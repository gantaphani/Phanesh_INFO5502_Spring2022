plaintiff and appellant california state teachers retirement system strs,a public entity,appeals a judgment following a grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant and respondent county of los angeles the county on a complaint for refund of property taxes.
strs is authorized to invest in real estate.because strs is a unit of state government,property it owns is exempt from property taxation.cal,art.xiii,a.however,the private lessees of real property owned by strs are subject to property tax based on the lessees possessory interest.the essential issue raised on appeal is the constitutionality of government code section,subdivision b,insofar as it prescribes the method for determining the assessed value of a private lessee leasehold interest in real property owned by a state public retirement system,when the lessee has leased only a portion of the property 
section,subdivision b provides where,as here,a lessee has leased less than all of the property,the lessee tax is based on the lessee allocable share of the full cash value of the property that would have been enrolled if the property had been subject to property tax upon acquisition by the state public retirement system,with the lessee allocable share based on the lessee percentage of the total leasable square feet of the property,italics added.in other words,under the statute the lessee tax is based on the full cash value of the property,even though the lessee holds only a possessory interest in the property.
we conclude there are two constitutional defects in the statute valuation methodology.section,subdivision b,is facially unconstitutional insofar as it bases a lessee assessment on the lessee allocable share of the full cash value of the property,based on the lessee percentage of the total leasable square feet of the property.under the statute,the exempt remainder or reversionary interest,belonging to the public retirement system owner,is included in the assessment of the lessee possessory interest.consequently,the statute violates the prohibition against assessing property taxes on publicly owned real property cal,art.xiii,a,as well as the prohibition on assessing property in excess of its fair market value.cal,art.xiii.
therefore,the judgment will be reversed and the matter remanded for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
the subject property and the assessment.
in,strs,a public retirement system,purchased the subject real property,an office building at westwood boulevard in los angeles hereafter,the building for million.the building has approximately in net rentable square feet.strs owns the building in fee simple.
because strs is a public entity,its interest in the building is exempt from property taxation.cal,art.xiii,a.however,a private lessee of publicly owned property is subject to property taxation on its possessory interest in the property,subd.b.therefore,strs lessees in the building were subject to property tax.
in january,dong eil kim and chang nim kim,doing business as mail boxes,collectively,kim entered into a lease with strs for a retail space consisting of square feet on the ground floor of the building.in a amendment to the lease,the parties extended the lease for an additional five years,to terminate february.
the original lease required kim to pay,i n addition to base rent,tenant proportionate share of operating costs for each calendar year to compensate for changes in landlord operating costs.the original lease obligated kim to pay all property taxes imposed in connection with the leasehold.
a amendment to kim lease provided.tenant shall continue to be responsible for its nnn charges under the lease,except that the real estate tax component shall be billed directly to tenant,rather than as a percentage of total taxes paid for the building.
for the tax year july,through june,the county assessed the value of kim leasehold interest at.based on the assessed value,the county levied a property tax against kim in the amount of.strs paid the county the amount of the tax owed by kim.
application for a reduced assessment and refund.
strs and kim then filed an application with the county assessment appeals board board to reduce the assessed value of kim leasehold interest and for a refund.the application identified strs as an affected party in the matter,and indicated the application was being presented as a test case to determine the appropriate valuation methodology for the various buildings strs owns in los angeles county.
the application by strs and kim challenged the constitutionality of section,and further argued that even assuming the statute were constitutional,its provisions had been misinterpreted and misapplied by the assessor.
the board denied the application.with respect to the constitutionality of the pertinent statute,the board ruled that,as a body,it lacked jurisdiction to declare the statute unconstitutional.the board further found the assessor did not misinterpret or misapply the provisions of section,subdivision b.
trial court proceedings.
on april,strs and kim collectively,plaintiffs filed a verified complaint for refund of property taxes.they alleged in pertinent part the valuation methodology that the county assessor used in making this assessment was unsound and did not properly apply the governing provisions of the california constitution,statutes,administrative regulations and assessment procedures in evaluating kim possessory interest under the lease the possessory interest.among other things,assessing property tax on the full fee interest in the property rather than just the leasehold interest in the property results in a differential taxation of real property that violates article xxx,section i of the california constitution because the value taxed is greater than the fair market value of the lessee possessory interest alone.
the complaint sought a judicial determination that section is void and unenforceable in that it violates the provisions of articles xiii and xiiia of the california constitution the method of valuation used by the county assessor and by the board was unsound and resulted in an improper and arbitrary value for kim possessory interest in the premises and the common areas of the building do not constitute possessory interests subject to taxation because the common areas do not satisfy the requirements of possession,independence and exclusivity under the applicable law.plaintiffs requested a refund of taxes paid and that the matter be remanded to the board so that the county may value the possessory interest in a manner consistent with the trial court determination.
summary judgment papers undisputed facts.
the county and strs presented the case to the trial court by way of for summary judgment.kim was not a participant in the summary judgment proceedings.the papers reflect the pertinent facts are largely undisputed,to wit 
the county determined the base year value of the building based upon strs fee simple interest in the entire property.the base year was and the base year value was strs purchase price of million.the county trended the base year value forward a maximum of two percent per year from to,pursuant to proposition cal,art.xiiia,b,and the cumulative upward adjustment from to was percent.thus,for the relevant tax year commencing july,the county assessed the value of the building at.of that sum,the county allocated to the office space and the remaining to the retail space in the building.the county established kim percentage of the total retail rentable square footage by taking kim square footage and dividing it by the total retail rentable square footage.the county determined kim premises represented percent of the total retail rentable square footage.applying that percentage to the value of the retail space in the building,the county assessed the value of kim leasehold interest at.based on the assessed value,the county levied property tax against kim in the amount of.
in its moving papers,the county asserted section is lawful and valid.
strs,in turn,argued the valuation methodology prescribed by section,subdivision b,violates the california constitution because it does not value taxable possessory interests in accordance with their fair market value it taxes property exempt from taxation its classification of taxpayers violates equal protection and its valuation methodology is not uniform in its application to all similarly situated taxpayers.strs further contended the county violated the california constitution in its application of section,subdivision b to kim.
trial court ruling.
on january,the motions for summary judgment came on for hearing and were taken under submission.thereafter,the trial court granted the county motion for summary judgment and took strs motion off calendar as moot.the trial court ruled on the undisputed facts and given the relevant case law,the statute on its face and the valuation methodology as applied here has not been shown to be unconstitutional,violative of equal protection or arbitrary.
appellate proceedings.
on june,strs filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment.
it appeared to this court the appeal by strs presented a case of first impression in california,involving the assessment of a taxable possessory interest,a leasehold,in tax exempt property owned by a public retirement system.due to the dearth of case authority and the statewide importance of the issue,this court sent a letter to counsel requesting supplemental briefing and inviting interested parties to participate as amicus curiae.
our letter identified two basic questions before this court does strs,which is exempt from property taxation and which paid the property tax assessed to its lessee,have standing to challenge the lessee tax assessment and,if this court can reach the merits of the controversy,does section,subdivision b fail to tax a lessee taxable possessory interest in accordance with the possessory interest fair market value so as to render the statute valuation methodology unconstitutional 
the california public employees retirement system calpers and the california state board of equalization boe subsequently filed amicus briefs in support of strs 
contentions 
strs contends section,subdivision b,violates the california constitution because it does not value taxable possessory interests in accordance with their fair market value it taxes property exempt from taxation its classification of taxpayers violates equal protection its valuation methodology is not uniform in its application to all similarly situated taxpayers.strs further contends the county violated the california constitution in its application of section,subdivision b to kim 
discussion 
strs,although its property is exempt from real property taxation,has standing to challenge the methodology used by the county to levy tax against strs lessee because strs actually paid the tax.
although kim was a party below,kim is not a party to this appeal.strs is the sole appellant.the county contends strs lacks standing to prosecute this appeal because strs acted as a volunteer in paying the disputed tax that was levied on an unsecured basis against kim.we reject the county contention and conclude strs has standing to prosecute this matter 
the statutory scheme clearly contemplates that one person may pay property taxes on the property of another.revenue and taxation code section states any person who receives a tax bill respecting property which has been assessed to another and who has power,pursuant to written or oral authorization,to pay the taxes on behalf of another shall after the taxes have been paid in full and within days of the receipt of the written request of the assessee,either deposit the original or a copy of the bill in the united states mail in an envelope addressed to the last known address of the assessee or deliver it otherwise to the assessee within said days.italics added.
further,revenue and taxation code section,pertaining to property taxation,specifies the persons authorized to bring a refund action.it states the person who paid the tax,his or her guardian or conservator,the executor of his or her will,or the administrator of his or her estate may bring an action only in the superior court against a county or a city to recover a tax which the board of supervisors of the county or the city council of the city has refused to refund on a claim filed pursuant to article commencing with section of this chapter.no other person may bring such an action but if another should do so,judgment shall not be rendered for the plaintiff.italics added.
the limitation contained in section simply means that only a person who has actually paid the tax may bring an action as opposed to the situation where someone else pays the property taxes of an owner of property.citation.s ection does not affect the determination of what property is taxable and what property is exempt.it merely defines the procedure for refunding taxes improperly collected.the procedure provides for refund to the person who,or entity which,paid the tax if the property was exempt.this orderly approach prevents double refund of the taxes to the party who paid the tax and the party who owns the property s ection is a mechanism for enforcing constitutional and statutory rights.failure to follow the correct procedural rules can result in forfeiture of the power to enforce the constitutional right.mayhew tech center,phase ii county of sacramento th,italics added state,as lessee,lacked standing to seek refund of taxes which it did not pay.
the reason for revenue and taxation code section restrictive standing requirement is evident.this limitation frees the taxing authority from the burden,often far greater than in the instant case,of untangling a web of agreements accounts in order to ascertain who is the proper recipient of any refund due.this determination is,of course,critical to avoiding a double payment.ibm personal pension plan city and county of san francisco th,pension plan lacked standing to sue for refund of property taxes and penalties paid by trustee of the plan on its behalf.
because strs,not kim,paid the tax,it is strs and only strs which has standing to prosecute the refund action and standing to maintain this appeal.
the county characterization of strs as a volunteer does not defeat strs standing.under our modern refund statutes,whether a tax payment was voluntary or involuntary is irrelevant.a taxpayer may seek a refund even without protesting the payment.this is a far cry from the common law right of action,which extended only to payments extracted under compulsion.franchise tax bd.superior court cal th,held,taxpayer has no right to jury trial in action for refund of state income taxes.
therefore,the county assertion that strs acted as a volunteer in paying kim property tax does not meet the issue.the inquiry,for purposes of determining standing to bring a refund action,is who paid the property tax,not the person motivation for paying the tax.because strs paid the tax,it has standing to litigate this matter.
we now turn to the merits of the appeal.
standard of review the extent of judicial deference to administrative agency interpretation.
we independently determine the proper interpretation of section.as the matter is a question of law,we are not bound by evidence on the question presented below or by the lower court interpretation.burden snowden cal th.
as for the degree of deference to be accorded to the interpretation of amicus boe,the supreme court addressed the issue of judicial deference to administrative agency statutory interpretation in yamaha,supra,cal th.while agency interpretation of the meaning and legal effect of a statute is entitled to consideration and respect by the courts id.at,agency interpretations are not binding or necessarily even authoritative id.at.courts must,in short,independently judge the text of a statute id.at.yamaha determined the weight accorded to an agency interpretation is fundamentally situational id.at,italics omitted and turns on a legally informed,commonsense assessment of its contextual merit id.at.yamaha set down a basic framework of factors as guidance and concluded that the degree of deference accorded should be dependent in large part upon whether the agency has a comparative interpretative advantage over the courts and on whether it has probably arrived at the correct interpretation.id.at.further,a court is less inclined to defer to an agency interpretation of a statute than to its interpretation of a regulation.ibid.
general principles re taxation of possessory interests.
in order to provide a framework for analyzing section,we begin with a brief overview of fundamental principles pertaining to the creation and taxation of possessory interests in real property.
it is hornbook law that a lessee has a present possessory interest in the premises,while the lessor has a future reversionary interest and retains fee title.citations.avalon pacific santa ana,hd supply repair remodel,llc th.in other words,when a possessory interest is created,the bundle of rights that constitute the fee simple interest is divided into a possessory interest or interests and a nonpossessory interest or interests i n the creation of a lease,the fee simple interest is divided into the leasehold interest,the possessory interest and the leased fee interest,the nonpossessory interest.assessors handbook section,assessment of taxable possessory interests,published by boe in december,hereafter,handbook available at.a possessory interest consists of a right to the possession of real property for a period less than perpetuity by one party,the holder of the possessory interest,while another party,the fee simple owner,retains the right to regain possession of the real property at a future date,at.
the term possessory interests is defined by statute as p ossession of,claim to,or right to the possession of land or improvements that is independent,durable,and exclusive of rights held by others in the property,except when coupled with ownership of the land or improvements in the same person,subd.a see also,a defining possessory interests in real property.
although publicly owned real property is exempt from taxation cal,art.xiii,possessory interests in such land or improvements are taxable under section of the revenue and taxation code and in pursuance of the constitutional mandate that all property shall be taxed,art.xiii.citation.privately held possessory interests in property owned by the federal government,the state,and municipalities are subject to taxation.citation.because a large proportion of california land was and is in public ownership,taxation of possessory interests is an important source of local government revenue.citations.connolly county of orange cal th.
with respect to the standard for taxing possessory interests,under section of article xiii of the california constitution considered in conjunction with the provisions of article xiiia proposition,all property is taxed according to its full value,meaning its fair market value,unless an alternative standard of value is constitutionally prescribed.handbook,supra,at.
the applicability of the market value standard to taxable possessory interests also was made clear by the california supreme court in de luz homes county of san diego cal d de luz.the standard of full cash value applies equally to a leasehold interest.accordingly,the assessor must estimate the price a leasehold would bring on an open market under conditions in which neither buyer nor seller could take advantage of the exigencies of the other.id.at,italics added.
the statutory definition of fair market value for assessment purposes is found in revenue and taxation code section.f air market value means the amount of cash or its equivalent that property would bring if exposed for sale in the open market under conditions in which neither buyer nor seller could take advantage of the exigencies of the other,and both the buyer and the seller have knowledge of all of the uses and purposes to which the property is adapted and for which it is capable of being used,and of the enforceable restrictions upon those uses and purposes.id.at subd.a.
the boe has promulgated a regulation,property tax rule,which addresses the valuation of taxable possessory interests.rule provides in relevant part that the fair market value of a taxable possessory interest is the fair market value of the fee simple absolute interest reduced only by the value of the property rights,if any,granted by the public owner to other persons and by the value of the property rights retained by the public owner excluding the public owner right to receive rent,b.
perhaps the cardinal feature of a taxable possessory interest is that it is an interest of finite duration.at some future date,the interest of the private possessor will terminate,and possession of the property will revert to the public owner.handbook,supra,at.therefore,w hen valuing a taxable possessory interest,the appraiser must determine a term of possession for the interest the term of possession also affects the value of a taxable possessory interest.all else being equal,the longer the term of possession,the higher the value of the possessory interest.ibid.
with this overview of the creation and valuation of private possessory interests in publicly owned property,we turn to section,which is the focus of this controversy.
history of section.
in,the legislature enacted education code former section to authorize strs to invest a portion of its assets in real estate,so as to broaden strs investment opportunities on behalf of its members and retirees.assem.bill reg.sess.ab stats,ch.
property which is owned by strs is exempt from real property taxation.cal,art.xiii,a.therefore,at the same time that it expanded strs investment authority,the legislature enacted section stats,ch,to require strs to reimburse local governments by way of an in lieu fee,so as to offset the local governments loss of property tax revenues resulting from such investments.state and consumer services agency,enrolled bill on ab.
as enacted,section stated in pertinent part a public retirement system,which has invested assets in real property and improvements thereon for business or residential purposes for the production of income,shall pay annually to the city or county,in whose jurisdiction the real property is located and has been removed from the secured roll,a fee for general governmental services equal to the difference between the amount that would have accrued as real property secured taxes and the amount of possessory interest unsecured taxes paid for that property.the governing bodies of local entities may adopt ordinances and regulations authorizing retirement systems to invest assets in real property subject to the forgoing requirements.stats,ch,italics added.
in other words,although the lessees of real property owned by strs or calpers paid property taxes based on the lessees possessory interest,the amount of the combined possessory interest in a parcel was less than the amount of the parcel full fair market value.therefore,the property tax collected from calpers and strs lessees was less than what would be collected by the county if the parcel were privately owned.to make up for this loss in property tax revenues,section allow ed local governments to charge calpers and strs an fee to pay for the county general services.governor office of planning research,enrolled bill on bill sb.
in,the attorney general opined section imposition of an in lieu fee for general government services upon calpers based on its ownership of real property was unconstitutional.the opinion reasoned the fee for general governmental purposes imposed by section was not a fee at all,but rather,an ad valorem tax on real property,since it is exacted for the general expenses of local governments.id.at.
the following year,mindful of the attorney general opinion,the legislature amended section to abolish the fee and instead require that all leases include a provision which would directly pass the full property tax onto the lessee.governor office of planning research,enrolled bill on sb.thus,the legislature decided to shift the entire property tax burden to the lessee,even though the lessee merely had held a possessory interest in the property.
as amended in,section provided in relevant part at subdivision b whenever a state public retirement system,which has invested assets in real property and improvements thereon for business or residential purposes for the production of income,leases the property,the lease shall provide,pursuant to section of the revenue and taxation code,that the lessee possessory interest may be subject to property taxation and that the party in whom the possessory interest is vested may be subject to the payment of property taxes levied on that interest.the lease shall also provide that the full cash value,as defined in sections and of the revenue and taxation code,of the possessory interest upon which property taxes will be based shall equal the greater of a the full cash value of the possessory interest,or b,if the lessee has leased less than all of the property,the lessee allocable share of the full cash value of the property that would have been enrolled if the property had been subject to property tax upon acquisition by the state public retirement system.the lessee allocable share shall be the lessee leasable square feet divided by the total leasable square feet of the property.stats,ch.
the constitutionality of the enactment was an issue from the inception.the legislative history of sb reveals that at the time the bill was under consideration,the boe took the position that the amendment to section was unconstitutional.the boe opined that requiring the full value of the full fee interest to be assessed against a private lessee would amount to taxation of constitutionally exempt property.accordingly,it appears that a constitutional amendment would be necessary to accomplish the purpose of this bill.boe,legislative bill analysis of sb,july.
similarly,the assembly republican caucus opined this bill may be unconstitutional because it may tax leaseholders at a higher rate than the fair market value of a leasehold estate and it would require leaseholders to make payments based on the ownership interest in the property even though the lessee holds only a possessory interest.governor office of planning research,enrolled bill on sb.
notwithstanding these concerns,the governor approved the bill and it took effect as an urgency measure on september.
in sum,the amendment to section was a departure from the standard of assessing possessory interests based on fair market value.section,subdivision b created a special rule for investment property owned by a state public retirement system.instead of taxing lessees of such property based on the fair market value of their possessory interests,the lessees were to be taxed based on their allocable share of the full cash value of the property that would have been enrolled if the property had been subject to property tax upon acquisition by the state public retirement system,with the lessee allocable share based upon the lessee percentage of the total leasable square feet of the property.ibid.
section,subdivision b,insofar as it requires a lessee to pay property tax on constitutionally exempt public owned real property,violates california constitution article xiii,section a.
the constitutionality of section,subdivision b,an issue which has been dormant since,is now squarely before this court.
the key constitutional provision for our purposes is article xiii,section a of the california constitution,providing that property owned by the state is exempt from property taxation.strs,as a unit of the state and consumer services agency,is a unit of state government performing a state function.therefore,property owned by strs is exempt from property tax.
the issue is the valuation of kim possessory interest,consisting of a portion of the retail space in the subject building owned by strs.in this regard,section states in pertinent part at subdivision b the lease shall also provide that the full cash value,as defined in sections and of the revenue and taxation code,of the possessory interest upon which property taxes will be based shall equal the greater of a the full cash value of the possessory interest,or b,if the lessee has leased less than all of the property,the lessee allocable share of the full cash value of the property that would have been enrolled if the property had been subject to property tax upon acquisition by the state public retirement system.italics added.
the county applied the valuation methodology of the statute.as set forth above in some detail factual procedural background,ante,b,the county valued kim possessory interest by taking kim percentage of the total leasable square footage of the building percent of the retail rentable square footage,and multiplying it by the proposition adjusted value of the building overall retail space,thereby assessing kim leasehold interest at.based on the assessed value,the county levied property tax against kim in the amount of 
the defect in this valuation methodology,which is prescribed by section,subdivision b,is that is taxes property which is constitutionally exempt from taxation.the county allocated the entire valuation of the building to the various lessees,such as kim,without any reduction for the value of the reversionary interest retained by strs,the lessor,which owns the building in fee simple.
further,the county made no adjustment for the fact that kim lease was winding down.as the boe recognizes,absent special circumstances,a taxable possessory interest normally declines in value with each passing year.here,however,the county assessed kim leasehold interest at,toward the end of the lease term,based on nothing more than strs acquisition price of the property in,trended forward to.thus,kim assessment was based on the fee simple value of the property,rather than on the value of the possessory interest.
the vice in section,subdivision b,is that it values tax exempt real property using the fee simple value of the property,and taxes the lessees based on the entire assessed value.california constitution article xiii,section a,exempts p roperty owned by the state,rather than the state itself.italics added.the reversionary interest in the subject real property is property and therefore is exempt from taxation.section,subdivision b does not become constitutional simply because it shifts the tax on the reversionary interest to the lessees of strs.we conclude that in order to satisfy article xiii,section a,which exempts strs real property from taxation,the value of the rights retained by the exempt owner of the real property must be excluded in order to determine the proper valuation of kim taxable possessory interest.
the boe handbook,dealing with possessory interests generally,is mindful of these issues it states with a taxable possessory interest,since the underlying fee simple interest held by the public owner is almost always tax exempt,it is necessary to separately value the possessory interest held by the private possessor.handbook,supra,at.the handbook explains the valuation approaches for taxable possessory interests are similar to the conventional approaches to value the comparative sales approach,the income approach,and the cost approach that are generally accepted and used in the valuation of the fee simple interest.however,the conventional approaches must be modified to accommodate the finite duration of a taxable possessory interest and the corresponding fact that a portion of the fee simple interest in those rights,the reversionary interest,is retained by the public owner and is nontaxable.handbook,supra,at,italics added.
the boe regulation pertaining to the valuation of a taxable possessory interest in publicly owned real property,property tax rule,also covers the point.the regulation states in pertinent part,the fair market value of a taxable possessory interest is the fair market value of the fee simple absolute interest reduced only by the value of the property rights,if any,granted by the public owner to other persons and by the value of the property rights retained by the public owner,b,italics added.the boe valuation method,applicable to possessory interests generally,prevents the lessee from being taxed on the value of the reversionary interest retained by the public lessor,and therefore comports with california constitution,article xiii,section a.
section b,by including the full value of the fee interest in the assessable va
