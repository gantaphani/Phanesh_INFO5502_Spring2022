the internal revenue service determined that leon malachinski was deficient in the payment of his federal income taxes for the year.malachinski contested the assessment in the united states tax court.he contended that his signature on a consent form to extend the statute of limitations on assessment had been forged and that if any deficiency were assessed,he was entitled to credit against it the he previously had remitted to the irs in.the tax court ruled in favor of the irs it found that malachinski signature on the consent form was genuine.it further concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to determine whether malachinski was entitled to a credit for the remittance.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the decision of the tax court.
backgrounda.facts 
malachinski and his now wynne superson were married in may.the couple filed a joint federal income tax return for the year on april.in late or early,the irs contacted the malachinskis regarding the tax return,and malachinski sought the advice of vincent arnone,his tax return preparer.the malachinskis granted power of attorney to arnone and to attorney eugene laporte in march.
superson filed for divorce in march but did not tell malachinski until a month later.on may,irs agent alan neubauer sent a letter addressed to the malachinskis that asked them to sign and return form a,special consent to extend the time to assess tax,with respect to their income taxes.the form permitted the irs to extend the time period in which it had to assess any deficiencies.on or about june,the irs received the form,which had been dated june,and bore what purported to be the signatures of both malachinski and superson.an irs official countersigned the form on june.
three days later,on june,malachinski and superson granted another power of attorney to john ostrand and stephen mack,certified public accountants.the power of attorney was originally prepared on may.superson,however,issued a separate power of attorney on september,naming as her representatives two attorneys,anthony scariano and justino petrarca,and a certified public accountant,michael moxley.
the malachinskis were divorced in march.also in march,malachinski filed a separate tax return for his taxable year.in april,acting on advice from one of his advisors,he sent to the irs a remittance to reduce any potential tax obligations for.the irs received the funds and prepared a voucher the voucher contained a handwritten entry that described the payment as a cash bond.further,a section of the voucher was checked,indicating that the amount was an advance payment on deficiency.the voucher did not have a separate section to indicate that the remittance was in the nature of a cash bond or deposit.
mack,malachinski representative,met with neubauer on june.the irs subsequently issued an examination report to malachinski and superson that indicated,in relevant part,that the two had a deficiency in income tax of for the year.malachinski then executed a third power of attorney,naming glenn acquino,a certified public accountant,as his representative.acquino duly filed a protest with the irs on the malachinskis behalf.
in april,the irs transferred the remittance from the joint account of malachinski and superson to malachinski individual tax account.in october,for reasons not indicated in the record,the irs refunded the plus in interest malachinski claims,however,that he never received the money.the irs does not have a copy of the refund check nor does it have any supporting documentation.it is the irs policy to destroy such records after six years.
malachinski executed a fourth power of attorney in december,authorizing attorney michael boylan to represent him before the irs.boylan wrote to the irs in august,informing the agency that malachinski had not been able to secure superson approval of a proposed settlement.
in late,superson began to complain bitterly about malachinski to a friend and,claudine mellerke mellerke became concerned that superson might carry out the various threats she had made against her life.these concerns came to the attention of local police,and superson ultimately was convicted of violating,use of interstate commerce facilities in the commission of murder for hire.malachinski was the intended victim of superson scheme.at the time of trial in this tax matter,superson was incarcerated in chicago and awaiting sentencing.
on may,the irs issued a notice of deficiency to malachinski and superson regarding their taxes,and malachinski timely filed a petition in the tax court.he later filed an amended petition that asserted that the statute of limitations on assessment had expired before the notice of deficiency was mailed.he maintained that his signature on the form that purported to extend the limitations period had been forged,presumably by superson.malachinski counsel deposed superson in this case,but she refused to answer any questions,citing her privilege against.
tax court proceedings 
at trial,malachinski testified that he had not signed the consent form nor had he seen the form until.he believed that superson either had signed it or had someone else sign his name to it,but he never had authorized her to do so nor had he given her a power of attorney to act for him.to bolster these arguments,malachinski offered the testimony of superson former friend and,mellerke,who testified that superson had told her that she had done something to get even with malachinski she had contacted the irs and had reported malachinski for several things that he had not done,and also she provided a document to the irs shortly before they were divorced that he was not aware of.at.according to mellerke,superson claimed that the document was so damaging that malachinski would be feeling the effects of it for the rest of his life.id.at.although the commissioner objected to mellerke testimony as hearsay,the court reserved ruling on its admissibility.
malachinski also introduced the expert report of diana marsh,a forensic document examiner.after examining twenty exemplars of malachinski signature,marsh made the following conclusion in a written report 
after an examination of all the documents submitted,it is my opinion that malachinski did not write the name malachinski on the document at issue,the irs consent form dated june.in addition,it is my opinion that the same individual wrote both dates of.
malachinski attempted at trial to elicit from marsh the factual basis for her conclusion that he had not signed the form,but the irs objected that the questions solicited information beyond the scope of the report.the court sustained the irs objection and restricted marsh testimony to the material contained in the written documentation.the court explained that tax court rule f provides that the facts,data,and analysis that form the basis for an expert conclusion are admissible only to the extent that they are set forth in a written report.
the court nonetheless permitted malachinski to proffer additional testimony from marsh regarding the basis and reasons for her conclusion.in the proffer,marsh related her concerns about the letter formations in the questioned signature.specifically,she noted characteristics of the loop on the l of malachinski first name,the angle of the bottom of the s in his middle name,and the absence of a loop at the end of his signature.
in response,the irs offered the report and testimony of james davidson,also a forensic document examiner and chief of the questioned document section of the irs criminal investigation division national forensic laboratory in chicago.davidson compared the signature on the consent form to known exemplars of malachinski signature.he noted that the exemplars fell into categories exemplars were quickly written abbreviated last names were formally written with distinct letter definition and three were shortened,quickly written signatures.at.davidson found that the exemplars from the first two categories were of minimal value in making the comparison and that the signature on the consent form was most similar to the third category.id.at.he was,however,unable to determine whether the signature on the form was genuine in his opinion,the three signatures in the third category were not enough of a representative sample of the writer for him to make any determinations.id.
regarding the remittance,malachinski testified that he had never requested the payment to be transferred to his account for or refunded.he also denied having received a refund of that payment in.on,he indicated that he had never checked his bank records to determine whether he had deposited a similar amount at the time because he had not understood that it was the irs contention that the payment had been refunded.malachinski witness,mellerke,testified that superson had told her that she had received a refund from the irs that was intended for her but that she had cashed it and kept the money.the commissioner objected to this testimony as hearsay,but the court again reserved ruling on its admissibility.
in a memorandum opinion filed after trial,the tax court determined that the notice of deficiency was not barred by the statute of limitations.because the notice had been mailed more than years after the return was the statute of limitations on assessment is typically three years from the filing of the court concluded that malachinski had made a prima facie showing that the notice was untimely.the burden,therefore,fell on the irs to establish that the bar was inapplicable.in the court view,the irs had met that burden by producing a facially valid form a indicating a waiver of the limitations period.malachinski then was required to show that the agreement was invalid,a difficult task because,as the court noted,an individual signature on a document is prima facie evidence that the individual actually signed it.
although malachinski had attempted to overcome this statutory presumption by presenting marsh testimony that his signature was forged,the court found that marsh report did not adequately set forth the facts and reasons supporting marsh conclusions.the court also noted that no showing had been made that the failure to include these materials in the report was due to good cause it concluded,therefore,that allowing marsh to provide additional direct testimony would have unduly prejudiced the irs ability to her.it accordingly sustained the irs objection and restricted marsh direct testimony to the material set forth in her written report.
the tax court also explained that davidson,the commissioner expert,had determined that the exemplars were not sufficiently representative to permit him to render an opinion regarding the authenticity of the signature.after considering both expert opinions and scrutinizing the documents itself,the court found that the signature was not a forgery.the court thus concluded that malachinski had not overcome the statutory presumption that he signed the consent form.
in making its finding on the genuineness of the signature,the court also based its conclusion on various pieces of circumstantial evidence.for example,the court noted that malachinski had first argued that his signature had been forged in,twelve years after the form was signed.the court did not believe that,during the twelve years that followed the alleged waiver of the statute of limitations,none of malachinski four sets of professional advisors had consulted with him about the validity of the waiver.rather,the court believed that malachinski advisors had done so and had learned from him that he had signed the consent form otherwise,they would have sought to terminate the proceedings immediately.in the court view,the conduct of malachinski and his advisors is thus plainly inconsistent with the claim that the consent was forged.at.
moreover,typewritten portions of a power of attorney to advisors ostrand and mack indicated that malachinski and superson had contacted the accountants by may.the consent was executed on june,and,ten days later,malachinski and superson signed the power of attorney.the court deemed it unlikely that superson would forge her husband signature on a consent form days before cooperating with him in hiring advisors to represent them her duplicity would have been too easily uncovered.id.
the court also noted that malachinski,at the urging of his advisors,made a payment with respect to liability in april.he made the payment after the period of limitations for would have expired unless a valid waiver were in effect competent professionals,opined the court,would not advise a client to make a payment with respect to a tax liability which could not be collected.id.the court further observed that malachinski advisors had conducted additional discussions with the commissioner agents in the latter part of,and,even after the commissioner sent malachinski and superson a letter proposing a liability of more than,the advisors made no suggestion that the collection of the taxes was.finally,the court noted that almost seven years passed between the time malachinski granted a power of attorney to boylan,his attorney of record in the tax court,and the time the question of the validity of the signature was first raised.
although malachinski argued that superson possessed enough animosity toward him to motivate the forgery of the consent hatred evidenced in large part by her involvement in a hire scheme against court concluded that such animosity was too attenuated and too remote in time to support a finding that she forged malachinski name to the consent document.id.at.evidence of superson criminal involvement arose in,six years after the form was executed and after a bitter custody battle had taken place.the court noted,too,that it would have reached the same conclusion even if it had considered mellerke proffered testimony in this regard.the court did not reach the irs hearsay objection because mellerke testimony was too vague and inconclusive to be of evidentiary value in determining whether malachinski signature on the consent was forged.id.at.
the tax court also held that it lacked jurisdiction to determine whether malachinski was entitled to a credit for the payment.it explained that its jurisdiction is limited to the determination of deficiencies and certain overpayments,and malachinski remittance did not fall into either category.the payment was better characterized as a deposit in the nature of a cash bond,the court concluded,a payment over which the tax court does not have jurisdiction 
malachinski argues on appeal that the tax court erred in determining that he consented to extend the statute of limitations for assessment and that the court did not have jurisdiction to determine whether he was entitled to a credit for the remittance.
genuineness of signature 
section a of the internal revenue code the code provides that the irs has three years from the date a return is filed to assess deficiencies.this period can be extended,however,if both the secretary and the taxpayer have consented in writing to its assessment after such time.c.
in asserting a statute of limitations defense,a taxpayer makes a prima facie case by showing that the notice of deficiency was not mailed within the time period.see adler commissioner,wl.if the irs produces a consent to extend the limitations period that is valid on its face the burden then shifts back to the taxpayer to show that the consent is invalid.see id.at.the ultimate burden of proof on the limitations defense always rests on the taxpayer.see id.at see also feldman commissioner,cir.
in this case,malachinski filed his tax return for the year on april.on june,prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations,a representative of the commissioner executed a consent form,purportedly signed by malachinski and superson,that agreed to extend indefinitely the statute of limitations on assessment for.the irs,relying on that consent,issued the notice of deficiency at issue here in may.
malachinski argues that the agreement to extend the statute of limitations is invalid because he never signed the consent form.he speculates,instead,that his forged his signature.to overcome the presumption that a signature on a document is authentic,see,malachinski presented at trial the expert report and testimony of diane marsh,a forensic document examiner.he now maintains on appeal that the tax court abused its discretion in curtailing marsh testimony.
tax court rule f requires that an expert written opinion be submitted at least days in advance of trial.the report must not only set forth the witness opinions but also include the facts or data on which that opinion is based and reasons for the conclusion.testimony is excluded altogether for 
failure to comply with the provisions of this paragraph,unless the failure is shown to be due to good cause and unless the failure does not unduly prejudice the opposing party,such as by significantly impairing the opposing party ability to the expert witness or by denying the opposing party the reasonable opportunity to obtain evidence in rebuttal to the expert witness testimony.
tax court rule f.
we agree with the tax court that marsh written report does not satisfy rule f.the report is terse and conclusory,indicating only marsh opinion that malachinski had not signed his name to the consent form and that the same individual had written the date on both signature lines.marsh does not explain her conclusions nor does she denote the facts supporting it.moreover,malachinski has not shown that the failure to include this information was due to good cause.in our view,the tax court was on solid ground in concluding that permitting the additional testimony would have unduly prejudiced the irs ability to marsh.see diego investors iv commissioner,cch,noting that o ne purpose of exchanging expert reports is to facilitate effective by the other party see also estate of friedberg commissioner,cch,w hen one party seeks to introduce expert testimony,which may be exceedingly complex and difficult for the layperson to readily understand,the other party must be given sufficient time to overcome those obstacles.the use of expert testimony is within the discretion of the trial judge,see diego investors,cch at,and we see no evidence that the tax court abused its discretion in curtailing malachinski direct examination of marsh.
in rebuttal to marsh report,the commissioner presented the report and testimony of james davidson,also a certified document examiner.davidson examined various exemplars of malachinski signature and concluded that the samples were not representative enough for him to find that the signature was a forgery.taking into account the conclusions of the two experts,the tax court examined the exemplars itself to reach its own conclusion that the signature was genuine.malachinski now argues that the court committed clear error in making this determination.
as an initial matter,we note that malachinski faces a difficult burden in contesting the tax court factual findings.under the clearly erroneous standard of review,a finding of fact is reversed only when the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.coleman commissioner,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we must view the evidence in the entire record in the light which is most favorable to the finding.pittman commissioner,cir quoting tripp commissioner,cir.
although malachinski objects to the court substitution of its own judgment for that of his expert,the tax court is permitted to do just that.the court has broad discretion to evaluate the overall cogency of each expert analysis.estate of davis commissioner,wl citation and quotation marks omitted.it can reject,in whole or in part,reports and testimony of expert witnesses in favor of its own independent evaluation of the evidence in the record.see helvering national grocery.see also shepherd commissioner,wl we may be selective in our use of any part of an expert opinion.thus,the tax court apparently undertook an independent assessment of the signature.see,bybee commissioner,cch,after studying handwriting exemplars,tax court concluded that the handwriting reflected by petitioners signatures on their,and joint federal income tax returns appears to be identical to the handwriting reflected by petitioners signatures on the form,and no credible evidence indicates to the contrary.
malachinski also maintains that the inferences the court drew from the circumstantial evidence were not reasonable.for example,the tax court in part based its determination on the failure of malachinski and his tax professionals to raise the issue of consent until years after the form was signed malachinski argues that he received a letter from the irs in advising him that the tax dispute had been resolved he had no reason,therefore,to pursue the issue of consent.he also asserts that he relied on his lawyers to defend the tax return and did not even know that the forged waiver existed.
again,however,we are not persuaded that the court clearly erred in making its factual findings.as we have noted previously,the existence of evidence to support an inference contrary to that drawn by the trier of fact does not mean that the findings were clearly erroneous.see harper city of chicago heights,cir,cert.denied,d see also malkin united states,cir rejecting petitioner contention that the evidence was insufficient to support the district court finding that he signed an agreement to extend the statute of limitations on assessment.a fact finder choice between two permissible inferences from the evidence can not be clearly erroneous.see anderson bessemer city,d.
malachinski also takes issue with the tax court determination that his did not forge his signature.we conclude,however,that the court was well within its province when it found that superson hostility toward manifested in her attempt to hire someone to kill too far removed in time six years after the execution of the consent form to support the forgery theory.although malachinski marshals evidence to the contrary superson secretly had filed for divorce the two had been embroiled in a heated custody battle mellerke testified that superson had made several suspicious statements superson was convicted of attempting to hire someone to kill malachinski and,in a deposition related to this case,superson refused to answer,on grounds,questions relating to whether she forged malachinski signature,we review the record in the light most favorable to the tax court findings and,as indicated previously,defer to those findings when there are two permissible views of the evidence.see united states hardamon,cir.
remittance 
malachinski sent the irs a remittance of in april in anticipation of income tax liability for.notably,at the time malachinski made this payment,the irs had not defined any tax liability for.although the taxes were under audit,no examination report proposing a deficiency had been prepared.indeed,the deficiency was not determined until ten years later.in,the irs transferred the payment to malachinski individual income tax account.the money,plus in interest,was refunded by the irs six months later.
malachinski argues that he did not request either the credit of the funds to his taxable year or the refund of that amount.he denies,moreover,that he ever received the refund he speculates that superson intercepted the check and forged his endorsement.thus,even if he does not prevail on the statute of limitations defense,malachinski asserts that he is entitled to a credit of against the deficiency he now owes on his tax return.
the tax court determined that it was without jurisdiction to determine whether malachinski was entitled to a credit against the deficiency.the court reasoned that,when the payment was initially made,it was not a payment toward a liability and therefore ought to be considered a deposit rather than a payment to satisfy a particular tax liability.later,the irs applied the funds to malachinski tax liability and,in the course of determining the extent of that liability,returned these funds as an overpayment.because the tax court did not have jurisdiction over malachinski tax liability in this action,the court could not review the correctness of the irs disposition of the funds with respect to that year.therefore,at the time it was asked to apply the funds to the tax liability,there were no funds within the court jurisdiction to apply to that liability.
in reviewing the determination of the tax court,we turn first to its initial determination that,at the time of their receipt by the irs,the funds were a deposit rather than a payment on the taxes.in moran united states,cir,this circuit joined a significant number of other circuits in concluding that a court must look to the facts and circumstances of an individual case to determine whether a remittance is a deposit or a payment.see id.at.we held that for the purposes of deciding whether a remittance was a payment of tax,formal assessment is only one factor to be considered.id.at quoting ewing united states,cir,cert.denied,d.other factors to be considered include the taxpayer intent upon making the remittance,how the irs treats the remittance upon receipt,and when the tax liability is defined.see moran,at.
in moran,we also took the view,without extended discussion,that we ought to assess these factors under a de novo standard of review.further reflection has convinced us that a deferential standard is more appropriate.recent years have seen a growth in our national jurisprudence on the appropriate standard of review for the application of legal principles to questions.the supreme court has made it clear that plenary review is appropriate when a relevant legal principle can be given meaning and clarified only through the application of that rule to the circumstances of a particular case and when there are particularly important reasons for the courts to craft a defined set of rules that ensure that future determinations involving important rights are made accurately.see ornelas united states,d see also cooper,leatherman tool group,d.however,absent such special considerations,a proper allocation of the roles of trial and appellate courts counsels that fact specific questions not easily susceptible of useful generalization be reviewed deferentially by appellate courts.see cooter gell hartmarx,d pierce underwood,d.the application of the facts and circumstances test that we embraced in moran indicated strongly that we ought to review the determination of the tax court on this question deferentially.on this applicable standard of language to the contrary in moran is overruled 
applying a deferential standard of review to the determination of the tax court in this case,we see no reason to disturb that court conclusion.the record adequately supports the conclusion that the tax court correctly determined the payment in this case,at the time it was made,was a deposit.as we already have noted,malachinski payment was made in april,well before any liability was defined.at that time,his tax return was being audited,but no report proposing a deficiency was prepared until months later,and the deficiency was not determined until years later.the amount of the remittance bore,in the words of the tax court,no perceptible relationship to the amount of the deficiency proposed in the examination report more than.at.malachinski,additionally,did not indicate that the remittance constituted a payment rather,he recalled making it to halt the accrual of interest 
further,the irs apparently treated the remittance as a cash bond.when it refunded the remittance,it included in reflection of the accrual of interest for the six months the money was in the account and not for the total four years the irs had the money.the payment of interest only for the time that the money was posted to the account indicates that the irs treated the payment as a cash bond for the year 
although the tax court has jurisdiction to determine whether a deposit payment is applicable to a particular deficiency,see hays commissioner,cch,here,the court was never asked to determine whether the deposit in question could be attributed to the tax year at any time prior to the irs application of those funds to the tax account in.whether those funds were properly allocated to the tax account was a matter not properly before the tax court in this proceeding because the court did not have jurisdiction over the tax account.see b.at first glance,section b seemingly might provide a jurisdictional hook to permit the tax court to reach this question.that section states 
i f the tax court finds that there is no deficiency and further finds that the taxpayer has made an overpayment of income tax for the same taxable year in respect of which the secretary determined the deficiency,or finds that there is a deficiency but that the taxpayer has made an overpayment of such tax,the tax court shall have jurisdiction to determine the amount of such overpayment,and such amount shall,when the decision of the tax court has become final,be credited or refunded to the taxpayer.
we can not read this provision as permitting the tax court to determine whether the deposit ought to be attributed to malachinski tax deficiency.first,b refers to overpayments,and,as we just held,with respect to the tax year,the remittance at issue here is a deposit and not a payment.although the term is nowhere statutorily defined,see estate of baumgardner commissioner,wl,the supreme court has defined overpayment as any payment in excess of that which is properly due.jones liberty glass.defining overpayment as used in the statutory predecessor to b,of the code.for there to be an overpayment,the taxpayer first must have made a payment.see bachner commissioner,wl,aff.without published opinion,cir.because malachinski has not made a payment for the tax year,it follows that he could not have made an overpayment that would have brought him within the purview of b.
even if malachinski remittance could be considered a payment rather than a deposit when it was transferred and credited to his account,b nevertheless prevents the tax court from exercising jurisdiction over the remittance.this recently added subsection of reads as follows 
denial of jurisdiction regarding certain credits and tax court shall have no jurisdiction under this subsection to restrain or review any credit or reduction made by the secretary under section 
the senate report explains that the addition clarifies that the tax court does not have jurisdiction over the validity or merits of the credits or offsets that reduce or eliminate the refund to which the taxpayer was otherwise entitled,sess.although the tax court has jurisdiction to determine the amount of an overpayment,see b,it does not have jurisdiction to direct the disposition of an overpayment when that payment has been credited against another year assessment pursuant to a prior to the commencement of a tax court proceeding.see b savage commissioner,wl.
conclusion 
the tax court did not clearly err when it determined that malachinski signature on the consent form was genuine.we also agree that the tax court lacked jurisdiction to determine whether malachinski was entitled to a credit for the remittance.accordingly,we affirm the decision of the tax court.
i agree with the majority analysis and disposition of the taxpayer first ground of appeal and with its conclusion anent the second ground that the remittance to the irs was a deposit and not a payment of taxes.i also agree that the tax court determination that it was a deposit should not be reviewed de novo,that is,without deference to the tax court view of the matter,though i think we could say a bit more on that subject.but i disagree with the majority holding that the tax court lacked jurisdiction to apply the taxpayer deposit toward his tax let me begin with this issue.
the majority points out that the tax court jurisdiction is limited to the resolution of disputes over deficiencies,a,is,that its power to resolve such disputes includes the power to determine whether a taxpayer is entitled to a refund of payments made in excess of a deficiency,b,that is,to a refund of an overpayment.so far,so good.but when a taxpayer makes a deposit against a possible liability,so that there is only a potential deficiency,the majority holds that the tax court has no jurisdiction to apply the deposit against the deficiency even if the court later determines,as it did in this case,that,yes,there is a deficiency against which the deposit could be credited to reduce the taxpayer net deficiency
