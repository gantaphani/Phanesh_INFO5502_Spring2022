the estate of fred godley estate appeals the decision of the tax court valuing godley fifty percent interest in five general partnerships and determining an estate tax deficiency of.the estate contends that the tax court should have applied a minority discount by discounting godley interest in the partnerships because he lacked control over them.
whether a minority discount is appropriate in a given situation is part of the larger factual question of valuation.inasmuch as the tax court valuation of godley interest was not clearly erroneous,we affirm.
at the time of his death,decedent fred godley godley owned a fifty percent interest in five general partnerships.the remaining fifty percent was owned by godley son frank godley godley.four of the partnerships,monroe housing for the elderly,clinton housing for the elderly,rocky mount housing for the elderly,and charlotte housing for the elderly collectively housing partnerships,were formed in and owned and operated housing projects for elderly tenants.the fifth general partnership,godley management association gma,was formed in for the purpose of managing the operations of the housing partnerships.gma held no real estate or other fixed assets and served only as a management company.
the housing partnerships held multifamily rental housing projects operated under housing assistance payments contracts hap contracts with the united states department of housing and urban development.see united states housing act of,department of housing and urban development act.pursuant to the hap contracts,housing assistance payments are made to the housing partnerships to cover the difference between the rental rates agreed to under the hap contracts and the portion of the rent paid by eligible families.in addition,in the event of a vacancy,the hap contracts entitled the owner to payments in the amount of eighty percent of the contract rent for up to sixty days.if the vacancy period exceeded sixty days,the owner could request additional payments.the term of the hap contracts for monroe,charlotte,and rocky mount was thirty years and the term for clinton was twenty years.
godley,was the managing partner for the housing partnerships.this gave him control over the overall management of the partnerships godley,likewise took care of the management of the housing partnerships.he would pay bills,set aside reserves for replacement of assets or to cover contingencies,and acquire those properties that the partnership had decided upon.however,godley,could not make any major decision without the affirmative vote of percent of the partnership shares.major decisions included buying or selling land or partnership property,securing financing,spending in excess of,entering into major contracts,or taking any other action which materially affects the partnership or the assets or operation thereof.
despite the fact that godley,was the managing partner,godley was actively involved in the housing partnerships.he regularly visited the housing projects to inspect the property and attend to the tenants concerns.and he made his own decisions when issues with the tenants arose.godley had a long history as a business man in construction and when he was engaged in a business enterprise,he was almost always the person in charge.
at the time of godley death,each partnership agreement contained a provision granting godley,the option to purchase godley interest in that partnership for.godley,exercised these options and purchased godley interest in all the partnerships for a total of.on godley federal estate tax return,his interests in the five partnerships were reported at a fair market value of each,the option price.
on august,the internal revenue service mailed a statutory notice of deficiency in federal estate tax of to the estate.the irs disregarded the option price and instead determined the value of godley fifty percent interest by looking at the value of the partnerships assets and the income generated by them.the irs applied a discount to the value it determined based on the inability to easily sell a fifty percent interest in a company lack of marketability discount,but it did not apply a discount because godley lacked control over the partnerships minority discount.
the estate petitioned the tax court for a redetermination of the deficiency based upon the value set forth in the options.in the alternative,the estate requested a valuation based upon the fair market value of godley fifty percent interests with discounts.specifically,the estate argued that the irs should have applied a minority discount when determining the fair market value of godley interests.during the trial,the estate presented expert testimony on the valuation of the partnership interests.the irs did not present expert testimony as to the value of the housing partnerships,but did introduce the report of mitchell kaye,a valuation expert who had testified in an earlier state proceeding involving godley,as to the value of gma 
the tax court determined,after three days of trial,that the options served a testamentary purpose,and therefore,disregarded them in valuing godley interests.the court then determined the value of the housing partnerships by modifying the valuation methodology of one of the experts and applying a twenty percent lack of marketability discount.the tax court accepted kaye report on the valuation of one hundred percent of gma.no minority discount for lack of control was applied to any of the five partnerships.the court finally determined that there was an estate tax deficiency of.the estate appeals.
the estate contends that whether godley fifty percent interest represented a lack of control over the five partnerships,thereby entitling godley to a minority discount,is a question of law.we disagree.the question of whether a taxpayer is entitled to a discount is intertwined in the larger question of valuation and valuation determinations are clearly questions of fact.
we review de novo the tax court conclusions on questions of law.waterman comm r,cir.however,the tax court findings of fact may be set aside only if they are clearly erroneous.burbage comm r,cir.determinations of fair market value constitute findings of fact and,therefore,are subject to review only for clear error.id.
the fair market value of a business interest can often be determined simply by examining its market price.however,a company frequently has no ready market for its shares.therefore,t he fair market value is the price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller,neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts.united states cartwright,d quoting reg.b.when determining the fair market value under this test,a fact finder must look to the existing facts,circumstances,and factors at the valuation date that influence a hypothetical willing buyer and willing seller in determining a selling price.estate of newhouse comm r,wl.the weight to be given to these various factors depends upon the facts of each case.estate of andrews comm r,wl.and the amount a willing buyer will pay is often not based solely on asset values or net worth.often,a discount or premium must be applied to reflect the value an investor places on things such as managerial control,ability to the shares,and other risks.
during valuation a fact finder must decide whether the value should be increased or discounted for any reason.a minority discount may be appropriate if the block of stock does not enjoy the rights associated with control of the enterprise.estate of chenoweth comm r,wl.the application of such a discount is only appropriate if,as a factual matter,the minority status of the interest would affect the value that a willing buyer would pay.thus,the question of whether a discount for a lack of control is warranted depends,like the question of valuation generally,on the facts and circumstances of the case.
