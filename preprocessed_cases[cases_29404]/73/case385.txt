richie conner conner,the subject of an ongoing criminal tax investigation,appeals the district court order dismissing his petitions to quash certain summonses issued by the internal revenue service irs to two record keepers and granting the government cross motion for enforcement of such summonses.we affirm.
since the early,conner has owned and operated shags lumber company,a sole proprietorship in the business of purchasing and harvesting timber,pressing timber into wood products,and selling those products.in june,irs agent michael durland began a civil audit of conner and federal income tax returns.following completion of those audits,the irs assigned irs agent thomas walker agent walker to audit conner and federal income tax returns.subsequently,in february,agent walker began to audit conner and federal income tax returns.
accountant rudolph nagy accountant nagy had prepared conner through federal income tax returns and represented conner before the irs during its civil audits of those returns.a different accountant,lloyd hartman accountant hartman,had prepared conner federal income tax return.as of march,conner had not yet filed a federal income tax return for.
when agent walker received conner civil audit file,it contained few documents pertaining to tax years and,because those documents had been transmitted to the irs appeals office.the file did,however,contain conner federal income tax returns and profit and loss statements for and,which documents agent walker assumed came from accountant nagy,but did not know for certain.agent walker then requested additional records from accountant nagy,which he did not provide.
conner retained an attorney to represent him in the civil audit of his federal income tax return for.agent walker reviewed records pertaining to conner tax year at the attorney office,copied those he needed,and authorized the return of the original records to conner.
agent walker ultimately referred conner case to the irs criminal investigation division for a tax fraud investigation with respect to tax years through.special agent ross pierson special agent pierson was assigned the case 
before special agent pierson issued the summonses at issue in the present appeal,special agent pierson reviewed the irs civil audit file on conner and discussed the case with agent walker.notably,the file contained documents indicating that conner had directed accountant nagy to submit a set of federal income tax returns for the years through as part of a bank loan application,which returns reflected substantially more income than was reported on the returns conner had filed with the irs for the same years.these discrepancies,inter alia,prompted special agent pierson to issue summonses to accountants hartman and nagy in order that he special agent pierson could compare records pertaining to conner held by the accountants with those in the irs civil audit file on conner.
special agent pierson accompanied by another irs special agent and agent walker personally served a summons on accountant hartman on december,and a summons on accountant nagy on december.the summonses were virtually identical.the first page directed the named accountant to appear at the irs office in staunton,virginia,before special agent pierson on january,to produce the documents described on the second page relating to conner financial transactions for through.the third and fourth pages quoted extensively from internal revenue code sections containing the rights of third parties who receive summonses for taxpayer records.rather than producing the summoned documents at the irs office in staunton,virginia on january,accountants hartman and nagy turned over the summoned documents to special agent pierson on the day of service.
conner third petition to quash pertains to a second summons served on accountant hartman.believing that he had been tardy in giving conner notice of the first summons served on accountant hartman,special agent pierson served a second summons on accountant hartman in early january.accountant hartman did not produce any documents in response to this second summons because he had already complied with the first summons 
pursuant to irc h,conner filed petitions in the united states district court for the western district of virginia to quash each of the three summonses.the district court consolidated the petitions and held an evidentiary hearing on december,in order to resolve factual disputes bearing on the questions of whether the irs issued the summonses in good faith and whether the irs currently possessed the records sought special agent pierson,agent walker,accountant hartman,and shag lumber company office manager,eunice montgomery,testified at the evidentiary hearing.the district court also considered affidavits by special agent pierson,accountant hartman,and accountant nagy.accountant nagy died before the evidentiary hearing.
following the evidentiary hearing,the district court made the following findings of fact in a memorandum opinion issued on december,
pierson did not demand production of the documents on the day of service 
each summons conspicuously noted its return date 
hartman produced the documents on the day of service in order to avoid having to appear at the irs office on the summons return date 
pierson did not verbally inform hartman and nagy of conner right to petition to quash however,he gave them each a written explanation of conner rights,and each had an opportunity to read it before producing the records 
pierson questioned hartman and nagy about their relationship with conner however,he did not by that questioning,in effect,prematurely examine the records 
upon learning of conner petitions to quash,pierson sealed the records in envelopes,and they have remained sealed to this date 
as of this date,neither pierson nor any other irs agent has examined the sealed records 
conner has failed to demonstrate that the irs already possessed the records at the time pierson served the summonses.
based on these findings,the district court denied conner petitions to quash and granted the government motion to enforce the summonses.this timely appeal followed.pursuant to motion by conner,the district court stayed the effect of its final order pending appeal.

once the irs has made such a showing it is entitled to an enforcement order unless the taxpayer can show that the irs is attempting to abuse the court process.such an abuse would take place if the summons had been issued for an improper purpose,such as to harass the taxpayer or to put pressure on him to settle a collateral dispute,or for any other purpose reflecting on the good faith of the particular investigation.the taxpayer carries the burden of proving an abuse of the court process.
