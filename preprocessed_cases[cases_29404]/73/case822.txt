administrative claim 
in july,iowa submitted an amended corporate income tax return to the irs claiming a tax refund for the tax year.iowa claimed a refund on its main buildings at its truckstop facilities,arguing that the buildings could be depreciated on a schedule.iowa based its claim on the buildings qualification as retail motor fuels outlets under internal revenue code e e iii.section e e iii defines what constitutes a retail motor fuels outlet.the taxpayer may establish that its facility is a retail motor fuels outlet either using the test or the test.id.
in its administrative claim,iowa attempted to establish that its facilities qualified as retail motor fuels outlets under the test.it argued that its main buildings are not convenience stores and do not compete with typical convenience or grocery stores.it further asserted that the main buildings are the focal point of its fuel marketing business.finally,iowa argued that these main buildings derive more than of their gross revenues from products.accordingly,iowa argued that it was inappropriate to separate the main buildings revenues from the revenues generated at other buildings in the truckstop complex.it contended that congress did not intend for gross revenues to be calculated on a basis.
in the memorandum to the irs,however,iowa offered no argument concerning the floor space of the properties at issue.it neither argued that it was eligible under the test nor did it contend that more than of the floor space in these facilities was devoted to sales.
the irs denied iowa claim for the additional depreciation.in its decision,irs agent steve kueter observed that the not applied on a be satisfied by iowa.kueter also noted that iowa could not meet the test based on the amount of the buildings that it devoted to activities that were unrelated to petroleum marketing such as restaurants,fast food outlets and other activities mentioned above.kueter further noted that he believed that iowa would not attempt to show that the test could be met.iowa appealed kueter ruling.the irs appeals officer then sustained kueter denial of the additional depreciation.
district court appeal 
iowa then appealed the irs decision to the district court.in its complaint,iowa argued that the main buildings in walcott and joplin were retail motor fuels outlets under the test.iowa claimed that the assets in not treated as separate more than of their gross revenues from petroleum and products and thus met the test.additionally,iowa argued that the main buildings in walcott and joplin qualified as retail motor fuels outlets based on the requires a building to devote more than of its floor space to the marketing of petroleum or products 
the irs then moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted.in its order,the court rejected iowa asset aggregation argument,finding that a retail motor fuels outlet could not encompass several buildings.the court also concluded that the doctrine of variance prevented iowa from arguing that its buildings qualified as retail motor fuels outlets under the alternate test.

test qualification 
on appeal,iowa first argues that its walcott and joplin main buildings qualify as retail motor fuels outlets under the test.this argument is founded on iowa contention that purposes of the properly calculated by considering the gross revenues attributable to the entire installation,not by dividing the revenues on a basis.
asset aggregation 
iowa argument relies on an asset aggregation theory.it argues that a retail motor fuels a commodity market,and that there is no restriction that a market be housed in a singular structure.iowa contends that a retail motor fuels outlet could consist of multiple in conjunction with one another.thus,iowa argues that e e iii does not require that a retail motor fuels outlet gross revenue be a fraction of the outlet total on the sales generated at each individual structure located on the premises.instead,it asserts the various structures should be aggregated for revenue purposes.
we decline to adopt iowa reading of the statute.it does not stand the test of reason.a reading of the statute as iowa encourages could result in illogical outcomes.for example,restaurants located at a truckstop could have food sales that exceed the gross revenues of the truckstop petroleum sales.in such circumstances,none of the outlet those dedicated primarily to receive the benefit of an accelerated depreciation schedule.
also,if the entire property was considered a singular retail motor fuels outlet,each those without receive the favorable tax treatment.thus,if the retail motor fuels outlet sold a part of its market that was not petroleum based,then the business would no longer be entitled to the shelter of the depreciation schedule.this scenario would produce the absurd result of a property that is subjected to a significant
