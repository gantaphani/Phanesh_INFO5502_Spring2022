introduction 
in this case,appellant theophile carty filed in superior court,in propria persona,a petition for a writ of error coram nobis to vacate,according to his petition,a plea of no contest to failing to file an income tax return.the petition was denied and,on appeal,carty claims the denial was error because the trial court erroneously failed to advise him concerning immigration consequences of his plea as required by penal code section,subdivision a he was unaware of the immigration consequences of his plea,and,contrary to the trial court ruling,the petition was timely.
having requested and received supplemental briefing,we hold that,to the extent the petition alleged that the trial court failed to advise carty concerning the above mentioned immigration consequences,that carty was unaware of same,denial of the petition was proper.denial was proper because a statutory motion to vacate judgment brought pursuant to section,subdivision b,and not the nonstatutory petition for a writ of error coram nobis brought by carty,is the remedy for relief.accordingly,we will affirm the order denying the petition.however,because carty originally could have brought such a statutory motion and,on this record,it is appropriate for the trial court in the first instance to determine the propriety of granting such a motion,we will remand the matter with directions that the trial court treat carty petition as a statutory motion.
carty appeals from the order denying his petition for a writ of error coram nobis,following,according to the petition,a judgment entered after his plea of no contest to failing to file an income tax return.
factual and procedural summary 
on september,carty,in propria persona,filed a petition for writ of coram nobis capitalization omitted in case no.the petition alleged that in august,a judgement sic of conviction and sentence was rendered by the superior court in case no,and o n april,as part of a plea agreement,carty pled no contest to a charge that he violated california revenue and taxation code section as a result of the conviction,carty was sentence d to days of house arrest and three years probation.carty served that sentence.
carty alleged that as a direct consequence of the above mentioned plea,he was placed in the custody of the federal bureau of prisons,was facing deportation proceedings,and was in danger of deportation,exclusion from the united states,revocation of his lawful status in the united states,and other grave immigration consequences.the underlying judgment,he claims,was unlawful because he was denied effective assistance of counsel prior to his plea in that,in pertinent part,his counsel failed to advise him concerning the immigration consequences.as a result,he asserts that his plea was neither voluntary nor intelligent,because he was ignorant of the immigration consequences of his plea.if he had been informed of those consequences,he would have used every available remedy to contest the accusations against him.
the petition further alleged that carty rights were violated because he was not admonished by the court concerning potential immigration consequences,and he was not warned of the possibility of deportation and exclusion from the united states.he prayed that the court,inter alia,vacate the judgment and sentence.
on october,the court denied the petition on the ground that coram nobis would not lie to vacate a judgment because of ineffective assistance of counsel or because defense counsel had given false advise,assurances,or promises.the court also denied the petition on the ground that it was untimely.
as mentioned,the petition allegations appear to conflict concerning when carty was convicted in the case underlying the petition see fn,ante.moreover,although,the petition alleged it was verified,it was neither signed nor verified.we assume,for purposes of our decision,that the petition accurately alleges the crime s of which carty was convicted in the underlying case,and that he is in the custody of the federal bureau of prisons as a result of that conviction.
contention 
carty contends t he court erred in denying the petition without issuance of an order to show cause.
discussion 
carty petition was properly denied,but remand is appropriate to permit the trial court to treat the petition as a statutory motion to vacate judgment.prior to section,the writ of coram nobis provided relief where a defendant was unaware of immigration consequences of a guilty plea.
the writ of error coram nobis is a common law remedy.people thomas cal d,fn.thomas people adamson cal d,see witkin epstein,law ed.criminal judgment.the writ of error coram nobis generally lies to give relief where the petitioner,through fraud,coercion,or excusable mistake,was deprived of a fair trial on the merits.see witkin epstein,supra.
a petition for a writ of error coram nobis hereafter,petition is a motion to vacate judgment.people shipman cal d,fn,shipman thomas,supra,cal d at,fn.however,the petition is a nonstatutory motion to vacate judgment people banks cal d,people adamson cal d,people adamson,supra,cal d at,since the petition seeks a common law remedy 
importantly,the purpose of a petition is to secure relief,where no other remedy exists.people adamson,supra,cal d at,italics and bracketed material added people banks,supra,cal d at,accord people wheeler d.accord see witkin epstein,supra,stating,concerning the petition,a frequent ground of denial is that the alleged error could have been raised in another way,by motion during trial,motion for new trial,appeal,or habeas corpus.citations.
prior to the enactment of section,discussed post,a defendant could file a petition seeking relief from a judgment on the ground that the defendant was unaware of the immigration consequences of a guilty plea,but the defendant had no right under principles to be advised by the trial court concerning such consequences thus,prior to,a defendant could not,via a petition,seek relief on the ground that the trial court failed to give such advisements.
section,subdivision b statutory motion to vacate judgment supplants the writ where the trial court fails to advise a defendant concerning specified immigration consequences the defendant is unaware of same.
section,enacted in,by statutes,chapter,section,became effective january.people trantow,supra,d at,fn.subdivision a thereof requires that,prior to accepting a guilty or no contest plea to an offense not an infraction,a court must advise the defendant concerning specified immigration consequences.subdivision b,provides a remedy when a court fails to give the requisite advisements and the plea may have a specified immigration consequence s a defendant may move to vacate the judgment,withdraw said plea,and enter a plea of not guilty 
it is clear from section,subdivision d,that the advisement requirement of subdivision a was designed to remedy the problem arising when defendants entered pleas of guilty no contest,not knowing subdivision d,that is,unaware,that the conviction could have the specified immigration consequence s.accordingly,the term advisement in subdivision a reasonably must be understood to mean not merely that the trial court recites the specified subdivision a language,but that the defendant understands that recitation and the defendant is deemed to have understood the recitation if it was given in the defendant language.phrased differently,once the defendant receives a subdivision a advisement from the trial court prior to the plea,the defendant can no longer claim that the defendant was unaware of the immigration consequences specified in that advisement.when a defendant claims that the defendant was unaware of those consequences,a statutory motion will be dispositive.
finally,a motion to vacate judgment brought pursuant to section,subdivision b is a statutory motion to vacate judgment hereafter,statutory motion.people totari cal th,fn,d,totari.indeed,totari is the first california supreme court decision,and the only published decision,to refer to a motion to vacate judgment brought pursuant to section,subdivision b as a statutory motion.
totari and zamudio teach that distinguishing the petition from the statutory motion does not promote form over substance.
every petition for a writ of error coram nobis is a motion to vacate judgment,but the converse is not true.as noted earlier,our supreme court has made clear that a petition is the equivalent of a motion to vacate judgment,but appellate cases err by asserting that a motion to vacate the judgment is the equivalent of a petition for a writ of error coram nobis,people gutierrez th,d accord,people gontiz,supra,th at,d people castaneda th,d since a statutory motion is not a nonstatutory petition.
as shown below in totari,our supreme court,in the context of its discussion of the appealability of an order denying a statutory motion,recently reaffirmed the distinction between the statutory motion and a petition as a nonstatutory motion to vacate judgment.
totari held that an order denying a statutory motion was an appealable order under section,subdivision b,as an order made after judgment,affecting the substantial rights of the party.totari,supra,cal th at,d.the attorney general,who had urged the contrary,argued that the defendant in that case knew the immigration consequences of his guilty plea before he was sentenced,and also argued that the supreme court,in making the procedural determination of whether the above mentioned order was appealable,was required to make a de novo factual finding on the issue of whether the defendant knew said consequences.totari,supra,cal th at,d.
the supreme court observed that the attorney general was confus ing the contested issues on the merits with the procedural question of appealability totari,supra,cal th at,d,and the supreme court rejected the attorney general argument.the supreme court noted that the attorney general was analogizing to procedures followed in extraordinary writ proceedings.the supreme court also noted that,before the enactment of the statutory motion,the nonstatutory motion to vacate judgment was viewed as a petition.the supreme court further noted that,in an appeal from a trial court denial of a petition,a reviewing court initially determined whether the defendant had made a prima facie showing of merit and,if the defendant had not,the court could summarily dismiss the appeal.totari,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
totari observed that the appellate court in that case had found that a statutory motion was similar to,but not the same as,a petition the parties did not claim otherwise and they did not contend that the defendant appeal was part of an extraordinary writ proceeding.totari concluded that a reviewing court de novo finding of fact to determine a right of appeal was far different from its determination of the legal sufficiency of a prima facie showing of merit.totari,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
moreover,totari later noted that the attorney general relied on an earlier supreme court case involving a nonstatutory motion to vacate a judgment although that case did not involve immigration issues.totari rejected that reliance as misplaced on two grounds,the m ore important totari,supra,cal th at,d,one being that the defendant in the earlier supreme court case brought a nonstatutory motion to vacate judgment,while the defendant in totari filed a statutory motion.id.at,d.
our insistence upon distinguishing between the statutory motion and a petition does not promote form over substance.indeed,although there is no need to decide the issue,we show below that even absent our decision in this matter,in a case such as this one in which the record is silent on the issue of due diligence,a petition,unlike a statutory motion,might be denied 
the writ of coram nobis requires that the petitioner show due diligence that is,the petitioner must show that the facts upon which he relies were not known to him and could not in the exercise of due diligence have been discovered by him at any time substantially earlier than the time of his motion for the writ citations.shipman,supra,cal d at,accord,in re clark cal th,d.thus,it is necessary to aver not only the probative facts upon which the basic claim rests,but also the time and circumstances under which the facts were discovered,in order that the court can determine as a matter of law whether the litigant proceeded with due diligence.people shorts cal d,italics added.
in zamudio,the trial court granted the defendant motion to vacate judgment based on the court failure to advise,prior to his no contest plea,concerning the immigration consequence that the defendant conviction could result in his exclusion from admission to the united states.zamudio,supra,cal th at,d.importantly,the motion to vacate the judgment in zamudio was a statutory motion.totari,supra,cal th at,d.
in zamudio,the attorney general argued that the trial court should have denied defendant section motion on the ground he delayed,without excuse,in bringing it.however,there was no evidence in the record as to when the defendant first knew that he risked actual exclusion from admission to the united states for purposes of section,subdivision b.zamudio,supra,cal th at,d.zamudio rejected the notion that the issue of whether the trial court erroneously failed to advise concerning the immigration consequence was waived because of the defendant failure to raise the issue at or before sentencing.ibid.
zamudio later acknowledged that people castaneda,supra,th,d,stood at most for the proposition that a postjudgment motion to change a plea must be made with reasonable diligence.zamudio,supra,cal th at,d.however,zamudio concluded,absent evidence that defendant long ago had cause to question the accuracy of the trial court immigration advisements,to hold he should have objected to them earlier would be unfair.this conclusion accords with the plain language of section,which contains no time bar.zamudio,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
thus,under a petition,in which a defendant,such as carty,must aver the time and circumstances under which the facts were discovered people shorts,supra,cal d at,as part of a due diligence showing,it appears that the defendant would have the burden to show when the defendant first had cause to question the accuracy of immigration advisements and risked actual immigration consequences,and the absence of evidence on these issues would defeat the petition.people castaneda,supra,th at,d.we note in this regard that one of the reasons carty petition was denied was that it was untimely.however,zamudio,faced with a silent record on these issues,effectively concluded that a defendant has no such burden as to a statutory motion,and the absence of evidence on these issues does not defeat such a motion 
application of law to this case.
denial of carty petition was proper.
carty contends his petition was erroneously denied as mentioned,the purpose of a petition is to secure relief,where no other remedy exists people adamson,supra,cal d at,italics added.the statutory motion exists as an available postjudgment remedy when a trial court fails to advise a defendant of immigration consequences as required by section,subdivision a,when a defendant claims he was unaware of those consequences.accordingly,to the extent carty petition alleged such a trial court failure,that he was unaware of such immigration consequences of his plea,there is no need to decide whether it was properly denied on the ground of untimeliness.we hold denial of the petition was proper since the statutory motion existed as a remedy.people murillo th,d statutory motion,not a motion to strike prior conviction,is the exclusive remedy to raise issue of trial court failure to give the statutorily required advisements.the trial court properly denied carty petition 
remand is appropriate.
based on our previous discussion,it is clear that carty originally could have brought a statutory motion.moreover,as noted earlier,a defendant making a statutory motion must show prejudice,that is,properly advised,the defendant would not have pleaded no contest in the first place.zamudio,supra,cal th at,d.concerning that issue,zamudio also observed,whether defendant was prejudiced by the trial court incomplete advisements is a factual question,appropriate for decision by the trial court in the first
