rrf appeals.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.we affirm.
background 
the court of federal claims factual findings are extensive and clearly presented.see rrf ii,fed.cl.at rrf i,fed.cl.at.because these factual findings are largely undisputed,we recite only those facts necessary to resolve this appeal.
there are several players of interest.nancy zimmerman bracebridge,a management company.rrf ii,fed.cl.at.bracebridge created rrf,a hedge fund.id.bracebridge also manages ffip,ffip,another fund.id.all three bracebridge,rrf,and ffip are partnerships.rrf i,fed.cl.at.relevant to this appeal,zimmerman is a direct partner of ffip,and ffip is a direct partner of rrf.id.in this context,zimmerman is an indirect partner of rrf and represents similarly situated indirect partners of rrf direct partners of ffip.id.
in,russian sovereign debt was traded exclusively on the moscow interbank currency exchange micex.rrf ii,fed.cl.at.investors could not invest directly in russian sovereign debt on the micex however,they could invest in derivative instruments known as notes clns sold by certain authorized banks.id.at.when russia defaulted on its sovereign debt in august,the russian ruble collapsed,and clns lost nearly all of their value.id.these assets also became extremely illiquid the russian central bank imposed currency exchange limitations that prevented the ruble from being freely traded,and the russian government only allowed the authorized banks to access the debt and trade in rubles.id.
these events had serious consequences for tiger management,llc tiger,one of the world largest managers of hedge funds.id.at.two of tiger funds,foreign partnerships that do not pay taxes,had purchased clns through deutsche bank for more than million.id.after the collapse,those clns were worth less than of their original value.id.and tiger overall was in bad straits in,tiger managed billion but by,that amount had dropped to billion as a result of heavy losses in russian debt,asian debt,and an investment in us airways.id.at.during that period,tiger needed cash to redeem the shares of investors who wanted out,but the capital controls on russian debt hampered tiger ability to sell its devalued clns.see id.at.
zimmerman believed that she could make money for herself and investors by obtaining devalued russian debt at pennies on the dollar in anticipation of a recovery of the ruble and hence something approaching face value of debt instruments.id.at.as a result,bracebridge established rrf and sought holders of russian securities to contribute clns or cash in exchange for shares of rrf.id.at see.bracebridge also established rra,a separate management company to advise rrf and collect management fees.rrf ii,fed.cl.at.
despite earnest marketing efforts by bracebridge during the first several months,rrf largely failed to obtain investors and still had no assets in march.id.at.an internal bracebridge email on march,discussed a potential contribution of clns from an entity through deutsche bank.id.given concern that rrf needed partners to attract the potential investor,the email proposed having entities become rrf partners.id.a telephone list circulated the next day contained the contact information of players from bracebridge,deutsche bank,and tiger.id.
in april,ffip contribute d the first assets to rrf.see id.at.then,on april,bracebridge james dibiase emailed zimmerman about the need to represent that a high percentage of rrf,ffip is owned by individuals to attract deutsche bank investors.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in a second email on may,he advised zimmerman that rrf should not allow corporations to join because it could possibly impair one of our most valuable assets,the losses in russian depreciated assets that might end up in rrf.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.as explained in a later email by dibiase,the presence of corporations could preclude later resale since people interested in buying tax losses do want to transact with corporations.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
a series of transactions followed,each of which was orchestrated by deutsche bank.id.at.first,in late may,rrf first two substantial outside investors both funds operated by tiger transferred clns to rrf in exchange for an ownership interest in rrf.id.at.prior to investing,however,tiger requested certain changes to the standard rrf offering memorandum and refused to execute the standard subscription agreement representing that the shares subscribed for hereby are being acquired by the undersigned for investment purposes only,for the account of the undersigned,and not with a view to any sale or distribution thereof.id.paraphrasing see.in response,rrf reduced the period to allow tiger to redeem its shares on or after july,in exchange for cash or assets in kind,and excluded the representation that tiger was purchasing the shares for investment purposes only from the subscription agreement.rrf ii,fed.cl.at see.second,on june,approximately two weeks after the first transaction between rrf and tiger,tiger sold all of its rrf partnership shares to ffip for approximately million,a discount of.rrf ii,fed.cl.at see.notably,during the two weeks between tiger acquisition of its ownership interest in rrf and its sale of that interest to ffip,the value of the shares had in fact increased.rrf ii,fed.cl.at.and a fax from deutsche bank to dibiase during this period makes clear that it was rrf,not tiger,that would have had an interest in an entity like ffip purchasing tiger shares and acquiring the losses.id.at.third,on june,rrf sold of the tiger clns to general cigar corporation general cigar for cash and shares.id.at see.finally,in,rrf sold the remaining of the tiger clns on the open market.rrf ii,fed.cl.at.
following these transactions,dibiase began working with ernst young to provide the documents and facts that would collectively lay the foundation upon which the accountants would prepare rrf tax returns.id.at.on august,rrf filed its tax return,allocating a loss to ffip,which included a loss of from the sale of the of the tiger clns.id.at rrf i,fed.cl.at see,ffip then reported losses for the and tax years,much of which were attributable to the loss claimed by rrf in.rrf i,fed.cl.at.ffip losses flowed through ffip to zimmerman,who filed her individual tax return on october.id.on her individual tax return,zimmerman reported a substantial amount of rrf loss.id.in other words,the bulk of the losses rrf allocated to ffip in were not passed through in,but were retained by ffip until,at which point the losses impacted zimmerman return.id.
in,the irs performed an audit of ffip partnership return,which ultimately resulted in the issuance of a no adjustments letter to ffip.id.at see.however,in october,the irs issued the fpaa to rrf for its tax year,which disallowed the loss rrf claimed for the sale of the tiger clns and imposed a penalty.rrf i,fed.cl.at rrf ii,fed.cl.at.

ii.the court of federal claims did not err by denying rrf for summary judgment in rrf i 
in rrf i,the parties filed for summary judgment disputing whether the irs timely issued the fpaa and whether it suspended the limitations period for adjustment and assessment of rrf indirect partners ffip direct partners individual tax returns.fed.cl.at.with the agreement of the parties,the court of federal claims selected zimmerman as representative of the rrf indirect partners who also are ffip direct partners whose tax returns were filed less than three years prior to the issuance of the fpaa.id.at.the court of federal claims determined that if it is demonstrated that the loss from rrf tax return can be traced to zimmerman tax return then the irs may assess additional taxes.id.at.it then h e ld that the fpaa validly suspended the limitation s period for assessing zimmerman individual tax return.id.
on appeal,rrf argues that a ny attempt by the irs to collect tax from ffip partners in and later years based on ffip partnership items is because the irs failed to issue an fpaa to ffip for those years.appellant br.according to rrf,the fpaa toll ed the period for assessing tax attributable to rrf partnership items,not ffip partnership items,id.at capitalization modified,because the fpaa can not apply to either two partnerships,rrf and ffip or two tax years,and,see id.at.we hold the court of federal claims correctly determined that the losses claimed on zimmerman tax return are attributable to the loss claimed in rrf tax return,the limitations period for which was suspended by the fpaa.
legal framework 
pursuant to the tefra,the g eneral rule is that the period for assessing any tax imposed by subtitle a,income tax with respect to any person which is attributable to any partnership item or affected item for a partnership taxable year shall not expire before the date which is three years after the later of either filing of the partnership return or the return due date.a emphases added.if an fpaa with respect to any taxable year is mailed to the tax matters partner,the limitations period in a shall be suspended for the period during which an action may be brought under and,if a petition is filed under with respect to such administrative adjustment,until the decision of the court becomes final,and for one year thereafter.id.d.taken together,a and d provide that the issuance of an fpaa for a given year suspend s the limitations period for assessing any tax of any person that is attributable to any partnership item for that year.
attributable to means due to,caused by,or generated by 
the central issue here is whether the losses that ffip allocated in to zimmerman were attributable to the loss reported by rrf in under a.this is a question of statutory interpretation and,thus,our inquiry begins with the statutory text.bedroc,llc united states,citations omitted.the plain meaning of legislation should be conclusive,except in the rare cases in which the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters.united states ron pair,internal quotation marks,brackets,and citation omitted.when interpreting another provision of the internal revenue code,we explained that attributable to is not defined anywhere in the internal revenue code and has no special technical meaning under the tax laws.electrolux holdings,united states,fed.cir.citation omitted.we noted that,in tax cases,various other courts have construed the phrase according to its plain meaning,which is understood to be due to,caused by,or generated by.id.at citations omitted collecting cases see keener united states,fed.cir.same.
other principles of statutory construction reinforce this interpretation.first,term s should be construed,if possible,to give them a consistent meaning throughout the relevant statutory scheme.gustafson alloyd.interpreting attributable to in a differently from how it is interpreted in other internal revenue code provisions,due to,caused by,or generated by,would violate this principle.second,limitations statutes barring the collection of taxes otherwise due and unpaid are strictly construed in favor of the government.badaracco comm r,internal quotation marks and citation omitted see bufferd comm r,stating that,even where the statute of limitations for assessments is ambiguous,if the commissioner construction is a reasonable one courts should accept it absent convincing grounds for rejecting it.as such,a should be interpreted broadly and the irs interpretation,if reasonable,should be given deference.defining attributable to in a to mean due to,caused by,or generated by preserves the phrase plain meaning,maintains consistency with the phrase interpretation elsewhere in the internal revenue code,and follows the supreme court precedent for affording the irs deference in interpreting the internal revenue code.therefore,we see no reason why that same definition should not apply here.
c.the court of federal claims did not err in determining that the losses claimed on zimmerman individual tax return are attributable to the loss claimed on rrf tax return 
applying that definition of attributable to here,the fpaa suspended the limitations period for assessing any tax against zimmerman that was due to,caused by,or generated by any partnership item on her individual tax return.the parties do not dispute that the irs issued the fpaa to rrf less than three years after zimmerman filed her individual tax return.rrf i,fed.cl.at see.and,as explained above,rrf allocated the loss claimed in its tax return to ffip,much of which ffip passed through in its and tax returns to zimmerman,who claimed these losses in her individual tax return.rrf i,fed.cl.at.thus,the losses zimmerman claimed on her tax return were generated by the loss claimed on rrf tax return,and the fpaa suspended the limitations period for assessing taxes on these losses.
this interpretation of attributable to also comports with the internal revenue code reasonable policy of treating partnership items at their source.generally,the tax treatment of any partnership item and the applicability of any penalty,addition to tax,or additional amount which relates to an adjustment to a partnership item shall be determined at the partnership level.pursuant to this principle,the tax liability of an indirect partner depends upon the partnership items,and a ll adjustments required to apply the results of a proceeding with respect to a partnership to an indirect partner shall be treated as computational adjustments.a see sente inv.club comm r,applying a.computational adjustments are change s in the tax liability of a partner which properly reflects the treatment of a partnership item.a emphasis added.the irs actions here fall squarely within the definition of a computational adjustment because the irs change d the tax liability of one indirect partner,zimmerman,to properly reflect the treatment of a partnership item,the loss claimed in rrf tax return.id.as a result,the irs properly adjusted the partnership item at its source 
rrf counterarguments are unpersuasive 
rrf presents two counterarguments,neither of which is persuasive.first,rrf argues that an item can only be a partnership item of a single partnership.appellant br.according to rrf,the g overnment conceded that the assessment at issue was attributable to a ffip partnership item.id.quoting rrf contends that the partnership item at issue is,and can be,a partnership item of ffip and only ffip.id.in support,rrf avers that permitting a partnership item to be attributable to multiple partnerships would disregard congress intent to simplify the procedures for partnership tax proceedings.id.brackets omitted quoting transpac drilling venture united states,fed.cir.vague references to the objective of simplifying partnership tax proceedings are insufficient to demonstrate that the plain meaning of attributable to will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters,and,thus,the plain language is conclusive.ron pair,at.
second,rrf contends that our interpretation of would violate the tax system bedrock annual accounting principle,that taxes are to be determined on an annual basis.appellant br.citing burnet sanford brooks.specifically,rrf alleges that our interpretation ignores the supreme court instruction that,a bsent other specific directions from congress,internal revenue code provisions must be interpreted so as to conform to the basic premise of annual tax accounting.comm r gordon,footnote omitted see appellant br.the annual tax accounting principle concerns the annual calculation of tax liabilities based on receipts and deductions,not the limitations period to assess a tax.see united states skelly oil,explaining the procedures for calculating annual tax liabilities under the annual accounting principle.indeed,it is well settled that the irs and the courts may recompute taxable income in a closed year in order to determine the tax liability in an open year.barenholtz united states,fed.cir.footnote omitted.that is precisely what has occurred here the irs disallowance of the loss claimed on rrf tax return will result in zimmerman owing tax for losses claimed in her individual tax returns for and any later years in which she claimed losses attributable to the rrf loss,whether she or ffip carried them over 
iii.the court of federal claims did not err in determining that tiger was never a bona fide partner in rrf 
in rrf ii,the court of federal claims concluded that tiger had no real intention of becoming a partner in rrf and that rrf had reason to know that.fed.cl.at.instead,the court of federal claims found a review of the evidence demonstrates that their transaction was a sham,that the transaction lacked economic substance,that the contribution can be ignored,and that the transaction should be characterized as a sale.id.rrf argues that the court of federal claims erred by dismissing the relevant provisions of the internal revenue code,focusing on tiger subjective intent rather than objective indicia,and ignoring precedent permitting parties to structure transactions to achieve tax advantages.appellant br.see id.at.because there was no bona fide partnership between rrf and tiger,we hold that the court of federal claims did not err.
rrf and tiger did not intend to form a bona fide partnership 
the legal framework 
when a party acquires an economic interest in a partnership,they are only treated as a partner for tax purposes if the partnership interest is acquired in a bona fide transaction,not a mere sham for tax avoidance or evasion purposes.reg.e iii.in determining whether a bona fide partnership exists,the supreme court requires that courts evaluate whether the partners really and truly intended to join together for the purpose of carrying on the business and sharing in the profits and losses or both.comm r culbertson,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.more specifically,the supreme court explained that 
t he question is not whether the services or capital contributed by a partner are of sufficient importance to meet some objective standard,but whether,considering all facts including any facts throwing light on their true intent the parties in good faith and acting with a business purpose intended to join together in the present conduct of the enterprise.
id.at emphases added footnote omitted.contrary to rrf repeated assertions,the focus of the culbertson test is not objective it is the parties true intent.id.the parties true intent is evaluated by considering all facts,and t riers of fact who are constantly called upon to determine the intent with which a person acted are best able to make these determinations,id.at footnote omitted.
the court of federal claims did not err in its factual findings as to rrf and tiger intent 
the court of federal claims consider ed all facts,and determined that it was clear that tiger had no real intention of becoming a partner in rrf and that rrf had reason to know that,rrf ii,fed.cl.at emphasis added.but the court did not merely find that rrf had reason to know that tiger intended a sale,not a partnership.the court also found that,as early as april,tiger contribution was part of a plan of which rrf principals were fully aware to move highly depreciated assets to rrf via deutsche bank in a way that preserved their tax characteristics.id.at.in other words,both players knew before the first transaction that tiger would sell its clns for cash and that rrf would obtain clns with massive losses.as the court stated,tiger and rrf thus collaborated in a scheme to use the tax laws to their advantage.id.we discern no clear error in these findings by the court of federal claims.
indeed,the court of federal claims factual findings are thorough,established by the record,and supportive of its conclusion that rrf and tiger did not form a bona fide partnership.for example,both rrf and ffip were funds,and deutsche bank worked closely with both rrf and ffip to orchestrate each of the relevant transactions.as the court of federal claims found,
t he quickest means of seeing the events in focus is to step back and look for the actions of the common denominator,deutsche bank.it was the broker who helped tiger acquire its russian assets.it linked tiger with the bracebridge funds,rrf and ffip.it helped arrange the transfer of the tiger assets to rrf.it brokered the sale of tiger partnership interest in rrf to ffip,in the process making certain that the form of the sale did not jeopardize the subsequent transfer of the losses to a third party.it then obtained an option to sell the clns from rrf and finally arranged a sale to general cigar.the evidence clearly indicates that rrf was a knowing and willing participant in these activities,at least as of april.
id.at emphasis added see id.at explaining the relevant transactions,including deutsche bank involvement,and providing supporting citations.
this is particularly telling when tiger,the only party to the transactions that was not managed by bracebridge retained its interest in the partnership for approximately two weeks.see id.at explaining that tiger retained its interest from either may or,to june,see also.the court of federal claims found that the evidence is clear that tiger was interested in the spring of in selling its position in the clns.rrf ii,fed.cl.at.and at the time of tiger contribution to rrf,tiger employees were already emailing about the next step sale.id.tiger was at all times interested in liquidity,a sale,not a partnership.because culbertson requires that the parties act with a business purpose and intend to join together in the present conduct of the enterprise,at,it is highly significant that tiger refused to sign the standard subscription agreement stating that the shares subscribed for hereby are being acquired for investment purposes only,and not with the view that any resale or distribution thereof,rrf ii,fed.cl.at emphases added citing see.
moreover,relying on the government experts,the court of federal claims found that tiger entry into rrf made no sense as an investment,and its exit made no sense in terms of timing.rrf ii,fed.cl.at.the transaction neither diversified tiger investment portfolio rrf ii,fed.cl.at see,nor provided tiger with any additional expertise rrf ii,fed.cl.at,see.as one of the world largest management companies,tiger was already paying its own experts and would have been better off managing its own clns rather than paying for nothing,paying management fees to rra and committing to any kind of lockup period.id.at.in addition,tiger did not perform basic due diligence prior to the acquisition rrf ii,fed.cl.at see,and it sold the clns to ffip two weeks later at a discount even though the value had increased during that short period.id.at.
as for rrf,the court of federal claims found that there is a massive amount of circumstantial evidence that rrf was aware early on that tiger had no real interest in becoming a partner,and it concluded that rrf was a willing participant at some point at least as of april in facilitating the transfer of assets through the sham partnership.id.at.for example,emails between rrf principals in april and may,before the first transaction,revealed rrf knowledge that tiger intended to engage in a sale and that it would be important to preserve the tax basis of tiger contribution for that future sale.id.at.
these factual findings are sufficient to demonstrate that neither rrf nor tiger intended to form a bona fide partnership under the culbertson standard.
the court of federal claims did not err in its legal conclusion that rrf and tiger did not form a bona fide partnership 
lacking any basis to challenge the court of federal claims factual findings,rrf argues that the court of federal claims erred in its selection of the appropriate legal standard and the legal conclusions it drew from its underlying factual findings.see appellant br.rrf primary argument is that the court of federal claims improperly ignored sections of the internal revenue code that dictate that tiger was a partner and that the losses on the property contributed by tiger properly transferred to the partnership.appellant br.see id.citing to c,e,a,b.by ignoring these provisions,rrf alleges that the court of federal claims eschewed the and congressionally mandated standard for determining partnership formation in favor of its own test,under which objective indicia of partnership intent are disregarded as mere formalities and one party unilateral intent can invalidate the partnership.id.at see id.at.
the court of federal claims did not apply its own test,id.at it applied the supreme court.under culbertson,the focus of the inquiry is the parties true intent,at,which is determined by considering all the facts,id.contrary to rrf assertions,the court of federal claims considered the totality of the circumstances,see,rrf ii,fed.cl.at discussing the revisions to the subscription agreement mandated by tiger,discussing rrf expert estimate that rrf rate of return was for and for,discussing tiger ability to do its own market and asset analysis,and determined that rrf and tiger actions were mere formalities,id.at.the court of federal claims weighed all of the relevant factors,made underlying factual findings,and applied the appropriate legal standard to these findings to determine that rrf and tiger did not enter into a bona fide partnership,reached a legal conclusion.this is exactly what is required by both culbertson and our precedent.see at requiring courts to consider all facts to determine the parties true intent,that the parties in good faith and acting with a business purpose intended to join together in the present conduct of the enterprise wells fargo,at stating that the characterization of transactions for tax purposes is a legal issue that is based on underlying findings of fact citation omitted.we find no error in the court of federal claims factual findings and agree with its legal conclusion.
rrf arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.first,rrf contends that culbertson does not apply here because congress has provided the standard governing partnership formation.appellant br.in support,rrf cites to a general statement from the circuit that culbertson does not supersede clear congressional intent.id.at citing horn comm r,cir.although useful in determining congressional intent and in avoiding results unintended by tax code provisions,the culbertson doctrine can not trump the plainly expressed intent of the legislature.however,culbertson clearly articulates the standard for determining whether a partnership is bona fide,and we are bound by culbertson until either the supreme court or congress overrules it.accord hohn united states,our decisions remain binding precedent until we see fit to reconsider them,regardless of whether subsequent cases have raised doubts about their continuing vitality.citation omitted dickerson united states,congress retains the ultimate authority to modify or set aside any judicially created rules of evidence and procedure that are not required by the constitution.citations omitted.in addition,even if we were bound by horn,which we are not,see int l custom,united states,fed.cir.when our precedent is silent on a particular question,we may look to another circuit for guidance and may be persuaded by its analysis,though decisions from other circuits are not binding on this court.internal quotation marks and citation omitted,horn does not provide that objective indicia should serve as the foundation of a court analysis of whether a partnership is bona fide.in fact,horn does not mention partnership at all.see generally.horn is simply inapposite.
second,rrf argues that the court of federal claims incorrectly focused on tiger unilateral intent.appellant br.for example,rrf states that the court of federal claims dwelled on its finding that tiger had no real interest in being a long term investor.but the court of federal claims could never explain why this mattered to partnership formation.id.at.rrf overlooks that culbertson explicitly counsels that both parties must intend to form a partnership,meaning that both rrf and tiger intent were relevant.see at repeatedly referring to the intent of the parties emphasis added.in addition,contrary to rrf assertions,the court of federal claims did not look to tiger unilateral intent instead,it found that rrf both knew of and shared in tiger intention.see,rrf ii,fed.cl.at the balance of the evidence of rrf knowledge of what was really happening is so overwhelming,tiger and rrf collaborated in a scheme to use the tax laws to their advantage.w e are not obligated to give them effect when their sole intent was to avoid treating the transaction as what it was,a sale.
finally,rrf asserts that the court of federal claims incorrectly relied on its finding that the parties had use d the tax laws to their advantage.appellant br.quoting rrf ii,fed.cl.at.it is true that a taxpayer has an unquestioned right to decrease or avoid his taxes by means which the law permits.coltec,united states,fed.cir.citation omitted.however,this was not the foundation of the court of federal claims holding.instead,it determined that rrf and tiger sole intent was manipulating the tax code,rrf ii,fed.cl.at,and,thus,that they lacked the true intent to form a bona fide partnership,culbertson,at.
rrf transaction with tiger lacked economic substance 
even had rrf and tiger intended to form a bona fide partnership,the court of federal claims correctly determined that rrf transaction with tiger fails under the economic substance doctrine,see rrf ii,fed.cl.at,which prevent s taxpayers from subverting t
