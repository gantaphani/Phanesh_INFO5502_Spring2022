in this mandamus proceeding,plaintiff merchandising concept group sought to compel defendant california unemployment insurance appeals board the appeals board to set aside its reassessment decision that plaintiff workers were employees and not independent contractors which resulted in upholding a tax assessment levied by the employment development department against plaintiff r etain jurisdiction over the employment development department which conducted the audit that first concluded the workers were employees and refund taxes erroneously collected by the employment development department.
the question on appeal is whether merchandising concept group is entitled to judicial review of the appeals board reassessment decision.the answer is no.as we explain,the legislature has not provided for judicial review of the appeals board reassessment decision rather,it has provided for an action against the director of the employment development department for refund of any taxes paid by the claimant,provided the claimant has filed a claim for refund with the department and the appeals board has issued an order or decision regarding the petition for review of the department denial of the claim for refund.this is an adequate remedy at law.
here,merchandising concept group filed a claim for refund but failed to exhaust its administrative remedies by waiting for a decision from the appeals board regarding the petition for review of the denial of the claim for refund.as such,we affirm the superior court judgment entered after it sustained a demurrer without leave to amend the petition for writ of mandate.
factual and procedural background 
merchandising concept group contracted with clothing manufacturers to provide attractive product displays to promote sales of goods in retail stores.the people who made the displays were called detailers,and merchandising concept group classified them as independent contractors.
the employment development department audited merchandising concept group and determined the detailers were not independent contractors but employees subject to employment deductions.the employment development department issued an assessment totaling approximately plus a penalty on merchandising concept group based on the reclassification of of its workers 
merchandising concept group challenged the assessment and penalty by filing a petition for reassessment with an administrative law judge.the administrative law judge affirmed the assessment but reversed the penalty,finding the failure to file adequate tax returns was made on advice of counsel,on which merchandising concept group reasonably relied.
both merchandising concept group and the employment development department appealed to the appeals board,which affirmed the administrative law judge decision and denied the petition for reassessment.the appeals board stated this was a final decision.attached to its decision was an i nformation s heet that stated,among other things,t he petitioner may seek judicial review of any portion of this decision denying or dismissing any portion of its claim for refund by filing an action in the superior court in the county of sacramento against the employment development department edd director.judicial review of a decision other than as set forth above may be obtained only upon conclusion of the administrative process,including the payment of sums owed and the filing of a claim for refund with the employment development department.
merchandising concept group paid the assessment,filed a claim for refund with the employment development department,and filed a petition for writ of mandate in the superior court asking the court to direct the appeals board to set aside its reassessment decision,r etain jurisdiction over the employment development department,and refund taxes erroneously collected by the employment development department.
the appeals board demurred to the petition for writ of mandate on the following three grounds merchandising concept group had an adequate legal remedy in the form of a suit for refund,merchandising concept group failed to exhaust its administrative remedies,and the appeals board was not a proper party to an employment tax challenge.
the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend on all three grounds and entered a judgment of dismissal.
merchandising concept group filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
on appeal,merchandising concept group raises a number of arguments why the court judgment was wrong.in essence,merchandising concept group contends it had a right to superior court review of the appeals board reassessment decision based on case law,statutory law,and the appeals board own statements following its reassessment decision.it also argues it should have a chance to amend its petition to correct any pleading errors that led to the belief the petition was a claim for refund as opposed to simply a challenge to the validity of the appeals board reassessment decision.
the appeals board responds the judgment was correct because merchandising concept group failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and a suit for refund against the employment development department is an adequate legal remedy.
to put these arguments in context,we begin by explaining the relevant constitutional provisions and statutes at issue.
constitutional and statutory provisions prescribe the manner of proceeding in an action to recover a tax paid 
the california constitution has granted to the legislature the power to prescribe the manner of proceeding in an action to recover a tax paid.patane kiddoo d,patane.specifically,article xiii,section,of the california constitution permits a tax refund lawsuit only in such manner as may be provided by the legislature.
the legislature has adopted sections of the unemployment insurance to implement th is constitutional provision,which impose as a condition to the maintenance of an action to recover unemployment insurance taxes the exhaustion of administrative remedies.patane,supra,d at.
specifically,section permits any employing unit or other person to file a petition for review or reassessment with an administrative law judge w ithin days of service of any notice of assessment or denial of claim for refund or credit.if the petition is not filed within days or an additional period granted,an assessment is final at the expiration of the period.ibid.
if such a petition for review or reassessment is filed,an administrative law judge shall review the matter and,if requested by the petitioner,shall grant a hearing.a hearing is not required on a petition if a prior hearing has been afforded the petitioner involving the same issues.
after the administrative law judge serves notice of the decision,the petitioner or the director of the employment development department may file an appeal to the appeals board,subd.a.
the appeals board then makes a decision on the appeal.within days after the service of the notice of the decision of the appeals board upon an appeal,a claimant may bring an action against the director of the employment development department on the grounds set forth in the claim in a court of competent jurisdiction in the county of sacramento for the recovery of the whole or any part of the amount with respect to which the claim has been denied,subd.a.the same subdivision,however,contains the following prohibition on filing suit no suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any amount of contributions,interest or penalties alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected unless a claim for refund or credit has been filed pursuant to this chapter.ibid.
merchandising concept group failed to exhaust its administrative remedies 
the employment development department contends merchandising concept group failed to exhaust its administrative remedies,as required by the unemployment insurance code,precluding writ review.we agree.
although exhaustion of administrative remedies is generally thought of as a judicially developed rule,in the case of an action to recover a tax paid,it is a statutory creation by the legislature pursuant to the grant of po
