introduction 
community redevelopment agency of the city of los angeles cra and the county of los angeles county dispute the manner in which property tax revenue is shared.the dispute centers on county interpretation of revenue and taxation code section section,which reduces the amount of revenue that cra receives.we uphold county interpretation and affirm.
background 
california law authorizes the creation of community redevelopment agencies to rehabilitate blighted areas.these agencies adopt plans for specific blighted areas,and pursuant to these plans the agencies become entitled to the increase in tax revenues attributable to the redevelopment area covered by the agencies plans.generally,as property values in a redevelopment area increase,tax revenues also increase.these incremental increases are referred to as tax revenue increments or simply tax increments.community redevelopment agencies typically use bonds to fund redevelopment projects and then use allocations of the tax increments to repay the bonds.
the legislature,in accordance with the california constitution art.xvi,has provided that local taxing agencies remain entitled to the tax revenues they would have received had development not been undertaken.by the same token,redevelopment agencies are entitled as a general principle to the increase in tax revenue generated by a redevelopment project.health,redevelopment agency county of san bernardino cal d.
nonetheless,the legislature has previously required that redevelopment plans contain limitations on the total amount of tax increment that a plan can receive.plans promulgated with such tax increment limitations thus cap the total amount of tax increment a plan will receive.
the present appeal concerns interpretation of section and its application with respect to tax increment limitations.section allows a county auditor to attribute administrative and overhead costs to various jurisdictions and community redevelopment which a county collects and to which a county pays tax revenues.cra is one of the agencies for which county collects tax revenue.county,in calculating its payment of tax revenues to cra,deducts or withholds the section administrative costs attributable to each redevelopment plan from the tax increment allocated to each plan.
with respect to three redevelopment plans,cra disputes county interpretation and application of section.cra does not assert that county improperly calculates the amount of the deduction.rather,cra asserts that county procedure of offsetting or withholding the administrative costs from the revenue it allocates and pays to cra is not authorized by section.county responds that if the administrative costs are not deducted from the allocation,redevelopment agencies would,in the final analysis,avoid payment of these costs,shift the burden to other jurisdictions and special districts,and make illusory the assessment of the administrative fee.
cra filed a complaint contending that county methodology is improper and results in underpayment of revenue to cra.the trial court did not agree with cra,denied cra petition for writ of mandate,and dismissed the complaint for declaratory relief,injunctive relief and damages.
factual and procedural history 
the community redevelopment law crl and other statutes authorize the formation of redevelopment agencies such as cra and empower them to adopt redevelopment plans.health,et cra has adopted three plans denominated respectively the pico union plan pico union plan,the crenshaw plan,and the central business district plan cbd plan.cra adopted the pico union plan on november,the crenshaw plan on may,and the cbd plan on july.
the crl and portions of the revenue and taxation code provide that a redevelopment plan receives property tax revenue generated by the increases in property values attributable to the area governed by the plans and also by tax rate increases.a county auditor then calculates and pays a redevelopment agency in accordance with certain formulas proportionally related to the increase in tax revenues.
the crl limits the duration of redevelopment plans and requires certain plans to limit the tax dollars they may receive pursuant to the plans.health.section requires that redevelopment plans have time limitations.section pertains to plans adopted before october,without these time limitations and,in subdivision a,requires that such a redevelopment plan be subject to a limitation on the number of dollars of taxes which may be divided and allocated to the redevelopment agency pursuant to the plan,including any amendments to the plan.taxes shall not be divided and shall not be allocated to the redevelopment agency beyond that limitation.subdivision g of section pertains to redevelopment plans adopted after october,and prior to january,and in subdivision g contains the exact requirement presented in subdivision a.thus,all three redevelopment plans at issue herein are subject to the allocation limitation provisions of section.
in the early,at a time when public funds were in crisis,the legislature enacted several provisions to foster the economic viability of county governments.the legislature enabled counties to recoup the administrative and overhead costs of collecting and apportioning tax revenues.see sb maddy stats,ch.several adjustments were made concerning the special revenue and tax problems of school districts.in,the legislature enacted section ab stats,ch,which was later amended.
presently,subdivisions a and b of section provide in pertinent part as follows 
a notwithstanding any other provision of law,for the fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter,the auditor shall divide the sum of the amounts calculated with respect to each jurisdiction,educational revenue augmentation fund eraf,or community redevelopment agency pursuant to sections and,or their predecessor sections,and section of the health and safety code,by the countywide total of those calculated amounts.the resulting ratio shall be known as the administrative cost apportionment factor and shall be multiplied by the sum of the property tax administrative costs incurred in the immediately preceding fiscal year by the assessor,tax collector,county board of equalization and assessment appeals boards,and auditor to determine the fiscal year property tax administrative costs proportionately attributable to each jurisdiction,eraf,or community redevelopment agency 
b each proportionate share of property tax administrative costs determined pursuant to subdivision a,except for those proportionate shares determined with respect to a school entity or eraf,shall be deducted from the property tax revenue allocation of the relevant jurisdiction or community redevelopment agency,and shall be added to the property tax revenue allocation of the county 
in sum,section authorizes a county to apportion to itself from tax revenues what the parties variously call a property tax administrative funding,or a property tax administrative fee,or simply a ptaf.using a formula based on a ratio,which the statute calls the administrative cost apportionment factor,subd.a a county auditor determines the total cost of administering the collection of property taxes and then calculates the share of those costs attributable to each jurisdiction,including community redevelopment agencies.under subdivision b,the county deducts this proportionate share from the property tax revenue allocation of the community redevelopment agency.the county then adds the deducted amounts to the property tax revenue allocation of the county.ibid.county deduction of ptaf reduces cra net allocation.
subdivision e of section states e it is the intent of the legislature in enacting this section to recognize that since the adoption of article xiii a of the california constitution by the voters,county governments have borne an unfair and disproportionate part of the financial burden of assessing,collecting,and allocating property tax revenues for other jurisdictions and for redevelopment agencies.the legislature finds and declares that this section is intended to fairly apportion the burden of collecting property tax revenues and is not a reallocation
