in this case,a sanitation fee ratepayer,jack moore,appealed a judgment denying his petition for writ of mandate and equitable relief as against the city of lemon grove the city and the lemon grove sanitation district the district,together with the city,respondents.moore sought to stop respondents from transferring funds collected as sewer service fees and charges to the city general fund,claiming the transfers violated proposition,the right to vote on taxes act.historical notes,west,cal.const.ed.foll.art.the trial court concluded that the charges at issue were subject to proposition,but that the transfers did not violate proposition as the district had used reasonable methods to determine the amounts to transfer.we agree and affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
the district manages and maintains about miles of collection pipes that transport sewage to the city of san diego treatment plants.the district possesses very little capital equipment and the city has three employees who exclusively perform work.all district maintenance,facilities,administrative equipment,personnel,service,billing,regulatory and other overhead are provided by the city.the other functions required for the district to operate,receptionists,analysts,engineers,inspectors,plan checkers,are provided by city employees that divide their time among various activities.
moore is a resident of the city and a sanitation fee ratepayer.he filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for injunctive relief,claiming respondents provide sewer services and impose fees and charges on users of the sewer services through property tax bills.he alleged that respondents engaged in a practice whereby they transferred funds collected as sewer service fees and charges to the city general fund.further,he claimed respondents failed to earmark these funds for a specific purpose,such as for reimbursement of shared costs or sewer maintenance and operations,but instead used the funds for general governmental purposes.moore claimed the yearly amount transferred by respondents to the general fund was not based on the actual costs incurred to support sewer maintenance and operations,but was calculated as about percent of the annual sewer service fees collected.
moore sought a petition for writ of mandate directing that respondents stop all transfers to the general fund and restore all previously transferred funds received by the general fund.he also sought a declaration of rights declaring that respondents violated article xiii d article xiii d of the california constitution and an injunction enjoining respondents from transferring funds to the general fund and requiring them to repay all previously transferred funds received by the general fund.
after considering the parties evidence,the trial court issued a tentative ruling concluding that the sanitation fees and charges at issue were subject to proposition,but finding respondents did not violate proposition.the trial court later confirmed its tentative ruling.thereafter,the court issued a judgment denying moore petition for writ of mandate.moore timely appealed.we granted the application of the howard jarvis taxpayers association to file an amicus curiae brief on behalf of moore.
discussion 
general legal principles 
in,california voters enacted proposition,which amended the california constitution by adding article xiii a article xiii a.the amendment plac ed significant limits on the taxing power of local and state governments.citation.as pertinent here,article xiii a,section provides,cities,counties and special districts,by a vote of the qualified electors of such district,may impose special taxes on such district city of san diego shapiro th,shapiro,italics deleted.
in,california voters enacted proposition,which added article xiii c article xiii c and article xiii d article xiii d to the california constitution in order to close loopholes in proposition.shapiro,supra,th at.t he primary purpose of proposition was to reform the law governing local government imposition of revenue generating devices other than special taxes id.at.a fee or charge is defined as any levy other than an ad valorem tax,a special tax,or an assessment,imposed by an agency upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership,including a user fee or charge for a property related service.art.xiii d,subd.e.
section of article xiii d sets forth the procedures and requirements governing fees and charges.as relevant here,section provides a fee can not be charged in excess of the service provided a fee can only be used for the purpose it was charged and the fee may not be imposed for general governmental services.art.xiii d,subd.b,hereinafter section b,or.the theme of these sections is that fee or charge revenues may not exceed what it costs to provide fee or charge services.of course,what it costs to provide such services includes all the required costs of providing service,and,including operation,maintenance,financial,and capital expenditures.the key is that the revenues derived from the fee or charge are required to provide the service,and may be used only for the service.in short,the section b fee or charge must reasonably represent the cost of providing service.howard jarvis taxpayers city of roseville th,roseville.
as one court that examined a regulatory fee noted,some fees are not easily correlated to a specific,ascertainable cost.this may be due to the complexity of the regulatory scheme and the multifaceted responsibilities of the department or agency charged with implementing or enforcing the applicable regulations the multifaceted responsibilities of each of the employees who are charged with implementing or enforcing the regulations the intermingled functions of various departments as well as intermingled funding sources and expansive accounting systems which are not designed to track specific tasks.california of scientists department of fish game th.thus,courts afford agencies a reasonable degree of flexibility to apportion the costs of regulatory programs in a variety of reasonable financing schemes.ibid.
the agency charging the fee or charge has the burden of demonstrating compliance with these requirements.b.the question whether a fee or charge violates article xiii d is subject to de novo review.silicon valley taxpayers,santa clara county open space authority cal th.we presume that the appealed judgment is correct.denham superior court cal d.even when we exercise our independent judgment in reviewing the record,we do not decide disputed issues of fact morgan imperial irrigation dist.th,and our review is limited to issues which have been adequately raised and supported in the appellant brief.reyes kosha th,fn.
ii.analysis 
the trial court concluded that the sanitation fees and charges at issue were fees as defined in article xiii d,section,subdivision e of the california constitution and thus,were fees subject to proposition.this finding is not at issue.rather,moore contends the money transferred by respondents from the sanitation fund to the general fund is illegal because the transfers were not properly tied to actual costs incurred for the district benefit and respondents never properly identified and quantified the costs.moore alleges a violation of three specific subdivisions of section.accordingly,we address each subdivision in turn,examining whether the district met its burden of demonstrating compliance with the requirements of section.
a.the fees were not spent for unrelated revenue purposes 
a fee may only be used for the purpose it was charged.b.here,the fees at issue were collected from property owners and described as sewer service charges.accordingly,respondents may appropriately spend these fees on anything related to the maintenance and management of the sewer system.we consider all the required costs of providing service,and,including operation,maintenance,financial,and capital expenditures.roseville,supra,th at.
the district presented evidence showing most functions required for it to operate are provided by city employees that divide their time among various activities.in return,the district reimburses the city for these services and expenses related to these services.cathleen till,the city finance director,explained that basic operational tools that the district requires to operate include support staff,accounting software,accounts payable staff,computer and gis systems,human resource services,executive management and support,inspection services,engineering staff,design programs and tools,and receptionist staff.because the district does not possess any of these software programs,computer systems,personnel,expertise,buildings for office space,it relies on the city to provide these services.
graham mitchell is the city manager and serves as executive director for the district.as the district executive director,mitchell oversees the overall operation of the district,manages the employees that provide direct and support services to the district,manages the overall budget,provides policy recommendations to the district board of directors and ensures that the district is fiscally solvent.
mitchell explained that the shared staffing approach utilized by the district and the city creates effective economies of scale and saves the taxpayers and ratepayers of the city and the district.mitchell also stated it is common practice in california for a city manager to provide executive management for several enterprises and for city staff to provide support for the other enterprises such as a sanitation district.
mitchell attempts to ensure an equitable and reasonable exchange of personnel and services between the city and the district.to manage the exchange of personnel and services between the city and the district,he utilizes an accounting practice in which the district transferred reimbursements to the city under two categories interfund transfers for operations and interfund transfers for administrative services.interfund transfers for operations relates to the direct personnel costs that the city incurs to manage and operate the district direct costs and the interfund transfers for administrative services represents the overhead costs associated with operating the district indirect costs.
till explained how the city and the district apportion indirect costs.for example,the telephone in the office used by the district is charged as a direct cost to the sanitation program.however,a percentage of the telephones used by the supervising public works director,city manager and other employees who spend part of their working hours performing sanitation duties is apportioned as an indirect cost to the district.the apportionment is done in accordance with the city best estimate of the actual time spent on sanitation matters.till stated that general department overhead is apportioned to the general fund if services are provided to the district by that department.
mitchell stated that moore inquiries over the past few years have prompted the city to create a better system to document transfers between the district and the city.after consulting with the san diego county grand jury auditor,the city developed a method to determine overhead costs.the city first determines its total costs for building expenditures,accounting software,copiers,utilities.it then determines each fund or activity share of the overhead costs by examining the budgeted expenditures for each fund or activity.mitchell explained that the challenge with using an expenditure model is that in any given year,expenditures can fluctuate greatly.for example,the district could have million in capital improvements,which would increase its share wildly that year.because this anomaly exists,mitchell explained that it makes more sense to base each fund or activity share of overhead on revenue.
till similarly stated that revenue estimates are a good indicator of general time spent by the support departments of each special fund when dividing overhead costs and provided the following as an example.assuming she gets thirty phone calls a day about various business items.each phone call may discuss a different budget fund.a call from the public works director may raise five or six special fund issues.cost allocation by time sheet could not capture the allocation of each of these costs.however,a general allocation method based on how much money flowed through into the programs would be a more accurate measure of the actual time spent and the loaded costs of each employee time in each program.
till noted that counting tasks assigned to each manager would be a misleading way to determine overhead costs,using the handling of tort claims by the risk works director as an example.she stated that most claims involve tire or wheel damage due to pot holes.these claims have a very standardized process and seldom are a significant cost item.in contrast,sewer damage claims happen once or twice a year and take up significant time and resources.till explained that for sewer backups,the district must respond as if it is the district fault unless proven otherwise.this entails significant environmental cleanup costs and costs for damage to the household and often hotel bills.it is a process even if it is later determined that the district was not at fault.the risk manager,city manager,city attorney,public works crews and outside contractors are involved for sewer backup clams.accordingly,one claim for tire damage and one sewer backup claim are not equal from a cost allocation perspective.
significantly,moore conceded at oral argument below that when a cost is incurred for the joint benefit of different divisions within a city or local government,those costs may be allocated.moore explained that the principle used by respondents was okay,but that the methods used were too ad hoc and not subject to any kind of objective criteria.moore agreed with the trial court restatement of his argument that he believed the method used by respondents to estimate and allocate their costs was unreasonable,while respondents believed the method to be reasonable.below and on appeal,moore relied on the roseville case to support his argument that respondents did not use a reasonable methodology.
at issue in roseville was an franchise fee fee.roseville,supra,th at.the roseville court explained that p rivate utilities pay public authorities franchise fees to use government land such as streets,or for to provide utility service.the city similarly imposes the fee on its municipal utilities is the term of choice since the utilities are not private entities.id.at,fn.omitted.the city set the franchise fee at a flat four percent of the utilities annual budgets.id.at.the roseville court concluded that the flat fee on the annual budget violated section b because the city made no showing that the flat fee represented actual costs,noting o n its face,this fee does not represent costs.it is a flat fee.roseville,at.once collected,the city transferred the flat fee into its general fund without pledging it for any specific purpose.id.at.the court concluded the transfer violated sections b and b because the flat fee was used to pay for general governmental services,not costs attributable to the services for which the fee was charged.roseville,at.
similarly,in howard jarvis taxpayers city of fresno th fresno,the city required each municipal utility to pay to the city,in lieu of property and other taxes normally placed upon private business,an fee currently set at one percent of the assessed value of fixed assets of the utility department or division.id.at.the fresno court concluded that the trial court properly prohibited the city from collecting the in lieu fee,noting the city has not even claimed the in lieu fee approximates the cost of city services to the utility departments and divisions,much less has it established such a relationship as a fact.id.at.the fresno court stated that if the city wishes to recover all of its costs from user fees,it must reasonably determine the unbudgeted costs of utilities enterprises and that those costs be recovered through rates proportional to the cost of providing service to each parcel.id.at.
the trial court rejected moore argument that the instant case was akin to the fees at issue in roseville.the court found that,unlike t
