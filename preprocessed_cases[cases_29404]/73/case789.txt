jefferson smurfit corporation smurfit brought this refund action against the united states claiming that a deficiency assessment by the internal revenue service irs for tax year was barred by res judicata.in its tax returns smurfit had claimed net operating losses which it sought to carry back to its tax year in order to obtain a refund for that year.during its examination of smurfit returns,the irs discovered that the amount which smurfit sought to carry back had been miscalculated and issued reports notifying smurfit of the resulting deficiency.smurfit did not contest that the amount it had carried back for its losses and credits had been miscalculated.it paid the assessed amount and now seeks a refund,arguing that a final decision of the tax court for its tax year bars the deficiency assessment.both parties moved for summary judgment in the district court.smurfit motion was granted,and the irs appeals.we reverse.
a corporate reorganization caused smurfit to file two tax returns for.it claimed in foreign tax credits in the first return and net operating losses in the second.smurfit also filed an irs form corporate application for tentative refund under,seeking to carry back the loss and the in credits to its tax year in order to produce a refund for that year.the day after smurfit filed its form,the irs began to examine its and tax filings.in the course of the examination,the irs employed economists to determine whether the foreign tax credits had been calculated correctly.
smurfit filed a tax court petition in to resolve its tax liabilities for and,and in january the irs and smurfit agreed to a stipulated settlement.on january,the tax court issued its brief decision based on the stipulation of the parties which simply ordered that there is no deficiency,or overpayment,in income tax for and that there is a deficiency in income tax for in the amount of.the tax court decision became final on april.
before the tax court filed its decision applying to the tax year,the irs issued notices of proposed adjustments disputing the calculations of smurfit carriedback losses and credits.sometime after smurfit had filed its petition in the tax court relating to its and tax years,the same irs examiner who had studied its liabilities for those years began examining its returns.the examiner discovered errors in smurfit calculation of its claimed foreign tax credits and net operating losses prior to entry of the tax court judgment.two examination reports relating to the tax years were released by the irs on april,several months after the tax court decision on smurfit and tax returns and one day before it became final.another examination report for issued on may.the irs reports stated that smurfit had miscalculated its net operating losses and tax credits and that it owed an additional plus interest for the tax year.
smurfit paid the asserted deficiency in june,and filed an administrative claim with the irs for a refund of the it had paid plus interest.it claimed that the tax court decision on its and tax years precluded the irs from seeking a deficiency payment for based on smurfit miscalculations of its net operating losses for.after the irs failed to act on the administrative claim within six months,smurfit filed this refund action in the district court.
both parties moved for summary judgment.smurfit did not argue that it had correctly calculated its tax credits or operating losses,but rather that res judicata barred the irs from seeking deficiencies for its tax year.the government responded that the internal revenue code allows it to assess deficiency payments for miscalculated net operating losses intended by a taxpayer to be carried back to an earlier tax year,regardless of whether the tax court has issued a decision for that year.in addition the government asserted a claim for equitable recoupment if smurfit were to prevail in the district court,a claim which smurfit did not contest.the tax court had determined that smurfit owed a deficiency payment for tax year,but the recalculations by the irs showed that smurfit would be due a tax benefit for that year if it were not barred by the final judgment rule.the government therefore argued that if reassessment of the carryback losses for was barred by res judicata,its reassessment of smurfit tax year should be affected similarly.the district court granted summary judgment to smurfit,as well as the government recoupment request.
the united states appeals,arguing that the district court erred by granting summary judgment to smurfit because congress has provided that the irs may examine and assess deficiencies resulting from errors in carriedback net operating loss cases even after the tax court has issued a final decision for the carryback year.smurfit contends,however,that under commissioner sunnen,the judicial adjudication of liabilities for a tax year acts as a bar to additional assessments for that year.it claims that congress did not intend to abrogate the doctrine of claim preclusion for carriedback net operating losses.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.lund hennepin,cir.
prior judgments can bar future litigation under two independent common law preclusion and claim preclusion.klipsch,wwr technology,cir.issue preclusion bars parties from relitigating issues that were actually litigated and necessary to the outcome of a prior judgment.mckenzie engineering nlrb,cir.smurfit concedes that the amount of the carriedback losses was not litigated in the tax court proceeding and that issue preclusion is inapplicable.under the doctrine of claim preclusion or res judicata,a party is prohibited from asserting a claim or defense in a later proceeding that should have been raised in an earlier proceeding in which there has been a final judgment.id.smurfit contends that under this doctrine the irs is precluded from seeking a deficiency assessment for the tax year because it did not raise its claim in the tax court.
claim preclusion is a common law doctrine which can be overridden by statute.see iowa network services qwest,cir zackim commissioner of internal revenue,cir.whether congress intended for the irs to assess deficiencies based on miscalculated carryback amounts even after the tax court has issued a final judgment for the carryback year is determined by examining the language,structure,and purpose of the statutory scheme.jones rath packing,d.
under the tax code,the irs is ordinarily required to assert a deficiency in a return by issuing the taxpayer a notice of deficiency.a.after receiving such a notice,the taxpayer can either pay the deficiency or file a petition in the tax court disputing that it owes the amount sought.the taxpayer is not required to pay the tax until the decision of the tax court has become final.a.taxpayers are unable to file a petition in the tax court unless they receive a notice of deficiency for a particular tax year,midland mortgage commissioner,wl.
although the irs is generally barred from determining additional deficiencies for a tax year for which the taxpayer has filed a petition in the tax court,c,congress has created exceptions to enable the assessment of other deficiencies even after one notice of deficiency has issued.section c contains both the general rule against successive deficiencies and the exceptional circumstances which do permit them 
if the secretary has mailed to the taxpayer a notice of deficiency and the taxpayer files a petition with the tax court the secretary shall have no right to determine any additional deficiency of income tax for the same taxable year with respect to any act or failure to act to which such petition relates,except in the case of fraud,and except as provided in section a relating to assertion of greater deficiencies before the tax court,in section b relating to mathematical or clerical errors,in section or relating to termination assessments,or in section c relating to the making of jeopardy assessments.
c emphasis added.
section c thus both permits additional notices of deficiency and lists the limited circumstances where they are allowed,explicitly including mathematical or clerical errors as provided in
