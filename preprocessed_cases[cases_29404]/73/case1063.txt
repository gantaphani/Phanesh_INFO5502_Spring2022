petitioner william miller appeals the district court affirmance of a bankruptcy court ruling which concluded that his chapter plan did not discharge his obligation to pay,gap period interest on taxes owed to the internal revenue service irs miller contends that the irs must be precluded from challenging the chapter plan,which he deems to have unambiguously indicated its intent to discharge any liability for gap period interest,on res judicata grounds.in the alternative,miller urges the panel to construe the language of the chapter plan and the applicable provisions of the bankruptcy code as excepting from discharge the interest which accrues on a tax debt only when the government claim to that debt is unsecured.
we have jurisdiction over the district court order affirming the decision of the bankruptcy court pursuant to d.we now affirm.
background 
william miller was the sole shareholder of rosalie restaurant associates,an incorporated entity which failed to pay the requisite employment taxes for the first quarter of.on october,miller was assessed a trust fund recovery penalty by the irs,which subsequently recorded notices of federal tax liens in california and iowa.miller filed for chapter bankruptcy on december.
on december,the irs was granted an allowed secured claim against miller bankruptcy estate in the amount of,and an allowed unsecured priority claim in the amount of.miller filed a chapter plan of reorganization on january.miller proposed plan,with several modifications,was confirmed on april.
article xi of miller confirmed plan,titled discharge and injunction,is the primary basis of contention between the parties.in pertinent part,it provided 
except as otherwise provided in the confirmation order or this plan,the confirmation order will act as a discharge and termination,as of the effective date,of any and all liabilities and debts of,and claims against the debtor that arose at any time before the confirmation order,including any interest accrued on such claims from and after the petition date 
a ll debts and interests shall be conclusively deemed released and discharged,as provided in and 
prior to confirmation,the irs sent a letter to miller counsel on february,in which the irs explained that a debtor is ineligible to receive a discharge from certain types of federal taxes in a chapter case.specifically,the letter noted that the,gap period interest accruing on miller tax debt constitute d a nondischargeable claim that the irs was not willing to concede.in response,miller counsel assured the irs,in a letter dated march,that any interest obligations were outside the scope of this plan,and therefore can not be done as part of the plan.
on april,following the transmission of a final payment to the irs,miller filed an adversary complaint in the bankruptcy court for the eastern district of california,seeking a declaration that his tax obligations to the irs under the plan had been satisfied.on august,miller moved for summary judgment in his declaratory action.
on october,the bankruptcy court denied miller motion for summary judgment.the bankruptcy court concluded that,while confirmation orders generally constitute res judicata against subsequent appeals from parties who did not contest the order,the general rule was inapposite to the present case.specifically,the court noted that the contract language was ambiguous with regard to the issue of the dischargeability of gap period interest,and res judicata could not bind the parties until that ambiguity was clarified.
since res judicata did not operate to bar the irs from pursuing its appeal,the court proceeded to consider the merits of the underlying claim.the court decreed that any ambiguities in the plan language must be construed against miller both because he was the drafter of the plan,and because the irs could not be deemed to have waived a statutory right in the absence of an unmistakably clear statement indicating its intention to do so.applying that construction to article xi,the court substantively concluded that miller tax debts were nondischargeable under and,and that the gap period interest which accrued on those debts was,by extension,excepted from discharge as well.
on march,miller filed a second motion for summary judgment.he urged the bankruptcy court to heed the reasoning posited by the tenth circuit in united states victor,cir,which concluded that a secured irs claim for a trust fund recovery debt was dischargeable under a now a and a.the irs opposed miller motion,and filed a for summary judgment,urging the court to follow the rationale employed by the eleventh circuit in gust united states in re gust,cir per curiam,which rejected victor in concluding that an irs claim does not become dischargeable by virtue of being secured by a lien.
on may,the bankruptcy court awarded partial summary judgment to the irs.the court was persuaded to follow the reasoning of gust,and reject the holding of victor,in support of its conclusion that the exception to discharge for tax debts articulated in a was not limited to unsecured claims.however,the court scheduled a trial to determine several outstanding issues,including whether parol evidence was admissible to aid in the interpretation of article xi.on december,the court announced its holding that parol evidence was admissible to ascertain the meaning of the ambiguous language of article xi.further,the court declared that the evidence considered,namely the letters exchanged between the irs and miller counsel,confirmed its earlier ruling that article xi could not be interpreted as rendering miller liability for gap period interest dischargeable.
on december,miller appealed the bankruptcy court decision,and the irs elected to have the appeal considered by the district court.on october,the district court filed an opinion in which it confirmed the judgment of the bankruptcy court.the district court considered the interplay of a clarifying that certain types of debts of the kind listed in a are nondischargeable whether or not a claim is filed and a referring to tax debts of the type incurred by miller.in addition,the court adopted the reasoning of gust,concluding that a excepts from discharge tax debts such as the one involved in the instant case.since the language of article xi could be read to support the conclusion that debts were only discharged to the extent permissible under d to a,the district court concluded that the bankruptcy court had correctly resolved the ambiguity of article xi in the irs favor.

plan ambiguity 
res judicata 
miller implores the panel to refuse to consider the government arguments regarding the interpretation of article xi of his chapter plan on the grounds of res judicata.in order to facilitate the bankruptcy code aim of providing a rehabilitating debtor with a fresh start,an order confirming a bankruptcy plan is binding on all parties and all questions that could have been raised pertaining to the plan are entitled to res judicata effect.trulis barton,cir.if a creditor fails to protect its interests by timely objecting to a plan or appealing the confirmation order,the creditor is foreclosed from challenging any of the plan provisions,even if such a provision is inconsistent with the code.great lakes higher educ.pardee in re pardee,cir internal quotation marks omitted.miller contends that the failure of the irs to object to the confirmation of the plan should preclude it from challenging miller obligations under the plan.
although confirmation of a plan generally acts as a final order which binds all parties,regardless of whether they assented to the plan,a plan which is ambiguous as to a material term is subject to interpretation by a reviewing court.a chapter bankruptcy plan is essentially a contract between the debtor and his creditors,and must be interpreted according to the rules governing the interpretation of contracts.hillis motors,haw.auto.dealers ass n,cir.it is a maxim of contractual interpretation that a contract is ambiguous if it is capable of more than one reasonable interpretation.badie bank of,th,d,see also local motion,niescher,cir per curiam the existence of an ambiguity in a contract is a matter of law.an ambiguous term is one susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.citations omitted.where a contract is ambiguous,it is the court task to determine the ultimate construction to be placed on the ambiguous language by applying the standard rules of interpretation in order to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.badie,d at.if indeed article xi is deemed to have been ambiguous,then the principles of res judicata do not operate to bar the government from asserting its position.
miller insists that the language of article xi unambiguously indicates that the intent of the plan was to discharge him from any obligation for gap period interest.the first paragraph of article xi states that,e xcept as otherwise provided in the confirmation order or this plan,all debts,including those for interest accrued on such claims from and after the petition date,are discharged.both miller and the courts below agreed that the first paragraph incontrovertibly was intended to cover debts such as the gap period interest sought by the irs.
however,miller disputes the lower courts reading of the second paragraph of article xi,which states that all debts shall be conclusively deemed released and discharged,as provided in and.at issue is the interpretation of the phrase as provided in.section provides generally for the discharge of debts in a chapter bankruptcy proceeding.section d states that the confirmation of a plan a discharges the debtor from any debt that arose before the date of such confirmation.d a.
however,d sets forth explicit exceptions to the general discharge provision.specifically,it states the confirmation of a plan does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt excepted from discharge under section of this title.id.d.
in support of his interpretation of article xi,miller points to the title of the article discharge and injunction and the article explicit reference to two sections in which debt is discharged outlining the effects of discharge and evidence that the article was intended to operate as a discharge of any obligation to pay the irs gap period interest.
on the other hand,the irs argues that the article was not intended to discharge the irs otherwise nondischargeable claims.the irs points to the facts that article xi was a general provision governing all claims rather than a provision defining the treatment of the irs claims specifically,and the article expressly limits its scope by the e xcept as otherwise provided language,and the reference to the whole of,which includes the enumerated exception in d.
whether to accept the former interpretation,or the latter,depends entirely on how one parses the phrase as provided in.at this stage,we need not resolve that issue,since it is plain that,contrary to miller contention,the interpretation suggested by the irs is a reasonable one.there was no indication that the article reference to was intended to be circumscribed in any manner whatsoever,and the limiting language at the commencement of the article arguably implies that some sort of limitation will be forthcoming.since reasonable minds can differ as to whether as provided in was intended as a mere modifier of discharged,or was rather a more global reference to in its entirety,which indicated that d was the implicit limitation of article xi,that term of the plan is capable of more than one reasonable interpretation.badie,d at.
interpretation of ambiguity 
even though article xi properly is construed as ambiguous,miller nonetheless contends that the courts below erred in construing the ambiguous language against him.the courts below chose to construe the ambiguous language against miller,first,based on the interpretive principle that ambiguous contractual provisions are to be construed against their drafter.under california law,where a contract is ambiguous,the language of a contract should be interpreted most strongly against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist.cal.civ.code.since bankruptcy plans are to be interpreted under the rules governing the interpretation of contracts,hillis motors,at,the courts below were correct to have relied on to conclude that the ambiguity in article xi should be construed against miller.
second,the courts below construed the ambiguous language of article xi against miller on the ground that a plan in which the irs consents to waive its right to collect an arguably nondischargeable tax debt requires a clear,explicit statement to that effect.cathay bank lee,th,d.in cathay bank,the court held that a waiver could be explicit enough to satisfy the clarity burden if it either identified the statutory right being waived by citation,or explained the substance of that right.id.at.the language of article xi does neither of those two things.rather than spelling out in stark terms that the exceptions enumerated in d,which would have preserved the irs claims as nondischargeable debts,were not applicable,or stating unequivocally that otherwise nondischargeable debts are discharged by confirmation of the plan,article xi merely incorporates a general reference to.as such,it is inescapable that the language of article xi is insufficiently clear to warrant overriding the interpretive rule that statutory rights can be waived only by an explicit statement.
in the instant case,article xi of miller chapter plan could plausibly be interpreted to support either his,or the irs position regarding the dischargeability of gap period interest.moreover,the courts below properly concluded that the ambiguity with which they were presented should be construed against miller position.therefore,res judicata does not bar the irs from seeking a judicial resolution of the dispute.
dischargeability of gap period interest 
although the irs is not barred from challenging miller interpretation of article xi by the principles of res judicata,and the ambiguous plan language may be construed against him,miller urges this court to countenance an interpretation in which any obligation to pay gap period interest was discharged by his chapter plan.miller argues that the legislative intent is not readily discernable from the complex interplay among d,a,and a.of course,in interpreting the command of a legislative enactment,the inquiry must begin,and may well end,with the text of the statute itself.patenaude equitable life assurance soc y of the united states,cir i f the statutory language is clear,that is the end of our inquiry.internal quotation marks omitted.section provides generally for the discharge of debts in a chapter bankruptcy section d specifically excepts from discharge those debts enumerated in a.section a,in turn,excepts from discharge any debt for a tax of the kind specified in section a of this title,whether or not a claim for such tax was filed or allowed.a a.section a establishes eighth level priority for allowed unsecured claims of governmental units,including a tax required to be collected or withheld and for which the debtor is liable in whatever capacity,such as a withholding tax required to be collected by an employer.a c.
two courts of appeal which have analyzed the statutory framework have reached diametrically different conclusions regarding its meaning.miller primarily relies on the tenth circuit decision in victor for the proposition that the interplay among a,a,and d compels the conclusion that any irs claim for gap period interest is discharged unless it is an allowed unsecured claim.conversely,the irs relies principally on the eleventh circuit decision in gust in beseeching this court to interpret the statutes to prohibit the discharge of tax obligations such as the one involved in the instant case.the issue of the appropriate interpretation of the statutory
