we have for review the fifth district court of appeal en banc decision in rosado vosilla,so d dca,which certified conflict with the second district court of appeal decision in alwani slocum,so d dca.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.the conflict issue is whether notice to a property owner that the property is scheduled for a tax deed sale,sent in compliance with section,florida statutes,nonetheless violates due process of law when the taxing authority has received a change of address from the property owner but sends the tax sale notice to the owner former address.the property owners in this case,who provided the taxing authority with a change of address,assert that the notice sent to their former address pursuant to section,was constitutionally inadequate to give them the opportunity to take action that could have prevented the sale.we agree that the notice was not reasonably calculated to apprise the owners of the tax deed sale,which is the due process test.for the reasons that follow,we approve rosado and disapprove alwani.
facts and procedural history 
julio and nannette rosado hereinafter collectively referred to as the rosados owned a residence that they lost as a result of unpaid ad valorem taxes.the property is located in altamonte springs,part of seminole county.on may,nonpayment of ad valorem taxes for led the seminole county tax collector to issue a tax certificate for the rosados property on september,the rosados notified the tax collector that they had moved to a new residence located at imperial palm drive in apopka,florida.the rosados also informed the tax collector that they were the owners of the altamonte springs property and requested that any and all correspondence from the tax collector office,pertaining to said property,be sent to the following post office box box,zellwood,fl.further,the rosados informed the tax collector that a legally incapacitated relative and his female caretaker were residing at their altamonte springs residence and that the caretaker did not speak english.
on february,the rosados notified the clerk of court via certified mail that their mailing address had changed to the apopka residence and that their zellwood post office box could be used as a secondary address.the letter was directed to the attention of the property tax department of the court.the clerk of court acknowledged receipt of the rosados letter.although the rosados notified both the tax collector and the clerk of court of their change of address,the rosados address was not updated in the tax assessment roll.
on april,the holder of the tax certificate applied for a tax deed to the rosados altamonte springs property pursuant to section,florida statutes.a tax deed is a deed that is issued to the highest bidder on property sold at a public auction because of nonpayment of ad valorem taxes.sections a and a,florida statutes,require the clerk of court to mail notice of the application for the tax deed to the address of the legal titleholder as listed on the latest tax assessment roll.pursuant to these statutory provisions,the clerk of court mailed notice via certified mail to the rosados at the address listed on the latest tax assessment roll.because the rosados address had not been updated on the tax assessment roll,notification was mailed to the altamonte springs residence.the return receipt was signed by a regina carmona.the rosados did not receive notice of either the application for the tax deed or the date of the proposed tax deed sale.
on december,the altamonte springs residence was sold at a tax deed sale to edward terry.the next day,terry conveyed the property by quitclaim deed to john vosilla,emilio cirelli,kelly scofield,and steve semmelman hereinafter collectively referred to as vosilla.vosilla filed a complaint in the trial court to quiet title to the property.the rosados asserted that because they had previously notified the tax collector and clerk of court of their change of address,the clerk notice was not reasonably calculated under all the circumstances to apprise them of the tax deed sale.rosado,so d at.the rosados further asserted that the inadequate notice denied them due process.at trial,in addition to other evidence,the rosados presented the testimony of the tax deed clerk for the clerk of court,who testified that the sheriff office attempted to post notice of the tax deed sale at the altamonte springs property on november.the tax deed clerk further testified that prior to the tax deed sale,the sheriff office provided written notice to the clerk of court that the rosados no longer resided at the altamonte springs address.the tax deed clerk did not know whether the clerk office employee who was working on the rosados file in november of was aware that the rosados no longer resided at the altamonte springs address.
the trial court found that the failure of the rosados to receive notice was completely the fault of the taxing agencies.nonetheless,the trial court concluded that the notice did not violate the rosados due process rights because the notice was sent in compliance with the statutory requirements.the trial court concluded it was bound by alwani and eurofund,terry,so d dca,both of which held that notice of a tax deed sale that complies with section comports with due process even though the titleholder had sent the taxing authorities notice of a change of address.
on appeal,the fifth district reversed.in its en banc opinion,the fifth district noted that i t is undisputed that the clerk complied with the statutory notice requirements,but questioned whether the notice provided was reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise the rosados of the tax deed sale and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.rosado,so d at quoting mullane central hanover bank trust.the fifth district answered this question in the negative and ruled that the notice provided did not satisfy due process because it was not reasonably calculated to apprise the rosados of the impending tax deed sale where the tax collector knew or should have known that the address listed on the tax assessment roll was incorrect.rosado,so d at.the fifth district receded from its decision in eurofund to the extent it conflicted with its opinion and certified conflict with the second district decision in alwani.see id.at.
the conflict issue is whether notice that complies with section violates the requirements of due process where the taxing authority receives actual notice from the titleholder of a change of address but sends the notice of the tax deed sale to the former address.this issue does not require us to determine whether section is facially constitutional.rather,we are presented with an challenge to the constitutionality of the statute that is,whether section is unconstitutional as applied to the facts of this case we begin our analysis by setting forth the pertinent provisions of chapter,florida statutes,and then discuss the constitutional due process requirements that must be satisfied before a person may be deprived of his or her property.next,we explore case law addressing the effect of a titleholder change of address on the notice requirements of section.finally,we explain why the notice provided in this case did not comport with constitutional due process requirements.
statutory notice requirements applicable to a tax deed sale 
chapter governs tax collections,sales,and liens in this state.section a states that the clerk of the circuit court 
shall notify,by certified mail with return receipt requested or by registered mail if the notice is to be sent outside the continental united states,the persons listed in the tax collector statement pursuant to that an application for a tax deed has been made.such notice shall be mailed at least days prior to the date of sale.if no address is listed in the tax collector statement,then no notice shall be required.
emphasis supplied.section a provides in pertinent part 
the tax collector shall deliver to the clerk of the circuit court a statement that payment has been made for all outstanding certificates or,if the certificate is held by the county,that all appropriate fees have been deposited,and stating that the following persons are to be notified prior to the sale of the property 
a any legal titleholder of record if the address of the owner appears on the record of conveyance of the lands to the owner.however,if the legal titleholder of record is the same as the person to whom the property was assessed on the tax roll for the year in which the property was last assessed,then the notice may only be mailed to the address of the legal titleholder as it appears on the latest assessment roll.
emphasis supplied.
when read together,sections a and a require the clerk to mail a notice of tax deed sale to the legal titleholder at the titleholder address as it appears on the latest assessment roll.delta prop,profile investments,so d.however,section d,florida statutes,states that the failure of anyone to receive notice as provided herein shall not affect the validity of the tax deed issued pursuant to the notice.relying on language from this provision,we have explained that t he failure of anyone to receive notice as provided in section does not affect the validity of the tax deed as long as the clerk complies with the notice requirements of subsection.dawson saada,so d,alteration in original quoting d.stat.
ii.constitutional due process requirements 
the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment require s that deprivation of life,liberty or property by adjudication be preceded by notice and an opportunity for a hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.mullane,at.the fundamental right to have a meaningful opportunity to be heard has little reality or worth unless one is informed that the matter is pending and can choose for himself whether to appear or default,acquiesce or contest.id.at.a landowner whose property is to be sold for delinquent taxes undoubtedly has a vested ownership interest in the subject property and is therefore entitled to notice of a pending tax deed sale.dawson,so d at.
the united states supreme court has explained that to satisfy due process,any notice given must be reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.mullane,at.see also delta prop,so d at quoting mullane dawson,so d at quoting mullane.determining whether a particular method of notice is reasonably calculated to provide adequate notice requires due regard for the practicalities and peculiarities of the case.mullane,at.subject to this limitation,the legislature has the authority to determine the extent and character of the notice which shall be given by the state before property is sold for nonpayment of taxes.dawson,so d at.
in dawson,we addressed whether due process requires strict compliance with section as well as section.section states that i n addition to the notice provided in subsection,the sheriff of the county in which the legal titleholder resides shall,at least days prior to the date of sale,notify the legal titleholder of record of the property on which the tax certificate is outstanding.in dawson,the legal titleholders asserted that the clerk failure to provide proper notice of the location of the tax deed sale and the sheriff failure to serve additional notice pursuant to section rendered the tax deed invalid for lack of due process of law.see so d at.in rejecting the contention that due process requires strict compliance with the notice provisions in both subsections of section,we explained that subsection specifies the mandatory duties of the clerk upon an application for a tax deed and that subsection,which provides for additional notice by the sheriff,is directory only.id.at.therefore,a tax deed may not be set aside for failure to comply with section where the clerk of court satisfies the requirements of section,id.at,which mandat es notice reasonably calculated to apprise landowners of the pending deprivation of their property.id.at.
in dawson,we also considered whether sections and,florida statutes,which specified the defenses available to challenge either a tax deed or a tax deed sale,superseded section.see dawson,so d at neither section nor section listed inadequate notice as an available defense.the court ruled that these statutory provisions did not supersede the notice requirements set out in section,and therefore a legal titleholder could challenge the validity of a tax deed based on a lack of notice.see id.we reasoned that otherwise a tax deed would be valid even without compliance with any of the statutory notice requirements,which would contravene the elementary and fundamental requirement of due process,namely notice to the interested parties.id.second alteration in original quoting mullane,at.
iii.effect of notice by titleholder of change of address 
determining whether the notice sent in compliance with the statutory requirements comports with due process requires us to determine whether the notice was reasonably calculated to apprise the titleholders of the impending tax sale under all the circumstances and with due regard for the practicalities and peculiarities of the case.mullane,at.florida case law in this area reflects two significant scenarios one in which the titleholder fails to provide a valid or updated mailing address,the other in which,as in this case,the titleholder informs the taxing authority of a new mailing address.we address each in turn.
notice of change of address not provided by titleholder 
in evans ireland,so d dca,the statutory notice of application for a tax deed was mailed to the titleholders previous address.the titleholders did not inform the property appraiser of the change of address.id.at.the titleholders were aware that the tax bills were being sent by the property appraiser to their previous address,which was also the address listed on the latest tax assessment roll.in addition,due to clerical error,the property appraiser began mailing the tax bills to the owners of an adjacent parcel,who forwarded the bills to one of the titleholders at his florida address.although aware of the error,the titleholders took no action to change the mistake in the property appraiser address records.id.after correcting the error,and pursuant to section a,the clerk of court mailed notice of the tax deed sale to the titleholders address as listed on the latest tax assessment roll.relying on section d and this court decision in dawson,the second district concluded that because notice was mailed in accordance with the requirements of section,the fact that the titleholders did not receive the notice does not invalidate the tax deed.id.at.
in kidder cirelli,so d dca,the only address provided to the tax collector for the owner of the property was that of the property itself,which was a vacant lot.id.at.as a result,the owner address on the latest tax assessment roll,to which the statutory notice was mailed,was the address for the vacant lot.see id.at.the statutory notice was returned undelivered.see id.at.although the owner conceded that the clerk of court complied with the statutory notice procedure,he asserted that when the undeliverability of the mailed notice to the owner became known to the clerk,due process required that the clerk search for him.id.the fifth district disagreed and reasoned that an owner bears some responsibility for his correct address being on the tax assessment roll.see id.the fifth district explained that n o claim is made that the owner ever took any steps to provide a correct address to taxing authorities or discover why he was not receiving tax bills.a person in the position of the owner has no right to complain that the clerk did not look hard enough for him.id.
the first district recently addressed this issue in bozeman higginbotham,so d dca.there,the clerk of court mailed the statutory notice to the address higginbotham had listed as his address which was also his last known address,as required by section a,florida statutes.id.at.however,the notice was returned to the clerk of court,stamped return to sender attempted not known.id.in rejecting the assertion that the tax deed was invalid,the first district ruled that as long as the clerk of court complies with the requirements of section a,the failure of an owner to receive actual notice does not affect the validity of the tax deed.see id.at.
the common element in these cases is that the titleholder took no action to provide the taxing authorities an updated or accurate address.thus,even though the titleholders did not receive actual notice of the pending tax deed sale,compliance with the statutory requirements led the courts to conclude that no due process violation occurred.unlike evans,kidder,and bozeman,in which the titleholders did not provide a correct or updated mailing address,the certified conflict issue in this case raises a due process concern over the adequacy of section when the titleholder has informed taxing authorities of a change of address prior to the mailing of the statutory notice and the taxing authorities have actual notice of the change of address.on this basis,evans,kidder,and bozeman are distinguishable 
notice of a change of address provided by titleholder 
in alwani,the conflict case,the second district rejected an challenge to the constitutionality of section.see so d at.the titleholders asserted that they did not receive notices of the tax deed sales on their properties because the notices had been sent to their former address in hong kong rather than to their correct address in the united arab emirates.see id.at.the titleholders further claimed that before the notices were mailed,they had notified both the tax collector and the clerk of court of their change of address,but that through error by these agencies the notices were not mailed to their correct address.see id.the second district rejected the titleholders assertion that the tax deeds were invalid for lack of notice.
the second district held that where the clerk of court complies with the requirements of section a,notice of a tax deed sale comports with titleholders due process rights even where the clerk,through error,fails to send the notice to the titleholders correct mailing address.see id.at.in so holding,the second district acknowledged the test articulated in mullane and the subsequent decision of the united states supreme court in mennonite board of missions adams,d,for evaluating whether the notice given satisfies constitutional due process requirements.the second district,however,distinguished both cases by concluding that neither mullane nor mennonite board of missions concerned a lack of notice of the kind involved here to a taxpayer who knows that taxes are unpaid.alwani,so d at.
iv.the vitality of alwani in light of dawson and delta property management 
the second district in alwani viewed the due process requirements of united states supreme court precedent too narrowly.in addition to distinguishing mullane and its progeny,the second district based its decision in alwani on three grounds titleholders have a legal obligation under section,florida statutes,to pay ad valorem taxes before they become delinquent and are aware that there are consequences for their failure to do so lack of notice is not one of the grounds for challenging the validity of a tax deed under section,florida statutes and a requirement that the clerk of court must look beyond the tax collector statement to ascertain the titleholder current address would create an intolerable burden on the clerk and would result in the clerk acting without legal authority.see so d at.through our opinions in dawson and delta property management,both of which were issued after alwani was decided,we have rejected each of the three grounds for the second district decision in alwani.
in dawson,we explicitly rejected the assertion that the duty imposed by section upon owners of real property in florida relieves the state of its obligation to inform interested parties of a tax deed sale.see so d at.relying on the united states supreme court decision in mennonite board of missions,we explained that w hile we agree that all taxpayers are under an obligation to know the status of their property,knowledge of delinquency in the payment of taxes is not equivalent to notice that a tax sale is pending.id.emphasis supplied quoting mennonite bd.of missions,at.in addition,as discussed more fully above,we disagreed with the contention that section superseded section and thereby precluded a titleholder from challenging the validity of a tax deed based on lack of notice.see dawson,so d at.we determined in dawson that although section did not contain an exception for lack of notice,a titleholder may challenge the validity of a tax deed on this ground.see so d at.
we recently rejected the remaining basis underlying alwani when we concluded in delta property management that under certain circumstances,the clerk of court has a duty to go beyond the tax collector statement to ascertain the titleholder correct address prior to mailing notice of a tax deed sale as required by section a.see so d at.in delta property management,this court addressed whether,under chapter of the florida statutes,the clerk of the circuit court must verify the legal titleholder address prior to mailing the notice of the tax deed sale to that titleholder if the tax assessment roll has been or should have been updated after the tax collector provided the clerk with the tax collector statement.so d at.in that case,the clerk of court prepared the statutory notice of the tax deed sale more than three months after the clerk of court received the tax collector statement,specifying the address of the titleholder as a party entitled to notice.see id.at.the titleholder allegedly notified the tax collector of its change of address five months before the tax collector delivered to the clerk of court the statement required by section a.see id.at.the statement did not reflect the change of address.as a result,the tax collector statement listed the titleholder previous address as it was contained in the tax assessment roll.see id.at.
however,by the time the clerk of court prepared and mailed the notice to the titleholder,the latest tax assessment roll was,presumptively,the roll,not the version the tax collector relied upon in preparing the statement under section a.see id.at.because the clerk of court relied solely on the address provided in the tax collector statement without determining whether the roll was available,the titleholder did not receive notice of the tax deed sale.see id.at.we held that based on these circumstances,the 
clerk of the circuit court,when mailing the notice of a tax deed sale to the titleholder of the affected property,must mail the notice to the address of the titleholder as listed in the latest tax assessment roll.if the tax assessment roll is updated after the clerk receives a statement from the tax collector but prior to mailing the notice to the titleholder,the clerk must look at the new assessment roll to see if the titleholder address has changed and,if the clerk finds that the address has changed,the clerk must mail the notice to the new address listed in the latest assessment roll.
id.at.we noted that to hold otherwise would deny a titleholder his or her property without due process of law.see id.at.we explained that w hile the clerk should use the tax collector statement when preparing the tax sale notices,circumstances may warrant some additional action by the clerk because t here could come a point in time when the tax collector statement no longer represents those who are entitled to notice.id.at quoting baron rhett,so d,dca.
notice reasonably calculated to reach the titleholder 
in determining whether the notice given was reasonably calculated under all the circumstances in this case to apprise the titleholders of the tax deed sale,we reject the reasoning in alwani,which rests on flawed premises.instead,we apply the reasoning of delta property management and the united states supreme court recent decision in jones flowers,d.as we explained in delta property management,w hile the clerk should use the tax collector statement when preparing the tax sale notices,circumstances may warrant some additional action by the clerk.so d at.due process requires that the clerk look beyond the tax col
