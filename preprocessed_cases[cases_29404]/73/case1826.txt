due process 
in this court,arangold has abandoned its federal constitutional claims,as well as its illinois equal protection and special legislation claims,choosing to pursue only its illinois due process and uniformity claims.we first address arangold due process arguments.
the act neither involves a suspect classification nor impinges on a fundamental right.accordingly,to comport with due process,it must bear a rational relationship to the public interest sought to be served and the means adopted to accomplish this goal must be reasonable.messenger edgar,russell,at.in applying the rational basis test,a court must identify the public interest that the statute is intended to protect,examine whether the statute bears a reasonable relationship to that interest,and determine whether the method used to protect or further that interest is reasonable.people lindner.rational basis review is limited miller,at,and highly deferential committee for educational rights edgar.as long as there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts showing that the legislation is rational,it must be upheld.people hamm.whether a statute is wise or whether it is the best means to achieve the desired result are matters left to the legislature,not the courts.people shephard.the judgments made by the legislature in crafting a statute are not subject to courtroom fact finding and may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data.cutinello whitley.
defendants argue that the government interest at medical care for the poor in care legitimate and that the general assembly could reasonably have found that tobacco products cause diseases requiring such care.
revenues collected pursuant to the act are used to pay the cost of medical care for those persons unable to bear the cost of such care themselves.the state has a legitimate interest in preserving the health of its citizens new energy of indiana limbach,d,and in assisting the poor to meet their needs carmichael southern coal coke.the general assembly may have believed that the use of tobacco products causes a variety of health problems and that such problems require medical care.with respect to those persons who lack the resources to afford such care,the general assembly may have believed that responsibility to pay rests with the state and that those,such as arangold,whose products impose such costs on the state,should bear some measure of those costs through the taxing of their products.
recognizing that litigants may not challenge the factual underpinnings of the general assembly legislative judgments under due process analysis people ex rel.lumpkin cassidy,arangold challenges the method chosen in the act to fund care for the poor.it argues that the tax imposed by the act is arbitrary and unreasonable because it selectively targets for taxation distributors of cigars and chewing tobacco to fund a general welfare program of the state,designed to benefit a broad range of taxpayers.it principally relies on two cases decided by this court,crocker finley,and boynton kusper.
in crocker,the plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of a fee charged to all petitioners for dissolution of marriage.the fee was assessed in addition to the usual filing fees and,pursuant to statute,was collected to fund shelters and other services for victims of domestic violence.this court invalidated the fee,which,in reality,was a tax,on the basis that it conflicted with the illinois constitutional right to obtain justice by law freely.const,art.i.recognizing that statutes imposing litigation taxes are not necessarily unconstitutional,we determined that court filing fees and taxes may be imposed only for purposes relating to the operation and maintenance of the courts.we found such a requirement to be inherent in the constitutional right to obtain justice freely.if the right to obtain justice freely is to be a meaningful guarantee,it must preclude the legislature from raising general revenue through charges assessed to those who would utilize our courts.crocker,at.we also held the fee violative of due process.focusing on the means chosen by the legislature to fund domestic violence shelters and programs,we noted that these services were available to all adults and their dependents who are the subjects of domestic violence.there was no requirement that recipients of the services be married or divorced,yet the legislature chose to tax dissolution petitioners as a means of funding the programs.doing so caused the members of that class to bear the cost of maintaining this public welfare program,while excluding other classes of taxpayers who would also benefit from the programs.crocker,at.
in boynton,we struck down a similar fee imposed upon those who applied for marriage licenses.the statute required county clerks to pay of the fee collected for issuance of a marriage license into the domestic violence shelter and service fund.the plaintiffs challenged this portion of the license fee as an unconstitutional tax violative of du
