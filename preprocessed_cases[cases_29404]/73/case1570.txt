factual and procedural background 
the county assesses annual real property taxes to the owners of real property in the county,and collects tax payments from real property owners in semiannual installments due on november and the following february.for the second installment,taxes not paid by the end of the statutory grace period on april incur a percent penalty.
the county reciprocal tax accounting cortac program allows lenders or other entities to make bulk payments of real property taxes through a wire transfer to the county bank on behalf of the real property owners who are assessed property tax by the county.as we understand the cortac program,at least one of its uses is to allow lenders to transmit to the county the real property tax payments borrowers remit with their mortgage payments,which the lenders hold in impound accounts until the taxes become due.zc real estate tax solutions ford th,zc real estate tax solutions property owners often are required to and sometimes do so voluntarily pay a portion of their real estate taxes with each monthly mortgage payment.the lender holds these monthly tax payments in an escrow account until it is time to make tax payments to the local taxing authority.
first american provides tax services,including consolidated mass tax payment services,to banks,mortgage companies and other commercial loan servicers.first american services a number of clients in san diego by coordinating their property tax payments to the county through the cortac program.first american acted as the tax service company for clients with respect to the second installment of the fiscal year property taxes in the amount of approximately million owed to the county on different real property parcels.among first american clients was bank of america capital market bank of america,which retained first american as the tax service company to coordinate the payment of property taxes in the amount of to the county through the cortac program for real property parcels owned by a number of different assessees who were bank of america borrowers.
as required by the cortac program,first american sent the county an electronic file identifying the real property parcels for which it would be transmitting second installment property tax payments on behalf of its clients.first american also sent the county a list identifying the amounts of the payments that would be wired for each of its clients,with the amount of listed for its client bank of america.
between april and april,the county received separate wire transfers of the property tax payments for of first american clients.however,first american failed to transmit the payment on behalf of bank of america by the april,payment deadline.according to first american,it failed to transmit bank of america payment by april,because of an internal error in formatting a spreadsheet used in making the wire transfers.because of the formatting error,the amount that it was to transfer for the bank of america payment was inadvertently hidden,and therefore,the payment was overlooked.
when the county had not received a wire transfer of bank of america payment by the close of business on april,it first american to notify it of the missing payment.the next morning,on april,first american wired to the county for the bank of america payment.because the payment arrived after the april,deadline,the county imposed a percent penalty in the amount of as required by section the penalty was imposed as a lien against the real property parcels owned by the bank of america borrowers.
first american then attempted to obtain cancellation of the penalty pursuant to section.that provision states 
any penalty,costs,or other charges resulting from tax delinquency may be canceled by the auditor or the tax collector upon a finding of any of the following 
a failure to make a timely payment is due to reasonable cause and circumstances beyond the taxpayer control,and occurred notwithstanding the exercise of ordinary care in the absence of willful neglect,provided the principal payment for the proper amount of the tax due is made no later than june of the fourth fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the tax became delinquent.
b there was an inadvertent error in the amount of payment made by the taxpayer,provided the principal payment for the proper amount of the tax due is made within days after the notice of shortage is mailed by the tax collector.
c the cancellation was ordered by a local,state,or federal court.
in its first formal step toward seeking cancellation,first american sent a letter to the county collector on april,requesting that the penalty be cancelled under section,subdivision b because of an inadvertent error in the amount of payment made by the taxpayer.on april,first american met with the county to discuss cancellation of the penalty under section,subdivisions a and b.on may,the county chief deputy tax collector notified first american in writing that cancellation was not appropriate because neither subdivision a nor subdivision b was applicable.
first american remitted payment for the penalty under protest on may,by wire transfer it filed a verified claim for refund of the tax penalty with the county board of supervisors on october.the county rejected the claim on december.
on february,first american filed this action against the county to obtain cancellation of the penalty pursuant to section.as first american acknowledges,t he correct procedure to assert a claim in court for cancellation and refund of tax penalties pursuant to section is,admittedly,unclear.therefore,first american filed a pleading containing three alternative procedural approaches a cause of action for refund of tax penalties,a cause of action for declaratory relief,and a petition for a writ of mandate.
the county filed an answer,and the trial court held a bench trial based on stipulated facts,declarations and exhibits,together with the parties trial briefs and argument.
the trial court issued a statement of decision,which included extensive findings of fact and reached several conclusions that are relevant here.
first,the trial court stated that although the legislature did not identify the procedure by which taxpayers may challenge the denial of an application for cancellation of penalties under section,a taxpayer may challenge such a denial either through a petition for a traditional writ of mandate code civ,et or an action for refund brought pursuant to section et.
second,the trial court determined that although first american was not the taxpayer,it had paid the penalty imposed by the county and thus had standing to bring a refund action under section and to file a petition for a writ of mandate as the party beneficially interested.
third,the trial court concluded that first american was entitled to cancellation of the penalty under both subdivisions a and b of section.according to the trial court,although subdivision a of section requires that f ailure to make a timely payment is due to reasonable cause and circumstances beyond the taxpayer control,and occurred notwithstanding the exercise of ordinary care in the absence of willful neglect ibid,those requirements were met because first american error in formatting its spreadsheet occurred notwithstanding its exercise of ordinary business care a failure to accomplish an intended wire payment because of the unintended and erroneous computer spreadsheet customer designation constitutes circumstances beyond the taxpayer control and there was no willful neglect.the trial court also concluded that there had been an inadvertent error in the amount of payment made by the taxpayer as required by subdivision b of section.specifically,it explained that there was an inadvertent error in the amount that first american had transmitted on behalf of its clients.according to the trial court,under the unique procedure of the cortac program,t he inadvertent nonpayment of a portion of the total amount payable by a cortac participant,first american falls within section,subdivision b.
the trial court issued a writ of mandate directing the county to cancel the penalty and refund it to first american with interest calculated pursuant,and it also ordered the same relief pursuant to section et.
the county appeals from the judgment.
discussion 
standard of review 
whether reviewing an order issuing a writ of mandate or a ruling in a tax refund action,our standard of review in this instance is the same we review the trial court findings of fact for substantial evidence,and review its legal conclusions,including its interpretation of statutory provisions,under a de novo standard of review.jackson gourley th,jackson county of los angeles raytheon th,raytheon fujitsu it holdings,franchise tax bd.th.
b.the requirements of subdivision a of section are not satisfied because the late payment was not due to circumstances beyond the taxpayer control 
to be entitled to cancellation of a penalty under subdivision a of section after a late property tax payment,a party must establish that f ailure to make a timely payment is due to reasonable cause and circumstances beyond the taxpayer control,and occurred notwithstanding the exercise of ordinary care in the absence of willful neglect ibid.if the statutory requirements are met,the county must cancel the penalty.strumpfer,supra,th at.
the statutory language contains four separate requirements the delay in payment was due to reasonable cause,was due to circumstances beyond the taxpayer control,occurred notwithstanding the exercise of ordinary care,and occurred in the absence of willful neglect,subd.a.if any of these requirements are missing,first american is not entitled to cancellation of the penalty under subdivision a of section.
as we will explain,we conclude as a matter of statutory interpretation that the clerical error that caused first american to make a late payment on behalf of bank of america borrowers did not constitute circumstances beyond the taxpayer control,subd.a.therefore,first american is not entitled to cancellation of the penalty under section,subdivision a.
as an initial matter,we note that the statutory language refers to circumstances beyond the taxpayer control,subd.a,italics added.first american is not the taxpayer however,the trial court recognized that first american was acting as an agent of the taxpayer in transmitting payment of the taxes assessed against the taxpayers.when we consider whether the delay in payment was due to circumstances beyond the taxpayer control,our inquiry will therefore include whether the delay in payment was due to circumstances beyond the control of the taxpayer agent,first american.zc real estate tax solutions,supra,th at fn.focusing on the actions and policies of the tax services company,not the taxpayer,in determining whether an error by the tax services company causing a delay in real property tax payment was a circumstance beyond the taxpayer control within the meaning of.
it is undisputed that first american failed to timely transmit the tax payment because it made a mistake in formatting a spreadsheet that listed the entities on behalf of which it needed to initiate wire transfers.the line on the spreadsheet listing bank of america was inadvertently formatted so that it was hidden.whether these circumstances are beyond the taxpayer control within the meaning of section,subdivision a is a matter of statutory interpretation,to which we apply a de novo standard of review.jackson,supra,th at raytheon,supra,th at.
the only case to consider the meaning of the term circumstances beyond the taxpayer control in section,subdivision a is zc real estate tax solutions,supra,th.in that case,a tax services company handling the payment of property taxes for its clients made an error in addressing the envelope in which it mailed the tax payments,sending the payment to san francisco instead of to stanislaus county.id.at.when the error was discovered,it was too late to make a timely payment.ibid.the court concluded that the tax services company was not entitled to cancellation of the penalty under section,subdivision a because,among other things,the delinquent payment was not due to circumstances beyond the taxpayer control.zc real estate tax solutions,at.as it explained,the tax services company failure to send the payment to the correct address was clearly within its control,as was its failure to discover its error in a timely manner.ibid.
first american error in formatting its spreadsheet which it used to initiate the wire transfers is very similar to the error in zc real estate tax solutions of misaddressing an envelope.both are clerical errors that were plainly inadvertent,but which were within the parties control and avoidable.in this case,the payment would have been timely if first american would have acted differently in formatting its spreadsheet,in designing its processes for initiating wire transfers or in taking additional steps to confirm wire transfers before the payment deadline.following zc real estate tax solutions,supra,th,we conclude that first american failure to timely transmit the tax payment was not due to a circumstance beyond its control.
first american advocates that we reach a different conclusion,interpreting section,subdivision a as meaning that a circumstance is beyond the taxpayer control anytime that circumstance arose despite the taxpayer exercise of ordinary care in the absence of willful neglect.italics added.thus,according to first american,as long as it exercised ordinary care and was not willfully negligent,we should conclude that the circumstance giving rise to the late payment was beyond its control.in essence,first american wants to read out of section,subdivision a the requirement that the late payment be due to circumstances beyond the taxpayer control and focus solely on the statutory requirements of ordinary care and the absence of willful neglect.ibid.we reject this interpretation of the statute because it fails to give effect to each of its parts.courts should give meaning to every word of a statute if possible,and should avoid a construction making any word surplusage.arnett dal cielo cal th.as we have explained,the statutory language contains four separate requirements,stated in the conjunctive.giving effect only to the requirements of ordinary care and the absence of willful neglect would improperly ignore the statutory language requiring that the late payment be due to a circumstance beyond the taxpayer control.
first american also relies on a different tax provision section,subdivision a b which provides 
if a person failure to make a timely remittance of sales tax reimbursement or use tax is due to a reasonable cause or circumstances beyond the person control,and occurred notwithstanding the exercise of ordinary care and the absence of willful neglect,the person shall be relieved of the penalty imposed by this subdivision.italics added.
as first american points out,section,subdivision b provides the following definition 
reasonable cause or circumstances beyond the person control includes,but is not limited to,any of the following 
a the occurrence of a death or serious illness of the person or the person next of kin that caused the person failure to make a timely remittance.
b the occurrence of an emergency,as defined in section of the government code that caused the person failure to make a timely remittance.
c a natural disaster or other catastrophe directly affecting the business operations of the person that caused the person failure to make a timely remittance.
d the board failed to send returns or other information to the correct address of record,that caused the person failure to make a timely remittance.
e the person failure to make a timely remittance occurred only once over a period,or once during the period in which the person was engaged in business,whichever time
