background 
neither party disputes the facts at issue here,which are as follows.
in,commonwealth entered into a set of power supply contracts the contract with several other utilities,pursuant to which it agreed to build a power plant known as canal unit the plant.the other utilities agreed to purchase all plant output for years from the date of completion.the contract required commonwealth to build a new conventional steam plant with a capability of approximately megawatts.commonwealth was required to use all due diligence in delivering the electricity regularly and without interruption,and promised to operate and maintain the plant in an economical and efficient manner and in accordance with good utility practice and all applicable law.however,the contract did not provide for any specific repair schedules nor mandate the replacement of particular parts.
in and,with the contract still in effect,commonwealth made several repairs and improvements to the plant at an approximate expense of million,including i replacement of the generator rotor,two silica analyzers,a recorder system,welded tubes,burner panels,insulation,air preheater parts,and valves ii addition of two barge mooring dolphins iii addition of a penthouse heating system and iv repairs to the boiler feed pump.after the required commonwealth to capitalize these items rather than deduct them as ordinary and necessary business expenses,commonwealth asserted that the items qualified for the investment tax credit under the transition rules.the issued refunds totaling approximately by check dated july,which was deposited by commonwealth on july.the filed suit on july,claiming that the refunds were granted erroneously.
as a preliminary matter,the district court held that the claim was not because the limitations period did not begin until the date the refund check cleared,on august.see commonwealth energy.at.
the district court found the readily identifiable with language of a ambiguous,and thus examined the legislative history of the supply or service contract provision.the court refused to limit the transition tax credit provision to property explicitly designated in a supply contract,but instead relied on a congressional colloquy for a broader interpretation of a.commonwealth energy,d at.the court held that,at least in the power supply context,that generating is readily identifiable with the written supply contract where the contract specifies the primary energy source and the total generating capacity.id.at.as the contract specified both source and capacity,the district court held principally for appellee commonwealth,only excluding a refund for the mooring dolphins because they were neither generating equipment nor generating property under the contract id.at.
discussion 
statute of limitations 
we begin with the proposition that statutes of limitations when sought to be applied against the government are construed strictly in favor of the government.see,badaracco commissioner,d.b provides that the recovery of an erroneous refund shall be allowed only if such suit is begun within years after the making of such refund here,commonwealth received a refund check on july.the check cleared at the federal reserve bank and payment was authorized by the treasury on august.the government filed its complaint on july.accordingly,the government suggests that the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the treasury has approved payment commonwealth argues that the limitations period runs from the date of receipt and thus the action should have been.
this is a case of first impression in this court,and one that apparently has not been addressed by the supreme court and has only been addressed indirectly by one other court of appeals however,commonwealth points to supreme court dicta suggesting that the appropriate date is the date of receipt.in united states,d,the court ruled against the taxpayer,holding that,as between the date the refund check was mailed and the date of receipt by the taxpayers,the date of receipt would govern.the court did not consider whether the date of payment would govern over the date of receipt.the court noted that the cause of action in question was rooted in the common law claim of assumpsit,and that such an action accrue d upon the receipt of payment.id.at.quoting new bedford lloyd inv.in a much older case,united states wurts,the court held that the forerunner of b ran from the date of payment,rather than from the date which the refund was allowed.see id.at.however,the court said little about what the date of payment was,at least as it bears on the present case.
the ninth circuit has decided the issue,albeit indirectly.in united states carter,cir,the court held that the taxpayer had failed to carry its burden to show that the check had been received before december,which would render untimely the government complaint,filed on december.the taxpayer negotiated the check on december,thus,if the court used the date the check cleared,the government complaint would have been within the period.see id.at.but the court assumed,without elaboration,that the date a refund is made is the date it is received,and did not address the important policies which we have considered in choosing between the date of receipt rule and date of clearance rule.
we agree with the district court conclusion that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until august,at the time the check cleared the federal reserve and payment was authorized by the treasury.first,we note that the court reasoning in wurts rested on the fact that a taxpayer was not entitled to the refund money until the date of payment,as opposed to the date of allowance.the court noted that even after a check was signed and mailed,the commissioner might cancel the payment.id.at.citing daube united states.under and regulations pursuant to it,the government right to cancel payment until treasury authorization is clear.see f nothing in this section limits the authority of the secretary to decline payment of a treasury check after first examination thereof at the treasury.d checks shall be deemed to be paid by the united states treasury only after first examination has been fully completed.
second,because the date of receipt in was sufficient to place the cause of action within the statute of limitations,the court had no need to determine whether a complaint filed as here between two years from the date of receipt and two years from the date would also so fall.however,in supporting its decision despite the greater clarity of a date of mailing rule,the court noted that the date at the very least sets an outer bound,at.using the date here both satisfies the rule that we construe statutes of limitations in favor of the government and provides a certain limitations date by which the government must abide.although the treasury can not know for certain when a check is received by a taxpayer,it can know when that check clears,and determine whether or when to file suit accordingly
