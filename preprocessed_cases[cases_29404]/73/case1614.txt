the california franchise tax board ftb appeals from a judgment ordering a refund to ventas finance i ventas,a limited liability company llc,of,the entire amount it paid pursuant to former revenue and taxation code section for the years,and,and a postjudgment order awarding attorney fees to ventas in the amount of pursuant to code of civil procedure section.
the trial court ordered the refund based upon its conclusion that,as applied to ventas,the levy imposed by former section violated the commerce clause of the united states constitution,cl commerce clause because the levy was based upon total income without apportionment to income attributable to,or derived from,california sources.although at least some of ventas income did derive from california sources,the court ordered ftb to refund the entire amount.
in its postjudgment order awarding attorney fees,the court rejected ftb contention that section is the exclusive means of obtaining fees in a tax refund suit.it further ruled that ventas was the successful party within the meaning of code of civil procedure section,and that ventas met the remaining criteria for an award of fees.in calculating the amount of reasonable fees,the court applied a multiplier to a lodestar figure of.
we shall uphold the trial court determination that former section,as applied to ventas,violates the commerce clause because it is not fairly apportioned,and that the court properly denied ftb request that it judicially reform former section by rewriting it to include an apportionment mechanism.we shall also conclude,however,that neither federal due process nor any principle of california law requires ftb to refund the entire amount ventas paid.the refund should be limited to the amount ventas paid for the years in issue that exceeds the amount it would have been assessed,without violating the commerce clause,using a method of fair apportionment we therefore shall reverse the judgment in part,and remand with directions to redetermine the amount of the refund.in all other respects,we shall affirm the judgment.
we shall also hold that section is not the exclusive means of obtaining attorney fees in a tax refund suit,and that fees may be awarded pursuant to code of civil procedure section,if the criteria specified therein are otherwise established.in light of the partial reversal of the underlying judgment,however,we can not say with certainty that the court would exercise its discretion in the same manner.we therefore shall also reverse the postjudgment order awarding attorney fees,and remand with directions that the court may redetermine eligibility and the amount of reasonable fees in light of our partial reversal of the judgment.
the suit for refund.
ventas was formed in as a limited liability company under the laws of the state of delaware.it is wholly owned by ventas,a delaware real estate investment trust,and was formed to obtain financing secured by certain skilled nursing facilities to which ventas held title.in,ventas owned to facilities,three of which were located in california.ventas had no other property,employees,or representatives working on its behalf in california.
on november,ventas registered as a foreign llc with the california secretary of state,and remained registered through.in,and ventas paid the minimum tax imposed under section.it also paid the following amounts imposed under former section based upon its total income from all sources reportable to this state for the taxable year former,sub.a.in accordance with ftb interpretation of former section,ventas reported its total income from all geographic sources to calculate the amount owed without apportionment to california sources.it was stipulated that if the apportionment methodology california uses for corporations see et were applied,ventas california apportionment percentage would have been only percent,percent and percent,respectively,for these years.
on january,ventas filed a timely claim for refund on the ground that former section contained no method for apportioning the levy to the proportionate amount of income earned,or attributable to economic activity,in california and therefore violates the commerce clause and the due process clause of the united states constitution.on february,and again on march,ftb informed ventas that it had denied the refund claim.although ventas did not file an appeal to the state board of equalization,it did exhaust its administrative remedies for the purpose of filing a suit for refund,and timely filed its complaint seeking a refund.
after a trial based upon stipulated facts,the court held that former section is a tax and,as applied to ventas,violates the commerce clause and due process,because it is based upon all income unapportioned to activities within california.the court refused ftb request to reform former section to add an apportionment mechanism because the legislative history showed that the legislature had considered and rejected including an apportionment mechanism,and neither the statute nor the legislative history contained any indication of the type of apportionment mechanism the legislature would have enacted.the court ordered that ventas was entitled to a refund of the entire amount it paid pursuant to former section,plus interest and costs for the years in issue.ftb filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment.
the motion for attorney fees.
ventas thereafter filed a motion seeking attorney fees pursuant to code of civil procedure sections and,subdivision b.the case was accepted on a contingency fee basis.based upon standard billing rates,the attorney fees actually incurred through november would have totaled.ventas sought million in fees.
this request for a substantial upward adjustment of the lodestar figure was largely predicated upon the theory that this case was the second of two filed by the same attorneys for different plaintiffs that,if upheld,would entitle tens of thousands of llc registered in california to obtain refunds estimated to total as much at billion,and no less than million.
in the first case,northwest energetic services llc franchise tax board super.city and county,no.cgc,the same attorneys who represented ventas had already obtained a judgment ruling that former section was unconstitutional as applied,and an award of million in attorney fees the plaintiff llc in that case,however,did not earn any income that could be sourced to california,and there had been no dispute that it was entitled to a refund of all amounts it had paid.ventas argued the instant litigation was necessary to address ftb position that only those llc that had no income attributable to california sources were entitled to a full refund.in all other cases,ftb maintained that the appropriate remedy was to refund the difference between the amount the llc paid and the amount it would have paid if former section included a fair apportionment mechanism.ventas reasoned that this litigation conclusively resolved issues left unresolved after the northwest trial by establishing that former section could not be judicially reformed,and that any llc who paid the levy is entitled to a full refund.
ftb,on the other had,estimated the amount of potential refunds as a result of the northwest trial and this case was closer to million.ftb based its much smaller estimate on its determination that approximately percent of llc earned all of their income from california sources.it reasoned that,as applied to these llc,former would not violate the commerce clause.ftb argued that the decision following the northwest trial and in this case therefore only applied to percent of registered llc that had no income from california sources,or,like ventas,had income from both inside and outside california.these two categories of llc together paid percent of the levy paid annually under former section.
the court found both estimates to be somewhat speculative,but concluded that the economic benefit secured by this case was at least the million in refunds due to california llcs with activities within and without california.the court relied upon this estimate both as a factor in concluding that the litigation had produced considerable pecuniary benefits for a large class of persons,and as a factor in applying an upward adjustment to the lodestar figure,albeit a much more modest increase than ventas had sought 
in selecting a multiplier of,the court weighed the additional benefits conferred by the litigation,including the preservation of valuable resources,both public and private,and particularly those of the judiciary,by obviating the need for duplicative litigation and the vindication of important constitutional rights under the commerce and due process clauses of the united states constitution,particularly the right to engage in interstate commerce without undue burdens.the court also considered the skill of ventas lead counsel,the fact that compensation was contingent and that no one else in the last years had been prepared to take on this litigation.against these factors,the court weighed the fact that the work involved was not wholly novel because except for the issue of reformation and the related issue of the measure of the refund,this litigation was duplicative or substantially similar to the issues litigated in the northwest trial.
the court applied the multiplier of to the lodestar figure of,to award fees in the amount of.
legislation.
on october,the governor signed into law assembly bill,amending former section for taxable years beginning on and after january,and adding section stats,ch.the amendment changed the language of former section,subdivision a from total income from all sources reportable to this state to total income from all sources derived from or attributable to this state.it also added the following language total income from all sources derived from or attributable to this state shall be determined using the rules for assigning sales under sections and and the regulations thereunder,as modified by regulations under section,other than those provisions that exclude receipts from the sales factor,subd.b b.
assembly bill also added section,which specifies that if the levy under former section is finally adjudged to be unconstitutional,the remedy shall be for the ftb to recompute it only to the extent necessary to remedy the discrimination or unfair apportionment,and refund the difference.
section of assembly bill further provides as follows 
a the legislature is aware of pending litigation challenging the validity of the fee imposed pursuant to section of the revenue and taxation code.
b the amendments made by section of this act to section of the revenue and taxation code,if enacted,shall apply to taxable years beginning on and after january.
c section of the revenue and taxation code,as added by section of this act,shall apply to suits for refunds filed on or after the date of enactment of this act and suits for refunds filed before that date that are not final as of that date.
d refunds of fees payable as a result of the litigation described in subdivision a shall be limited to the amount by which the fee paid,and any interest assessed thereon,exceeds the amount that would have been assessed if the fee had been computed in accordance with subparagraph b of paragraph of subdivision b of section of the revenue and taxation code,as added by the amendments to that section made by section of this act.
e it is the intent of the legislature that no inference be drawn in connection with the amendments made by this act to section of the revenue and taxation code for any taxable year beginning before january.
validity of former section as applied to ventas 
former section was enacted in as part of the limited liability company act llc act which authorized the formation,operation,and regulation of llc within california.the llc act requires any llc that registers with the secretary of state to pay the annual minimum tax set forth in section,and to pay a levy pursuant to former section.subdivision a of former section provides that in addition to the minimum tax,every limited liability company subject to tax under section shall pay annually to this state a fee equal to specified amounts based upon the amount of the total income from all sources reportable to this state for the taxable year.
ftb first asks us to determine whether application of the levy under former section to the income of ventas,wherever earned and without apportionment according to the percentage of business or income attributable to activities within california,violated the commerce clause.we shall conclude that it did,and that former section is unconstitutional as applied to ventas.we therefore need not,and do not,decide whether former section is unconstitutional on its face or whether it violates due process 
the negative or dormant implication of the commerce clause prohibits state taxation citation,or regulation citation,that discriminates against or unduly burdens interstate commerce and thereby imped es free private trade in the national marketplace.general motors tracy,d.state statutes imposing taxes on income earned outside the state,or imposing a tax on total income without apportionment to activities within the state,have long been held to violate the commence clause.see,gwin,henneford.state tax measured by the entire volume of the interstate commerce in which taxpayer participates and not apportioned to its activities within the state violates the commerce clause greyhound lines mealey.tax on gross receipts from transportation violates commerce clause to extent receipts were attributable to activities outside the state.
ftb contends that former section is not a tax,but a regulatory fee,and that as such the appropriate commerce clause analysis is the balancing test outlined in pike bruce church,d pike.ftb asserts that the levy imposed under former section would pass the pike test because the llc act effectuates a legitimate local public interest in promoting a new business form,preventing the flow of business and jobs from the state,and protecting californians who deal with llc the effects of the levy on interstate commerce are only incidental and de minimis because it required ventas to pay during the years in issue only a fraction of one percent of its total income and the local benefits ventas derived from registering with the secretary of state exceed the minimal burden of the levy.
ftb further contends that,even if the levy imposed by former section is a tax,it still does not violate the commerce clause under the test set forth in complete auto transit,brady,d complete auto.specifically,ftb asserts the dispositive question in this case is whether former section satisfies the second prong of the complete auto test,is it fairly apportioned.fair apportionment requires both internal consistency and external consistency.jefferson lines,supra,at.ftb contends that the internal consistency test is inapplicable,and that ventas should have been required to demonstrate that the levy imposed by former section actually adversely impacts interstate commerce more than intrastate commerce.
ftb also contends that the levy imposed by former section is distinguishable from other state taxes found to violate the commerce clause because under the llc act,an llc that registers in california may elect to be taxed as a corporation pursuant to a statutory scheme that does provide a method of apportionment,subd.b.ventas instead elected to be subject to the levy under former section.ftb asserts this election ameliorates the burden imposed on interstate commerce,and constitutes a waiver,or estops ventas from challenging the constitutional validity of former section 
all of the foregoing arguments were carefully considered,thoroughly analyzed,and rejected by division five of this court in northwest,supra,th,d.in that case northwest energetic services northwest,an llc organized under the laws of the state of washington,registered as an llc with the california secretary of state pursuant to corporations code section.it paid the minimum tax imposed under section,but failed to pay an amount imposed under former section,based on an llc total income from all sources reportable to this state for the taxable year.former,subd.a.northwest had no california customers,made no deliveries in california,and had no operations,property,inventory,employees,agents,independent contractors or place of business in california.id.at,d.when ftb notified northwest that it owed for amounts due for tax years,and,northwest paid the and cancelled its registration with the secretary of state.after exhausting its administrative remedies,it filed a suit for refund.the trial court ruled that,as applied to northwest,former section violated the commerce clause,and ordered a refund of the entire amount northwest had paid for the years in issue.id.at,d.
on appeal,ftb raised all the same arguments it does here.division five held that former section is a tax,not a regulatory fee northwest,supra,th at,d,and that it violates the commerce clause under complete auto,supra,because it is not fairly apportioned.northwest,at,d.the court held former section failed the internal consistency test for the following reason i f the levy were replicated in every state,an llc engaging in business in multiple states with the same total income as northwest would pay the maximum levy in every state in which it did business or registered to do business.an llc operating only in one state would pay the maximum levy only once.thus,the levy places a greater burden on interstate commerce than intrastate commerce.id.at,d.
the court rejected ftb argument that the internal consistency test was inapplicable and that northwest had to demonstrate by some other means that the tax burdens interstate commerce.it explained that the case upon which ftb relied,american trucking,michigan pub.serv.com,d american trucking,was distinguishable.northwest,supra,th at,d.the michigan fee in american trucking was a flat fee,which does not seek to tax a share of interstate transactions,which focuses upon local activity,and which is assessed evenhandedly.citation.here,by contrast,the levy is not a flat fee imposed on all llc for the privilege of doing business locally in california,but a percentage of the llc total worldwide income,which therefore does tax a share of interstate transactions.moreover,the court in american trucking did not reject the internal consistency requirement altogether.instead,it found no commerce clause violation notwithstanding the absence of internal consistency,because the petitioners would incur intrastate local fees in multiple states only by engaging in local business in those states.here,by contrast,an llc incurs the levy based on its total worldwide income merely by registering with the state,even if it does no business there.northwest,at,d.
the court further observed that,as is also the case here,ftb advanced no argument addressing external consistency.northwest,supra,th at,d.the court concluded that the levy imposed by former section also failed the external consistency test b ecause the levy is measured by the llc total income wherever earned,and not just what is earned in california,and thus the levy reaches beyond that portion of value that is fairly attributable to economic activity within the taxing state,quoting jefferson lines,supra,at.
finally,the court rejected ftb voluntary choice arguments based upon the fact that northwest could have elected to be taxed as a corporation,a statutory scheme that,unlike former section,provided a method for apportionment and thereby avoided taxation under former section.the court declined to characterize northwest decision as consent to be taxed on all income without apportionment,or as a voluntary choice,because an election to be taxed as a corporation rather than as a passthrough llc would have more dramatic consequences.among other things,such an election would require northwest to make the same election with the internal revenue service,thus changing the manner in which northwest and its members would be taxed at the federal level,with likely similar changes in all the other states in which northwest did business.avoiding the aspect of a corporation by which the entity is taxed on profits and its members on distributions is one of the hallmark benefits of an llc.indeed,in passing the llc act,our legislature recognized this facet of llc as one of the major reasons for such interest in llc in the first place.the ftb now would have llc surrender this advantage not only in california,but in all other states in which the llc pays taxes and on its federal tax returns as well,simply so california can impose a tax based on income generated outside of california.the idea that this could somehow ameliorate the burdens on interstate commerce,or insulate the levy from scrutiny under the commerce clause altogether,is simply untenable.nor do we think that llc which our legislature wanted to attract to california in passing the llc be forced to endure an unconstitutional assessment merely because they proceeded under the auspices of a california statute former.northwest,supra,th at,d.
the court concluded that,as applied to northwest,former section violated the commerce clause and that northwest,which conducted no business in california,is entitled to a refund of the amounts it paid under former section.the ftb agreed in northwest that the refund should be of the entire amount the llc had paid for the years in issue because none of its total income derived from california sources.northwest,supra,th at fn,d.we find the reasoning in northwest persuasive,adopt it as our own,and conclude that,as applied to ventas,former section violates the commerce clause to the extent that it fails to provide a method of fair apportionment.
ftb next raises two issues concerning the appropriate remedy that were not raised in northwest,supra,th,d,because the llc in that case did not conduct any business in california,and ftb did not dispute that northwest was entitled to a refund of the entire amount it paid for the years in issue.in this case,ventas conducted at least a portion of its business in california.therefore,ventas could have been required to pay a portion of the levy without violating the commerce clause had former section included a method of fair apportionment.the parties stipulated that if the apportionment methodology california uses for corporations et were applied,ventas california apportionment percentage would have been percent,percent and percent,respectively,for the years in issue.
in light of the foregoing facts,ftb argues that instead of ordering a refund of the entire amount of tax ventas paid for the years in issue,the court should either judicially reform former section to preserve it against constitutional invalidity and apply it as reformed to ventas or limit the amount of the refund in this case to the difference between the amount ventas actually paid and the amount ventas could have been taxed without violating the commerce clause using a method of fair apportionment.ftb asserts that the amount ventas could have been taxed for the contested years using a method of fair apportionment can easily be determined by using the allocation and apportionment provisions of the uniform division of income for tax purposes act set forth in sections to and the applicable regulations.the parties have already stipulated that ventas california apportionment percentage would have been percent,percent and percent,respectively,for the years in issue.ftb further contends that this measure of the refund is,in any event,now mandated by the new section added by assembly bill.section specifies that if the levy under former section is finally adjudged to be unconstitutional,the remedy in any suit for refund that is not final shall be to recompute the tax in accordance with the apportionment methodology added to former section by assembly bill,and refund the difference.
ventas contends that the judicial reformation ftb proposes is not an appropriate remedy because it is inconsistent with the legislative intent at the time former section was enacted.it further contends that when a state tax violates the commerce clause because it is not fairly apportioned,the state must refund the entire amount paid,even if a portion of the tax could have been collected without violating the commerce clause using a method of fair apportionment.ventas further contends that the statutory changes enacted by assembly bill are either invalid or inapplicable to this case because the changes constitute a new tax,and as such had to be approved by a vote,pursuant to california constitution,article xiii,section.since it was not,ventas asserts the changes made by assembly bill are ineffective and invalid.application of to any suit for refund that was not final as of the date of enactment is a retroactive application of the law that violates due process.
we shall conclude that ftb fails to establish the limited conditions that would support exercise of the power of judicial reformation,and shall decline to reform former section in the manner ftb suggests.we,however,also conclude that a refund of the entire amount ventas paid pursuant to former section is not compelled by the due process clause,or by any principle of state law.a refund of the difference between the amount ventas paid and the amount it would have paid based upon income derived from or attributable to california sources,using a method of fair apportionment,would fully cure the commerce clause violation.this remedy does not place an unreasonable burden on ventas because the parties have already agreed what ventas california apportionment percentage would have been for the years in issue,if this apportionment methodology were used.we shall therefore reverse and remand to the trial court for further proceedings to determine the amount of the refund.in light of this disposition,we need not reach the question whether application of the changes made by assembly bill after the judgment in this case was entered would violate the due process clause.
reformation.
ftb argues that former section can and should be judicially reformed to cure the constitutional invalidity by requiring an llc income be sourced to california using the allocation and apportionment provisions of the uniform division of income for tax purposes act set forth in sections to.it urges this court to judicially reform former section to so provide.the proposed reformation would essentially rewrite former section in accordance with the changes added by assembly bill.
a court may,rewrite a statute in order to preserve it against invalidation under the constitution,when we can say with confidence that i it is possible to reform the statute in a manner that closely effectuates policy judgments clearly articulated by the enacting body,and ii the enacting body would have preferred the reformed construction to invalidation of the statute.ceridian franchise tax bd.th,d ceridian.by applying these factors,courts may steer clear of judicial policymaking in the guise of statutory reformation,and thereby avoid encroaching on the legislative function in violation of the separation of powers doctrine.kopp fair pol.practices com.cal th,d,kopp.the power of judicial reformation has typically been exercised in three categories of cases i cases concerning procedural safeguards required by the first amendment principles of procedural due process ii cases concerning classifications underinclusive under the equal protection clause and iii cases concerning otherwise vague or overbroad criminal statutes.id.at,d.
in the context of cases involving tax statutes that violate the commerce clause,the courts have consistently declined to exercise the power of judicial reformation to cure the constitutional violation.for example,in ceridian,the court declined ftb request that it judicially reform a tax provision that violated the commerce clause by,among other things,allowing a deduction for insurance subsidiary dividends only to corporations domiciled in california.ftb suggested the court could reform the challenged statute by rewriting it also to allow corporations to take the deduction.the court explained that the suggested reformation was not appropriate because the plain language of the deduction provision stated that it applies only to corporations commercially domiciled in california.ceridian,supra,th at,d.since the provision was clear and unambiguous on its face,it could not be rewritten based upon divination of some contrary legislative intent from other sources.ibid.the court further noted that even if it could reform the provisions to expand the availability of the deduction,t he deductions thus more broadly allowed would still be calculated in accordance with a formula that we have determined violates the commerce clause.as ftb recognizes,attempting to rewrite subdivision b would involve us in precisely the type of judicial policymaking and encroachment on the legislative function in violation of the separation of powers doctrine,against which the kopp court warned.citation.thus,reformation is not possible in this case.id.at,d.
similarly,in city of modesto national,th,d city of modesto,a city filed suit to recover a tax deficiency assessed under a municipal license tax.the trial court held the license tax was not fairly apportioned to reflect the percentage of the business actually taking place within the taxing jurisdiction as required under the california constitution.id.at,d.the city amended the ordinance to include an apportionment mechanism,and asked the court of appeal to judicially reform the original ordinance in a similar manner.the court declined to do so.it explained t he original ordinance was adopted in.thus,it is not possible to divine the intent of that enacting body.further,reforming the ordinance to comply with constitutional mandates requires adding a substantive change to the law.such judicial policymaking and encroachment on the legislative function is improper.id.at,d.
nonetheless,ftb asserts that judicial reformation of former section is possible,without encroaching upon the legislative function,because the phrase reportable to this state as used in former section is,at least arguably,susceptible to the interpretation that it describes only total income from all sources derived from or attributable to this state.therefore,ftb reasons,the proposed reformation is not necessarily at odds with the plain language of former section,and would be consistent with the legislative policy judgment underlying this legislation.ftb further suggests that if the legislature knew that an unapportioned llc tax would be declared unconstitutional,the legislature would certainly have chosen to include an apportionment mechanism,because collection of some revenue would always be preferable to none.
we can not say with confidence that the proposed reformation would be consistent with the legislative policy judgment underlying former section,because the legislative history reflects that the legislature actually considered,and rejected,a version including precisely the language the ftb now suggests.this rejected version based the tax imposed on gross receipts derived from or attributable to sources within this state.ibid.as the court in northwest observed,it is not clear why this language was changed,but g iven the legislative desire to maintain revenue neutrality,a reasonable inference is that legislators were concerned that the revenue generated from a fee based only on receipts derived from or attributable to sources within this state would not be sufficient.in other words,california would lose money unless the fee was imposed on business.northwest,supra,th at,fn,d.ftb does not suggest an alternate explanation for the deletion of this language from the final version of former section that would allow us to conclude ftb proposed reformation closely effectuates policy judgments clearly articulated by the enacting body kopp,supra,cal th at at,d,at the time former section was enacted the remedy of judicial reformation is improper when the suggested reformation is inconsistent with the legislature intent,or when that intent can not be ascertained.kopp,at,d.
measure of refund.
ftb alternatively contends that the court erred by requiring it to refund the entire amount ventas paid pursuant to former section for the years in issue.it argues that no principle of federal due process or of state law compels it to refund the entire amount ventas paid for the years in issue.instead,ftb argues that ventas is only entitled to a refund of the difference between the amount it paid pursuant to former section and the portion that could have been collected consistent with the dictates of the commerce clause by apportioning the tax to income derived from or attributable to california sources.ventas,on the other hand,asserts that in mckesson florida alcohol tobacco div,d mckesson,the court held that when a state tax violates the commerce clause because it is not fairly apportioned the only remedy consistent with federal due process is to refund the entire amount.
the appropriate remedy for collection of a tax in violation of the commerce clause is,in the first instance,a matter left to the state so long as the remedy it affords comports with federal due process.mckesson,supra,at,fn.in mckesson,a licensed wholesale distributor of alcoholic beverages filed a tax refund suit challenging florida liquor excise tax scheme on the ground that it discriminated against interstate commerce by giving special rate reductions for beverages that were manufactured from products grown in florida.id.at.the florida courts granted injunctive and declaratory relief enjoining future enforcement of the preferential rate reductions,thereby leaving all distributors subject to the liquor tax nonpreferred rates,but denied mckesson claim for a refund of at least the difference between the disfavored product tax rate and the favored product tax rate.id.at.
the issue before the court in mckesson,supra.was not the measure of the refund,but rather whether due process required the state to provide any refund at all,or whether the state could remediate collection of tax in violation of the commerce clause retrospectively by other means,such as retroactive assessments upon taxpayers who had received preferential treatment.the court held that when a state requires a taxpayer to pay taxes first and raise objections to the tax in a postdeprivation refund action,the state must provide taxpayers with,not only a fair opportunity to challenge the accuracy and legal validity of their tax obligation,but also a clear and certain remedy,citation for any erroneous or unlawful tax collection to ensure that the opportunity to contest the tax is a meaningful one.id.at,fn.omitted.the court held the remedy must include some form of retrospective relief,but does not necessarily require that the state provide a refund.
the court explained that where the tax is not invalid in its entirety,but,as in the case before it,was unconstitutional only insofar as it operated in a manner that discriminated against interstate commerce,the state retains flexibility in responding to this determination.florida may reformulate and enforce the liquor tax during the contested tax period in any way that treats petitioner and its competitors in a manner consistent with the dictates of the commerce clause.having done so,the state may retain the tax appropriately levied upon petitioner pursuant to this reformulated scheme because this retention would deprive petitioner of its property pursuant to a tax scheme that is valid under the commerce clause.mckesson,supra,at.therefore,the court held that florida could,consistent with due process,provide a remedy for the commerce clause violation of the excise tax in several ways.it could refund to the taxpayer the difference between the tax it paid and the tax it would have been assessed were it extended the same rate reductions that its competitors actually received,assess and collect back taxes from petitioner competitors who benefited from the rate reductions during the contested tax period,calibrating the retroactive assessment to create in hindsight a nondiscriminatory scheme,or fashion a remedy consisting of a partial refund to petitioner and a partial retroactive assessment of tax increases on favored competitors,so long as the resultant tax actually assessed during the contested tax period reflects a scheme that does not discriminate against interstate commerce.id.at.
ventas argues that mckesson,supra.further held that,in contrast to a tax that is discriminatory,where,as here,the tax violates the commerce clause because it is not fairly apportioned,the state has no choice id.at.but to refund the entire amount of taxes paid,even if it is possible to calculate with reasonable certainty the amount the taxpayer would have paid for the years in question if the tax had been fairly apportioned,without placing an undue burden on the taxpayer 
ventas argument is based upon a misreading of the discussion in mckesson,supra.contrasting the range of remedies a state may offer when a state tax violates the commerce clause by,for example,taxing intrastate commerce at preferential rates,versus the more limited range of relief that could be offered to redress the collection of a state tax that violates the commerce clause because it is not fairly apportioned.in the course of determining whether the state was required to provide any refund at all,as opposed to some other form of retrospective relief,the court did draw a distinction between taxes that are beyond the state power to impose,and a tax such as the one before it that was unconstitutional only insofar as it operated in a manner that discriminated against interstate commerce.mckesson,supra,at.in the former circumstance,the court stated the state would have had no choice but to undo the unlawful deprivation by refunding the tax previously paid under duress.ibid.the clearest example the court gave of such a tax was the collection of a tax on indian lands that are immune from state taxation.id.at.the state could not reformulate such a tax to cure its invalidity and enforce it as reformulated during the contested period because the object of the tax,indian lands,was absolutely immune regardless of how the tax might be formulated.therefore,in such a case,the state would have no alternative remedy but to refund the tax.the court did also cite atchison,invalidating a franchise tax most of which was apportioned to business conducted wholly outside the state mckesson,at,as another example where the only remedial option is a refund.when a tax unduly burdens interstate commerce due to lack of apportionment,an alternative remedy,such as retroactive assessments upon other taxpayers in lieu of a refund,would not cure that type of commerce clause violation.the court point,however,was simply that some type of refund would be the only remedy in such a case.it did not discuss what the measure of the refund should be,and certainly did not hold,or even imply,that a state would be required to provide a refund of the entire amount collected under such a state tax provision,even if the state could have collected some portion of the tax for the years in issue using a method of fair apportionment without violating the commerce clause.to the contrary,earlier in the opinion,when summarizing the holding in,the court stated that the railroad company was entitled to a refund of the portion of the tax imposed on activity.mckesson,at,italics added.thus,to the extent that the court made any reference at all to the measure of the refund,the court implied that the state was required to refund only the portion that could not be imposed without violating the commerce clause in any event,it certainly did not create any kind of categorical rule concerning the measure of a refund when a state tax violates the commerce clause because it is not fairly apportioned.
we conclude that,although mckesson,supra,d does hold that when a tax violates the commerce clause because it is not fairly apportioned,a refund is the appropriate remedy,it does not support ventas assertion that the refund must be of the entire amount paid.mckesson held only that when a tax violates the commerce clause because it is not fairly apportioned,the state has no choice but to provide a refund because the commerce clause violation can not be cured by other means such as a retroactive assessments against those who were taxed at preferential rates.it did not,however,specify the measure of the refund that must be provided when a tax violates the commerce clause because it is not fairly apportioned.
we therefore look to several california decisions that have addressed the question of the appropriate measure of a refund in a tax refund suit when the tax collected is found to violate the commerce clause,or equivalent provisions under the state constitution 
in general motors city and county of san francisco th,d general motors,this court held that general motors was entitled to a refund of all taxes it had paid under a municipal ordinance that discriminated against general motors and other manufacturers because manufacturers would be subject to only one tax upon gross receipts from the sale of goods whereas manufacturers would be subject to two tax upon the portion of gross receipts attributable to selling activity within the city,and any tax upon gross receipts imposed by another municipality where the seller manufactures its goods.id.at,d,d.our determination that general motors was entitled to a full refund was not,however,based upon categorizing the tax as violating the commerce clause because it was discriminatory or unapportioned.instead,we analyzed whether the specific remedy proposed by the city in lieu of a full refund satisfied the due process parameters for postdeprivation relief outlined in mckesson,supra,d.the city proposed to refund all selling taxes general motors could prove it had paid on goods upon which another city had also assessed a manufacturing tax.we held that the proposed remedy failed substantively to cure the commerce clause violation because,among other reasons,it did not fully eliminate the discrimination suffered by general motors because it would still be paying a selling tax to san francisco while local manufacturers pay a manufacturing tax.general motors,at,d.moreover,procedurally the proposed remedy was less than the clear and certain relief mckesson requires,because it placed the burden on the taxpayer to demonstrate double taxation had actually occurred.moreover,to meet this burden,general motors would have been required to produce documentation from years ago that it was otherwise never required to maintain.general motors,at,d.on those facts,we concluded the alternative remedy proposed by the city would not provide clear and certain relief,because it imposed an unreasonable burden of proof upon the taxpayer rendering the proffered remedy inadequate.absent a reasonable,clear,and certain method of determining the amount of tax the city could have collected without violating the state and federal commerce provision and deducting that from the total amount of tax collected,we held the city was required to refund the entire tax payment general motors had made under the challenged tax provision.id.at.
in macy stores,city and county of san francisco th,d macy,division three of this court addressed the question whether mckesson,supra,d or any principle of state law compelled the city to refund all of the business taxes macy had paid under a municipal tax scheme found to violate state and federal commerce clause provisions.the challenged tax required a business operating in san francisco to calculate its tax liability based upon its payroll expense,and again based upon gross receipts,and then to pay whichever amount was greater.macy,at,d.it was undisputed on appeal that the tax failed the internal consistency test because it could hypothetically discriminate against intercity taxpayers,who might be subject to tax under a payroll expense measure in one jurisdiction and under a gross receipts measure in another,unlike a local taxpayer,who would pay tax only to san francisco under only one measure.macy,at,d.the trial court had concluded that this court decision in general motors,supra,th,d compelled it to order a refund of the entire amount macy had paid for the contested years,and the city appealed.macy,at,d.
the court of appeal reversed.it held that the remedy the city proposed,consisting of a partial refund in an amount sufficient to remedy the hypothetical discrimination,effectively placed macy in the same position as a local taxpayer,and that no principle of due process or state law required that the city instead refund the entire amount macy had paid.macy,supra,th at,d.division three correctly stated that this court decision in general motors,supra,th,d did not establish a categorical rule that the only remedy is to provide a full refund macy,at,d.an expert had calculated that macy would have paid percent more than a hypothetical taxpayer with only local business,and macy did not dispute this estimate.id.at,fn,d,d.it therefore was possible to use the estimate to calculate the amount of tax macy had been required to pay that a hypothetical local taxpayer would not have had to pay,without placing the burden upon macy to prove this amount,or to come forward with documentation in support of its refund claim that it would not otherwise have had reason to keep.division three distinguished this court holding in general motors on these grounds.macy,at,d.division three observed,t here is no claim here that the city proposed remedy is deficient because it is uncertain or would not eliminate the discriminatory effect of the challenged tax,by placing macy in the same position as a local taxpayer.id.at,d.the court also rejected the argument that a full refund was required on the ground that the challenged tax provision was void,and therefore of no force and effect.id.at,d.nor was a full refund compelled by article xiii,section of the california constitution,because that section merely recognizes the taxpayer right to refund of an illegal tax,as a corollary to the prohibition against enjoining the collection of any tax,but it does not address the proper measure of refund.id.at,d.
the court concluded that the measure of the refund the city proposed satisfied all the state and federal requirements of due process.macy is entitled to be placed in a position equivalent to that occupied by local taxpaying businesses so it will have paid a valid measure of taxes.citation.in this way,the city may limit macy tax refund to the amount necessary to remedy any discrimination from the city former tandem tax.citation.macy is not entitled to a full refund of all business taxes paid between and.such a refund would place macy in a more favorable position than a local taxpayer during the same period.macy,supra,th at,d.
finally,in city of modesto,the court indirectly addressed some of these same due process principles,in a procedurally different context,when it declined to judicially reform a municipal tax ordinance to include a method of fair apportionment.the ordinance had been amended to cure the constitutional invalidity by adding a method of fair apportionment,but the court had found that the amendments applied prospectively only.the court explained that due process concerns were among its reasons for declining to judicially reform the ordinance to include a fair apportionment mechanism like the one added by the amendments although here the disputed tax has not yet been collected,the amended ordinance places the burden on the taxpayer to prove which gross receipts should be excluded based on activities.thus,if we were to retroactively validate the tax by applying the apportionment provisions,we would be requiring the taxpayer to produce documentation from up to nine years ago that it otherwise was never required to maintain.if the taxpayer were unable to document its claimed activities,the assessed deficiency would remain the same as it was under the unconstitutional tax.this is not a clear and certain remedy but,rather,places an unreasonable and unfair burden on the taxpayer.city of modesto,supra,th at,d.
due process concerns similar to those identified in general motors,supra,th,d and city of modesto,supra,th,d do not exist with respect to ftb proposed remedy in this case.ventas does not contend that the partial refund proposed by ftb would not substantively redress the commerce clause violation.ftb proposes only to retain that portion of the levy under former section that may be fairly apportioned to ventas activity,and to refund the balance that would represent the amount collected in violation of the commerce clause.using ftb measure of the refund does not create any proced
