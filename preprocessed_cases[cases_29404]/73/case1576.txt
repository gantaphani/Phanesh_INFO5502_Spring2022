this court has repeatedly recognized that money is the lifeblood of modern government.money comes primarily from taxes,and,as the importance of a predictable income stream from taxes has grown,governments at all levels have established procedures to minimize disruptions that would interfere with essential public operations.batt city and county of san francisco th,batt flying dutchman park,city and county of san francisco th,flying dutchman helms bakeries bd.equalization d.this principle is of sufficient magnitude to warrant a constitutional prohibition on any legal or equitable process to prevent or enjoin the collection of any tax cal,art.xiii,article xiii,section,reinforced by numerous statutes to the same effect.in daar alvord d,the court of appeal held that an action aimed at challenging and halting the collection of a local property tax would not evade these prohibitions by being framed as one intended to prevent governmental waste under code of civil procedure section section.
in,the voters of san francisco amended the existing municipal payroll tax in a manner one,not incidentally,was not subject to the unlawful for a number of reasons.he filed a complaint for declaratory relief that the amending measure was invalid,and sought an injunction preventing the expenditure of taxpayer monies in implementing,applying or enforcing the measure.following daar,the trial court concluded that the taxpayer lacked standing to challenge the measure,and dismissed the complaint.
although we do not agree that daar is controlling,we do agree with the trial court ultimate conclusion.the crucial point distinguishing daar is the existence of a state statute expressly prohibiting interference with the collection of a real property tax in language virtually identical to article xiii,section.there is no state statute immunizing a municipal payroll tax from challenge,so daar is not dispositive.on the other hand,we conclude that a number of authorities purportedly holding that a taxpayer action under section may be used to challenge the validity of a taxing statute do not actually decide that point.
after a full and fresh reexamination of the issue,we believe there are weighty policy reasons why no california taxpayer plaintiff has ever been permitted to halt implementation of a local tax.the hostility to the interruption of local tax which article xiii,section is but one back to the century.there are legitimate concerns for limiting the ability of persons not required to pay a tax themselves to challenge the validity of that tax,particularly when they would enjoy a more advantageous position than given to persons actually required to pay the it.and the most obvious negative consequence of allowing legal challenges by persons lacking a direct financial interest in the operation of a tax is the unacceptable risk of paralyzing the financial stability of local governments with a flood of lawsuits.in light of our analysis,we agree with the trial court ultimate conclusion that plaintiff lacked standing.we thus affirm the judgment of dismissal.
background 
in,the city and county of san francisco city enacted a payroll expense tax ordinance payroll tax.bus.tax,et it imposed a tax one and percent upon every person engaging in business within the city.the scope of the tax on payroll expense applied to compensation paid to,on behalf of,or for the benefit of an individual,including salaries,wages,bonuses,commissions,property issued or transferred in exchange for the performance of services and any other form of compensation,who,during any tax year,performs or renders services,in whole or in part in the city,a.
in,the city voters enacted proposition k,which extended the payroll tax to entities,which were defined as including a trust,partnership,corporation described in subchapter s of the internal revenue code of,limited liability company,limited liability partnership,professional corporation,and any other person or entity which is not subject to the income tax imposed by subtitle a,chapter of the internal revenue code of,or which is allowed a deduction in computing such tax for distributions to the owners or beneficiaries of such person or entity.bus.tax.
although the details are not entirely clear from the record,it appears that questions as to the correct scope of proposition k application led the city board of supervisors in to propose another ballot proposition to clarify the reach of the payroll tax.although the primary purpose of the measure appears to have been to raise the small business exemption to the payroll tax,another goal was to settle the question of the scope of the coverage.purporting to amend two provisions,bus.tax,and,the import of proposition q was explained to voters by the city controller as follows some types of corporations compensate their partners by paying them a share of the firm annual profits in addition to any salary paid for services rendered.currently,the city payroll tax is not paid on these profits.the proposed ordinance would require the payroll tax to be paid on all partner compensation,excluding returns on investment,and would result in additional gross annual tax revenue of million.the businesses that would be affected are typically law,accounting,medical,and other types of professional corporations.proposition q was adopted by the voters on november.
on december,plaintiff john chiatello filed a verified complaint challenging the proposition q change to the payroll tax as applied to entities.identifying himself as a resident of the city who owns real property located within the city and pays property taxes,plaintiff stated the aim of his complaint as follows enforcement by the city of the invalid and illegal provisions of proposition q will result in wasteful expenditures of taxpayer monies.code of civil procedure section provides a cause of action to taxpayers such as plaintiff to prevent wasteful expenditures of taxes in this manner.thus,by this action,plaintiff seeks a declaration that the city may not enforce proposition q to tax distributions of profits to owners of entities.
in his single cause of for taxpayer action to prevent declaratory plaintiff alleged that proposition q amendments were not effective because the city misled the electorate in its description of proposition q in that proposition q did not amend a key provision governing the tax base for associations,to wit san francisco business and tax regulations code section continues to provide explicitly that distribution of ownership profit or loss is not included within a partnership payroll expense tax base.
plaintiff had additional reasons for assailing the taxation provisions of proposition q.as he alleged at length,distributions of profits by a partnership are not compensation for services.taxation of profit distributions was also invalid because it was prohibited by revenue and taxation code section,which forbids local government from imposing an income tax.finally,plaintiff alleged that proposition q was invalid because it violates the single subject rule in the city charter.
plaintiff alleged that declaratory relief declaring the invalidity of proposition q is necessary to prevent the actual and threatened expenditure of taxpayer monies in implementing and applying these invalid and unlawful provisions,including but not limited to the development of new forms and procedures for submitting and processing such returns,the creation of website materials addressing the changes to the payroll expense tax,the training of staff to handle returns and issues under these new provisions,and the costs of enforcement as taxpayers attempt to comply with the law.the expenditure of these funds is a waste of taxpayer monies and requires immediate adjudication of the legality of proposition plaintiff prayed for a declaratory judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure section determining that any expenditure of taxpayer monies to implement,apply or enforce proposition q to be a waste of taxpayer monies,prohibited by state law,and enacted in violation of the city single subject rule in addition,plaintiff also prayed for issuance of a judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure section restraining and preventing the expenditure of taxpayer monies in implementing,applying or enforcing proposition 
the city interposed a general demurrer to the complaint.in addition to arguing that proposition q was validly drafted and adopted,the city maintained that plaintiff lacks standing to challenge san francisco payroll expense tax.citing daar alvord,supra,d,the city explained that in tax disputes,the rule is pay first,litigate later,precluding injunctive or declaratory relief,and plaintiff may not invoke section to subvert the pay first rule.
in his opposition to the demurrer,plaintiff cited a number of decisions as authority that he did have standing to press his claim based on section.plaintiff argued that the pay first principle did not apply to him because he is not subject to the payroll expense tax,and thus had no obligation to pay anything,so it would be a logical absurdity to require him to comply with refund procedures before being allowed to challenge proposition plaintiff further argued that proposition q is void for lack of voter approval as required by state proposition cal,art.xiiic,b.plaintiff acknowledged in a footnote that the city may point out that plaintiff complaint does not include an explicit cause of action under proposition.however,the underlying facts are all encompassed within the complaint,and the demurrer can not be sustained on that basis.rather,plaintiff must be allowed to amend the complaint to provide greater clarity regarding this valid claim.
the trial court conducted two hearings.the first was largely devoted to the issue of whether plaintiff had standing to prosecute the action.however,the court continued the matter for a week so that it could take a harder look at the proposition aspect.after hearing additional argument on that issue,the trial court issued this order plaintiff lacks standing to sue.this court may not grant injunctive relief to prevent tax collection.see daar alvord d.plaintiff fails to allege he is injured or will be injured by proposition any party who may be injured by proposition q has an adequate remedy to challenge its validity by paying the tax first and then bringing a claim for refund before seeking judicial relief.leave to amend is denied.the text of the amendments to san francisco business and taxation regulations code section d was included in the voter pamphlet,and the effect of proposition q was adequately explained to voters.there is no reasonable likelihood that plaintiff will be able to state a valid cause of action.
plaintiff perfected this timely appeal from the judgment of dismissal entered in due course.

standing and section 
standing is a jurisdictional issue that must be established in some appropriate manner.waste management of alameda county,county of alameda th.as a general principle,standing to invoke the judicial process requires an actual justiciable controversy as to which the complainant has a real interest in the ultimate adjudication because he or she has either suffered or is about to suffer an injury of sufficient magnitude reasonably to assure that all of the relevant facts and issues will be adequately presented to the adjudicator.citations.to have standing,a party must be beneficially interested in the controversy that is,he or she must have some special interest to be served or some particular right to be preserved or protected over and above the interest held in common with the public at large.citation.the party must be able to demonstrate that he or she has some beneficial interest that is concrete and actual,and not conjectural or hypothetical.a complaining party demonstration that the subject of a particular challenge has the effect of infringing some constitutional or statutory right may qualify as a legitimate claim of beneficial interest sufficient to confer standing on that party.citations.holmes california nat.guard th.
the fundamental aspect of standing is that it focuses on the party seeking to get his complaint before a court,and not in the issues he wishes to have adjudicated.harman city and county of san francisco cal d,quoting flast cohen.the issue of standing is determined by the courts as a matter of policy.in large measure it depends on the fitness of the person to raise the issues.farley cory d,the question of standing to sue may be raised by demurrer.torres city of yorba linda th,citing parker bowron cal d.
however strict the concept of standing may be in other contexts,it has been considerably relaxed by section,which provides in pertinent part an action to obtain a judgment,restraining and preventing any illegal expenditure of,waste of,or injury to,the estate,funds,or other property of a county,town,city or city and county of the state,may be maintained against any officer thereof,or any agent,or other person,acting in its behalf,either by a citizen resident therein,or by a corporation,who is assessed for and is liable to pay,or,within one year before the commencement of the action,has paid,a tax therein.this section does not affect any right of action in favor of a county,city,town,or city and county,or any public officer provided,that no injunction shall be granted restraining the offering for sale,sale,or issuance of any municipal bonds for public improvements or public utilities 
this relaxation is a consequence of the salutary goal of section the primary purpose of this statute,originally enacted in,is to enable a large body of the citizenry to challenge governmental action which would otherwise go unchallenged in the courts because of the standing requirement.citation.california courts have consistently construed section liberally to achieve this remedial purpose.blair pitchess cal d,accord,santa barbara county coalition against automobile subsidies santa barbara county of governments th,cates california gambling control com.th.thus,under section no showing of special damage to the particular taxpayer is necessary for the taxpayer to prevent injury to the public.white davis cal d,quoting crowe boyle cal.
in point of fact,this liberality has twice outrun the literal statutory language.notwithstanding the plain language of section identifying the plaintiff as a citizen resident,it can be invoked by nonresident taxpayers.irwin city of manhattan beach cal d.and courts have applied section to agencies of the state,even though only local governmental units and officers are named in the statute text.serrano priest cal d,fn.blair pitchess,supra,cal d,see cates california gambling control,supra,th,failure of state officials to collect money due under gaming compacts vasquez state of california th,it is established that an action lies under section to enforce the government duty to collect funds due the state see also cornelius los angeles county.authority th,and decisions cited.
just what amounts to waste is more readily intuited than enunciated.it has been described as a useless expenditure of public funds that is incapable of achieving the ostensible goal.see harnett county of sacramento cal,funds for special election that could not result in stated purpose of election.certainly it reaches outright fraud,corruption,or collusion,harman city and county of san francisco,supra,cal d,nickerson san bernardino cal.even when done in the exercise of a lawful power,public spending may qualify as waste if it is completely unnecessary,or useless,or provides no public benefit.sundance municipal court cal d,county of ventura state bar th.waste is money that is squandered,or money that is left uncollected,and thus is a constitutionally prohibited gift of public resources.see harman city and county of san francisco,supra,at public property sold for less than statutory minimum lundberg county of alameda cal d,validity of tax exemption unsuccessfully challenged.waste can exist even when there is no net loss,as when illegal procedures actually permit a saving of tax funds.wirin parker cal d.
waste does not encompass the great majority of governmental outlays of money or the time of salaried governmental employees,nor does it apply to vast majority of discretionary decisions made by state and local units of government t he term waste as used in section means something more than an alleged mistake by public officials in matters involving the exercise of judgment or wide discretion.to hold otherwise would invite constant harassment of city and county officers by disgruntled citizens and could seriously hamper our representative government at the local level.thus,the courts should not take judicial cognizance of disputes which are primarily political in nature,nor should they attempt to enjoin every expenditure that does not meet with a taxpayer approval.sundance municipal court,supra,cal d,quoting city of ceres city of modesto d.but whatever else it may or may not be,it is unquestionably waste for government to budget or spend money administering an illegal ordinance.see tobe city of santa ana cal th,citing white davis,supra,cal d,blair pitchess,supra,cal d,fn.
daar alvord is not controlling 
daar alvord can not be understood without appreciating the role played by article xiii,section,which provides no legal or equitable process shall issue in any proceeding in any court against this state or any officer thereof to prevent or enjoin the collection of any tax.after payment of a tax claimed to be illegal,an action may be maintained to recover the tax paid,with interest,in such manner as may be provided by the legislature.
it is easy to discern why daar alvord became the prime focus of the parties dispute.the case involved one of the first decisions in the wake of the passage of proposition to consider the sea change that measure wrought in the assessment and collection of ad valorem real property taxes.plaintiff daar and his company owned real property and paid the taxes assessed on it by los angeles county.he then sued county officials for a refund of those taxes,for himself and all persons and entities similarly situated.that part of the suit was not at issue.what was in play was the cause of action for injunctive relief under section to prevent the defendants from expending those funds constituting the assertedly excessive taxes collected by defendants and,further,to require defendants to impound those funds pending resolution of the matter,namely,daar claim that officials were refusing to apply proposition one percent cap to the unsecured portion of the assessment roll.daar appealed from the trial court denial of a preliminary injunction.daar alvord,supra,d.
daar reliance upon section was countered by the defendants invoking the long established principle,recognized both in the california constitution and in the revenue and taxation code,which precludes taxpayers from enjoining the collection of taxes.the constitutional provision is article xiii,section.the revenue and taxation code provision is section,which provides no injunction or writ of mandate or other legal or equitable process shall issue in any suit,action,or proceeding in any court against any county,municipality,or district,or any officer thereof,to prevent or enjoin the collection of property taxes sought to be collected.the court of appeal further noted that by enacting revenue and taxation code section,the legislature has provided a remedy for the taxpayer who claims to have paid taxes illegally imposed or erroneously collected,and the decisional law has uniformly relied on the adequacy of legal remedy provided by revenue and taxation code section to reject efforts by individual or corporate taxpayers to challenge some aspect of the tax collection process,declaring that the basic rationale for precluding such challenge is the public policy favoring the uninterrupted funding of governmental activities.daar alvord,supra,d.
the issue of collection was the point the daar plaintiffs attempted to use to keep their suit alive.the court of appeal rejected the attempt plaintiffs do not herein challenge the collection of assertedly illegally imposed taxes by defendants,but rather seek to prevent the collected taxes from being spent by defendants and to require their impounding pending a determination of the lawfulness of imposition of the taxes at the rate.defendants contend,however,that,if it is legally permissible to enjoin a governmental entity from spending what it has collected,the constitutional and statutory provisions concerning collection will be rendered totally ineffective,a result unintended by either the framers of the constitution or the legislature 
in resolving the issue presented herein,we consider whether there is any conflict between code of civil procedure section and section of article xiii of the california constitution and revenue and taxation code section.we have no difficulty in harmonizing these constitutional and statutory provisions.we deem that the illegal governmental activity which is subject to taxpayer challenge in code of civil procedure section does not include activity characterized as illegal solely by reason of purportedly illegal tax collection.it can be not reasonably so we any expenditure of illegally collected taxes is per se an illegal governmental activity.we reject any such broad characterization as contrary to accepted principles of reasonable construction of constitutional and statutory provisions.daar alvord,supra,d.
the daar court used the word standing only once,and that obliquely,in a quote from the supreme court.see daar alvord,supra,d,quoting the excerpt from blair pitchess,supra,cal d,set out ante.nevertheless,the clear import of its reasoning was that daar and his company,as taxpayers liable for real property taxes,lacked standing to seek a prepayment adjudication of the legality of that tax.that it is how it was construed in mckendry county of kern d,the sole reported decision citing daar.
the obvious relevance of daar here is the conclusion that section can not be used to challenge collection of taxes a plaintiff may believe is illegal.but daar was not the simple collision of that statute and article xiii,section.equally prominent was revenue and taxation code section,which parallels the language of the constitutional provision.because we believed this point was not adequately addressed in the briefs already on file,we solicited supplemental briefing from the parties.armed with this additional input,we conclude that daar is not controlling here.
it must be remembered that daar involved real property taxes.these were clearly deemed of sufficient importance to the functioning of local government that the legislature enacted revenue and taxation code section replicating the constitutional rule of article xiii,section prohibiting efforts to enjoin the collection of such taxes by cities and counties.and it is that statute that is key to a proper understanding of daar alvord.as far as we can determine,that statute is unique in extending immunity to local taxing authorities.every other statute extends immunity only to suits against the state or any administering state officer.see fish,commercial fishing landing tax,sales and use taxes,motor vehicle fuel tax,use fuel tax,private railroad car tax,insurance tax,gift tax,franchise and income taxes,cigarette tax,alcoholic beverage tax,timber yield tax,energy resource surcharge,emergency telephone users surcharge,hazardous substances tax,integrated waste management fee,oil spill response,prevention,and administration fees,underground storage tank maintenance fees,diesel fuel tax unemp,unemployment insurance contributions.without regard to whether article xiii,section could protect the county officials in daar,revenue and taxation code section did 
the supplemental briefing,and our own research,has found no state statute extending a comparable immunity to city or county officials administering a tax other than on real property put bluntly,there is no state statute standing in the way of the city having to answer a claim under section that it is committing waste by administering an illegal taxing statute.in light of the foregoing,daar alvord should not be read as categorically prohibiting the use of section to challenge a local tax.
plaintiff is unable to identify a single judicial decision approving 
use of section by a person not personally liablefor a tax to halt collection of that tax 
but if daar alvord does not bar the courthouse door,must plaintiff thus be admitted and allowed to proceed plaintiff identifies a number of decisions,including three from different divisions of this district,which he claims authorize his taxpayer challenge under section to proposition q.we have examined those decisions and understand their allure for plaintiff,for several of them do indeed state,or strongly imply,that section can be employed to test the validity of a taxing statute.a close analysis of these decisions demonstrates that they are not direct or controlling authority on the point before us.
van atta scott cal d involved a taxpayer action filed pursuant to section challenging a county application of state statutes providing for pretrial release of persons facing criminal charges.although there is much space devoted in the opinion to the scope and operation of section van atta scott,supra,at,there was no issue of the validity of tax collection.
lundberg county of alameda,supra,cal d involved a taxpayer suit aimed at a county exempting certain property from taxation.thus,although it did involve a taxation measure,the point of the litigation was not to challenge the validity of that measure,or try to halt collection of taxes,but was meant to increase the amount of taxes collected by compelling county authorities to cease granting exemptions.that is precisely the opposite of what plaintiff is seeking.
pacific motor transport state bd.of equalization d pacific motor transport involved a declaratory relief action by trucking firms challenging the validity of an administrative rule and its application to them.although the details are sparse,it appears that the two firms believed that conducting intracity and intercity operations as separate enterprises might lessen the overall tax burden.id.at.taking note of former revenue and taxation code section,the language of which paralleled the terms of article xiii,section,division one of this district allowed the challenge to the validity of the regulation to proceed under former government code section now section.however,the court reasoning had several cautionary provisos 
we note that government code section,by its express terms,does no more than permit judicial determination as to the validity of a regulation.the policy behind revenue and taxation code section proscribes judicial interference in the tax collection process.no sound reason appears why an interested party should not have the question of a tax regulation validity determined,so long as the tax collector is not hindered in his duties thereby.state and federal courts are frequently,in one way or another,passing upon the validity of tax regulations after payment of the required tax.these determinations then affect taxpayers and tax collections in other pending and future cases.rather than an impediment,such decisions must be considered as in aid of tax collection,for they tend to add certainty and conclusive legality to the process.they do no harm to the public policy expressed by section.
care must be taken in judicial proceedings under government code section as they relate to such tax regulations,that the relief be limited in the statute language to a judicial declaration as to the validity of the questioned regulation the relief afforded may not prevent or enjoin or otherwise hamper present or future tax assessment or collection effort against the plaintiff or anyone,as proscribed by section.it will be presumed that the governmental agency will respect a judicial declaration concerning a regulation validity.if it does not the taxpayer remedy lies in paying the assessed taxes and then commencing action based upon such invalidity for their refund.pacific motor transport,supra,d.
pacific motor transport is distinguishable on a number of points.unlike here,it was an action against a state taxing agency.unlike here,it involved a challenge to an administrative regulation.unlike here,it was not a taxpayer action brought under section,but a statutorily authorized challenge brought by parties who were actually subject to the tax.further,it relied on an immunity statute that has subsequently been repealed.see stats,ch,repealing former.perhaps most significantly,it did not we do unabashed attempt to halt local efforts to collect a local tax.and,on this last point,division one opinion can not be read to furnish any comfort to plaintiff,because the court reluctance to do so is palpable finally,years later our supreme court has subsequently cited pacific motor transport for the proposition that government code section,which authorizes an action for declaratory relief to determine the validity of a regulation is strictly construed in tax cases and may not be used to prevent the state from collecting taxes or,by parity of reasoning,to compel the state to refund taxes.woosley state of california cal th,fn.
trim,county of monterey d trim involved a suit by a taxpayers organization alleging that some real property in monterey county was properly assessed for property tax purposes at percent of its fair market value,while other real property in the county was assessed at substantially less than fair market value.id.at.division three of this district stated that section has been construed to authorize a taxpayer to contest the legality of a taxing statute.id.at.again,the gist of the challenge was that the county is wasting money because it is not collecting all that it could in revenues.and even so,division three held that these allegations are insufficient to state a cause of action for relief under code of civil procedure section.id.at.there was no challenge to the validity of a tax,only the claim that unequal application was depriving the county of money to which it was entitled.
the next authority invoked by plaintiff is the opinion of division four in county of sonoma state bd.of equalization d county of sonoma.this was a suit by a county and one if its residents challenging the state board of equalization interpretation of a state statute concerning exemption of geothermal steam from county taxation.the relief granted by the trial a judicial declaration that revenue and taxation code section did not exempt steam from local sales tax,and a writ of mandate directing the state board of equalization to commence collecting sales tax on behalf of sonoma county,and then to remit those taxes to the county.id.at.
division four held that the county and the individual had standing to sue to compel the board to alter its interpretation of the state law as exempting geothermal steam from county taxation taxpayer suits are well recognized in california and are explicitly authorized by statute.code civ.among other things,section has been interpreted as authorizing a taxpayer to contest the legality of a taxing statute citing lundberg county of alameda and trim.county of sonoma,supra,d.the court further noted that judicial scrutiny of the board interpretation argument need not disrupt the orderly administration of the tax laws.id.at.however,division four ultimately held that the individual and the county were entitled to no relief by virtue of an intervening amendment to the state statute expressly exempting sales of geothermal steam from county taxation,together with a legislative declaration that the amendment was intended to be declaratory of existing law and to codify the longstanding administrative practice of the state board of equalization which interprets section as exempting steam from sales and use taxation.stats,ch.county of sonoma,supra,at.
as evident from its citation of lundberg county of alameda and trim,what was at issue in county of sonoma was an exemption from taxation,and thus a failure to collect revenues,not an actual expenditure that could be characterized as waste.like pacific motor transport,it was an action against a state taxing agency.and there was no issue of judicial process hampering collection of sales tax.see humane society of the united states state bd.of equalization th,fn.
the final authority cited by plaintiff is san miguel consolidated fire protection dist.davis th san miguel.there,a number of special districts and individuals sued the state controller and other state and local officials alleging that former revenue and taxation code section,subdivision c,which allocated a percentage of real property tax revenues from special districts to each county educational revenue augmentation fund,was unconstitutional on a number of grounds.the plaintiffs also challenged the defendants computations to determine the amounts allocated from the fund to local education authorities.the trial court denied the plaintiffs petition for a writ of mandate and declaratory relief.the court of appeal for the third appellate district affirmed,and held that all of the plaintiffs arguments against the statute were without merit.before doing so,however,the court addressed the issue of the plaintiffs standing.the court concluded that the special districts did not have standing but that the individuals did.to support this conclusion,the court simply quoted the passage from county of sonoma that section has been interpreted as authorizing a taxpayer to contest the legality of a taxing statute.san miguel,supra,at,quoting county of sonoma,supra,d.
the statute at issue in san miguel was not a true taxing statute,in the sense that it did not itself generate revenue,but is more properly characterized as a statute allocating revenue already generated by other statutes.see the text of former,subd.c quoted in san miguel,supra,th,fn.even if the san miguel plaintiffs had succeeded in having the statute overturned,the net effect would not have reduced homeowner property tax bill,or diminished the revenues available to any governmental unit.this would explain the absence of any effort to halt collection under the statute.the difficulties with the conclusion carried forward from county of sonoma have already been addressed.
this review establishes that none of the authorities cited by plaintiff stands four square for the proposition that section may be employed to challenge the validity of an actual taxing statute,much less that such a challenge can secure declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting collection of that tax.our own research has failed to discover such a precedent.upon deep reflection of the problem,we believe the explanations for this absence are obvious.
why we agree with the trial court that plaintiff lacks 
standing to prosecute this action 
it is a truism in criminal law that capital prosecutions receive special attention because death is different.gregg georgia.so are taxes.they are the grease that make the wheels of government go round.this inescapable reality was recognized long before section was enacted in.stats,ch.in,having served as chief justice of the california supreme court,stephen field penned these words for the united states supreme court it is upon taxation that the several states chiefly rely to obtain the means to carry on their respective governments,and it is of the utmost importance to all of them that the modes adopted to enforce the taxes levied should be interfered with as little as possible.any delay in the proceedings of the officers,upon whom the duty is devolved of collecting the taxes,may derange the operations of government,and thereby cause serious detriment to the public.dows city of chicago,supra,dows.
these are not mere dusty words from a bygone age.their pertinency has,if anything,gained as the operations of government have expanded exponentially to meet the demands of modern life.justice field words continue to be quoted by california the united states supreme this day,state bd.of equalization superior court cal d,pacific gas electric state bd.of equalization cal d,modern barber cal.emp.stab,supra,cal d,flying dutchman,supra,th,levin commerce energy,california grace brethren church,fn.
not surprisingly,the law of tax remedies began with actual taxpayers trying to get refunds.given the importance of a steady and predictable stream of income to states and local government,courts declined to act until the challenged tax had actually been paid,springer united states,state bd.of equalization superior court,supra,cal d,and decisions cited.this was the genesis of the pay first litigate later principle found in article xiii,section.again,going back to justice field,a tax would be enjoined only in very rare instances where more than a naked claim of illegality was raised a suit in equity will not lie to restrain the collection of a tax on the sole ground that the tax is illegal.there must exist in addition,special circumstances bringing the case under some recognized head of equity jurisdiction,such as the enforcement of the tax would lead to a multiplicity of suits or produce irreparable injury,or where the property is real estate,throw a cloud upon the title of the complainant.hannewinkle georgetown,quoting dows accord,state railroad tax cases,cheatham et unites states.this reasoning was also adopted by the california supreme court,and by this court.crocker scott cal,sav.and loan society austin cal,helms bakeries bd.equalization,supra,d.but if there was an adequate remedy at almost always meant a refund collection of a tax would not be halted by courts,matthews rodgers,boise artesian water boise city,eisley mohan cal d,construction and application of statutes denying remedy by injunction against assessment or collection of tax federal district courts shall not enjoin,suspend,or restrain the collection of any tax under state law where a plain,speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such state.
although they follow a different path,the example of the federal courts is not without relevance.not having an equivalent of section,and compelled to respect the constitutional requirement that they decide only actual cases and controversies,allowing only a limited exception for challenges that can be framed under the free exercise or establishment clauses of the first amendment,they otherwise do not entertain taxpayer challenges to state or federal taxing policies,hein freedom from religion foundation,daimlerchrysler cuno,asarco,kadish,valley forge christian college americans united for separation of church and state,doremus board of education,alabama power ickes.congress has even enacted a statute very much to the same effect as our article xiii,section,quoted ante.
the rationale for this federal abstention is that a taxpayer lacks standing because the financial interest shared with millions of others,is comparatively minute and indeterminable remote,fluctuating and uncertain.frothingham mellon,frothingham decided with massachusetts mellon.the administration of any statute,likely to produce additional taxation to be imposed upon a vast number of taxpayers,the extent of whose several liability is indefinite and constantly changing,is essentially a matter of public and not of individual concern.if one taxpayer may champion and litigate such a cause,then every other taxpayer may do the same,not only in respect of the statute here under review,but also in respect of every other appropriation act and statute whose administration requires the outlay of public money,and whose validity may be questioned.the bare suggestion of such a result,with its attendant inconveniences,goes far to sustain the conclusion which we have reached,that a suit of this character can not be maintained.frothingham,supra,at.the party who invokes the judicial power must be able to show,not only that the statute is invalid,but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of its enforcement,and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally.id.at fairchild hughes,plaintiff has only the right,possessed by every citizen,to require that the government be administered according to law and that the public moneys not be wasted.opn.of brandeis.the court deemed it of much significance that no precedent sustaining the right to maintain suits like this has been called to our attention.frothingham,supra,at.
one of the benchmark federal decisions on standing,and the one which established the limited exception to the general rule against taxpayer standing,is flast cohen,supra.as previously mentioned,the court in flast stated the fundamental aspect of standing is that it focuses on the party seeking to get his complaint before a court and not on the issues he wishes to have adjudicated.id.at.however,the court seemingly undercut this formulation by also stating that in ruling on taxpayer standing,it is both appropriate and necessary to look to the substantive issues to determine whether there is a logical nexus between the status asserted and the claim sought to be adjudicated in order to ascertain whether the plaintiff is a proper and appropriate party to invoke the judicial power.id.at.this is to say that the plaintiff must prove a direct injury that goes beyond a generalized grievance and general interest common to all members of the public united states richardson,quoting ex parte lévitt,or one shared in substantially equal measure by all or a large class of citizens.warth seldin.thus,when the plaintiff is not himself the object of the governmental action or inaction he challenges,standing is not precluded,but is ordinarily substantially more difficult to establish.lujan defenders of wildlife.
these considerations have not found expression in california decisions considering section.nevertheless,an analysis of the substantive issues see flast cohen,supra,persuades us that the underlying reasoning is equally transferrable to the context of taxpayer actions brought under that statute to challenge the validity of local taxing statutes.
the principle that courts should refrain from enjoining collections exacted by a taxing statute first appeared in the california constitution in.see eisley mohan,supra,cal d.but it had already been receiving judicial recognition for almost a century.see dows,supra,citing heywood city of buffalo hannewinkle georgetown,supra,citing heywood and mooers smedley johnsons ch.article xiii,section embodies this principle,but its vitality is not dependent on its expression in article xiii,section.as previously shown,the california supreme court was enforcing the principle long before enactment of section in and the adoption of the predecessor version of article xiii,section the following year.see crocker scott,supra,cal,sav.and loan society austin,supra,cal,see also pacific gas electric state bd.of equalization,supra,cal d,fns,history of article xiii,section.
the concerns behind article xiii,section,dows,and the federal decisions about taxpayer standing are clearly germane even if they have not been codified.the fear that persistent interference with the collection of public revenues,for whatever reason,will destroy the effectiveness of government has been expressed in many judicial decisions state bd.of equalization superior court,supra,cal d,quoting modern barber.stab,supra,cal d,and has not lost any force.if anything,in these times of restricting the ability of local government to develop new sources of revenue,interference could have even more drastic consequences.
the academic examinations of section do not show that taxpayer actions have been allowed to challenge the validity of a tax or halt collections of revenue.and one of the studies,echoing frothingham,in fact acknowledges the possibility that taxpayer actions could be used for improper reasons such as challeng ing political decisions or constant harassment of officials leading to vexatious litigation that may plague the courts when state taxpayers suits are brought before them.note,california taxpayers suits suing state officers under section of the code of civil procedure hastings,collins meyers,the public interest litigant in california observations on taxpayers actions loyola.see frothingham,supra,taxpayers suits a survey and summary yale,taxpayers suits potential for harassment may encourage governmental immobility and inhibit progressive community action and unduly burden city officials who must defend against such suits.the examination of the california decisions undertaken above likewise shows the absence of a single reported instance where tax collection has been enjoined.like the united states supreme court,we deem this precedential void of almost years significant as circumstantial confirmation that such a to extraordinary exceptions as suggested in dows does not generally exist.see frothingham,supra.
it is one thing to provide an opportunity for a person or entity to challenge the legality of a tax already paid.indeed,that opportunity is commanded by due process.see batt,supra,th,and authorities cited.however,that person or entity may not go into court and obtain adjudication of the validity of a tax which is due but not yet paid.state bd.of equalization superior court,supra,cal d.the city rightly insists that the pay first,litigate later principle which is also embodied in article xiii,section,can not be ignored.if plaintiff construction of section is accepted,the taxpayer not actually subject to a tax will paradoxically be in a more advantageous position than will someone who must pay the tax.the latter party will be obliged to pay the tax,exhaust all administrative remedies,and only then be entitled to go to the courts.but while the actual taxpayer must satisfy all of these conditions precedent,a section taxpayer can jump the queue ahead of those who actually paid the tax and race to court the day after a taxing statute is enacted this places the section taxpayer in an invidious position.the person actually required to pay the tax must wait while someone far less aggrieved may already be racing to the courts.the section taxpayer may be no less hostile to the taxing statute,but it is not possible to view that hostility as lacking the precise focus of the actual payer who wants his or her money back.the section taxpayer challenging the taxing statute would,in the words of justice brandeis,be asserting only the right,possessed by every citizen,to require that the government be administered according to law and that public moneys not be wasted.fairchild hughes,supra.this is precisely the sort of generalized grievance seeking vindication of a general interest common to all members of the public,united states richardson,supra,which in this situation would seem to mean any person or entity who pays any sort of a tax in san francisco.yet,given existing construction of section,the potential plaintiffs would expand to include nonresident taxpayers.see irwin city of manhattan beach,supra,cal d.this would be precisely the situation of courts hearing challenges to taxing statutes mounted by plaintiffs armed with only comparatively minute and indeterminable remote,fluctuating and uncertain interest that is shared with millions of others.frothingham,supra,see holmes california nat.guard,supra,th,the resulting uncertainty,if not chaos,for the thousands of local taxing authorities would obviously be dire.
it can not be denied that there is considerable force in plaintiff argument that a claim for refund could never redress the harm that the complaint and section seek to wasteful expenditure of public monies in implementing an invalid ordinance.those expenditures are already underway and the public monies at issue will have already been squandered before any tax returns are due pursuant to proposition see fn,ante.but this logic must yield to the reality that plaintiff sought to prevent this waste by halting the city collection in its tracks with an injunction.however,as already shown,that is a remedy california common law had virtually forbidden prior to enactment of section.so,when plaintiff asserts that section lacks any exception for cases,he fails to foresee that the statute would have to be construed to include such an exception because the legislature would be presumed to have been aware of the common law aversion to enjoining tax collection.see,estate of banerjee cal d,in re the marriage of bouquet cal d,mcfadden jordan cal d.by correctly noting that the principle and section must be reconciled,plaintiff anticipates our conclusion.and citing pacific motor transport,supra,d,certainly does not aid plaintiff because the court there specifically noted the crucial proviso no sound reason appears why an interested party should not have the question of a tax regulation validity determined,so long as the tax collector is not hindered in his duties thereby.id.at,italics added.the court deemed the point sufficiently important to warrant reiteration the relief afforded may not prevent or enjoin or otherwise hamper present or future tax assessment or collection effort against the plaintiff or anyone,italics added.a third time,as previously noted,the pacific motor transport court also quoted dows in noting that injunctive very remedy plaintiff not available.see fn,ante.finally,plaintiff is alleging only the illegality of proposition q,without any of the special circumstances that permits equitable intervention in the form of an injunction.state railroad tax cases,supra,hannewinkle georgetown,supra,dows,supra,sav.and loan society austin,supra,cal,helms bakeries bd.equalization,supra,d.
in light of the foregoing,our independent review compels us to conclude that the trial court hit the nail on the head with its ruling that plaintiff lacks standing to sue.this court may not grant injunctive relief to prevent tax collection.a lack of standing is a jurisdictional defect to an action that mandates dismissal.cummings stanley th.because the trial court correctly reached this conclusion,and there being no suggestion that plaintiff could amend around it,the dismissal of plaintiff complaint was proper
