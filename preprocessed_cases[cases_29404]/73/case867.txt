smith,circuit judge 
this appeal presents the question of whether entities that are disregarded for federal tax purposes may nevertheless constitute partners under a such that their partnership is not eligible for the exception contained in.for the reasons stated in this opinion,we hold that an entity disregarded status does not preclude its classification as a partner.
factual and procedural background 
in,robert kotick kotick and his father charles kotick kotick formed a delaware limited liability company llc,seaview trading,llc seaview.federal tax regulations treat seaview as a partnership.see reg.b i.the koticks each held their respective interests in seaview through delaware llcs agk investments llc agk,owned wholly by kotick,and kmc investments llc kmc,owned wholly by kotick.
seaview acquired an interest in a common trust fund,which in reported a loss that was allocated to its investors including seaview.kotick reported the loss arising from seaview interest in the trust fund on his form.in,the internal revenue service irs audited kotick form,at which time it became aware of kotick claimed loss resulting from seaview investment.at the conclusion of the audit,the irs disallowed certain transaction expenses relating to seaview,and assessed additional taxes.it did not,however,disallow the loss that kotick had reported on his individual tax return as a result of seaview trust investment.the statute of limitations for kotick form expired in july.a.
the irs began an audit of seaview in october.five years later,in october,the irs issued a final partnership administrative adjustment fpaa notice disallowing the loss from seaview trust investment and imposing penalties.kotick filed a petition in tax court on behalf of seaview challenging the irs notice in regard to seaview taxes.kotick argued that the irs notice was invalid because seaview was exempt from the partnership audit pursuant to the exception set forth at a b i.agk filed a separate petition seeking the same relief.
the irs moved to dismiss kotick petition for lack of jurisdiction,arguing that seaview did not fall within the exception,and kotick lacked standing to file the petition on behalf of seaview because he was not seaview tax matters partner.in march,the tax court granted the irs motion.kotick then filed this appeal.

disregarded entities and the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 
under treasury regulation,an eligible entity with a single owner can elect to be classified as an association or to be disregarded as an entity separate from its owner.subsection b ii of the regulation provides that a domestic eligible entity with a single owner will be d isregarded as an entity separate from its owner by default,unless the entity chooses otherwise.the activities of a disregarded entity are treated in the same manner as a sole proprietorship,branch,or division of the owner,except in regard to the application of certain special employment and excise tax rules.reg.a.
the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of tefra,pub,a.stat,sets forth unified audit and litigation procedures applicable to partnerships.see.in a proceeding,a tax court has jurisdiction to determine 
all partnership items of the partnership for the partnership taxable year to which the notice of final partnership administrative adjustment relates,the proper allocation of such items among the partners,and the applicability of any penalty,addition to tax,or additional amount which relates to an adjustment to a partnership item.
id.at f.under the exception provided by a b i,an entity will not be considered a partnership for the purposes of tefra audit procedures if the entity has or fewer partners each of whom is an individual,a c corporation,or an estate of a deceased partner.
treasury regulations provide a caveat to the exception contained in the exception in a b i does not apply to a partnership for a taxable year if any partner in the partnership during that taxable year is a partner as defined in section a.reg.a a.tefra defines a partner as any partnership,estate,trust,s corporation,nominee,or other similar person through whom other persons hold an interest in the partnership.a.
ii.disregarded llcs constitute partners 
appellants argue that under,the regulation,agk and kmc were disregarded entities treated as sole proprietorships of their respective individual owners,and that consequently they could not constitute partners within the meaning of treasury regulation a.seaview is correct in regard to its first contention agk and kmc were disregarded entities but their disregarded status for the purpose of federal taxes does not preclude their classification as partners under a.to the contrary,every source cited by the parties has found that llcs qualify as partners,regardless of their elected classification under.seaview has provided no compelling reason for us to diverge from this consensus.
the irs directly addressed the question of whether a disregarded entity may constitute a partner in revenue ruling,we have previously applied skidmore deference to revenue rulings.see omohundro united states,cir.per curiam under skidmore swift,and the supreme court decision in united states mead,an agency ruling is eligible to claim respect according to its persuasiveness.at citing generally skidmore.we consider multiple factors when exercising skidmore review of agency action,including the thoroughness and validity of the agency reasoning,the consistency of the agency interpretation,the formality of the agency action,and all those factors that give it the power to persuade,if lacking the power to control.tualatin valley builders supply,united states,cir.see also tablada thomas,cir.finding skidmore deference warranted in light of the rational validity and consistent application of an agency position,despite the existence of reasonable alternative interpretations.
applying skidmore framework for reviewing agency rulings,revenue ruling carries persuasive,if not decisive,force,and therefore warrants judicial deference.ruling concededly does not contain extensive discussion of its analysis but the concise nature of its reasoning does not undercut its basic logic.ruling starts by emphasizing that the definition of a partner contained in a includes partnership s,estate s,trust s,s corporation s,nominee s or an other similar person through whom other persons hold
