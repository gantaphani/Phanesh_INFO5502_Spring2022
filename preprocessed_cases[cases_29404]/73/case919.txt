defendant appellants lynne meredith,teresa manharth giordano,and gayle bybee appeal their jury convictions for conspiracy to defraud the united states,mail fraud,false representation of a social security number,passport fraud,and failure to file income tax returns.their convictions arose from their participation in businesses that helped customers evade federal and state income taxes.
defendants appellants contend that their convictions violate the first amendment.we agree that mere advocacy of tax evasion and nothing more can not support convictions for conspiracy or fraud.however,the defendants did far more than advocate.they developed a vast enterprise that helped clients hide their income from federal and state tax authorities.accordingly,we reject their claims that their convictions violated the first amendment.we also reject giordano claim that the indictment erroneously included misdemeanor crimes among the objects of the felony conspiracy count,and her challenge to the district court jury instruction on the crime of failure to file income taxes.however,we vacate giordano restitution order and remand for recalculation because the district court failed to consider evidence that giordano presented at sentencing.
defendants appellants other claims of error are addressed in a memorandum disposition filed contemporaneously with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
beginning in,meredith owned and operated various businesses,including we the people wtp,free the people,sovereignty pure trusts,and liberty international.these organizations sold books and held seminars that instructed people how to avoid paying any personal income taxes.giordano worked for wtp,and other businesses,as a paralegal,drafting correspondence to the irs and the california franchise tax board on behalf of clients.bybee served as international marketing director for liberty international and trust salesperson for liberty international and sovereignty pure trusts.
meredith wrote two books,how to cook a vulture and vultures in eagle clothing,which explained how people could stop paying income taxes.the books instructed customers to falsely report to the irs that they did not owe income taxes.meredith and bybee also organized seminars in which meredith instructed customers how to evade paying income taxes.
at the heart of the defendants operations was a financial instrument known as a pure trust,which they claimed was exempt from taxes.the defendants sold these trusts to customers who learned about meredith theories at seminars and in her books.wtp opened bank accounts for customers using a trust identification number,which was not the customers social security numbers or an employer identification number issued by the irs for the purported trust.

discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence 
defendants appellants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence underlying their convictions for mail fraud,conspiracy,false representation of a social security number,and passport fraud.
to evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal,we conduct a inquiry.first,we must consider the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the prosecution.united states nevils,cir en banc citation omitted.second,we must determine whether this evidence,so viewed,is adequate to allow any rational trier of fact to find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
mail fraud and conspiracy 
defendants appellants contend that insufficient evidence supports their conspiracy and mail fraud convictions because their conduct was protected by the first amendment.
to evaluate this argument,we first outline the level of first amendment protection the constitution provides to activities.next,we examine the evidence supporting each of the mail fraud and conspiracy charges,and determine whether the first amendment protects those acts.
first amendment and activities 
the first amendment prohibits any law abridging the freedom of speech.const.amend.however,the supreme court has carved out some limited categories of unprotected speech,including obscenity,defamation,fraud,incitement,and speech integral to criminal conduct.united states stevens,citations omitted.
at issue here is the first amendment exception that allows the government to regulate speech that is integral to criminal conduct.this exception first arose in giboney empire storage ice,in which a state court prevented unions from picketing to force a distributor to enter an agreement that violated state restraint law.id.at.the supreme court upheld this ruling,rejecting the contention that the constitutional freedom for speech and press extends its immunity to speech or writing used as an integral part of conduct in violation of a valid criminal statute.id.at.
in united states freeman,cir,we applied this exception to a tax evasion case.the defendant was convicted of fourteen counts of aiding and abetting,and counseling violations of the tax laws.id.at.the jury was not instructed on a first amendment defense,and therefore we reversed the convictions on the twelve counseling counts.id.at.however,we affirmed the convictions on the counts for assisting in the filing of false returns.we held that i n those instances,where speech becomes an integral part of the crime,a first amendment defense is foreclosed even if the prosecution rests on words alone.id.at 
meredith relies primarily on united states dahlstrom,cir,which involved defendants who held seminars at which they instructed members on how to create foreign trust organizations fto in order to reduce their tax liabilities.id.at.the defendants were convicted of conspiracy and tax fraud.we reversed the convictions on six of the tax fraud and conspiracy counts for insufficient evidence,partly because the f irst a mendment would require a further inquiry before a criminal penalty could be enforced.id.at.based on the evidence presented at trial,we concluded that the exception for incitement of imminent unlawful activity did not apply because n othing in the record indicates that the advocacy practiced by these defendants contemplated imminent lawless action.id.emphasis in original.dahlstrom,however,is inapposite here because it involves the first amendment exception for inciting imminent lawless action.because the defendants here are charged with mail fraud and conspiracy committed in part by means of speech,we instead analyze this case under freeman first amendment exception for speech that is integral to a crime.
for each count,we must determine whether defendants merely encouraged their customers to evade taxes,or if their speech was integral to the crime.
counts and mail fraud 
mail fraud has two elements having devised or intending to devise a scheme to defraud or to perform specified fraudulent acts,and use of the mail for the purpose of executing,or attempting to execute,the scheme or specified fraudulent acts.united states van alstyne,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.a participant in a scheme to defraud is liable for acts of mail or wire fraud committed by,provided those acts took place during the life of the scheme and were reasonably foreseeable as a necessary and natural consequence of the fraudulent scheme.united states green,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
count charged meredith and giordano with causing customer john spatola to mail a form individual income tax return,and count charged them with causing spatola to mail a form individual income tax return.
at trial,spatola testified that he learned of wtp and pure trusts from erickson,a relative of spatola who assisted meredith with seminars and book sales.spatola testified that after he read meredith book,vultures in eagle clothing,erickson told him he could lawfully avoid paying income taxes.after that conversation,he attended two seminars at which meredith discussed how to avoid paying taxes.spatola also testified that meredith book and newsletters instructed readers to file amended tax returns to recover taxes that he had already paid.after erickson and watts told spatola that they filed amended returns and received money back,spatola pursued this strategy and filed amended tax returns,following specific instructions from meredith books.spatola testified that he would not have amended his returns without these assurances from erickson and watts.in july,spatola received notices from the irs,stating that he would be penalized for filing frivolous tax returns.after he learned of the penalties,spatola contacted erickson,who said that she was studying to become a paralegal,and offered to assist spatola for a fee.
the first amendment does not prohibit conviction of meredith and giordano on counts and.wtp by way of its owner and employees did more than encourage spatola to file fraudulent amended returns.spatola not only received specific instructions from meredith books and seminars,but he also discussed his plans in detail with erickson and watts,who were participants in the overall scheme.these discussions were integral to the crime.although spatola did not testify that he had interactions with meredith or giordano,they both are liable for the reasonably foreseeable actions of their.see green,at.
viewing the record in the light most favorable to the prosecution,there is sufficient evidence for a rational jury to find meredith and giordano guilty of counts and beyond a reasonable doubt.
count mail fraud 
meredith and giordano also were convicted on count,which charged them with causing wtp customer kevin stambaugh to mail a claim for release of erroneous notice of protest letter.
at trial,stambaugh testified that after hearing meredith discuss tax evasion on the radio,he purchased her book and video tape.in early,following the instructions in her book,he amended his income tax returns from both and to show zero income.he also filed tax returns for and,even though he earned income in those years.in,the irs issued a deficiency notice for the return and penalized stambaugh.the irs also disallowed his and amended returns.after receiving these notices,stambaugh called wtp and was referred to giordano.stambaugh testified that he spoke with giordano six or seven times,and giordano assured him that he would ultimately prevail against the irs.beginning in february,giordano prepared a series of letters for stambaugh to send to the irs,for each.among the letters that giordano prepared for stambaugh was a july,request for the irs to release a levy.
the first amendment does not protect these actions.the defendants did far more than merely encourage stambaugh to defraud the federal government their speech was integral to stambaugh tax evasion.giordano explicitly instructed stambaugh how to avoid taxes,and she drafted letters for him to send to the irs in furtherance of the fraud.giordano actively participated in the fraud.as a in the wtp enterprise,meredith also is liable.see green,at.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,a rational jury could find meredith and giordano guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on count.
count mail fraud 
meredith and giordano were convicted on count,which charged them with mail fraud for causing customer eric bors to mail a check for the purchase of a pure trust.
at trial,bors testified that he contacted sovereignty pure trusts one of meredith organizations to learn about pure trusts.bors spoke with meredith and moore,who explained how the trusts could help him avoid paying any taxes.bors purchased a pure trust from moore,as well as books and pamphlets that provided additional instructions about avoiding income and social security taxes.moore advised him about setting up the pure trust,and filled out the trust application for him.on september,bors mailed a check to sovereignty pure trusts in exchange for a trust.bors testified that he would not have purchased the pure trust without the assurances from meredith and moore that the trusts protect income from the irs.
the first amendment does not prevent conviction on this count because meredith and moore speech was integral to bors tax evasion.meredith and moore instructed bors how to evade taxes through a pure trust,sold the pure trust to bors,and helped him structure the trust to evade taxes.accordingly,when viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution,a rational jury could find meredith and giordano guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of count.
conspiracy count 
all three defendants were convicted of conspiracy,in violation of.the statute states 
if two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the united states,or to defraud the united states,or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose,and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy,each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years,or both.
to prove a conspiracy under the defraud clause of this statute,the government need only show the defendant entered into an agreement to obstruct a lawful function of the government by deceitful or dishonest means and at least one overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.united states caldwell,cir.
the indictment alleged overt acts,including the mail fraud charges discussed above.the verdict forms did not specify which of the overt acts formed the basis for the conspiracy convictions.
as described in the previous sections,there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude the defendants engaged in a conspiracy that was not protected by the first amendment.numerous customers testified that the defendants helped them evade their federal and state tax obligations.meredith was the architect of the pure trust scheme,instructing her employees and customers how to evade taxes.meredith also trained employees to sell pure trusts.giordano created the pure trusts and drafted response letters to the irs on behalf of customers.bybee sold pure trusts and served as a trustee for customers.the conspiracy involved far more than mere advocacy of tax evasion.accordingly,there was sufficient evidence for a rational jury to conclude that the defendants conspired to defraud the government.
