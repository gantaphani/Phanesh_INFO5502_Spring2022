introduction 
what is a big box retailer as used by the legislature in health and safety code section and government code section commonly known as ab stats,ch,respectively,these statutes prohibit a redevelopment agency from providing financial assistance to a big box retailer that is relocating from one community to another within the same market area 
plaintiff,city of carson carson,appeals from the denial of its petition for writ of mandate.code civ.carson seeks to require the defendants,city of la mirada,city council of la mirada,and the la mirada redevelopment agency together,la mirada to comply with the requirements of ab and share with carson a portion of the sales tax revenue it receives from corporate express,corporate express.
ab was enacted by the legislature for the express purpose of preventing competition between municipalities for businesses that generate large amounts of retail sales tax.the definition of big box retailer,contained in the statute,is based on two criteria only physical size and ability to generate retail sales taxes under the revenue and taxation code based on the record,corporate express clearly falls within ab definition of big box retailer,and the efforts of corporate express to exact an economic package from la mirada to move to that city were exactly what ab was designed to prevent.therefore,the trial court interpretation and application of ab was legal error.accordingly,we reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
the parties.
there is no dispute about the facts in this case.carson is a municipality located in the south bay area of los angeles county.la mirada is located east of carson.as with all municipalities in california,both cities rely upon sales tax revenue to fund local government and services.
corporate express.
the southern california division of corporate express sells office products,furniture,and computer consumable supplies.corporate express operations consist of distribution centers throughout the united states.the company operates on a system.the hub is the distribution center,and spokes are sales,marketing,and customer service.in the greater southern california area,corporate express sells its products from san diego to bakersfield,and east.
corporate express sells its products exclusively through a sales force.corporate express customers are the,not the retail sellers,of the products and are preferably businesses who have at least workers.the company direct competitors include staples,office depot,and boise cascade.the company tailors its services to the customer needs and volume.hence,pricing is not standardized.approximately orders are processed per day,and some percent of the orders are delivered by corporate express trucks.
corporate express does not accept orders from the general public.that is,the company sales force solicits customers for whom they establish accounts.it is undisputed that corporate express services its customers by direct sales,purchase orders taken by telephone,facsimile,mail,and through the internet.
corporate express does not normally accept orders in person from its headquarters.although its la mirada facility contains a will call window where customers can pick up products,and a lobby with a receptionist to greet visitors,only employees with identification may enter the rest of the building,which is separated by security doors.customers may only come to the will call window if they have existing accounts and have placed orders before arriving.the la mirada site does not have cash registers.
the la mirada facility contains a warehouse on the ground floor.the warehouse has miles of conveyors,and loading docks on either side for shipping and receiving.there,the company receives products from manufacturers and selects individual items for sale to customers.the second floor,or mezzanine portion of the building,houses the administration and sales department.employees work in the square foot mezzanine.that area is a working showroom,where furniture is displayed while being used by the corporate express sales force.there is also a small display area where customers may browse and test the furniture and other products.according to gary gonsalves,president of corporate express southern california division,quite often clients are brought to the mezzanine to look at cubicle brands and furniture.
corporate express campaign to find a new location.
corporate express maintained a sales and distribution facility in carson from to.as such,the company was one of the largest generators of retail sales tax for carson.this is a significant amount given that approximately percent of carson general fund income for fiscal year was derived from retail sales tax.the company held leases in carson,compton,and paramount,all of which were set to expire in july.after a merger between bt office products and corporate express in,the latter wanted to consolidate its operations,and commenced a search for a new location.later,corporate express acquired office products,which had a distribution center and headquarters in santa fe springs.
in,corporate express considered the possibility of expanding at its existing carson site.but,it determined that the site was neither large enough nor the right shape to expand.eventually,corporate express began looking outside carson.
in the fall of,corporate express contacted la mirada to express its interest in consolidating its operations and relocating there.corporate express october,letter to la mirada director of finance indicated that the company was looking for a square foot distribution center.the company specified that it anticipated million in sales for of which approximately million would be taxable and million would directly relate to southern california.corporate express explained that one percent of this amount,or million in sales tax is collected from the point of sale which is currently carson.italics added.more particularly,corporate express indicated that if it were to decide to relocate from carson,it would expect to reasonably partner with economic benefits gained by the city of la mirada in a long term relationship as a result of million in sales tax revenue for and approximately million in the first full year in.
concurrently,corporate express notified carson that the company was seriously considering relocation concessions from la mirada and santa fe springs.the company reminded carson that all of its sales originate from its carson facility,as all of the orders are picked and shipped from this location.italics added.corporate express repeated its hope to partner with economic benefits gained by the city of carson in a long term relationship as a result of our sales tax base and employee count,and asked the carson city manager to provide the company with specific program details and dollar amounts that would assist corporate express to continue its occupancy in the city of carson versus relocating to la mirada or santa fe springs.
carson general manager for economic development,ronald winkler,explained carson response to this request.carson considered,inter alia,offering redevelopment tax increment money to the business,or a sales tax rebate.carson understood itself to be in competition with la mirada to offer assistance.
la mirada was also eager to have corporate express move into that city and found a large parcel of land in an industrial area previously used as an oil refinery.the city preferred that corporate express be the tenant on this property,instead of a warehouse,which would not generate sales tax revenue.originally,la mirada had proposed offering corporate express a rebate of percent of the sales tax.ultimately,la mirada increased the amount of the rebate to of the sales tax revenue over a certain threshold amount for the first three years after its relocation followed by percent of the revenues in the following years.carson estimated that the total financial assistance given by la mirada to corporate express would exceed million over a period.
carson offered to meet or exceed la mirada offer.by letter dated december,carson offered two options a arrangement that corporate express would own,or the retrofitting of an existing building under a lease agreement.
unfortunately for carson,two days earlier,on december,the la mirada redevelopment agency and corporate express executed a participation agreement.thereunder,la mirada promised to assist corporate express in purchasing or leasing land and constructing a square foot facility there.the agreement placed restrictions and maintenance requirements on corporate express,in return for which la mirada would provide a financial incentive agreement for a period of years.as the financial incentive,la mirada agreed to refund to corporate express a percentage of tax revenues as long as the company minimum annual sales tax revenues reached a certain amount.that is,the financial incentives would be measured by the production of sales tax revenues from the property.
la mirada was also aware that ab might apply.hence,included in the participation agreement was article,entitled possible claim by the city of carson.that article stipulated,in the event a court determined that ab applied to corporate express relocation,that la mirada would share its sales tax revenues with carson and the financial incentive would be readjusted.
corporate express had completed its move to la mirada by the time of trial.
carson lawsuit.
on april,carson commenced the instant action against la mirada to challenge the participation agreement as a violation ab.after amendment,carson lawsuit sought the invalidation of the participation agreement an injunction to regulate the approval of the participation agreement and writs of ordinary and administrative mandate to enforce the revenue sharing provisions of ab.by stipulation,the case was tried to the bench.
the trial court held that ab does not apply to corporate express la mirada facility because that company is not a big box retailer.after considering the legislative history,testimony,and extrinsic evidence submitted by both parties,the court concluded that the phrase big box retailer and the word store had specific meanings attributed by the legislature.they are retail establishments selling to the general public with or without membership dues,having very large parking lots four to five parking spaces per square feet of retail space,and catering to shoppers.examples the trial court found repeatedly identified in the materials included sam club,home base,costco,and office depot.
applying this definition to the evidence of corporate express operations,the court concluded that the la mirada facility is not a large building located as an island amongst parking spaces.the court was influenced by the fact that corporate express did not accept orders from the general public.rather,it is located in an area that is zoned heavy industrial,with parking spaces for the employees who work days.corporate express does not have large signs or a large area where products are displayed to customers.the court found that t he legislature specifically limited the scope of its enactment to stores and that corporate express la mirada facility was not operating a store within the meaning of the statute rather,the corporate express la mirada building was a facility because it had loading docks where trucks are filled for delivery to customers.the court entered judgment in favor of la mirada and carson filed its appeal.
contention 
carson contends the trial court erred in ruling that corporate express is not a big box retailer within the meaning of ab.
discussion 
the trial court denial of la mirada motion to dismiss the lawsuit was not error.
corporate express is a big box retailer as defined by ab and contemplated by the legislature.
corporate express physical size and ability to generate sales tax revenue make it a big box retailer.
the sole substantive question before us is whether corporate express qualifies as a big box retailer as that term is used in ab,in government code section,and health and safety code section.
in interpreting a statute,we apply principles the fundamental rule is to ascertain the intent of the legislature in order to effectuate the purpose of the law in doing so,we first look to the words of the statute and try to give effect to the usual,ordinary import of the language,at the same time not rendering any language mere surplusage.the words must be construed in context and in light of the nature and obvious purpose of the statute where they appear the statute must be given a reasonable and commonsense interpretation consistent with the apparent purpose and intention of the legislature,practical rather than technical in nature,and which,when applied,will result in wise policy rather than mischief or absurdity citations.klajic castaic lake water agency th,d,fair employment housing com.cal d.thus,t he intent prevails over the letter,and the letter will,if possible,be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.citation.people pieters cal d.
construction of a statute is a question of law which appellate courts review de novo.california ins.guarantee liemsakul d.
looking first to the words of ab,it defines big box retailer as a store of greater than square feet of gross buildable area that will generate sales or use tax pursuant to the uniform local sales and use tax law part commencing with section of division of the revenue and taxation code,subd.b health,subd.b,italics added.revenue and taxation code sections et refer to the determination and computation of sales and use tax ab clearly and unambiguously defines big box retailer by two factors,namely,physical size and ability to generate sales tax.
the words of ab define corporate express la mirada facility.first,the building is far more than square feet of gross buildable area.the mezzanine alone,where the sales are made,is square feet.second,corporate express generates retail sales tax revenue.by its own estimate,corporate express produced approximately million in sales tax collected from the point of sale in,and anticipated million in this amount made corporate express one of the largest producers of sales tax income for carson.indeed,corporate express marketed itself to carson,la mirada,and santa fe springs on the basis of its capacity to produce significant amounts of sales tax income for these cities.it was this ability that compelled la mirada to offer and then sweeten the deal with corporate express.thus,the two elements of ab definition of big box retailer apply to corporate express.
corporate express la mirada facility is a store.
the parties dispute whether corporate express is a store as that word is used in ab.webster dictionary defines store as a business establishment where usu ally diversified goods are kept for retail sale webster new collegiate dict,italics added and a place of deposit for goods esp ecially in large quantities.webster new internat.dict.black law dictionary defines store as a ny place where goods are deposited and sold by one engaged in buying and selling them.black law dict.ed,italics added.
based on these definitions,corporate express is a store.the company buys large quantities of office and computer supplies and furniture,which products are kept in the warehouse and then repackaged and sold to customers.no one disputes that corporate express customers are the of the products the company sells.see modern paint body supply,state bd.of equalization th,d courts look to primary intent of purchaser in determining whether product purchased at retail or for resale.thus,regardless of the fact its customers are by account only and are businesses,corporate express sales are retail sales.see,a retail sale or sale at retail means a sale for any purpose other than resale in the regular course of business in the form of tangible personal property.the company building contains a showroom and display area.its competitors are staples,office depot,and others who are in the business of retail sale of office supplies.although the warehouse and mezzanine are not atmospheres,the la mirada building is where the company sells its products to the ultimate consumer.
we are not persuaded by la mirada argument that corporate express la mirada facility is really a warehouse,not a store.la mirada describes corporate expre
