opinion of the court 
eli and renee chabot the chabots appeal the district court grant of the internal revenue service irs petition to enforce summonses for foreign bank account records that requires the chabots to keep.today we join six other circuits in holding that these records fall within the required records exception to the fifth amendment privilege.accordingly,we will affirm the district court grant of the irs petition.
background 
in april,the irs received information from french authorities concerning united states with undisclosed bank accounts at hsbc bank.the irs alleges that it has information regarding accounts held by pelsa business pelsa for the years through.according to the information provided to the irs,eli chabot is the beneficial owner of pelsa.
on june,the irs issued summonses to eli and renee chabot requesting that they appear on july,to give testimony and produce documents about their foreign bank accounts for the period from january,to december,the chabots attorney notified the irs that the chabots would not appear,were asserting their fifth amendment privilege against,and would not produce the requested documents.the irs amended the two summonses on november,limiting their scope to only those documents required to be maintained under.the chabots continued to claim the fifth amendment privilege,and the irs filed a petition to enforce the amended summonses on may.
before the district court,the chabots claimed that,although the contents of the records sought might not be protected by the fifth amendment,their act of producing the documents was protected.the chabots specifically claimed that responding to the summonses might subject them to prosecution for their failure to file the same information in an annual report of foreign bank and financial accounts.the chabots also claimed that any exception to the fifth amendment privilege based on the required records exception should not apply in this case.the district court held that the required records exception applied and thus the fifth amendment did not prohibit production of the documents sought.the district court therefore granted the petition to enforce the summonses.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to b and a.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to.whether enforcement of a summons violates the fifth amendment privilege is a mixed question of law and fact.united states ins.consultants of knox,cir.here,the question before us is purely one of law,and we review de novo the district court application of the fifth amendment privilege and the required records exception to the present facts.in re grand jury proceedings,cir.
iii.discussion 
on appeal,the chabots arguments can be summarized as follows allowing the government to rely on the required records exception to enforce the summonses in this case will lead to general governmental abrogation of the fifth amendment privilege for any failure to report crime the information that would be gleaned from compliance with the summonses is almost identical to what the government needs to charge the chabots with the felony of willful failure to report an overseas account in the report of foreign bank and financial accounts,thus requiring the chabots to incriminate themselves and the records that requires accountholders to keep do not satisfy the test for applying the required records exception to the fifth amendment privilege.the government response to these arguments is simple.it argues that the chabots records fall within the required records exception to the fifth amendment privilege.therefore,the questions before the panel are whether the chabots account records fall within the required records exception to the fifth amendment privilege and,if so,whether the chabots policy concerns are insurmountable barriers to our application of this exception.unpersuaded by the overriding effect of the stated concerns,we conclude that the chabots account records fall squarely within the required records exception to the fifth amendment privilege.therefore,we will affirm the district court grant of the irs petition.
a.the development of the required records exception to the fifth amendment privilege 
the fifth amendment states that n o person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.u.const.amend.v.an individual may claim this privilege if compelled to produce,testimonial communication s.fisher united states,d.the act of producing documents may trigger the fifth amendment privilege.see id.at.this is because,by producing documents,one acknowledges that the documents exist,admits that the documents are in one custody,and concedes that the documents are those that the subpoena requests.id.when these testimonial aspects of compelled production are,the fifth amendment privilege applies.see id.at.
in shapiro united states,the supreme court first articulated the required records exception to the fifth amendment privilege.in re grand jury subpoena dated,cir hereinafter doe.when shapiro was decided,private papers were entitled to fifth amendment protection based on their private status.see at.public papers,however,did not have fifth amendment protection.see id.at.in shapiro,the supreme court qualified this distinction when it held that the fifth amendment privilege did not apply to certain private papers that the law required a person to keep.id.at.the supreme court subsequently fleshed out shapiro holding in grosso united states,wherein it explained that the following three prongs must be met in order for records to fall within the required records exception the reporting or recordkeeping scheme must have an essentially regulatory purpose a person must customarily keep the records that the scheme requires him to keep and the records must have public aspects.
fisher,which found no fifth amendment privilege because the involved taxpayers were not the persons compelled to produce,appeared to shift the focus away from the distinction in determining whether compelled production of records violates the fifth amendment privilege see at.despite this somewhat altered view of how the fifth amendment relates to the production of documents,courts have continued to rely on the required records exception.see,balt.city dep t of soc.servs.bouknight,d recognizing the principle behind the required records exception abrogated respondent privilege even though her compliance with a court order to produce her child would have aided in her prosecution doe,at,applying the required records exception to the respondent privilege where his compliance with a grand jury subpoena for account records would have aided in criminal proceedings against him.
courts have offered several reasons for continuing to apply the required records exception to the fifth amendment privilege,even though the threshold framework for applying the privilege to documents appears to have changed to a degree.the first is,engaging in an activity for which congress conditions participation upon recordkeeping effectively waives the right to invoke the fifth amendment privilege to prevent compelled disclosure of such records.in re two grand jury subpoenae duces tecum dated,cir.the next,and perhaps weaker,is,because the records must be kept by law,the admits little in the way of control or authentication by producing them.id.and the last is,continued application of the required records exception is vital in order to protect the government legitimate interest in using the records that it requires individuals to keep.see,bouknight,at the court has on several occasions recognized that the fifth amendment privilege may not be invoked to resist compliance with a regulatory regime constructed to effect the state public purposes unrelated to the enforcement of its criminal laws.in re grand jury proceedings,at citing in re special grand jury subpoena dated,cir.these reasons support application of the exception under either the framework or the framework.thus,the required records exception has retained its vitality as an exception to the fifth amendment privilege against.see bouknight,at.
b.the government ability to use the required records exception to abrogate the fifth amendment privilege 
the chabots predict that inclusion of their account records in the required records exception will encourage the government to make excessive use of the exception in order to abrogate the fifth amendment privilege for any failure to report crime.the chabots also suggest that this would allow the government to abrogate the fifth amendment more generally by creating a host of or reporting requirements.because there is significant overlap between this argument and the first prong of the required records exception,we address only briefly the chabots argument here.
in shapiro,the supreme court explained that there was little danger of congress completely abrogating the fifth amendment privilege as long as the records that congress required individuals to keep closely served the purpose of a valid,civil regulation.shapiro,at.in that case,the emergency price control act was a valid exercise of congress power to set commodity prices during wartime that required vendors to keep records of their sales.id.at.because these sale records closely served the act legitimate regulatory purpose,the court concluded that inclusion of the petitioner sales records in the required records exception was a far cry from congress total abrogation of the fifth amendment privilege for any and all crimes.see id.at.in short,because of the required records exception exclusive application to valid,regulatory recordkeeping schemes,the government can not simply create a recordkeeping requirement in order to prosecute crimes,such as a willful failure to report offense.see in re grand jury investigation,cir hereinafter.
in the present case,the government conditions voluntary participation in foreign banking on maintaining records and reporting information regarding foreign bank accounts.see id.at.as explained in greater detail regarding the first prong of the grosso test,the recordkeeping requirement is part of a valid,essentially regulatory scheme.these records serve legitimate noncriminal purposes,because government agencies use this data for tax collection,development of monetary policy,and conducting intelligence activities.see united states under seal,cir listing the noncriminal purposes for which government agencies,including the treasury department,use account record data in re grand jury subpoena,cir employing similar reasoning.therefore,it is unlikely that the government will be able to use the required records exception to abrogate the fifth amendment privilege for any and all failure to report crimes.
compliance with the summonses will result in criminal liability 
the chabots contend that compliance with the irs summonses for their account records will provide a significant link in the chain of evidence that the government needs to prosecute them for willful failure to report overseas account s to the irs.appellant br.unfortunately for the chabots,this argument echoes the familiar yet unsuccessful arguments of other holders of foreign bank accounts who have invoked the fifth amendment privilege to prevent compliance with summonses for required records.see,doe,at,rejecting same argument.
courts use prong one of the required records exception to evaluate whether compliance with a recordkeeping scheme is likely to lead to criminal charges as a general matter.doe,at,at.if the scheme main purpose is to force individuals to turn over potentially incriminating evidence to be used in criminal prosecutions,the scheme is not essentially regulatory.see,at concluding that is essentially regulatory,in part,because the records that it requires accountholders to keep are not inherently incriminating and therefore not significant links in the chain of evidence necessary to bring criminal charges against accountholders.as discussed in further detail infra,production of the records that the irs seeks is unlikely to lead to criminal proceedings as a general matter,because owning a bank account overseas is not an inherently criminal activity.id.at.
to the extent that the chabots argue that production of the requested account records will establish a significant link in the chain of evidence in their particular case,we are not persuaded that this precludes application of the required records exception.the fifth amendment applies only if the compelled production is potentially.if producing the documents were not potentially incriminating,the chabots would have no fifth amendment concerns.it is the potentially incriminating nature of production that allows the chabots to invoke an otherwise valid fifth amendment privilege.it is this same potentially incriminating nature that makes the required records exception relevant to the chabots account records.see doe,at.the chabots argument appears to boil down to this the exception to the fifth amendment is inapplicable if the fifth amendment otherwise would apply.such an argument is nothing more than a request that the exception be abolished altogether a request we must reject.
applying the required records exception to section 
as indicated,in grosso,the supreme court set forth the following test for when the required records exception should be applied to the fifth amendment privilege 
f irst,the purposes of the united states inquiry must be essentially regulatory second,information is to be obtained by requiring the preservation of records of a kind which the regulated party has customarily kept and third,the records themselves must have assumed public aspects which render them at least analogous to public documents.
at.although this is an issue of first impression for this circuit,the second,fourth,fifth,seventh,ninth,and eleventh circuits previously have applied the required records exception to enforce summonses for the records that requires accountholders to keep today we join these circuits in applying the required records exception to this subset of documents that must be maintained by law.doe,at.
essentially regulatory purpose 
the chabots contend that is a recordkeeping scheme with an essentially criminal purpose.the first prong of the required records exception asks whether a recordkeeping scheme targets an inherently criminal activity an inherently suspicious class of persons.see doe,at,at.therefore,we begin our inquiry by determining what and whom targets.section regulates foreign bank account ownership,an activity in which people participate for a myriad of legitimate and legal reasons.as the chabots counsel recognized at oral argument,someone might own an overseas account to ensure convenient access to money when living,working,or even vacationing abroad.oral argument at,united states chabot,available at.chabot.
in a similar vein,the class of persons who own foreign bank accounts is comprised of citizens as well as miscreants.doe,at.on this point,we agree with the fifth circuit conclusion that the bank secrecy act requirements do not apply exclusively to those engaged in criminal activity.in re grand jury subpoena,at.
where a recordkeeping scheme exclusively targets those who engage in illegal activities,its purpose is essentially criminal.for example,the supreme court held that the statutes at issue in grosso and marchetti united states were essentially criminal because the regulations at issue exclusively targeted individuals who were engaged in an inherently illegal activity,namely gambling.grosso,at marchetti,d.see also leary united states,d holding that petitioner fifth amendment privilege was violated when compliance with the transfer tax provisions of the marihuana tax act would have required petitioner unmistakably to identify himself as a member of this selective and suspect group of individuals who failed to comply with the act order form requirement haynes united states,d concluding that the registration requirement of the national firearms act violated petitioner fifth amendment privilege where the requirement mainly targeted individuals who possessed a firearm but had failed to comply with the act other requirements,therefore targeting an inherently suspicious class of persons.conversely,because does not apply exclusively,or even largely,to criminals,
