this appeal challenges the government use of documents produced by navron ponds pursuant to a grant of immunity under.ponds appeal of his convictions for tax evasion and fraud requires the court to address the breadth of that immunity for an act of production that,in its testimonial character,falls somewhere between the response to a fishing expedition addressed in united states hubbell,d,and the production of documents whose existence was a foregone conclusion in fisher united states,d.because the government has failed to show with reasonable particularity that it knew of the existence and location of most of the subpoenaed documents,we hold that ponds act of production was sufficiently testimonial to implicate his right against under the fifth amendment to the constitution.although the government,to some extent,violated its immunity agreement with ponds by impermissibly using his testimony and its derivative evidence,questions remain regarding the precise nature of its use and whether the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of conviction and remand the case to the district court to determine the extent of the government impermissible use and whether that use was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
in,navron ponds,a criminal defense lawyer,agreed to represent a drug dealer named jerome harris.see,united states harris,cir.as a retainer,harris mother agreed to give ponds a white mercedes benz,which ponds registered in his sister name.harris pled guilty.at his sentencing,the district court asked harris about the whereabouts of the mercedes for forfeiture purposes.ponds failed to inform the court that he had the car.in,when the united states attorney office for the district of maryland learned this from harris,it began a grand jury investigation of ponds acquisition of the mercedes and his failure to reveal his possession of the car to the court,focusing on potential charges of contempt of court,obstruction of justice,and money laundering.see united states ponds,d.
maryland assistant united states attorney sandra wilkinson executed a search warrant for harris jail cell to obtain the retainer agreement discussing the mercedes.federal drug enforcement administration agents went to ponds apartment complex,albemarle house,looking for the car.parked outside were the mercedes,and in another parking space rented by ponds,a porsche with the vanity license plate i object.according to apartment personnel,ponds drove the mercedes and his sister,laura ponds pelzer,drove the porsche.wilkinson issued a subpoena duces tecum ordering ponds to produce seven categories of documents and the mercedes.when ponds expressed his intent to invoke his fifth amendment privilege against,wilkinson revised the subpoena to omit requests that ponds actually produce the car and that he produce financial and tax records,and filed a motion pursuant to for a judicial order authorizing immunity under.the subpoena made six demands of ponds to produce any and all documents from forward 
referencing use,ownership,possession,custody control of a white mercedes benz 
that refer or relate to payment of legal fees by or on behalf of jerome harris whether by cash,currency,or some other form of payment

records of employees of the law office of navron ponds in the time frame of to the present.
the district court granted the immunity request and ordered ponds to produce the subpoenaed documents.
armed with immunity,ponds appeared before the grand jury and produced approximately pages of documents.the documents included records showing that the mercedes and porsche were registered in the name of ponds sister ponds had financial accounts with his sister ponds and his sister sold a georgia property they had jointly owned ponds possessed money order receipts used to pay for various services,mostly involving the mercedes and ponds had a health insurance document indicating he had purchased insurance for himself and magdalene alexander.ponds also testified before the grand jury,responding to the prosecutors questions about the document production,including affirming that the health insurance document was responsive to the subpoena request for documents regarding his employees.magdalene maggie alexander,ponds employee,was then called before the grand jury,where she testified about many of the produced documents and in detail about the process by which she helped ponds produce them.
soon after ponds responded to the subpoena duces tecum,the maryland united states attorney office filed an ex parte application it had prepared before the subpoena response with the maryland federal district court to authorize the internal revenue service irs to disclose ponds and tax returns.the application was granted,and the irs reported that ponds had not filed tax returns in those years.because ponds was a resident of the district of columbia,the maryland prosecutors contacted the united states attorney office for the district of columbia about conducting a tax investigation of ponds.these contacts involved several meetings and the transfer of documents produced by ponds and of maryland grand jury transcripts to mark dubester and irs special agent nancy becker.
the investigation continued,and in,dubester applied for search warrants on the basis of an affidavit provided by agent becker that included information first learned in the maryland grand jury.based on those applications,the united states attorney office secured warrants to search ponds home and office,where agent becker seized six boxes of documents.the documents revealed that ponds had used a tax preparer,and the preparer records were subpoenaed,uncovering further details about ponds financial affairs.with these materials and others subpoenaed from financial institutions,ponds was indicted in the district of columbia on five counts of tax evasion under,one count of wire fraud under,and one count of fraud in the first degree under a,a.
ponds filed a pretrial motion for a hearing pursuant to kastigar united states,d,that would force the government to demonstrate that the charges in this matter and the evidence it proposes to use at trial do not derive directly or indirectly from ponds immunized testimony and production of documents.the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing at which it heard testimony from agent becker and wilkinson,and accepted proffered testimony from dubester.see ponds,d at.the district court denied ponds motion to dismiss the indictment.id.the jury convicted ponds on all counts and the district court,upon denying ponds motion for reconsideration of the kastigar ruling or for a new trial,sentenced ponds to twenty months imprisonment and restitution to the federal and district governments.ponds appeals.
provides that 
no testimony or other information compelled under an immunity order or any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or other information may be used against the witness in any criminal case,except a prosecution for perjury,giving a false statement,or otherwise failing to comply with the order.
this federal witness immunity statute has a constitutional dimension,as the supreme court in kastigar,d,held that immunity from use and derivative use is coextensive with the scope of the fifth amendment privilege against in that i t prohibits the prosecutorial authorities from using the compelled testimony in any respect.id.at.thus,at issue in document production cases in which a witness with immunity is subsequently prosecuted are two basic questions was the defendant act of producing the documents sufficiently testimonial that the fifth amendment privilege is implicated if so,did the government violate the defendant fifth amendment rights and the court order granting him immunity by using sources of information derived from the immunized testimony in the prosecution see hubbell,at.
the fifth amendment declares that n o person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.const.amend.v.at one point in our history,this declaration was taken to mean that the government could not compel the production of private papers.see boyd united states.in,the supreme court changed course,and it is now a settled proposition that a person may be required to produce specific documents even though they contain incriminating assertions of fact or belief because the creation of those documents was not compelled within the meaning of the privilege.hubbell,at.summarizing fisher,d.t he act of producing documents in response to a subpoena,however,may have a compelled testimonial aspect in that the act may implicitly communicate statements of fact,such as the witness admission that the papers existed,were in his possession or control,and were authentic.id.at.quoting united states doe,d.whether the act of producing evidence in response to a subpoena is sufficiently testimonial that the fifth amendment applies depend s on the facts and circumstances of particular cases.fisher,at.
two supreme court cases provide the framework for our analysis of the facts and circumstances of this case.in fisher,d,the court considered two cases in which irs agents visited and interviewed taxpayers under investigation for tax violations.see id.at.after the interviews,the taxpayers obtained from their accountants documents used in preparing their tax returns and gave the documents to their lawyers.see id.at.once the government discovered that the lawyers had the documents,it sought to subpoena the records.in one case,its subpoena demanded the accountant workpapers pertaining to the taxpayer books for three years,the retained copies of the taxpayer returns for those years,and the retained copies of reports and other correspondence between the accountant and the taxpayer during those years.id.after disavowing any fifth amendment protection for the contents of the documents themselves,the court nevertheless recognized the testimonial aspect of the act of production because c ompliance with the subpoena tacitly concedes the existence of the papers demanded and their possession or control by the taxpayer,as well as the taxpayer belief that the papers are those described in the subpoena.id.at.under the circumstances of that case,however,the court concluded it was doubtful that implicitly admitting the existence and possession of the papers rises to the level of testimony within the protection of the fifth amendment because t he existence and location of the papers are a foregone conclusion and the taxpayer adds little or nothing to the sum total of the government information by conceding that he in fact has the papers.id.at.because the subpoena was more a question of surrender than of testimony,the court held that no constitutional rights are touched.id.quoting in re harris.
hubbell provides the counterpoint to fisher.in hubbell,the supreme court held that hubbell act of producing over documents in response to a broad subpoena was sufficiently testimonial to implicate the fifth amendment because the prosecutor needed hubbell assistance both to identify potential sources of information and to produce those sources.at.some of the broadest demands of that subpoena asked for all documents referring to any direct or indirect sources of money or other things of value received by or provided to webster hubbell and webster hubbell schedule of activities.id.at.the court held that the collection and production of the materials demanded was tantamount to answering a series of interrogatories asking a witness to disclose the existence and location of particular documents fitting certain broad descriptions,id.at,in which it was unquestionably necessary for hubbell to make extensive use of the contents of his own mind in identifying the hundreds of documents responsive to the requests in the subpoena,id.at.the government claimed that it was a foregone conclusion that hubbell would possess the subpoenaed documents because a businessman such as hubbell will always possess general business and tax records that fall within the broad categories described in this subpoena,but the court rejected that argument as overbroad.id.at.
the supreme court distinguished the circumstances in hubbell from those in fisher while in fisher the government already knew that the documents were in the attorneys possession and could independently confirm their existence and authenticity through the accountants who created them,here the government has not shown that it had any prior knowledge of either the existence or the whereabouts of the produced documents.id.at.whether an act of production is sufficiently testimonial to implicate the fifth amendment,therefore,depends on the government knowledge regarding the documents before they are produced.in fisher,the government knew of the existence of a set of documents relating to defined topics that were in the hands of the taxpayers attorneys in hubbell,the government could not show its prior awareness of the existence or location of the produced documents.when hubbell was heard in this court,we described the inquiry this way 
t he government must establish its knowledge of the existence,possession,and authenticity of the subpoenaed documents with reasonable particularity before the communication inherent in the act of production can be considered a foregone conclusion.in making this assessment,though,the focus must remain upon the degree to which a subpoena invades the dignity of the human mind,and on the quantum of information as to the existence,possession,or authenticity of the documents conveyed via the act of production.
united states hubbell,citations omitted.although the supreme court did not adopt the reasonable particularity standard in affirming our decision,it emphasized that the applicability of the fifth amendment turns on the level of the government prior knowledge of the existence and location of the produced documents.see hubbell,at,another circuit has applied the reasonable particularity standard to determine whether an act of production is sufficiently testimonial to implicate the fifth amendment.see in re grand jury subpoena dated april,cir.because that standard conceptualizes the supreme court focus in a useful way,so do we.
once it is clear that an act of production is sufficiently testimonial to be protected by the fifth amendment privilege against,the question remains how the government may use the compelled testimony and information derived therefrom in a later prosecution of the witness.in kastigar,d,the supreme court held that immunity from use and derivative use is coextensive with the scope of the privilege against in that i t prohibits the prosecutorial authorities from using the compelled testimony in any respect.id.at.therefore,when a person accorded immunity is subsequently prosecuted,the government bears the affirmative duty to prove that the evidence it proposes to use is derived from a legitimate source wholly independent of the compelled testimony.id.at.
with oral testimony,the bar on derivative use is easy to imagine.for example,if a murder suspect who has been granted immunity is called before a grand jury and asked whether he committed a murder and where the murder weapon is,his testimony may not be used against him in a criminal trial.in addition,the government may not use his testimony to retrieve the weapon for use against the witness at trial.even if the government introduced the weapon without indicating that it learned of its location from the defendant immunized grand jury testimony,only using fingerprints or dna testing to link the weapon to the defendant,the weapon would still be barred because it was directly or indirectly derived from compelled testimony.if the police simply happened upon the weapon through an ongoing investigation,however,the weapon could be used against the witness because it was derived from a legitimate source wholly independent of the compelled testimony.kastigar,at.see hubbell,at.
with immunity,the key question is whether,despite the compelled testimony implicit in the production,the government remains free to use the contents of the produced documents.in hubbell,the supreme court rejected the manna from heaven theory by holding the use of the contents of produced documents to be a barred derivative use of the compelled testimonial act of production.the court did so by stating that it can not accept the government submission that hubbell immunity did not preclude its derivative use of the produced documents as it was only through hubbell truthful reply to the subpoena that the government received the incriminating documents of which it made substantial use in the investigation that led to the indictment.hubbell,at.emphasis added.in context,these statements indicate that the supreme court understands the contents of the documents to be because they are a derivative use of the compelled testimony regarding the existence,location,and possession of the documents.as stated by this court in hubbell if the government did not have a reasonably particular knowledge of subpoenaed documents actual existence,let alone their possession by the subpoenaed party,and can not prove knowledge of their existence through any independent means,kastigar forbids the derivative use of the information contained therein against the immunized party.hubbell,at emphasis added.or explained another way,the contents of the documents can not be used against the witness because they are not derived from a legitimate source wholly independent of the compelled testimony.kastigar,at.this approach treats documents revealed in an immunized act of production just like the weapon revealed pursuant to immunized testimony.if the existence or location of the item was revealed through compelled testimony,the item is derivative of the testimony and may not be used by the government against the.
after determining what may not be used against the,the further question remains how that information may not be used.the direct introduction of immunized information as evidence at trial would be a prohibited use.see hubbell,at.but goes further,provid ing a sweeping proscription of any uses,direct or indirect,of the compelled testimony and any information derived therefrom,functioning as a comprehensive safeguard,barring the use of compelled testimony as an investigatory lead,and also barring the use of any evidence obtained by focusing investigation on a witness as a result of his compelled disclosures.kastigar,at.footnotes omitted.in united states north,this court noted that kastigar does not prohibit simply a whole lot of use,or excessive use,or primary use of compelled testimony.it prohibits any use,direct or indirect.id.at.accordingly,this court held that the government use of immunized testimony to refresh the recollection of a grand jury witness constituted a use of the compelled testimony.see id.
taken together,the bar on the use of information derived from a testimonial act of production by a witness with immunity and the breadth of that bar create real risks for prosecutors planning on prosecuting those whom they subpoena.the decision to seek use immunity necessarily involves a balancing of the government interest in obtaining information against the risk that immunity will frustrate the government attempts to prosecute the subject of the investigation.doe,at.that risk was manifested in the government prosecution of ponds.
the central question on appeal is whether the district court reliance on a sharp distinction between the testimonial aspect of producing documents and the contents of the documents,see ponds,d at,is contrary to an essential holding of the supreme court in hubbell that the use of the contents of documents may be a barred derivative use of the testimony inherent in the immunized act of producing those documents.throughout its opinion,the district court emphasizes its understanding that immunity is limited to the act of production and does not extend to the contents of documents.see id.at.ponds contends that the district court has returned to the repudiated rationale by seeming to think that nothing is amiss if the prosecution uses the contents of the documents without reference to the testimony inherent in the act of production.
it is true that in hubbell the supreme court drew a distinction between protected testimony as to the existence,location,and authenticity of documents inherent in the act of production and the unprotected contents of the documents themselves.see hubbell,at.this distinction,however,is only relevant in the context of determining whether an act of production implicates the fifth amendment.in that context,the contents of the documents are irrelevant for constitutional purposes because their preparation was not compelled.see fisher,at.doe,at.therefore,to determine whether an act of production implicates the fifth amendment,the court looks only to the communicative aspects of the act of production itself and to whether those tacit averments as to the existence and location of the documents add anything significant to the sum total of the government information.fisher,at.
the sharp distinction upon which the district court relied becomes less relevant,however,when a court proceeds to the conceptually separate and temporally subsequent kastigar inquiry.hubbell,at.this is because,coextensive with the protections of the fifth amendment,see kastigar,at,provides that a witness compelled by the district court to testify over an assertion of the fifth amendment privilege is not only protected from having that testimony used against him,but is also protected from having any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony used against him.when the government does not have reasonably particular knowledge of the existence or location of a document,and the existence or location of the document is communicated through immunized testimony,the contents of the document are derived from that immunized testimony,and therefore are to the government.
the government concedes that the contents of subpoenaed documents can sometimes be,describing the subpoena response in hubbell as sufficiently testimonial as to the documents existence and location to be privileged,and to taint the contents of the documents themselves.appellee br.at.the government attempts to minimize the distinction that the district court drew between contents and act of production.it contends that the district court understood that the act of production could taint the contents of produced documents,but found that ponds act of production did not taint the contents of the produced materials because his act of production did not make the extensive testimonial representations that hubbell did.the government reads the district court as understanding that immunity could reach the contents of documents,but that in this case,immunity did not reach the documents contents.
the district court distinguished ponds case from hubbell in finding the degree of interpretation,locating,cataloging and assembling of documents so important in hubbell simply not demanded by the narrow subpoena at issue here.ponds,d at.if the district court was correct that ponds act of production was insufficiently testimonial to implicate the fifth amendment,then it would be proper to deny protection to the contents of the produced documents.the district court opinion does not explicitly connect the discussion of the testimonial character of ponds act of production to its conclusion that the contents of the documents were unprivileged,however,which leads ponds to contend that the district court had the errant understanding that immunity only categorically reaches testimony inherent in the act of production and plainly not the contents of the documents produced.ponds,d at see,id.at.such an understanding would revive the rejected rationale whereby the government could use documents against an immunized party when it could do so without reference to how the documents were produced.that understanding would conflate the fifth amendment the act of production sufficiently testimonial to warrant fifth amendment protection with the immunity the government used compelled testimony or the information directly or indirectly derived therefrom in prosecuting the witness see hubbell,at.although the contents of the documents are irrelevant to determining whether the act of production was testimonial,the government use of the contents of the documents is critical in determining whether there was a derivative use of the compelled testimony that violates.
applying the lessons of fisher and hubbell to determine whether ponds act of production is better characterized as testimony or surrender,we begin by addressing the threshold question of whether the government has establish ed its knowledge of the existence,possession,and authenticity of the subpoenaed documents with reasonable particularity such that the communication inherent in the act of production can be considered a foregone conclusion.hubbell,at.ponds contends that his act of production was sufficiently testimonial to trigger fifth amendment protection because he used the contents of his mind to interpret the subpoena directions and to identify the documents in his possession that he believed were responsive.he maintains that the government was not focused on any tax offenses or any documents relevant to such offenses,citing wilkinson statement that she was surprised by some of the documents produced as evidence of the government lack of previous awareness of the existence and location of some of the documents.the government relies on the district court finding that the subpoena was narrow and specific,and reflected that the government already knew of the existence of the types of documents sought and their possession by defendant.ponds,d at.
as the critical inquiry is whether the government can show it had such prior knowledge of either the existence or the whereabouts,hubbell,at,of the produced documents that their existence and location was a foregone conclusion,fisher,at,the parties approach this inquiry by comparing and contrasting ponds subpoena to those in fisher and hubbell.by any measure,this subpoena falls somewhere in between the two unlike fisher,the prosecutors here did not ask for retained copies of workpapers,tax returns,and correspondence about which they were sure of both the existence and location.compare fisher,at,with ponds,d at.unlike hubbell,the set of topics for which the maryland prosecutors sought any and all documents refer ring or relat ing to is somewhat defined.compare hubbell,at,with ponds,d at.for most of the subpoena categories,however,the government has failed to establish its previous knowledge of the existence or location of the documents.
the existence and location of some subpoenaed documents were a foregone conclusion for instance,the government must have known of the existence of the documents in subpoena demand,a ny and all correspondence between the law offices of navron ponds and courts and prosecutors in the matter of jerome harris,because it was a party to that correspondence.and the government knew of the existence of documents referring to payment of legal fees by or on behalf of jerome harris subpoena demand because it had already seized a copy of harris retainer agreement from his prison cell.the failure of the government to identify each produced document specifically is of no moment.to be consistent with fisher,in which there is no indication that the government knew of each document within the set of documents of which it was aware,the reasonable particularity standard can not demand that the subpoena name every scrap of paper that is produced.because the government already had sufficient knowledge about the harris documents,ponds was simply surrendering them,not testifying,by complying with those demands in the subpoena.
the government prior knowledge of the existence or location of other subpoenaed documents has not been established.first,the government has not shown any prior knowledge that documents regarding the use,ownership,possession,custody control of a white mercedes benz subpoena demand were in existence or in ponds possession.before the subpoena,the government knew that the mercedes was normally parked at ponds apartment and was registered to his sister.see ponds,d at.but it had no idea that ponds possessed some of the documents he registration card,auto insurance information,sales contracts,and the has not shown it was even aware of the existence of the large range of correspondence and receipts that he produced regarding repairs and improvements to the mercedes.in fact,wilkinson testified that at the time that she sought act of production immunity,she was seeking to determine whether or not there were other documents that proved the longevity of ponds ownership of this car.this statement confirms that the government did not know whether or not documents relating to the car existed or were in ponds possession.ponds act of producing the documents testified to their existence and his possession,which effectively communicated that he had long been the beneficial owner of the car.the government prior knowledge that ponds had possession of a mercedes registered to his sister might render harmless the government improper use of the subpoenaed documents relating to the car,because the documents mostly confirmed what the government already suspected,but the government prior knowledge that he possessed the mercedes is not enough to establish with reasonable particularity its prior knowledge regarding the documents related to the mercedes.as in hubbell,where the supreme court rejected the government claim of knowledge based on the overbroad claim that hubbell was a businessman and therefore would have documents,at,the government can not show knowledge by means of broad assumptions about car ownership,much less mere possession.hubbell,at.
similarly,the government has not shown prior knowledge of the existence or location of documents relating to ponds sister,laura pelzer,subpoena demand a subpoena request that turned up documents regarding shared bank accounts and sales of shared real property.while in common parlance it might be a foregone conclusion that a person with a sibling will have documents relating or referring to the if only a christmas card or a parent reasonable particularity standard demands more.this court explained in hubbell that the government can not simply subpoena business records and then claim the requisite knowledge for purposes of the fifth amendment by pointing to the existence of a business.hubbell,at.the court stated that the government assertion that its knowledge of hubbell status as a consultant and a taxpayer carried with it a concomitant awareness of the existence and possession of his consulting and tax records similarly falls short.id.at.likewise,the government knowledge of ponds status as a brother does not carry with it an awareness of the existence and possession of records about his sister.the government prior knowledge that ponds had a mercedes and a sister can not suffice to establish its prior knowledge of the existence and location of the documents relating or referring to those topics that ponds,with immunity,produced in response to the subpoena.
in addition,the government has not shown that it had any prior knowledge of the existence or location of r ecords of employees of the law office of navron ponds in the time frame of to the present subpoena demand.the district court determination that the existence and location of these documents was a foregone conclusion was based on pure inference t he court concludes that it was a foregone conclusion in this day and age in the washington area that a sole practitioner would have some staff,even if or temporary,to assist him in his legal practice.moreover,it was also a foregone conclusion that certain administrative documents,including health care forms,would exist with respect to such staff,and would be in defendant possession.ponds,d at.this reasoning is reminiscent of the overbroad argument that a businessman will always possess general business and tax records,hubbell,at,an argument the supreme court fou
