the ultimate question in this case is whether the social security act covers physicians participating as medical residents in a graduate training program conducted by a hospital group jointly with a university.the issue arises in a suit by the united states against the hospital group to collect social security taxes under the federal insurance contributions act fica on the stipends the hospital group pays to the residents.the district court granted summary judgment for the united states,ruling that the stipends were wages and not scholarships or fellowships,and therefore not exempt from income tax,and that the residents did not qualify for the exemption from social security tax for students.we affirm in part,vacate in part and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.
the appellant,detroit medical center detroit medical,operates seven hospitals in the detroit metropolitan area.it sponsors a graduate medical training and education program jointly with wayne state university wayne state.this program provides training to medical residents in numerous areas of medicine.in michigan,two years of medical training are required before a doctor can take a state medical board examination.
each resident signs a residency agreement that contractually sets forth the duties and responsibilities of detroit medical,wayne state,and the resident.the resident agrees,among other things,to provide care commensurate with his or her level of advancement and general competence and to assume responsibility for teaching and supervising other residents or students.detroit medical gives the resident an annual stipend of slightly more than and also agrees to provide living quarters for residents on call,meals to resident s required to spend the night and liability insurance.detroit medical receives funding for its residency program from medicare,medicaid and blue cross.it does not charge patients for the care the residents provide.
the residents are supervised by a large number of physicians who are on the wayne state faculty.the program is conducted in conformity with the standards promulgated by the accrediting council for graduate medical education.
in its federal returns for to,detroit medical paid social security taxes on its medical residents stipends.in,detroit medical sought a refund of the taxes it paid for three quarters of,which the united states granted.on further review,however,the government concluded that the refunds had been erroneous.the united states sued detroit medical in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan to recover those refunds totaling more than million.detroit medical counterclaimed for the social security taxes on the stipends it had paid for through and and.
in a opinion,the district court granted the government motion for summary judgment,awarded the government the amounts it had refunded,and dismissed detroit medical counterclaim.
the court first held that the stipends paid to the residents were wages,not scholarships or fellowships that allegedly are not subject to social security taxes.the court stated that the residents stipends are given as a substantial quid pro quo for patient care because residents are contractually required to perform valuable patient care services.it also ruled that because the stipends are an all or nothing proposition,residents are required to care for patients in order to receive the stipends,no portions of them could be excluded from taxation as attributable to the time spent in actions other than patient care.
the court then held that the residents were not students at a school,college,or university who,under the statute,would be exempt from social security taxes.the court held that both the statutory provisions and the relevant treasury regulations are ambiguous on whether detroit medical residents qualify for the student exemption and that resort to the legislative history therefore was appropriate.the court f ou nd that permitting medical residents to qualify for the student exception would lead to just such result that is inconsistent with the intent of congress.that is,medical interns would be covered by fica whereas medical residents would not.
although this is a tax case,the underlying question is whether the social security act covers detroit medical residents.
in determining the meaning of the applicable provisions of the internal revenue code,the supreme court has pointed out the very specificity of the exemptions and the generality of the employment definitions indicates that the terms employment and employee,are to be construed to accomplish the purposes of the legislation a constricted interpretation of the phrasing by the courts would invite adroit schemes by some employers and employees to avoid the immediate burdens at the expense of the benefits sought by the legislation.united states silk.footnote omitted.as this court stated in luke hosp.ass united states,ohio misc,cir,in dealing with the beneficent purposes of the social security act,this court generally favors that interpretation of statutory provisions which calls for coverage rather than exclusion.also relevant are the principles that exemptions from taxation are to be construed narrowly,bingler johnson,d and do not rest upon implication,trust helvering,but must be unambiguously proved,united states wells fargo bank,d.in construing and applying those provisions,therefore,we must keep in mind that the underlying question is whether congress intended the social security act to cover detroit medical residents.
section of title of the united states code imposes a tax on the wages of employees for,survivors and disability insurance and hospital insurance.section imposes a similar tax on employers on the wages they pay.wages are defined in a as all remuneration for employment with certain exceptions not here involved,and employment is defined in b as any service,of whatever nature,performed by an employee for the person employing him except that such terms shall not include.this is followed by a number of exceptions,one of which for students we discuss in part iv,below.
detroit medical contends that its residents stipends are scholarships or fellowships,which a statutory provision provides are not part of gross income,and as such are not subject to fica taxes.
section of title provides in relevant part 
a general rule.gross income does not include any amount received as a qualified scholarship by an individual who is a candidate for a degree at an educational organization described in section b a ii.
b qualified scholarship.for purposes of this section 
in general.the term qualified scholarship means any amount received by an individual as a scholarship or fellowship grant to the extent the individual establishes that,in accordance with the conditions of the grant,such amount was used for qualified tuition and related expenses.
c limitation.
subsections a and d shall not apply to that portion of any amount received which represents payment for teaching,research,or other services by the student required as a condition for receiving the qualified scholarship or qualified tuition reduction.
section b a ii refers to an educational organization which normally maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled body of pupils or students in attendance at the place where its educational activities are regularly carried on.
in other words,for detroit medical residents stipends to constitute qualified scholarships that are not part of gross income,the amounts must have been used for qualified tuition and related expenses and the residents must have been candidate s for a degree at an educational organization that normally maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled body of pupils or students in attendance at a place where its educational activities are regularly carried on.
detroit medical theory apparently is that if the stipends are scholarships or fellowships and therefore not part of gross income under,then they were not wages subject to fica taxes under and.that is an arguable and perhaps a persuasive position,but the conclu
