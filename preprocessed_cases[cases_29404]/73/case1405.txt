this case concerns the department of commerce second administrative review of an antidumping order covering steel from the netherlands.the importer,corus staal bv,appealed commerce final determination to the court of international trade,challenging commerce use of the zeroing methodology to calculate corus dumping margin,commerce unfavorable classification of certain of corus sales transactions,and commerce determination that corus had absorbed antidumping duties rather than passing them on to its customers.the court of international trade upheld commerce use of zeroing and its classification of the disputed sales transactions.with regard to the absorption issue,the court held that corus had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and therefore had not preserved that issue for judicial review.we affirm.
zeroing is a method of calculating weighted average dumping margins.it works as follows commerce first determines a dumping margin for sales of a particular product by comparing the transaction price with the monthly weighted average normal value of that product,the price charged for the product in its home market.see.commerce then aggregates the dumping margins for all sales made below normal value.with respect to all sales made above normal value,sales,commerce assigns a dumping margin of zero.thus,when commerce calculates the weighted average dumping margin,the dumping margins for sales below normal value are not offset by negative dumping margins for those sales made above normal value.
in the second administrative review,which is at issue in this case,commerce employed the zeroing methodology to calculate the weighted average dumping margins for corus steel products.this court has held that although the antidumping statutes do not require the use of zeroing in calculating dumping margins,commerce zeroing methodology is a permissible interpretation of the statutory provisions.see corus staal bv dep t of commerce,timken united states.
corus does not directly challenge our decisions upholding commerce use of zeroing.rather,corus notes that commerce issued its final determination for the second administrative review in april,and it argues that subsequent events show that commerce has adopted a new policy with regard to zeroing and that the new policy should be applied to the second administrative review.
the new developments to which corus refers are the following in the european communities ec initiated a complaint before the world trade organization wto challenging the united states use of zeroing in certain antidumping investigations and administrative reviews.a wto panel initially found that the use of zeroing in antidumping investigations was inconsistent with the united states obligations under the wto agreement,but it upheld the use of zeroing in administrative reviews,both as such and as applied.see panel report,united,regulations and methodology for calculating dumping margins zeroing,a,c g.the wto appellate body subsequently reversed the portion of the panel decision that upheld the use of zeroing as applied to the administrative reviews challenged by the ec.see appellate body report,united,regulations and methodology for calculating dumping margins zeroing,a i,r.the panel report,as modified by the appellate body report,was then adopted by the wto dispute settlement body.united,regulations and methodology for calculating dumping margins zeroing,may.
following the wto panel decision,commerce announced that it would abandon the use of zeroing in conjunction with comparisons to calculate weighted average dumping margins in antidumping investigations and it sought comments on alternative approaches to be used in future investigations.antidumping proceedings calculation of the weighted average dumping margin during an antidumping duty investigation.after the panel report was adopted by the dispute settlement body,the united states stated that it would implement the dispute settlement body recommendations and rulings.see agreement under article b of the dsu,united,regulations and methodology for calculating dumping margins zeroing,see also press release,united states mission to the united nations in geneva,statements at the wto dispute settlement body meeting may.those statements,corus argues,demonstrate that commerce has abandoned the policy of zeroing.corus notes that commerce has since recalculated corus dumping margin without zeroing and,based on a finding of no dumping under that methodology,has revoked its antidumping order effective april.implementation of the findings of the wto panel in ec notice of determinations under section of the uruguay round agreements act and revocations and partial revocations of certain antidumping duty orders,may.corus now asks us to remand this case so that commerce can reconsider the final results of the second administrative review of the antidumping order in light of these recent developments.
we conclude that the events to which corus points do not require a different result in this case and that commerce has made amply clear that its new policy regarding zeroing would not apply to the administrative review at issue here.subsequent to corus filing of this appeal,commerce issued its final results in the fourth administrative review of the antidumping order.that ruling is particularly instructive,as there do not appear to be any relevant differences between that administrative review and the administrative review at issue in this case.in that decision,commerce addressed the same issues that corus now asserts need to be decided by commerce in the first instance.commerce decision in that review makes clear that its policy has not changed with respect to the retrospective application of the zeroing methodology and that a remand to commerce in this case would therefore serve no useful purpose.
it is clear that commerce intends to apply its new policy on zeroing only prospectively.section of the uruguay round agreements act uraa states that the implementation of adverse wto decisions applies to unliquidated entries that enter or are withdrawn from the warehouse on or after the date that the trade representative directs implementation.c b see also statement of administrative action for the uraa,doc,vol.i at,reprinted in.accordingly,commerce stated in the fourth administrative review that it is not altering its administrative review determination as a result of the prospective revocation of the order.issues and decision memorandum for the administrative review of certain carbon steel flat products from the netherlands final results of antidumping duty administrative review,itadoc may.
when commerce announced the elimination of zeroing in conjunction with the use of comparisons to calculate dumping margins in antidumping investigations,it stated that the new policy did not apply to any other type of proceeding,including administrative reviews.antidumping proceedings calculation of the dumping margin during an antidumping investigation final modification.thus,commerce new policy has no bearing on the present appeal,just as it had no effect on the final determination of corus fourth administrative review.
corus notes that the wto appellate body recently found that the use of zeroing in administrative reviews is inconsistent with the united states obligations under the antidumping agreement.see appellate body report,united relating to zeroing and sunset reviews,r.corus claims that the united states has committed to comply with that ruling based on statements it made to the dispute settlement body.see press release,mission to the united nations in geneva,statement at the wto dispute settlement body meeting.the united states,however,expressed strong reservations concerning any such implementation,noting that it considers that the appellate body findings relating to zeroing outside the context of comparisons in investigations are devoid of legal merit,that the findings suggest forms of implementation that simply make no sense from a policy perspective,and that i t is difficult to conclude that members agreed upon such an illogical outcome.id.furthermore,the united states commented that although it intends to comply in this dispute with its wto obligations,it will be considering carefully how to do so.id.those statements do not amount to the unequivocal adoption of the wto decision suggested by corus.
during the fourth administrative review,commerce considered the effect of the most recent wto decision.corus argued that,in light of that decision,commerce interpretation of the statute as allowing continued use of zeroing was inconsistent with the united states international obligations and therefore unreasonable.commerce found otherwise,stating that b ecause no change has yet been made with respect to the issue of zeroing in administrative reviews,the department will continue with its current approach to calculating and assessing antidumping duties in this administrative review.may issues and decisions memorandum.
as we observed in a previous case in which corus challenged commerce zeroing methodology,we accord commerce substantial deference in its administration of the antidumping statute.we explained that we will not attempt to perform duties that fall within the exclusive province of the political branches,and we therefore refuse to overturn commerce zeroing practice based on any ruling by the wto or other international body unless and until such ruling has been adopted pursuant to the specified statutory scheme.corus staal bv dep t of commerce.to the extent that recent developments have changed the current scheme,commerce has made it clear that those changes do not apply retroactively to administrative reviews.thus,our previous determination that commerce policy of zeroing is permissible under the statute applies to the challenged administrative review 
corus next appeals commerce classification of certain of its sales to an unaffiliated customer as constructed export price cep transactions rather than export price ep transactions.commerce calculates dumping margins by comparing the normal value of subject merchandise to its price in the united states.as noted,the normal value is the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold for consumption in the exporting country.a b.the price is calculated using either the ep or cep methodology.those terms are defined in a and b in relevant part as follows 
e xport price means the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold or agreed to be sold before the date of importation by the producer or exporter of the subject merchandise outside of the united states to an unaffiliated purchaser in the united states 
c onstructed export price means the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold or agreed to be sold in the united states before or after the date of importation by or for the account of the producer or exporter of such merchandise or by a seller affiliated with the producer or exporter 
due to certain adjustments made in calculating cep,see d,the use of cep is more likely to result in a determination of dumping,or in a higher dumping margin.see ak steel united states,noting that these deductions are meant to prevent foreign producers from competing unfairly in the united states market by inflating the price with amounts spent by the affiliate on marketing and selling the products in the united states.
corus classified its sales as ep transactions on the theory that the first sale or agreement to sell to an unaffiliated customer occurred before the date of importation.commerce found that the first sale occurred after the date of importation,and it therefore reclassified the sales as cep transactions.
corus sales process for the goods in question operated as follows first,corus issued frame agreements that set forth a general framework outlining the estimated volume and pricing of the unaffiliated customer likely purchases.second,when corus shipped merchandise to the united states,it issued pro forma invoices listing the shipped items for customs purposes.the goods were then stored at a warehouse in the united states until the customer placed a purchase order,at which point corus performed a price calculation based on the quantity ordered and market conditions.once a price was finalized and agreed upon,corus issued a sales invoice setting forth the terms of sale including product,quantity,and price.it then directed the goods to be shipped to the customer.upon receipt,the customer remitted payment to corus affiliate or,later,to corus directly.
commerce found that the final sales invoices setting forth the terms of sale represented the first sale or agreement to sell.corus concedes that there was no sale between corus and its customers until a final invoice was issued,but it argues that either the frame agreements or the pro forma invoices should have been deemed to represent the first agreement to sell and thus those sales should have been characterized as ep sales.
that argument is without merit.in essence,corus is arguing that the term agreement to sell covers what might best be termed a preliminary understanding between parties.corus effectively acknowledged as much in the trial court.see corus may,supplemental response under the frame agreements,there is no binding final agreement as to price,quantity or even specific products to be shipped.rather,they provide an operating framework under which the customer and corus can plan their business operations.see also corus april,supplemental response until the time of,corus the customer can change the quantity,price specific product to be shipped.neither a sale nor an agreement to sell occurs until there is mutual assent to the material terms price and quantity.with respect to the transactions at issue in this case,the mutual assent to price and quantity always occurred after the merchandise had been imported into the united states.under,those transactions thus may not be classified as ep sales.
corus argues that commerce approach impermissibly assigns the same meaning to both sale and agreement to sell,and therefore violates the canon of statutory construction that different terms used in the same statute presumptively have different meanings.corus contention is unpersuasive.an agreement to sell is a binding commitment that has not yet been consummated by the exchange of goods for consideration,the sale itself.see ak steel,at nsk united states,sale requires both a transfer of ownership to an unrelated party and consideration.as used in the statute,the terms sale and agreement to sell thus cover different types of transactions,and commerce approach does not result in according the two terms the same meaning.
corus argues that ak steel dictates that its sales be treated as ep transactions.in ak steel,we held that when the first sale to an unaffiliated customer is made by an exporter affiliate,that sale is treated as a cep transaction.at.contrary to corus claim,however,ak steel does not stand for the proposition that all sales by foreign sellers to unaffiliated customers should be considered ep transactions.in fact,ak steel states that transactions of the type at issue here,in which the sale made by a foreign producer or exporter occurs in the united states,should be treated as cep transactions.at see also id.at t he location of the sale appears to be critical to the distinction between the two categories.the statute,moreover,is clear on that point ep treatment is limited to transactions that occur between a seller outside the united states and a buyer inside the united states,before the date of importation.a.
corus argues that in its original investigation commerce concluded that the frame agreements constituted the first sale or agreement to sell.see notice of preliminary determination of sales at less than fair value certain carbon steel flat products from the netherlands,may.that characterization,however,is not accurate.commerce did not find that the frame agreements constituted the first sale or agreement to sell,but rather that the final written confirmation of price and quantity constituted the first sale or agreement to sell 
having reviewed the evidence on the record of this investigation regarding respondent reported ep sales,we conclude that sales between the foreign producer,corus staal and the customer were
