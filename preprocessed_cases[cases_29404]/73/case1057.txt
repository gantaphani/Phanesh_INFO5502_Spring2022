the plaintiffs sought relief from an anticipated contract between the state of washington and the swinomish indian tribe tribe regarding taxation of cigarette sales by indian retailers.the district court held that the tax injunction act tia,barred the action and dismissed it.the district court had jurisdiction over this timely appeal pursuant to and,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we affirm,but on grounds different from the district court.
washington law authorizes the governor to enter into contracts concerning the sale of cigarettes with certain indian tribes.such contracts must provide for a tribal cigarette tax in lieu of all state cigarette taxes and state and local sales and use taxes on sales of cigarettes in indian country by indian retailers,but the tribe may allow an exemption for sales to tribal members.id.the contracts must also provide that the tribal cigarette tax rate be one hundred percent of the state cigarette and state and local sales and use taxes within three years of enacting the tribal tax.id.tax revenue retained by a tribe must be used for certain statutorily defined essential government services.id,a.thus,cigarette tax contracts must provide that the state will not impose any tax,and must require a tribe to collect taxes effectively equal to the previously imposed state taxes,and use the revenue for essential government services.in addition,cigarette tax contracts must include a number of provisions regulating indian retailers activities,such as provisions requiring tax stamps,governing the purchase of cigarettes by retailers,and ensuring compliance.id.
marvin wilbur,marvin wilbur,and joan wilbur are enrolled members of the tribe and the operators of a retail store located on trust land within the swinomish indian reservation.in april,the wilburs filed an action against various washington officials and the department of revenue state alleging that the state and the tribe were negotiating a cigarette tax contract.they alleged that the statutes governing cigarette tax contracts and the proposed agreement violated the indian commerce clause,const.art.i,cl,the sherman antitrust act,the treaty of point elliot,stat,and a host of other constitutional and statutory provisions.the tribe was not named as a defendant.
the complaint requested,among other relief,a declaratory judgment that,and are void,unlawful and unenforceable as applied to cigarettes transported,distributed,received or sold by plaintiffs retail businesses located within the exterior boundaries of the swinomish reservation an injunction preventing the defendants from enforcing any provision of the statutes or contracting in any way with the swinomish tribe or any person or entity regarding a cigarette tax on any cigarettes to be received or sold by retail businesses within the exterior boundaries of the swinomish reservation and a declaration that any agreement or contract entered into by the swinomish tribe with defendants is invalid when attempted to be imposed or any way applied to plaintiffs.
the state filed a motion to dismiss the wilburs complaint,arguing that the wilburs lacked standing,that the tia and the eleventh amendment barred the wilburs action,that the tribe was an indispensable party,and that the complaint failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted.while that motion was pending,the state and the tribe executed a cigarette tax contract compact.however,because the parties did not inform the district court of this fact,the court was under the impression that the compact was still awaiting approval by the governor when it granted the state motion to dismiss.based largely on this misunderstanding,the court concluded that the tribe was not a necessary party.the court asserted that the wilburs likely lacked standing,but based its decision on the proposition that the tia deprived it of subject matter jurisdiction over the wilburs suit.therefore the district court dismissed the action without discussing the state other arguments.
the state urges us to affirm the district court ruling that the tia bars this action,or to affirm on one of the other grounds that it argued in the district court or on the additional ground that the case is now moot.see wolfe strankman,cir we may affirm the district court dismissal on any ground supported by the record.because we now know facts,undisclosed to the district court,bringing into question whether the tribe is an indispensable party pursuant to rule,we first determine whether we may proceed directly to the rule issue or whether we must first address jurisdictional issues.
the supreme court has adhered to the requirement that a court address questions pertaining to its or a lower court jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits.tenet doe,d,citing steel citizens for a better environment,d.however,
w hile steel reasoned that jurisdiction necessarily precedes a ruling on the merits,the same principle does not dictate a sequencing of jurisdictional issues.a court that dismisses on grounds such as personal jurisdiction,before finding jurisdiction,makes no assumption of power that violates the separation of powers principles underlying mansfield ry.swan.and steel company.it is hardly novel for a federal court to choose among threshold grounds for denying audience to a case on the merits.thus,as the court observed in steel,district courts do not overstep article iii limits when they decline jurisdiction of claims on discretionary grounds without determining whether those claims fall within their pendent jurisdiction,or abstain under younger harris,d,without deciding whether the parties present a case or controversy.
ruhrgas ag marathon oil,d citations omitted see also kowalski tesmer,d assuming existence of article iii standing and addressing alternative threshold question whether prudential requirements of standing were satisfied.
the difficulty here is that it is unclear whether a rule issue is the sort of threshold question to which a court may directly proceed without first addressing other threshold questions.we are unaware of any case discussing how rule fits within the steel ruhrgas scheme,and the parties have not briefed the issue.moreover,it is not always easy to determine whether a particular issue is the type of threshold matter which,if decided adversely to the plaintiff,obviates the need to address other threshold questions.compare cooper tire rubber,cir holding that district court erred in dismissing the case on forum non conveniens grounds without first determining whether it had subject matter jurisdiction with monegasque de reassurances nak naftogaz of ukraine,cir holding that court could pass over question of statutory subject matter jurisdiction and go directly to a forum non conveniens issue compare also calderon ashmus,d stating that court must first address whether action presented article iii case or controversy before addressing eleventh amendment issue and cox city of dallas,cir stating that article iii standing must be examined before the eleventh amendment with snoeck brussa,cir because the eleventh amendment bar conclusively ends this dispute we need not address the related issue of article iii standing which the district court found plaintiffs lacked and pederson.state,cir addressing issues of article iii standing and state sovereign immunity in no particular order.
although there is no clear precedent,we conclude that jurisdictional issues should be decided before reaching the rule issue.this is so because questions of subject matter jurisdiction,the courts statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case,steel,at,must generally be decided before the merits.see ruhrgas,at.a federal court may not hypothesize jurisdiction for the purpose of deciding the merits.thus,we must decide the questions of standing and mootness,both of which go to the article iii jurisdiction of this court and the courts below,arizonans for official english arizona,d,as well as the question whether the tia barred subject matter jurisdiction.see arkansas farm credit servs.of cent,d we have interpreted and applied the tax injunction act as a jurisdictional rule and a broad jurisdictional barrier quoting moe confederated salish kootenai tribes of flathead reservation,d.we have also held that we may not bypass an eleventh amendment issue in favor of deciding the case on the merits.cardenas anzai,cir,citing cal.franchise tax bd.jackson in re jackson,cir.thus,we will decide certain jurisdictional issues before turning to the rule question.
to satisfy article iii standing requirements,a plaintiff must show she has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.bernhardt county of los angeles,cir,quoting friends of earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d.standing is a question of law reviewed de novo.id.at.
a plaintiff has the burden of establishing the elements required for standing,and f or purposes of ruling on a motion to dismiss for want of standing,both the trial and reviewing courts must accept as true all material allegations of the complaint,and must construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party.takhar kessler,cir,quoting warth seldin,d.
as with all questions of subject matter jurisdiction except mootness,standing is determined as of the date of the filing of the complaint the party invoking the jurisdiction of the court can not rely on events that unfolded after the filing of the complaint to establish its standing.kitty hawk aircargo,chao,cir quotation marks and citations omitted see also lujan defenders of wildlife,d stating that t he existence of federal jurisdiction ordinarily depends on the facts as they exist when the complaint is filed and rejecting argument that events which occurred after filing retroactively created a redressability and hence a jurisdiction that did not exist at the outset quoting,d emphasis in lujan.thus,we examine whether the wilburs had standing under the facts extant at the time of filing,when the compact had not yet been signed.
the complaint alleged anticipated injuries from two types of provisions in the proposed compact.the first anticipated injury concerns provisions of the compact imposing taxes on sales to other tribe members and the second anticipated injury relates to compliance with the regulatory scheme articulated in.we need not get to the first if we conclude that the wilburs had standing to seek prospective relief to prevent the regulatory burden.we therefore turn to that issue.
the regulations contemplated by the proposed compact would cause the wilburs cognizable economic injury by forcing them to incur additional costs.see clark city of lakewood,cir the court routinely recognizes economic injury resulting from governmental actions as sufficient to satisfy the article iii injury in fact requirement quoting clinton city of new york,d.the district court stated that because the compact had not been executed,the injury was likely not actual or imminent.however,the wilburs sought a declaration that the challenged statutes were invalid,an injunction preventing the consummation of any cigarette tax contract pursuant to those statutes,and a declaration that any contract actually executed was invalid.while plaintiffs seeking injunctive and declaratory relief must show that the feared harm is actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical,o ne does not have to await the consummation of threatened injury before challenging a statute.canatella state of california,cir,quoting lujan,at,and babbitt united farm workers union,d.nothing in the complaint suggests that,at the time of filing,the compact consummation was not certainly impending.lujan,at,quoting whitmore arkansas,d.on the contrary,the complaint alleged that the state and tribe were in negotiations and that the compact would be executed within the near future.at the pleading stage,we accept this allegation as true.see takhar,at.thus,the prospect of injury to the wilburs from the proposed compact was sufficiently imminent to satisfy the requirement of an injury in fact.
the causation and redressability requirements are also satisfied.true,the wilburs injury was partly dependent on the actions of the tribe,in the sense that the compact could not be executed without its participation.see yesler terrace cmty.council cisneros,cir i t usually is difficult to establish causation and redressibility when a plaintiff alleged injury depends on the actions of a third party not before the court.but the opposite is also true had the state not enacted statutes authorizing cigarette tax contracts and negotiated with the tribe,the prospect of injury from the proposed compact would not have materialized.thus,the wilburs injuries are adequately traceable to the state actions.see artichoke joe norton,d,where plaintiffs sued governor and sought declaration that gaming compacts between state and indian tribes violated federal law,causation was satisfied because the governor approved the compacts that gave rise to the plaintiffs injuries,aff,cir agreeing with district court standing analysis.indeed,we have held that causation was satisfied at the pleading stage where the connection between the defendants conduct and the plaintiff injury was more tenuous than that involved here.see bernhardt,at where plaintiff alleged that a s a direct result of the county policy of settling civil rights actions for a lump sum including attorney fees,plaintiff has been unable to obtain a civil rights lawyer,plaintiff pleading adequately established the causation element required for standing.
redressability likewise is satisfied.plaintiffs need not demonstrate that there is a guarantee that their injuries will be redressed by a favorable decision p laintiffs must show only that a favorable decision is likely to redress their injuries,not that a favorable decision will inevitably redress their injuries.graham fema,cir citation omitted.the wilburs requests for prospective relief,if granted,would have been likely to redress the injury from the anticipated compact.we hold that the requirements of article iii standing are satisfied.
the state contends that the case is moot because the wilburs sought an injunction barring the state from consummating the compact with the tribe,and the compact has now been executed.however,the wilburs sought not only such an injunction,but also declaratory relief voiding several statutes and any cigarette tax contract executed by the state and tribe.t he controversy regarding these requests for relief is as live now as it was when the wilburs first sought relief.pac.transp.pub.util.comm n,cir.thus,although the wilburs request for an injunction might be moot,this does not prevent us from considering other requests for relief which are not moot.see powell mccormack,d where several forms of relief are requested and one of these requests subsequently becomes moot,the court has still considered the remaining requests pac.transp,at although one claim was moot,court may address the remaining,live claims.
the district court held that the tia deprived it of subject matter jurisdiction over the wilburs action.we review the district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,as well as its interpretation of a federal statute,de novo.see may trucking oregon dep t of,cir.the tia provides 
the district courts shall not enjoin,suspend or restrain the assessment,levy or collection of any tax under state law where a plain,speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such state.
in dismissing the action,the district court did not conclude that the wilburs sought to enjoin,suspend or restrain the assessment,levy or collection of a tax under washington law.rather,the court held that the anticipated tribal tax arises under state law for purposes of the tax injunction act because,among other reasons,i n the absence of the anticipated compact indian retailers selling cigarettes to individuals who are not members of the tribe could be required to collect state taxes on such transactions.see united states baker,cir t he right of a state to impose and enforce a tax on cigarettes sold by indians to nontribal members is clearly established.
the district court focus on the anticipated tribal tax misses the point.even accepting the premise that the wilburs suit sought to enjoin,suspend or restrain the assessment,levy or collection of the tribal tax which the wilburs dispute,the anticipated tribal tax was not a state tax.if the tribe imposed a tax independently of any contract with the state and retained the revenues,the tia would not apply to a suit seeking to enjoin,suspend or restrain the assessment,levy or collection of that tax for the obvious reason that the tribe is not a state.bluebeard castle,gov t of the virgin islands,cir tia does not apply to virgin islands because it is not a state.we are aware of no authority for the proposition that a tax under tribal law is transformed into a tax under state law simply because the tribe agrees to enact that law in exchange for a promise by the state not to levy similar taxes.such an agreement does not alter the fact that the tribe remains the taxing authority and the sovereign to which tax payments are remitted.thus,the question is not whether the wilburs sought to enjoin,suspend or restrain the assessment,levy or collection of a tribal tax,but whether they sought to enjoin,suspend or restrain the assessment,levy or collection of a washington tax.
we are assisted by the supreme court decision in hibbs winn,d.in hibbs,the plaintiffs challenged a state law authorizing certain tax credits,and sought to enjoin the law operation,on establishment clause grounds.see id.at.the court rejected the position that the tia prevent s interference with all aspects of tax administration,id.at quotation marks omitted,and held that the tia did not bar the plaintiffs action because that action,if successful,would result in the state receiving more funds that could be used for the public benefit.may trucking,at,quoting hibbs.at.thus,a fter hibbs,the dispositive question in determining whether the act jurisdictional bar applies is whether f relief would have operated to reduce the flow of state tax revenue,quoting hibbs.at.although hibbs had not been decided at the time of the district court decision,our decision which hibbs affirmed,winn killian,cir,had been.
here,the wilburs sought a declaration of the invalidity of the statutes governing cigarette tax contracts,an injunction preventing the state from entering into any contract,and a declaration that any agreement actually executed was void.this relief would not have operated to reduce the flow of washington tax revenues instead,it would have prevented the state from agreeing not to impose a tax.thus,the district court erroneously dismissed the case on tia grounds.
the state argues that the tia applies because the cigarette tax contract scheme benefits the state by saving the state resources in enforcing collection of the state taxes,and points to a legislative finding that cigarette tax contracts will enhance enforcement of the state cigarette tax law,ultimately saving the state money and reducing conflict.emphasis added.because the wilburs action,if successful,might harm the public fisc by depriving the state of the benefits of cigarette tax contracts,the state submits that it should be barred by the tia.but the tia proscribes only those actions which would operate to decrease a state tax revenue,see may trucking,at,not any lawsuit which might place financial burdens upon the state.whatever impact the wilburs action might have on the state litigation and enforcement costs,it surely will not reduce the state tax revenues.further,the state prediction about how this action might affect the state financial bottom line in the future is too speculative to circumvent the holding of hibbs.
nor do principles of comity bar this lawsuit.the supreme court has relied on such principles to preclude original jurisdiction only when plaintiffs have sought aid in order to arrest or countermand state tax collection.hibbs.at.the wilburs seek no such relief.
the state also argues that the eleventh amendment precludes the wilburs action,another jurisdictional hurdle we must discuss,even though the district court did not address this argument.
the eleventh amendment bars suits against a state or its agencies,regardless of the relief sought,unless the state unequivocally consents to a waiver of its immunity.yakama indian nation state of.dep t of revenue,cir.the wilburs concede that the state has not waived its immunity and that all claims against the state and its agency,the department of revenue,must therefore be dismissed.
however,the wilburs properly contend that the eleventh amendment does not bar their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against the governor and the director and assistant director of the department of revenue.since the supreme court decision in ex parte young,courts have recognized an exception to the eleventh amendment bar for suits for prospective declaratory and injunctive relief against state officers,sued in their official capacities,to enjoin an alleged ongoing violation of federal law.agua caliente band of cahuilla indians hardin,cir see also los angeles county bar ass eu,cir t he eleventh amendment does not bar actions seeking only prospective declaratory or injunctive relief against state officers in their official capacities.
i n determining whether the doctrine of ex parte young avoids an eleventh amendment bar to suit,a court need only conduct a straightforward inquiry into whether the complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.acs of fairbanks,gci communication,cir order,quoting verizon,pub.serv.comm n,d.the complaint alleged that the challenged statutes authorize the state to enter into agreements which violate federal law and,accordingly,sought a declaration that the statutes were invalid,an injunction preventing the state from utilizing the authority granted by those statutes to enter into any agreement,and a declaration that any agreement entered was invalid.the complaint therefore alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.see also artichoke joe,d at ex parte young permitted claim against governor seeking declaration that gaming compacts between state and indian tribes violated federal law.thus,the state of washington and its department of revenue must be dismissed but not the individual government officers.
with these jurisdictional issues behind us,we can now address the rule question.in the district court,the state argued that the action should be dismissed pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b because the tribe is an indispensable party pursuant to rule.the district court held that the tribe was not a necessary party.we generally review for an abuse of discretion the district court decision regarding joinder,but review de novo any legal conclusions underlying that decision.see disabled rights action comm.las vegas events,cir.
application of rule involves three successive inquiries.eeoc peabody coal,cir.
first,the court must determine whether a nonparty should be joined under rule a.we and other courts use the term necessary to describe those p ersons to b e j oined if f easible.
if an absentee is a necessary party under rule a,the second stage is for the court to determine whether it is feasible to order that the absentee be joined 
finally,if joinder is not feasible,the court must determine at the third stage whether the case can proceed without the absentee,or whether the absentee is an indispensable party such that the action must be dismissed rule uses the word indispensable only in a conclusory sense,that is,a person is regarded as indispensable when he can not be made a party and,upon consideration of the factors in rule b,it is determined that in his absence it would be preferable to dismiss the action,rather than to retain it.
id.at citations omitted.we address each of these inquiries in turn.
the state argues that the tribe is a necessary party because the tribe claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the
