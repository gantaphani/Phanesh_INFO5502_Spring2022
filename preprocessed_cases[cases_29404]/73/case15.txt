petitioners hereinafter mayo offer residency programs to doctors who have graduated from medical school and seek additional instruction in a chosen specialty.those programs train doctors primarily through experience.although residents are required to take part in formal educational activities,these doctors generally spend the bulk of their time typically to hours a week caring for patients.mayo pays its residents annual stipends of over and also provides them with health insurance,malpractice insurance,and paid vacation time.
the federal insurance contributions act fica requires employees and employers to pay taxes on all wages employees receive,a,a,and defines wages to include all remuneration for employment,a.fica defines employment as any service performed by an employee for the person employing him,b,but excludes from taxation any service performed in the employ of a school,college,or university if such service is performed by a student who is enrolled and regularly attending classes at the school,b.since,the treasury department has construed the student exception to exempt from taxation students who work for their schools as an incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study.fed.reg.in,the department issued regulations providing that t he services of a employee which includes an employee normally scheduled to work hours or more per week are not incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study.cfr b d iii.the department explained that this analysis is not affected by the fact that the services may have an educational,instructional,or training aspect.ibid.the rule offers as an example a medical resident whose normal schedule requires him to perform services or more hours per week,and concludes that the resident is not a student.
mayo filed suit asserting that this rule was invalid,and the district court agreed.it found the employee rule inconsistent with unambiguous text and concluded that the factors governing this court analysis in national muffler dealers,united states,also indicated that the rule was invalid.the eighth circuit reversed.applying chevron natural resources defense council,the court of appeals concluded that the department regulation was a permissible interpretation of an ambiguous statute.
held the treasury department employee rule is a reasonable construction of b.
a under chevron framework,the court first asks whether congress has directly addressed the precise question at issue.at.congress has not done so here the statute does not define student or otherwise attend to the question whether medical residents are subject to fica.
b the parties debate whether the court should next apply chevron step two or the analysis used to review a tax regulation in national muffler.absent a justification to do so,this court is not inclined to apply a less deferential framework to evaluate treasury department regulations than it uses to review rules adopted by any other agency.the court has r ecogniz ed the importance of maintaining a uniform approach to judicial review of administrative action.dickinson zurko.and the principles underlying chevron apply with full force in the tax context.chevron recognized that an agency power to administer a congressionally created program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left by congress.at.filling gaps in the internal revenue code plainly requires the treasury department to make interpretive choices for statutory implementation at least as complex as the ones made by other agencies in administering their statutes.
it is true that the employee rule,like the rule at issue in national muffler,was promulgated under the department general authority to prescribe all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement of the internal revenue code.a.it is also true that this court,in opinions predating chevron,stated that it owed less deference to a rule adopted under that general grant of authority than it would afford rules issued pursuant to more specific grants.see rowan united states,united states vogel fertilizer.since then,however,the court has found chevron deference appropriate when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.united states mead.chevron and mead provide the appropriate framework for evaluating the employee rule.the department issued the rule pursuant to an explicit authorization to prescribe needful rules and regulations,and only after procedures.the court has recognized these to be good indicators of a rule meriting chevron deference,mead,at.
c the rule easily satisfies chevron second step.mayo accepts the treasury department determination that an individual may not qualify for the student exception unless the educational aspect of his relationship with his employer predominates over the service aspect of that relationship,but objects to the department conclusion that residents working more than hours per week categorically can not satisfy that requirement.mayo argues that the treasury department should be required to engage in a inquiry into what each employee does and why he does it,and that the department has arbitrarily distinguished between training and classroom instruction.but regulation,like legislation,often requires drawing lines.the department reasonably sought to distinguish between workers who study and students who work.focusing on the hours spent working and those spent in studies is a sensible way to accomplish that goal.the department thus has drawn a distinction between education and service,not between classroom instruction and training.the treasury department also reasonably concluded that its employee rule would improve administrability,fed.reg,and thereby has avoided the wasteful litigation and continuing uncertainty that would inevitably accompany a approach like the one mayo advocates,united states correll.moreover,the rule reasonably takes into account the social security administration concern that exempting residents from fica would deprive them and their families of vital social security disability and survivorship benefits.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit 
chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court.
nearly all americans who work for wages pay taxes on those wages under the federal insurance contributions act fica,which congress enacted to collect funds for social security.the question presented in this case is whether doctors who serve as medical residents are properly viewed as student s whose service congress has exempted from fica taxes under b.
most doctors who graduate from medical school in the united states pursue additional education in a specialty to become board certified to practice in that field.petitioners mayo foundation for medical education and research,mayo clinic,and the regents of the university of minnesota collectively mayo offer medical residency programs that provide such instruction.mayo residency programs,which usually last three to five years,train doctors primarily through experience.residents often spend between and hours a week caring for patients,typically examining and diagnosing them,prescribing medication,recommending plans of care,and performing certain procedures.residents are generally supervised in this work by more senior residents and by faculty members known as attending physicians.in,mayo paid its residents annual stipends ranging between and and provided them with health insurance,malpractice insurance,and paid vacation time.
mayo residents also take part in a formal and structured educational program.brief for petitioners internal quotation marks omitted.residents are assigned textbooks and journal articles to read and are expected to attend weekly lectures and other conferences.residents also take written exams and are evaluated by the attending faculty physicians.but the parties do not dispute that the bulk of residents time is spent caring for patients.
through the social security act and related legislation,congress has created a comprehensive national insurance system that provides benefits for retired workers,disabled workers,unemployed workers,and their families.see united states lee,and nn.congress funds social security by taxing both employers and employees under fica on the wages employees earn.see a tax on employees a tax on employers.congress has defined wages broadly,to encompass all remuneration for employment.a ed.and supp.iii.the term employment has a similarly broad reach,extending to any service,of whatever nature,performed by an employee for the person employing him.b.
congress has,however,exempted certain categories of service and individuals from fica demands.as relevant here,congress has excluded from taxation service performed in the employ of a school,college,or university if such service is performed by a student who is enrolled and regularly attending classes at such school,college,or university.b ed.the social security act,which governs workers eligibility for benefits,contains a corresponding student exception materially identical to b.a.
since,the treasury department has applied the student exception to exempt from taxation students who work for their schools as an incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study there.fed.reg.adopting regs,c see reg.b d,cfr b d.until,the department determined whether an individual work was incident to his studies by performing a analysis.the primary considerations in that analysis were the number of hours worked and the course load taken.see,rul,cum.bull.services of individual employed on a basis with a course load are not incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study 
for its part,the social security administration ssa also articulated in its regulations a approach to the corresponding student exception in the social security act.see cfr c.the ssa has,however,always held that resident physicians are not students.ssr,cum.bull.in,the court of appeals for the eighth circuit held that the ssa could not categorically exclude residents from student status,given that its regulations provided for a approach.see minnesota apfel.following that decision,the internal revenue service received more than claims seeking fica tax refunds on the ground that medical residents qualified as students under b of the internal revenue code.
facing that flood of claims,the treasury department determined that it wa s necessary to provide additional clarification of the ter m student as used in b,particularly with respect to individuals who perform services that are in the nature of on the job training.fed.reg.the department proposed an amended rule for comment and held a public hearing on it.see,at.
on december,the department adopted an amended rule prescribing that an employee service is incident to his studies only when t he educational aspect of the relationship between the employer and the employee,as compared to the service aspect of the relationship,is predominant.at reg.b d i,cfr b d i.the rule categorically provides that t he services of a employee as defined by the employer policies,but in any event including any employee normally scheduled to work hours or more per week are not incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study.fed.reg.reg.b d iii,cfr b d iii the employee rule.the amended provision clarifies that the department analysis is not affected by the fact that the services performed may have an educational,instructional,or training aspect.ibid.the rule also includes as an example the case of employee e,who is employed by university v as a medical resident.fed.reg.reg.b e,cfr b e example.because employee e normal work schedule calls for him to perform services or more hours per week,the rule provides that his service is not incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study,and he accordingly is not an exempt student under b.fed.reg,reg.b e,cfr b e example.
after the department promulgated the employee rule,mayo filed suit seeking a refund of the money it had withheld and paid on its residents stipends during the second quarter of.supp,regents of of united states,d,app.to pet.for cert.mayo asserted that its residents were exempt under b and that the treasury department employee rule was invalid.
the district court granted mayo motion for summary judgment.the court held that the employee rule is inconsistent with the unambiguous text of,which the court understood to dictate that an employee is a student so long as the educational aspect of his service predominates over the service aspect of the relationship with his employer.supp,at.the court also determined that the factors governing this court analysis of regulations set forth in national muffler dealers,united states,indicate that the employee exception is invalid.supp,at see app.to pet.for cert.
the government appealed,and the court of appeals reversed.applying our opinion in chevron natural resources defense council,the court of appeals concluded that the statute is silent or ambiguous on the question whether a medical resident working for the school is a student for purposes of b,and that the department amended regulation is a permissible interpretation of the statut e.at.
we granted mayo petition for certiorari.
we begin our analysis with the first step of the framework announced in chevron,supra,at,and ask whether congress has directly addressed the precise question at issue.we agree with the court of appeals that congress has not done so.the statute does not define the term student,and does not otherwise attend to the precise question whether medical residents are subject to fica.see b.
mayo nonetheless contends that the treasury department employee rule must be rejected under chevron step one.mayo argues that the dictionary definition of student one who engages in study by applying the mind to the acquisition of learning,whether by means of books,observation,or experiment plainly encompasses residents.brief for petitioners quoting oxford universal dictionary ed.and,mayo adds,residents are not excluded from that category by the only limitation on students congress has imposed under the statute that they be enrolled and regularly attending classes at a school.brief for petitioners quoting b.
mayo reading does not eliminate the statute ambiguity as applied to working professionals.in its reply brief,mayo acknowledges that a professor taking evening classes a person who presumably would satisfy the statute requirement and apply his mind to learning could be excluded from the exemption and taxed because he is not predominant ly a student.reply brief for petitioners.medical residents might likewise be excluded on the same basis the statute itself does not resolve the ambiguity.
the district court interpreted b as unambiguously foreclosing the department rule by mandating that an employee be deemed a student so long as the educational aspect of his service predominates over the service aspect of the relationship with his employer.supp,at.we do not think it possible to glean so much from the little that provides.in any event,the statutory text still would offer no insight into how congress intended predominance to be determined or whether congress thought that medical residents would satisfy the requirement.
to the extent congress has specifically addressed medical residents in,moreover,it has expressly excluded these doctors from exemptions they might otherwise invoke.see b b,c ii excluding medical residents from exemptions available to employees of the district of columbia and the united states.that choice casts doubt on any claim that congress specifically intended to insulate medical residents from fica reach in the first place.
in sum,neither the plain text of the statute nor the district court interpretation of the exemption speak s with the precision necessary to say definitively whether the statute applies to medical residents.united st
