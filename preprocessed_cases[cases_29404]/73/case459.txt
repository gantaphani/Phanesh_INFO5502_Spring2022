edward wesley roush,roush appeals the sentence imposed after his conviction for tax evasion,in violation of.
on february,roush received income in the form of wastemasters,stock for legal services he had performed during and.on september,roush caused shares to be issued to six business entities,none of which filed tax returns in.in roush tax return,which he filed in,he declared a taxable income of.he did not report the receipt of the wastemasters stock,although he did claim charitable contributions on his and tax returns for donating over million shares to john marshall law school.the government estimated that the value of the stock received in was approximately million and estimated that the corresponding tax loss was approximately.roush and others were indicted on counts of wire fraud,securities fraud,money laundering,and conspiracy roush was also indicted on one count of tax evasion.when he pleaded guilty to tax evasion,the remainder of the charges were dismissed.
the probation officer who prepared the presentence report psr calculated the amount of tax loss for sentencing purposes at,establishing a base offense level of.see sentencing guidelines hereinafter.after a increase for failure to report income in excess of derived from criminal activity,b,a increase for use of sophisticated means,b,and a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,a b,the probation officer determined roush total offense level was,resulting in a sentencing range of to months.roush objected to the adjustments for failure to report income derived from criminal activity and for use of sophisticated means.he also objected to the calculation of the tax loss.the district court held a sentencing hearing on the question of the appropriate measure of the tax loss.testimony focused on whether the stock,which was restricted,was valueless by the end of and what impact that had on the tax loss calculation.
the district court ultimately adopted the psr,specifically noting that it believed that the tax loss calculation in the psr was correct.however,the district court expressed concerns about the severity of the sentence in light of the fact that the stock was worthless by the end of stating that that computation significantly overstates the actual seriousness of the offense here.rather than using the psr per share value for the stock,the district court used the total value roush had placed on the shares donated to john marshall law school in both and,approximately the district court stated at sentencing but i think in terms of trying to determine a fair sentence and a fair reflection of the gravamen of the offense,i think taking the defendant own claimed amount of contribution,charitable contribution,is a fair reflection.applying the percent tax bracket to the total value of the charitable donations to determine the tax loss,the district court determined that the total offense level would be,resulting in a sentencing range of to.after being reminded of additional filings,the district court reduced the sentence again to months the district court also required restitution in the amount of,a special assessment of,and two years of supervised release.roush now appeals,contesting the calculation of the guidelines range contained in the psr and arguing that the sentence imposed is unreasonable.
roush,on appeal,first challenges the district court acceptance of the psr calculation of the tax loss,the use of the percent tax bracket,and the application of the enhancements for failure to report income derived from criminal activity and the use of sophisticated means.
tax loss is the total amount of loss that was the object of the offense.c see also united states clements,cir holding that tax loss means the tax deficiency assessed rather than the amount that the irs could actually recover.to calculate the total tax loss for purposes of the psr,the probation officer used the fair market value fmv of the stock on february,the date that roush became able to request delivery of the stock average trading price of.this amount was then multiplied by the number of shares.the value of the shares was then discounted by percent the total actual gross receipts were therefore.the probation officer then subtracted of reported gross income to reach the total unreported income of.after subtracting the itemized deductions and using the percent tax bracket,the total tax loss was.
roush argues,as he did at sentencing,that the tax loss used to determine the base offense level in the psr was incorrect.roush asserts that the stock should be valued at the close of the taxable year.he then argues that the value of the stock by the end of was de minimus worth per share if not utterly valueless because of the stock cancellation.he also argues that even during,the restricted nature of the stock further suppressed the value of the shares.we review the application of the guidelines de novo and factual findings for clear error.united states clark,cir reviewing the district court computation of the tax loss.
under the internal revenue code,when property is transferred in connection with the performance of services,the excess of the fair market value of such property determined without regard to any restriction other than a restriction which by its terms will never lapse at the first time the rights of the person having the beneficial interest in such property are transferable or are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture,whichever occurs earlier,over the amount if any paid for such property,shall be included in the gross income of the person who performed such services in the first taxable year a.for the purposes of the psr,the stock was valued on february,the date that roush was first able to request the issuance of the shares the government argues that this is the correct date.in contrast,roush argues that the stock should be valued at the end of the taxable year.
on february,roush had the right to request immediate issuance of the stock and thus,constructively received the stock.see arnwine,cir a cash basis taxpayer will be deemed to be in constructive receipt of income when it becomes available to him without substantial restrictions.see also reed,cir u nder the constructive receipt doctrine,a taxpayer recognizes taxable income when he has an unqualified,vested right to receive immediate payment.typically,stock is valued on the date the shares are issued.see champion,cir applying the rule that stock received as compensation for services rendered to the issuing corporation is taxable as ordinary income of an amount equal to the value of the stock at the date of issuance see also pledger,cir t he value of defendant compensation for purposes of taxation could be determined by reference to the fair market value of the stock on the day of purchase.because roush took constructive receipt of the stock on february,that is the correct date on which to establish valuation.see wolder,cir observing that stock is valued on the date of constructive receipt.the revenue ruling cited by roush in support of his argument that the stock should be valued at the end of is inapposite as it deals with the rescission of a contract that voided the transfer of property,thus extinguishing all taxable income.see rul.roush argument that the stock should have been valued at the end of the year fails.
furthermore,the fact that the stock was restricted at all times during did not render its fair market value either zero or de minimus for the purposes of income calculations.see mcdonald,at discussing how the fair market value of a share of stock is determined without regard to restrictions.this court has analyzed a situation in which a taxpayer purchased corporate stock pursuant to a stock option plan that was subject to certain restrictions on subsequent sale.pledger,at.the sales agreement in pledger stipulated that the restricted stock was worth only percent of its fair market value if sold pursuant to a private placement sale.id.at.the taxpayer argued that a unconstitutionally allowed congress to tax in excess of the value for which the stock could be sold.id.in rejecting this argument,we wrote 
when he purchased the stock,the value of his compensation for purposes of taxation could be determined by reference to the fair market value of the stock on the day of purchase.although taxpayer argues that the stock subject to the securities restrictions was worth only percent of its fair market value,taxpayer ignores the fact that the stipulation regarding the percent value pertained only to the discounted value if the stock were sold in another private placement sale.a stipulation as to the value of property if sold under certain circumstances does not necessarily reflect the value of the property in the hands of the current owner the full value of the stock existed from the moment of purchase it was only temporarily subject to a diminution in value if exchanged because of the securities restrictions.despite taxpayer claim to the contrary,there was no nonexistent value upon which he was taxed.
id.at.the court went on to note that the fact that a stock could radically decrease in value after the initial purchase was simply part of the risk any stockholder encounters when he purchases stock and concluded that congress may constitutionally tax the full fair market value at the time of purchase without regard to the temporary restriction.id.
this analysis is instructive.although roush shares were restricted,he could in fact sell them although a restricted stock can not be sold publically,it can be sold in a private sale.indeed,roush reported a sale of of the shares on december,valuing them at approximately per share.as this court observed in pledger,the fact that stock is restricted,or even specifically valued for the purposes of private sales at less than the fair market value,does not affect the valuation of the shares for income purposes 
therefore,the district court did not clearly err when it used the fair market value of the shares on february,to determine the tax loss.
roush argues that the district court erred in placing him in the percent tax bracket when determining the total tax loss.he contends that under the sentencing guidelines,the tax loss shall be treated as equal of percent of the unreported gross income unless a more accurate determination of the tax loss can be made.c a see also united states cseplo,cir.roush did not object to the use of the percent tax bracket during sentencing and we therefore review for plain error.see united states hoover,cir applying the clear error standard of review to the district court choice of applicable tax bracket where appellant objected below see also united states mccaskey,cir noting that unobjected to findings of fact are subject to plain error review.
roush brief simply asserts that the percent tax bracket is incorrect,but offers no reasons why the use of the percent tax bracket constitutes plain error.the probation officer applied the percent tax bracket when calculating the total tax loss.a psr bears sufficient indicia of reliability to considered evidence.united states cothran,cir.in addition,during the sentencing hearing,the irs analyst also used the percent figure.see united states thomas,cir sworn testimony given by a government agent at a sentencing hearing generally bears sufficient indicia of reliability to be considered by the trial judge during sentencing.united states aubin,cir upholding the tax loss calculation of irs investigative agents.roush has offered no rebuttal evidence that the percent tax bracket was incorrect and thus,the district court did not plainly err.
roush challenges the enhancement for use of sophisticated means.see b mandating a increase if the offense involved sophisticated means.we review the district court factual finding that the defendant used sophisticated means to impede discovery of his offense for clear error.united states clements,cir.
when roush requested the issuance of the wastemasters stock,he had the shares issued to six companies,which the psr characterized as shell companies.the relevant guidelines commentary notes that hiding assets or transactions,or both,through the use of fictitious entities,corporate shells,or offshore financial accounts ordinarily indicates sophisticated means,cmt.we must consider the commentary to the guidelines as authoritative.united states wise,cir failure to follow such commentary could constitute an incorrect application of the guidelines.roush asserts,without further elaboration,that the existence of six corporate entities does not trigger the adjustment.because roush has not demonstrated that the district court was incorrect to follow the guidelines commentary,the district court did not clearly err in imposing a enhancement for use of sophisticated means.see clements,at holding that defendant use of multiple cashiers checks and his wife separate bank account to obscure the link between the money and himself constituted sophisticated means.
roush challenges the enhancement for failure to report income over that resulted from criminal activity,in this case,the fraudulent suit against wastemasters.see b.again,we review for clear error.see united states creech,cir.
roush contends that the government failed to adduce evidence that the source of the income was criminal activity.he does not,however,support this argument.roush thus fails to rebut the psr finding that the stock was derived from a criminal fraud conspiracy to use a lawsuit to force wastemasters to issue million shares of its stock to the.as discussed above,information in the psr that is unrebutted by the defendant bears sufficient indicia of reliability to be considered evidence by the district court.see cothran,at.
roush also argues for the first time on appeal that this provision violates the fifth amendment right against because it penalizes failure to criminal activity.this argument also fails.the point of the enhancement,as discussed in the application notes,is to further deterrence,particularly in light of the chronic of income.see b cmt.background.the increase does not itself force an individual to disclose the income,but merely takes into account the source of income when penalizing.see united states sullivan.holding that the requirement that income from illicit traffic in liquor be disclosed did not violate the constitution,stating i t would be an extreme if not extravagant application of the fifth amendment to say that it authorized a man to refuse to state the amount of his income because it had been made in crime united states johnson,cir holding that requiring disclosure of income,even income derived from illegal activity,on a tax return does not violate the fifth amendment,noting that the individual retains the option of disclosing the income without revealing its source.thus,the district court did not clearly err in imposing the enhancement for failure to report more than derived from criminal activity.
in addition to his objections to the psr,roush contends that the district court sentence was unreasonable because it was based on an incorrect tax loss value.to support this argument,he reasserts his contention that the stock was valueless by the end of the year.he also argues that it was unreasonable to include the charitable donations in the calculations because there was no evidence in the record that his tax returns were falsified.
here,the calculated guidelines range was to months roush received a sentence.the district court expressed its discomfort with the to month guidelines range based on its understanding of the relative worthlessness of the defendant stock at the end of the tax year and,thus,imposed a lower sentence,basing its calculation on the reported charitable deductions for gifts of the stock.the district court stated during sentencing 
it my view that the government is correct with regard to the calculation of income tax.i am going to vary from the guidelines because i think under these circumstances,although the tax calculation i believe is correct,given the fact that within the same tax year the stock became essentially worthless,i think that that computation significantly overstates the actual seriousness of the offense here.
it may be technically a correct calculation of what the internal revenue code calls for,but i think under the circumstances with
