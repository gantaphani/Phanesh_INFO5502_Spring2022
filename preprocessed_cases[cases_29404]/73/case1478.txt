the hunt construction group,hunt appeals the decision of the united states court of federal claims granting summary judgment that the united states is not liable to pay state and local sales and use taxes under a contract between hunt and the department of veterans affairs dva.hunt constr.group,united states,fed.cl.because the contract unambiguously required hunt to pay state and local sales and use taxes,and did not require the united states to execute an agency agreement,we affirm.
background 
in may,dva issued a solicitation for proposals the solicitation for construction of a hospital in arizona.two provisions concerning state and local taxes were contained in the solicitation federal acquisition regulation far,and a special notice.section states in pertinent part that t he contract price includes all applicable federal,state,and local taxes and duties.far b.the special notice,appearing on a sheet of green paper immediately following the table of contents,provided that sales and use tax exemptions should be sought where applicable.
the parties agree that the only potentially applicable exemption from state taxes under arizona law relates to purchases of permanent materials by qualifying hospitals or their agents.to be eligible for this exemption under arizona law,a contractor like hunt must be designated as the purchasing agent of the relevant government agency.on that point,section a of the far provides that prime contractors and subcontractors shall not normally be designated as agents of the government for the purpose of claiming immunity from state or local sales and use taxes.far a.the government disfavors such agency agreements because they alter the nature of the relationship and duties between the government and the contractor,and may require additional government resources to administer the contract.
hunt submitted a bid on june.hunt did not communicate to dva that it excluded from its bid state and local sales and use taxes for permanent materials.hunt excluded those taxes because,according to hunt,it assumed that dva would designate the successful bidder as its agent in order to secure the tax exemption.hunt did not consult counsel before submitting its bid,nor did it take far a into account when formulating its bid.dva awarded the contract to hunt on august.the final contract included both far and the special notice.
hunt immediately began construction.on january,hunt requested that the contracting officer sign an agency agreement designating hunt as its purchasing agent.the contracting officer ultimately declined to do so,explaining that hunt request was not in the interest of the government.without an agency agreement,hunt was ineligible for the tax exemption.hunt then submitted a claim to the contracting officer for reimbursement of the sales and use taxes it paid.the contracting officer denied hunt claim on june,relying on far a.
hunt brought suit in the court of federal claims seeking,representing the amount it paid for sales and use taxes that it did not include in its bid,plus interest.the court of federal claims denied hunt motion for summary judgment and granted the government for summary judgment,finding that the contract unambiguously required hunt to pay sales and use taxes and did not obligate the government to designate hunt as its agent.hunt constr.group,fed.cl.at.specifically,the court of federal claims found,inter alia,that far,taken together with the special notice,was unambiguous.id.
this timely appeal followed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
the primary issue on appeal is whether the court of federal claims correctly interpreted the provisions of the contract as unambiguously requiring hunt to pay state and local taxes,and as not requiring the government to designate hunt as its agent.this question of contract interpretation is one of law,and we review the court of federal claims interpretation without deference.barseback kraft ab united states.
we begin with the plain language when interpreting a contract.mcabee,united states.a contract is ambiguous only when it is susceptible to two reasonable interpretations.northwest,united states.the contract must be considered as a whole and interpreted to effectuate its spirit and purpose,giving reasonable meaning to all parts.gould,united states.
hunt contends that it is entitled to reimbursement from the government for the state and local sales and use taxes it paid on permanent construction materials,because,even if far is unambiguous on its face,the special notice introduced ambiguity into the contract.hunt claims to have interpreted far together with the special notice as indicating an intent by dva to take advantage of the available sales and use tax exemptions by designating the successful bidder as purchasing agent the government urges us to look no further than the plain language of the contract to find that hunt was unambiguously required to pay those taxes.
the tax exemption provisions of the contract are unambiguous and do not support hunt interpretation.far plainly instructed bidders that t he contract price includes all applicable federal,state,and local taxes and duties.far.the special notice did not introduce ambiguity.it simply notified bidders that s ales and use tax exemptions should be sought where applicable.the special notice did not state that dva intended to designate the successful bidder as its agent to secure certain tax exemptions.nothing in the special notice contradicts the clear language of far.the existence of section a,providing that the government shall not normally designate contractors as its agents,makes it particularly inappropriate to interpret the special notice as imposing an obligation on the government to execute an agency agreement.although hunt claims to have been unaware of section a when it prepared its bid,and this section apparently was not included in the contract,it is not unfair to charge hunt with constructive notice of pertinent regulations published in the federal register.fed.crop ins.merrill.just as everyone is charged with knowledge of the united states statutes at large,congress has provided that the appearance of rules and regulations in the federal register gives legal notice of their contents.see.
in sum,we agree with the court of federal claims that the special notice merely put offerors on notice that exemptions might be available and that the offerors themselves remain ed responsible for taking actions necessary to obtain those exemptions.hunt constr.group,fed.cl.at.when the contract language is unambiguous on its face,our inquiry ends,and the plain language of the contract controls.see textron def.widnall.
hunt argues,however,that the language of far together with the special notice,even if unambiguous on its face,must be considered in light of the particular circumstances surrounding the procurement.specifically,hunt argues that we should consider evidence of local trade practice before determining whether the contract is ambiguous.to that end,hunt argues that arizona public authorities routinely appoint contractors as their agents to secure tax exemptions.hunt could not below,and can not now,identify a single instance where a federal agency had executed such an agency agreement with a construction contractor.rather,hunt only pointed to instances where state and local agencies have executed such agreements.
hunt relies on metric constructors,national aeronautics space administration,in arguing that the existence of trade practice can render a contract ambiguous that is otherwise clear on its face.metric stands for no such proposition,and hunt reliance on metric is misplaced.hunt surprisingly fails to discuss our later decision in jowett,united states,which distinguished metric.in jowett,we recognized that evidence of trade practice may be useful in interpreting a contract term having an accepted industry meaning different from its ordinary where the contract otherwise appears the parties to a contract can be their own lexicographers and trade practice may serve that lexicographic function in some cases.id.at.consideration of trade practice may be a useful interpretation aid where
