in this case,we must consider whether a lender who pays a debtor ad valorem taxes and receives a transfer of the local taxing authority tax lien under texas law holds a tax claim protected from modification by of the bankruptcy code.we conclude that the lender claim is a tax claim,and that the interest rate due thereon may not be modified by a debtor chapter reorganization plan.we therefore affirm the district court judgment.
glenn and elizabeth thompson owed ad valorem property taxes on their home in humble,texas,for and to the humble independent school district,harris county,and the harris county municipal utility district collectively the taxing authorities.in february,they borrowed funds from tax ease funding,and,pursuant to texas law,authorized tax ease to pay the taxes on their behalf.see.tax code.the thompsons executed a promissory note agreeing to repay the debt amount of over a ten year period with an annual interest rate of.in return for providing the funds,tax ease received a transfer of the taxing authorities tax liens against the thompsons property.
in april,the thompsons filed in the united states bankruptcy court a voluntary petition for chapter reorganization.their reorganization plan proposed to repay the debt to tax ease at an annual interest rate of only.tax ease objected to the plan on the ground that under its claim for repayment was a tax claim for which the interest rate must be determined by nonbankruptcy law and may not be modified by the bankruptcy court.tax ease sought by its objection to preserve its contract rate of interest.
the bankruptcy court disagreed with tax ease.it reasoned that because tax ease paid the thompsons taxes,the tax claim was extinguished.although tax ease received a transfer of the tax lien,the bankruptcy court held that the claim for payment was based on the new promissory note and could be modified.after the bankruptcy court denied tax ease objection,but before it confirmed the thompsons plan,tax ease filed a notice of appeal to the district court.the bankruptcy court subsequently confirmed the plan in a separate written order.tax ease appeal to the district court was consolidated with another case presenting the same issue.
the district court reversed the bankruptcy court order and held that tax ease claim was a tax claim under.the district court reasoned that the debt originated from the debtors responsibility to the taxing authorities for their property taxes and that the transfer of the debt to tax ease did not change the nature of the debt.it noted that under texas law tax ease became subrogated to the rights of the taxing authorities.therefore,tax ease was entitled to the same protection of that would be afforded to the taxing authorities,and the bankruptcy court could not modify the interest rate.the thompsons now appeal to this court.
before addressing the merits of the appeal,we first consider our appellate jurisdiction.tax ease suggests that we lack jurisdiction because its appeal to the district court was not based on a final,appealable order of the bankruptcy court,and therefore the district court also lacked jurisdiction.
district courts have jurisdiction to hear appeals from bankruptcy courts to review final judgments,orders,and decrees.district courts also have appellate jurisdiction to consider the bankruptcy court interlocutory orders and decrees if the district court has granted leave to appeal because the instant case does not involve an order for which the district court granted leave to appeal,the district court jurisdiction depended on whether the bankruptcy court order was final.this court appellate jurisdiction similarly turns on the finality of the decisions in the bankruptcy and district courts.see in re bartee 
under our precedent,finality in bankruptcy proceedings is viewed in a practical,less technical light.in re england our approach to determining whether an order is therefore appealable in a bankruptcy case is flexible an appealed bankruptcy order will be considered final if it constitutes either a final determination of the rights of the parties to secure the relief they seek,or a final disposition of a discrete dispute within the larger bankruptcy case.the conclusion of a discrete judicial unit in the larger case,rather than the conclusion of the entire litigation,results in a final,appealable order 
we are satisfied that the bankruptcy court order here denying tax ease objection resolved a discrete dispute between these parties and was appealable.the record reveals that the only contested issue in the bankruptcy court with respect to confirmation of the thompsons proposed chapter plan was whether tax ease held a tax claim,and the resulting interest rate on that claim.the parties agreed at a hearing before the bankruptcy court that there were no other issues pending in the thompsons plan.tax ease claim was a dispute,and the bankruptcy court decision necessarily resolved the dispute and determined the amount,priority,and interest rate on the claim.although the order itself did not confirm the thompsons plan,it was considered by all parties to be final on the claim at issue and left nothing more for the court to do.it effectively resolved the merits of the controversy and was a final,appealable order there is no impediment to our jurisdiction 
we turn next to the merits of the appeal and consider whether the district court correctly determined that tax ease held a tax claim and was therefore entitled to receive its contract rate of interest.in bankruptcy appeals we review findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo.in re laughlin 
the sole issue in this appeal turns on the applicability of of the bankruptcy code.enacted as part of the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of limits a debtor ability to modify the interest rate on a tax claim as follows 
if any provision of this title requires the payment of interest on a tax claim or on an administrative expense tax,or the payment of interest to enable a creditor to receive the present value of the allowed amount of a tax claim,the rate of interest shall be the rate determined under applicable nonbankruptcy law 
because there was no uniform rate of interest for tax claims prior to the enactment of,and varying standards had been used to determine the applicable rate,congress sought to simplify the interest rate calculation it is now clear that when a federal,state,or local governmental entity pursues a claim against a bankrupt for unpaid taxes,the applicable interest rate is determined in accord with nonbankruptcy law what is not immediately clear from the statute is whether a creditor who pays the debtor taxes continues to hold a tax claim.
the bankruptcy code does not define the term tax claim.but it does define a claim in the broadest manner to be a right to payment,whether or not such right is reduced to judgment,liquidated,unliquidated,fixed,contingent,matured,unmatured,disputed,undisputed,legal,equitable,secured,or unsecured.in the simplest terms,a tax claim is a broad right to payment of taxes.section protects the interest rate due on this right to payment held by governmental entities and by private parties alike because it includes creditors within the realm of those able to make tax claims this must be so since the bankruptcy code elsewhere specifically defines a governmental unit,but congress chose instead to use the more broadly defined term creditor in we think the broad definition of claim,in conjunction with the broad protection afforded in,shows congress intent to include within tax claims held by private entities.see in re davis 
we know from the bankruptcy code that a tax claim is a broad claim for the payment of taxes and that a private entity may seek the benefit of in pursuing such a claim.but we still have not decided what specific rights a private entity such as tax ease possesses when it pays the taxes of the debtor.the statute provides that the rate of interest shall be the rate determined under applicable nonbankruptcy law.we read that to direct us to the texas law in this case.see in re haber oil
