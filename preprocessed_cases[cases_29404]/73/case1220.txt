the commissioner of internal revenue commissioner disallowed certain deductions claimed by charles investment,burton boothby,tax matters person after determining that charles had improperly carried forward certain passive activity losses from years in which charles had been a c corporation to the year in which charles became an s corporation.the tax court granted summary judgment in favor of the commissioner and charles appeals.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to and reverse.
background 
prior to,charles was a closely held c corporation as defined by j during the years,charles had been engaged in the real estate rental business.charles real estate rental activity was a passive activity as defined by c.in each of the years,and,charles passive activities generated total deductions in excess of the total gross income from the activities.such losses,passive activity losses pals,are pursuant to a.section b,however,provides that pals can be suspended and carried forward to the following year.furthermore,g a provides that in the year of disposition of the passive activity,any remaining pal,after the application of b carry over provision and after utilizing the pal to offset gain from the passive activity shall be treated as a loss.
effective january,charles elected to be taxed as an s corporation.also in,charles sold several of its rental properties for which there existed suspended pals for the years,and.on its tax return,charles identified the suspended pals that were associated with the sold properties and claimed those deductions in full pursuant to g a.furthermore,on its tax return charles reduced its cost basis with respect to the activities sold in to reflect the depreciation portion of the pal deductions taken.
on january,the commissioner issued a notice of final s corporation administrative adjustment for charles tax year ending december.the commissioner adjustment disallowed the deduction of in suspended pals and the use of in suspended pals for purposes of calculating the alternative minimum tax.the adjustments were based on b which prohibits an s corporation from carrying any carryforward from a year in which the corporation was a c corporation to a year in which the corporation is an s corporation.charles petitioned the tax court challenging the commissioner adjustments in addition,charles argued that if the pal deductions were disallowed,charles ought to be able to readjust its cost basis in the sold properties upwards in order to reflect the fact that the depreciation deductions had been disallowed.
in the tax court,the parties for partial summary judgment on both issues whether b precluded charles deduction in of suspended pals that had been incurred between and when charles had been a closely held c corporation and whether,if the commissioner had properly disallowed the carryover of the suspended pals,charles was entitled to recalculate its cost basis in the sold properties.the tax court ruled in favor of the commissioner on both issues,and both rulings are now before this court on appeal.
ii.analysis 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard as the court below.bullington united air lines,cir.there is no genuine dispute of material facts,therefore we need only determine whether the lower court correctly applied the substantive law.we review de novo the tax court interpretation of the various provisions of the internal revenue code.gitlitz,cir.
the issue is before us as a matter of first impression and,insofar as we can determine,has not been addressed in any other circuit.the parties present diametrically opposed interpretations of what,by any measure,is a complex set of statutory provisions.we begin with a review of each section place in the broader context of the internal revenue code and then consider and construe the specific statutory language.
congress enacted the subchapter s revision act of as part of an ongoing effort to give corporate shareholders the flexibility to be taxed in large measure as if they were a partnership.see generally jacob mertens,the law of federal income taxation.under subchapter s,the income of a corporation that elects s status is not taxed at the corporation level,but rather,flows through and is taxed as income to the corporation shareholders individually.recognizing,however,the potential for abuse inherent in this system,congress made b a part of subchapter s in order to prevent corporate losses incurred prior to its electing s status from inuring to the benefit of the corporation shareholders after an s status election.see generally id.the act was intended to prevent unwarranted tax benefits under subchapter rosenberg,wl section b is only one of several provisions designed to prevent abuses of the s corporation election.
four years later,in,congress enacted out of concern that taxpayers were deductions arising from activities in which the taxpayers did not participate passive activities and using those deductions to reduce the taxpayers other income.see generally merten,supra.section,therefore,is a comprehensive,statutory scheme governing gain and loss from passive activities.section allows pals to be deducted only to the extent the taxpayer has passive activity gains.any remaining pal is suspended,and carried over to the next year,again becoming available to offset passive activity gains.only upon the disposition of the passive activity does the entire pal,including the suspended pals from previous years,become available as a deduction against both passive activity gains and other,ordinary income.
it is our primary task in interpreting statutes to determine congressional intent,using traditional tools of statutory construction.nlrb united food commercial workers union,d quoting ins,d.as in all cases requiring statutory construction,we begin with the plain language of the law.united states morgan,cir.in so doing,we will assume that congress intent is expressed correctly in the ordinary meaning of the words it employs.park n fly,dollar park fly.therefore,i t is a well established law of statutory construction that,absent ambiguity or irrational result,the literal language of a statute controls.edwards valdez,cir.where the language of the statute is plain,it is improper for this court to consult legislative history in determining congressional intent.united states richards,cir.furthermore,legislative history may not be used to create ambiguity in the statutory language.id.our role in construing statutes was summarized by justice holmes we do not inquire what the legislature meant we ask only what the statute means.edwards,at quoting oliver wendell holmes,collected legal papers.therefore,despite each party reliance on legislative history to buttress its position,we rely first on the language of the statute.
the crux of the statutory dispute centers on the conflict between the two specific carryover provisions b and b.section b states except as otherwise provided in this section,any loss or credit from an activity which is disallowed under subsection a shall be treated as a deduction or credit allocable to such activity in the next taxable year.section b,on the other hand,provides that n o carryforward,and no carryback,arising for a taxable year for which a corporation is a c corporation may be carried to a taxable year for which such corporation is an s corporation.we must decide which statutory section governs the treatment of suspended pals after a corporate changeover from a c year to an s year.either the language of b functions as a statutory traffic cop,preventing any provision of the code outside of itself from negating the general rule of b,or,b clear prohibition on carryovers effectively trumps the general rules of.we hold that the plain language of precludes application of to the suspended pals of a corporation in the first year of its s election.because we hold that charles suspended pals are deductible in,we need not reach a conclusion on the question of whether charles is entitled to a cost basis readjustment.
it is a general rule of statutory construction that if a statute specifies exceptions to its general application,other exceptions not exp
