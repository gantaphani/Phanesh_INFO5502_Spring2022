james tuff tuff appeals the summary judgment granted the united states in its action to recover refunded to tuff by the internal revenue service irs in connection with stock options tuff exercised in through a margin loan from morgan stanley.we affirm the judgment.
background 
the appeal turns on whether tuff received income in the form of shares of stock when he exercised his options,or when morgan stanley liquidated the shares after their value had declined.
the material facts are not in dispute.tuff was employed by realnetworks,at a management level,and was classified as a corporate insider who could sell realnetworks shares only during open trading windows approved by the company.as part of his compensation package tuff received stock options,which he exercised twice in to purchase realnetworks shares that had a total market value at the time of purchase of.the exercise,or strike,price of these shares was,making the difference,or spread,between their market value and exercise price.
tuff financed these purchases by borrowing from morgan stanley,writing checks to realnetworks from his morgan stanley account to cover both the strike price and federal withholding taxes each time he exercised an option.the shares were deposited in an account in tuff name,and tuff became the registered owner of the stock.he had the right to vote the stock,receive dividends,and pledge the stock as collateral for a loan.taking advantage of these rights,tuff pledged the stock as collateral pursuant to a client account agreement with morgan stanley.the agreement provided 
you agree at all times to maintain such margins for your account with dean witter reynolds as required by law or custom,or as we may deem necessary or advisable.you also promise to discharge your obligations to dean witter reynolds upon demand this obligation survives termination of your account with dean witter reynolds 
under the agreement,morgan stanley had the right to liquidate tuff realnetworks shares,through margin calls,when necessary to maintain collateral in tuff account equal to the outstanding debt multiplied by.prior to the sale of any of his realnetworks shares in a margin call,however,tuff had the option to deposit cash or other securities to maintain his account margin and still retain all his realnetworks shares.after tuff received margin calls in and did not deposit additional equity in his account,morgan stanley sold of his realnetworks shares during blackout periods when tuff was precluded from trading realnetworks shares.
tuff and his wife filed a form joint income tax return for tax year,reporting of form income from realnetworks,which represented tuff salary plus the aggregate spread from the exercise of stock options described above.in january,the tuffs filed a form amended for refund,asserting that no income arose when tuff exercised the options in,and listing his income as,a difference of from the original return.the form also claimed a refund of the withholding tax tuff paid realnetworks upon exercising the options.after issuing the tuffs a check for in march,the irs reconsidered its position and sought to recover the refund.this action followed.
on the parties for summary judgment,the district court rejected tuff primary argument that his receipt of realnetworks shares was not taxable in when he exercised his options,but only later when morgan stanley sold them to restore the margin.the district court also rejected tuff alternative argument that he should recognize ordinary,rather than capital,loss for the decline in the fair market value of his realnetworks shares at the end of each blackout period,as well as each time morgan stanley sold the shares during blackout periods.the district court,as noted,granted summary judgment in favor of the united states and against tuff in the amount of,plus interest.
ii.the taxable event 
a question of first impression in this circuit when an employee exercises a stock option granted by the employer to purchase shares with money borrowed from a third party,pledging the shares as collateral for the loan,is the property transferred and substantially vested for tax purposes at the time the option is exercised,or at the time the shares are later liquidated citing no relevant authority,tuff contends that in these circumstances no taxable transfer occurs when the option is exercised.an overview of the statutory and regulatory provisions governing the taxation of stock options is useful to understand tuff arguments.
statutory and regulatory framework for taxation of stock options 
when an employee receives a stock option that does not have a readily ascertainable fair market value,as was the case with the options at issue,the receipt of the option generally is not taxable.e.rather,the employee is taxed upon exercising the option and receiving shares if two conditions are met.first,the shares must be transferred to the employee.under the applicable regulations,a transfer occurs when the employee acquires a beneficial ownership interest in the shares.a.second,they must be substantially vested in the employee.a a.shares are substantially vested in the employee when they are either transferable or not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.b.if both conditions are met,the employee must recognize income in the amount by which the shares fair market value exceeds the exercise price paid.a.
whether a risk of forfeiture is substantial depends on the facts and circumstances.c.shares or any other property transferred in connection with the performance of services are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture when the owner rights to their full enjoyment are conditioned upon any person future performance of substantial services.c.property is transferable if the employee can sell,assign,or pledge his or her interest in the property to a person other than the transferor,and this transferee is not required to give up the property or its value if a substantial risk of forfeiture later materializes.d.
in this case the realnetworks shares were transferred to and substantially vested in tuff when he exercised his stock options.realnetworks issued the shares to tuff,who then held legal title to the shares and was entitled to receive dividends.after tuff exercised his options,realnetworks imposed no further conditions upon his ownership interest.he had the right to vote the shares.he had the right immediately to sell the shares,because he exercised his options during open trading windows.tuff had the right to pledge the shares as collateral,and indeed did so to secure his loan from morgan stanley.
under the general rules described above,the transfer of the stock to tuff in was a taxable event.seeking to avoid this result,tuff argues that under the morgan stanley agreement,he received only another option rather than the shares themselves.
exception for certain transfers treated as the grant of an option 
treasury regulation a section a provides that income is not recognized when a transfer of property occurs by treating the exercise of some stock options as the grant of another option,rather than a transfer of shares.section a states 
i f the amount paid for the transfer of property is an indebtedness secured by the transferred property,on which there is no personal liability to pay all or a substantial part of such indebtedness,such transaction may be in substance the same as the grant of an option.the determination of the substance of the transaction shall be based upon all the facts and circumstances.the factors to be taken into account include the type of property involved,the extent to which the risk that the property will decline in value has been transferred,and the likelihood that the purchase price will,in fact,be paid.
the regulations illustrate how section a operates in this example 
example.on november,w sells to e shares of stock in w corporation with a fair market value of in exchange for a note without personal liability.the note requires e to make yearly payments of commencing in.e collects the dividends,votes the stock and pays the interest on the note.however,he makes no payments toward the face amount of the note.because e has n
