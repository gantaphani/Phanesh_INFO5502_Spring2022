douglas radtke,scott radtke,and michael donohoe appeal their convictions for conspiracy to defraud the united states and the irs,mail fraud,and federal tax law violations.they also appeal their sentences.we affirm.
the appellants convictions resulted from their actions during the in connection with two construction company rcc and scaffold services,ssi.douglas radtke incorporated rcc in to perform construction work for the department of housing and urban development.he bought ssi,a scaffolding supply company,in.during the,douglas radtke owned all of rcc and part of ssi,and was ceo of both companies.rcc was party to collective bargaining agreements with several unions,including the carpenters and joiners union union.ssi was not party to any such agreements.douglas radtke son scott radtke was and minority owner of ssi.michael donohoe was a field operations manager with ssi.
beginning in,ssi and rcc began intermittently paying employees for services performed on an ad hoc basis with checks written directly from the companies accounts payable bank accounts,rather than through the companies payroll system.these checks,referred to by all parties as cash checks,withheld no taxes or union benefit payments.until,whether to pay an employee with a cash check or through the normal payroll system was decided on a basis after the work had been performed.
in the early,douglas radtke hired rita galston to be ssi controller.she was promoted to chief financial officer in.galston testified at trial that she had believed at the time she worked for ssi that paying workers who were not regular employee s of the company casual workers without withholding taxes was permissible,so long as the payment amount did not exceed in any given year.many of the cash checks used to pay ssi and rcc employees were approved by galston.because of the supposed ceiling on the dollar amount of the cash checks,casual workers who received cash checks totaling more than were paid in checks made payable to relatives or friends.when workers who were on the regular payroll of ssi or rcc were paid in cash checks,a substitute name was always used.
at trial,evidence was presented regarding specific instances in which cash checks were paid in these substitute names.galston testified that douglas radtke expressly authorized the use of cash checks to compensate his son marc on two occasions.one time,the compensation was for driving a truck for ssi,and the check was made out in the name of marc wife,damita.the second cash check paid to marc radtke,according to galston,was made out in the name of his mother,diane radtke.a former ssi employee testified that scott radtke told him to submit a social security number and name not his own in order to receive payment over.donohoe acknowledged that he was paid several times with cash checks made out to persons other than himself.
in and,the use of cash checks at ssi became more regular with respect to a particular project.ssi won a contract to provide scaffolds for an inspection and repair project at hennepin energy resource company herc in.the job at herc involved a scaffolding system new to ssi.according to project manager scott such,douglas radtke,fearing it might take more time than expected to assemble the scaffolding,asked several workers including such if they would be willing to receive payment in the form of cash checks for their work on the job.the savings ssi achieved through its of withholding taxes on the amounts paid by cash checks reduced the risk of a loss to the company on the herc job.
ssi continued to perform services for herc in,but it became difficult to persuade workers to sign on for the dirty,unpleasant job.radtke br.at.according to galston testimony,scott such,the ssi project manager in charge of the herc job,eventually approached her about the possibility of paying all of the workers at the job in cash checks as a means of persuading enough of them to participate.galston believed that,because of the dollar amount of the herc job between and for labor in,she could not authorize the use of cash checks for all of the workers without douglas radtke approval.she testified that she and such approached douglas radtke with the proposal,and that she told him of the upside and downside of paying cash on a job this size.tr.at.the upside,according to galston,was the savings to ssi despite compensating workers at a higher level.the downside of which galston says she informed douglas radtke involved penalties and interest that would be assessed for ssi failure to pay taxes or union benefits on the employees pay,if the company actions were discovered.
galston testified that she did not recall specifically informing douglas radtke that using cash checks would be against the law,tr.at,but claimed she told him that from a risk standpoint,basically,one unhappy employee blowing the whistle would bring this to light.id.at.according to galston,douglas radtke thought about the proposal for between five and ten minutes before approving it,saying he felt that his employees were loyal to him and that none of them would turn him in.id.
galston testimony was not uncontroverted at trial.although scott such recalled discussing with douglas radtke the use of cash checks for himself and two other workers on the herc project in,he did not have any recollection of the april meeting recounted by galston.similarly,douglas radtke presented evidence indicating that he was traveling out of state during the time that galston recalled meeting with him in april 
after the herc job,use of cash checks at ssi and rcc continued to increase.galston testified that she did not seek approval from douglas radtke to use cash checks on later jobs because she felt that he approved the risk involved with doing this.tr.at.galston stated that she sought approval from various other ssi employees,including scott radtke,for use of cash checks on large jobs after.id.at.
in,ssi won a contract to erect scaffolding for a project at the.paul international airport.the contract for the job called for a certified payroll.the certification would require ssi to attest that proper withholding had been accomplished.not realizing this until after the job had been completed,ssi paid some workers in cash checks.when faced with a certification requirement that would force her either to report amounts paid with cash checks,revealing that no withholding had taken place with respect to those amounts,or to underreport the hours worked,galston testified that she chose to exclude some of the hours worked for cash checks.
testimony was unanimous at trial that cash checks were the subject of a discussion between galston,such,and douglas radtke occurring after the herc job,but the nature of the discussion differed in the recollections of various witnesses.according to galston,the discussion was prompted by such request to use cash checks on a large job.galston felt obligated to bring to douglas radtke attention the fact that workers not on the regular payroll of ssi or rcc would not be covered by workers compensation insurance if they were paid only in cash checks.she also remembered douglas radtke stating very loud ly at one point no more cash this year.tr.at.
douglas radtke,by contrast,recounted hearing a discussion between galston and such regarding the use of cash checks on an upcoming job.douglas radtke testified that he became very angry and got right in the middle of the discussion,telling such to refrain from using cash checks because workers paid in this manner would not be covered by workers compensation,and any injured worker would end up suing us.tr.at.
scott such described a conversation in which douglas radtke ordered him to back the cash payroll down to just our main employees so that he would not end up in jail.tr.at.an carpenter testified that such told him that douglas radtke had said the cash payroll was to be discontinued.donohoe also testified to hearing douglas radtke yell no more cash this year,or no more cash.
ssi and rcc ceased their use of cash checks as calendar year drew to a close.on february,irs agents executed a search warrant at the companies offices,seizing documents and interviewing employees.
a grand jury indicted the appellants,along with marc radtke,rita galston,and vernon bodin a of ssi,on july,charging each with conspiracy to defraud the united states and the irs and commit the following offenses failing to account for or pay over tax,in violation of,subscribing to materially false tax returns,in violation of,and mail fraud,in violation of,all in violation of together,the conspiracy count.the grand jury also indicted the defendants on three counts of mail fraud and three counts of falsifying erisa records,in violation of b and.douglas radtke and galston were charged with fifteen counts of failing to account for or pay over tax,in violation of,and galston was charged separately with fifteen counts of subscribing to materially false tax returns,in violation of.
galston pled guilty to the conspiracy count,one count of failing to collect and pay over taxes,and one count of falsifying erisa records.the appellants,along with marc radtke and vernon bodin,were tried together.the jury convicted douglas radtke,scott radtke,and michael donohoe of the conspiracy count.douglas radtke was also found guilty on seven counts of failing to collect,account for,and pay over tax,and on two counts of mail fraud.the jury found michael donohoe guilty of filing a false and fraudulent tax return and on three counts of mail fraud.scott radtke was convicted of three counts of mail fraud.the jury acquitted marc radtke and bodin on all counts.
douglas radtke,scott radtke,and donohoe were sentenced on april.douglas radtke received months imprisonment,a fine of,and restitution of going to wilson mcshane,the administrator of the union fringe benefit fund,and going to berkley risk administrators.scott radtke was sentenced to months in prison and to joint and several liability for the fine and restitution amounts also owed by his father.donohoe received eighteen months imprisonment and joint and several liability with his on the fine and restitution amounts.
on appeal,all three defendants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support their convictions.in reviewing a claim of insufficient evidence,we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict,and accept as established all reasonable inferences from the evidence that support the verdict.united states hawkey,cir.we will reverse only if no reasonable jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.united states walker,cir.after carefully considering the record,we find that the evidence presented to the jury was sufficient to sustain its verdict with respect to all three defendants.
douglas radtke argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to prove that he acted with the mental state required by the crimes for which he was convicted.he argues that e ach of the offenses charged in the indictment required proof that he acted with intent to defraud.radtke br.at.according to douglas radtke,the evidence showed only that galston instigated the use of cash checks,and that he permitted the practice in the good faith belief,formed in reliance on galston advice,that it was legal to pay casual workers as independent contractors.he points to the fact that he signed only four of the nearly cash checks introduced into evidence,and that each of these was to compensate casual workers.
we believe that sufficient evidence was presented at trial to support the jury finding of intent.there was testimony that douglas radtke recognized that the practice of using cash checks was illegal,but proceeded to authorize such checks.galston,such,and donohoe,for example,all testified to their recollection of a meeting at which douglas radtke expressed concern about the legal consequences of continuing the use of cash checks.according to such,he acknowledged that such consequences included jail time.galston also testified to an april meeting at which she explained to douglas radtke that fines and penalties would result from the use of cash checks on the herc job if the practice was discovered.
douglas radtke asserts that galston testimony regarding the meeting was not credible because such did not recall the meeting despite allegedly being present.this argument is unpersuasive.credibility determinations,of course,are for the jury to make,and even a testimony need not be corroborated to be believable.united states anderson,cir.douglas radtke also claims that no reasonable jury could have believed galston because evidence at trial was uncontroverted that douglas radtke was in annamaria,florida during the precise time galston claims to have met with him and such.radtke br.at.it is true that douglas radtke presented evidence suggesting that he was in florida during the week of april.the date of the meeting,however,was never placed in that week with offered only a guesstimat e,tr.at and douglas radtke does not claim to have been in florida for the entire month of april.the jury,in fact,heard evidence that douglas radtke was in minnesota when scott such was planning the herc job.it would have been reasonable for the jury,therefore,to conclude that douglas radtke was present at a meeting at which the illegality of cash checks was discussed.
in any event,intent to defraud need not be proved by direct evidence,united states ervasti,cir.the required intent can be inferred from the actions of the defendant.the jury received a considerable volume of circumstantial evidence from which it could have inferred the requisite mens rea.for example,douglas radtke was the ceo and president of ssi and rcc,and the jury heard testimony that he was a manager who was involved in the daily operation of the companies.evidence was presented suggesting that he personally profited by as a result of using cash checks at the herc project in.this evidence gave rise to a sufficiently strong inference of intent to defraud to permit the jury to find that douglas radtke committed the charged offenses.
scott radtke similarly maintains that the evidence presented at trial established only that he was present at ssi during the time of the alleged conspiracy and that he knew of the illegal use of cash checks.this is insufficient to sustain his convictions,he contends,because the government failed to present any credible evidence that he was a willing participant in any plan to defraud the irs or the carpenters union.radtke br.at.he also alleges that the government offered little to discredit his assertion that he relied in good faith on galston advice regarding the use of cash checks.id.
we disagree.as noted above,intent to defraud can be proven by circumstantial evidence,and scott radtke admits that he was familiar with the use of cash checks to pay for casual,extra hours labor.scott radtke br.at.he also concedes that his signature appears on a cash check that was shown to the jury,and that a witness testified to having heard him discuss the use of names on checks.galston testified that she obtained approval for the use of cash checks from scott radtke,and complained to him regarding scott such use of such checks.finally,galston testified to a meeting she had with scott radtke at which they discussed ways to avoid revealing the use of cash checks when they were required to certify a payroll.this evidence of scott radtke knowledge of and involvement in the cash check scheme provided sufficient support for the jury verdict.
donohoe also argues that there was insufficient evidence to sustain a finding that he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the conspiracy count and of mail fraud.in challenging his conviction for conspiracy,donohoe maintains that there was insufficient evidence to show that he intended to defraud the irs,and that his lack of intent to defraud precluded him from joining the alleged conspiracy.donohoe argues that he relied in good faith on galston assurances that the use of cash checks was legal,and that he was uneducated as to the workings of the irs rules and regulations.donohoe br.at.donohoe testimony at trial,however,undermines his protestations of good faith.donohoe testified that he initially thought the use of the cash checks sounded fishy.tr.at.his wife questioned the legality of the practice when donohoe told her he needed to use her name for a cash check,and donohoe recalled galston instructing him not to use the social security numbers of dead people for cash checks,because doing so would risk detection.the evidence presented at trial,in sum,supported the jury determination that donohoe had the state of mind required to join the fraudulent conspiracy.
also with respect to his conviction on the conspiracy count,donohoe argues that while the indictment alleged a conspiracy to defraud both the irs and union workers,donohoe br.at,the government failed to prove that the fraud targeted at different victims constituted a single conspiracy rather than two separate conspiracies.where the evidence at trial supports multiple conspiracies,but only a single conspiracy is charged in the indictment,we reverse only if the evidence does not support the single conspiracy and the defendant was prejudiced by the variance between the indictment and the proof.united states pullman,cir see also kotteakos united states.
whether a given case involves single or multiple conspiracies depends on whether there was one overall agreement to perform various functions to achieve the objectives of the conspiracy.united states massa,cir internal quotation omitted.this is determined by the totality of the circumstances,and because it is a question of fact,we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict.united states mccarthy,cir.relevant factors includ e the nature of the activities involved,the location where the alleged events of the conspiracy took place,the identity of the conspirators involved,and the time frame in which the acts occurred.id.internal quotation omitted.
here,the evidence supported a finding that there was a single conspiracy.the conspiracy in which donohoe allegedly participated involved defrauding the irs,but the conspiracy count of the indictment did not allege specifically that union workers were also the target of the appellants fraudulent scheme.some of the conduct charged,it is true,was directed at the union,but a conspiracy with multiple objectives is not the same thing as multiple conspiracies.see pullman,at.any fraud against the union depended on a similar mechanism as that against the irs,namely,the use of cash checks.all of the fraud took place either at the combined headquarters of ssi or rcc,or at company job sites.the identity of the conspirators was equally uniform douglas radtke,scott radtke,and donohoe all were accused and convicted of participating in the same fraudulent conspiracy.and the time frame for all of the allegedly fraudulent conduct was similar.the mailing of fraudulent reports to the union fringe benefit fund third party administrator occurred from november,through november.most of the cash checks were issued over a similar time period,between april and december.the evidence thus supports the existence of a single conspiracy.
donohoe argues further that there was insufficient evidence of his knowledge of the filing of fringe benefit reports to support his mail fraud conviction.this contention is without merit.first,knowledge of the actual instance of mailing the matter or thing alleged to have furthered a fraudulent scheme is not an element of the crime described by.the statute requires only that the defendant devise a scheme or artifice to defraud and cause the placement of any matter or thing in the mails with the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice.id.the requirement that the defendant cause the matter or thing to be mailed is satisfied by a showing that he did an act with the knowledge that the use of mails would follow in the ordinary course of business or that the use of mails reasonably could have been foreseen even though not actually intended.united states freitag,cir.the jury was instructed that it could find donohoe guilty if the other elements of mail fraud were shown and it was reasonably foreseeable that the mail would be used.tr.at.donohoe testified at trial that,during the time he worked for ssi,he assume d that ssi was meeting reporting requirements by reference to his time card information,and that he was familiar with the union fringe benefit fund.tr.at.he also testified that he knew the hours paid for with cash checks would not be reported to the union.tr.at.the jury conclusion after hearing this testimony that donohoe caused the fringe benefit forms to be mailed for purposes of was reasonable.
donohoe challenges the sufficiency of the government showing that he intended to file fraudulent reports to the union.donohoe testimony and other evidence presented at trial refutes this contention.donohoe testified that he knew the use of cash checks would result in of union benefits,yet he admitted that he authorized payment in the form of cash checks some ninety times.the government presented evidence during its of donohoe,moreover,suggesting he used cash checks with the express purpose of avoiding compliance with the union minimum rate.in short,the evidence of donohoe complicity in the union was sufficient to sustain his conviction for mail fraud.
in a challenge to his conviction for willfully subscribing to a known false tax return,see,donohoe asserts that the district court erred in excluding from evidence his amended return for tax year.donohoe concedes that he did not report in income received in the form of cash checks on his original tax return.his defense at trial was that he did not have to declare the because it was not included in his form.to bolster this defense,donohoe sought to introduce evidence regarding an amended tax return on which he reported the after realizing it was properly classified as income.the district court granted the government motion in limine to exclude evidence of the amended return.
we review a district court exclusion of evidence for abuse of discretion.united states martin,cir.the district court has considerable discretion in admitting evidence of acts of subsequent conduct of a defendant offered to prove the absence of evil intent.united states woosley,cir.a n reason demanding latitude for a court ruling on admissibility is that what takes place,particularly after the fact,is often feigned and artificial.post united states,internal quotation omitted.whether evidence of a defendant subsequent mental state,as demonstrated by a subsequent act,is of any probative value in establishing his state of mind at the time of the alleged criminal acts must be determined by the circumstances of the individual case.united states stoehr,cir.
donohoe urges us to follow the first,second,and seventh circuits,which,he asserts,have allowed the introduction of amended tax returns to show good faith.donohoe br.at.he points to three illustrative cases united states johnson,cir united states dyer,cir and united states tishberg,cir.none of the cases cited by donohoe holds that amended tax returns tend to prove a taxpayer lack of criminal intent when filing an original return.in tishberg,for example,the admissibility of the amended return was not considered on court stated during a discussion of the sufficiency of the evidence that the defendant amended return may demonstrate a good faith effort to correct his previous mistakes.tishberg,at.the court went on to say that the return does not,however,negate the import of his previous action.id.the suggestion that an amended return may demonstrate good faith in tishberg does not control donohoe situation because the good faith referred to in tishberg is a good faith effort to correct previous mistakes,not,as was in question in donohoe trial,good faith at the time the original return was filed.donohoe reliance on dyer and johnson is similarly unavailing.
whether an amended tax return filed technically might be relevant to the taxpayer intent at the time he filed the original return,there is no doubt that exculpatory acts performed substantially after a defendant wrongdoing is discovered are of minimal probative value as to his state of mind at the time of the alleged crime.the district court excluded this evidence because it was of of no probative value,and at best confus ing to the jury.tr.at.federal rule of evidence provides that evidence,though relevant,may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury.given that there was little,if any,probative value in donohoe amended filing,see united states ross,cir holding that the defendant filing of subsequent accurate tax returns and his offer to pay any delinquent taxes were not relevant to the charge that he had willfully failed to file tax returns in previous years,the district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that any minimal probative value was substantially outweighed by danger of confusing the issues and misleading the jury.
the appellants raise two assertions of error with respect to their sentencings the district court calculation of the amounts of loss for which they were held responsible,and the court consideration of facts that were not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.douglas radtke also challenges the adjustment he received for his role in the offense pursuant to ussg.
appellants each were sentenced based on an identical fraud loss amount,and they challenge several aspects of the district court calculation of this amount.we review a sentencing court determination of amount of loss for clear error.united states baker,cir.in determining the amount of loss attributable to fraud,precision is not required the sentencing court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss.ussg,comment.c.here,the district court computed the fraud loss amount as a total of two elements union benefit contributions that were not paid as a result of the use of cash checks and the use of ssi as a alter ego for rcc,totaling,and workers compensation premiums that were not paid as a result of the use of cash checks,totaling.this resulted in a total loss amount of.
the appellants argue that the district court erred by counting as fraud loss in union benefit payments not made by ssi.they contend that ssi was not relevant conduct because ssi was not subject to a collective bargaining agreement with any union,and because ssi was not alleged as criminal activity in their indictment.we disagree.
at trial,the district court heard testimony that ssi payroll employees performed work that was covered by rcc collective bargaining agreement,and that ssi was an alter ego of rcc.its finding that ssi was bound by rcc collective bargaining agreement was not clearly erroneous.the fact that ssi nonpayment is only obliquely referenced in the indictment,moreover,does not preclude the district court consideration of this conduct in determining the amount of loss due to fraud under the guidelines.relevant conduct under the guidelines need not be charged to be considered in sentencing,and it includes all acts and omissions that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.ussg a.the district court concluded that ssi of benefit contributions was absolutely a portion of the criminal conduct.tr.at.the court reasoned that rcc and ssi,as alter egos,both benefitted at the expense of their employees by accepting their labors while shortchanging them in coverage,vacation pay,and retirement benefits by not contributing to the union benefit fund.id.the court determination that ssi nonpayment of benefit contributions was part of the same course of conduct as the use of cash checks was not clear error.
douglas radtke argues that the loss amount should have been reduced by the amount of benefits ssi paid to its employees.radtke argues that although rcc and ssi failed to make contributions to wilson mcshane,the administrator of the union fringe benefit fund,which contributions would have entitled employees to various future benefits,the district court should have credited against the loss certain amounts that the companies spent to give different benefits to the same employees.radtke does not specify what amounts should have been credited on this basis.radtke br.at.
the sentencing guidelines provide that in a case involving fraud,loss shall be reduced by t he money returned,and the fair market value of the property returned and the services rendered,by the defendant or other persons acting jointly with the defendant,to the victim before the offense was detected.ussg,comment.e i.we do not think the fringe benefits paid by ssi or rcc to employees is the sort of credit against loss contemplated by the guidelines.the commentary to the guidelines provides that the court should apply a credit where the defendant returns the very money or property taken as part of the fraud.in this case,for example,if radtke had made arrangements to contribute funds belatedly to the administrator before the fraud was detected,the principle of credits against loss likely would apply.but radtke seeks a credit for other benefits provided to that do not correlate directly with the amounts withheld from the administrator as part of the fraud.we find no authority to support this proposition,and we are not of a mind to extend the availability of credits against loss to benefits like these,which were paid to employees as part of a plan to entice them to accept cash checks and thus to further the scheme to defraud.see united states whatley,cir w e are not inclined to allow the defendants a credit for money spent perpetuating a fraud.united states carrozzella,cir explaining that one reason for rule that funds returned as part of investment scheme are not credited against loss is that the return of money as interest or other income is often necessary for the scheme to continue.
appellants also charge as error the district court determination that in workers compensation was not paid as a result of their conduct.they argue that the correct amount of loss attributable to of workers compensation premiums was.we do not believe the district court finding was clearly erroneous.
both rcc and ssi paid for workers compensation coverage at two rates,a high rate and a low rate,depending on what type of work was performed by the covered employees.the high rate was paid for more dangerous scaffolding work done at substantial elevations high work,while the low rate was paid for work on the ground or at low elevations.the high rate for the years in question varied between percent and percent of all wages paid for high work.the low rate ranged from percent to percent.the district court found that percent of the wages paid in cash checks were for high work,and arrived at as the workers compensation loss.
appellants contend that the district court erred by finding that percent of the work paid for with cash checks was high work.they allege that uncontroverted testimony established that only percent of work was in the high work category,and that the correct loss figure was therefore.we do not believe this is an accurate characterization of the evidence before the district court.
to be sure,appellants introduced a spreadsheet prepared by the new owner of ssi suggesting that only percent of wages paid in cash checks was for high work.defendant ex.an audit supervisor from berkley risk administrators,rcc administrator for workers compensation,also testified that although he did not know offhand what percentage of the workers compensation premiums were for high versus low work,tr.at,the appellants spreadsheet indicated that about percent of rcc workers compensation premiums were in the high category.id.at.at trial,however,galston provided testimony that was sufficient to support an inference that a much higher percentage of cash checks were used for high work.when asked to explain what the company would save in workers compensation from paying cash,galston answered that our base rate on scaffold erection,workers comp,was percent of the wages paid,that dollars per hundred in wages.tr.although the evidence was not further developed,galston testimony could be understood to mean that most or all of the cash checks were used to compensate workers for high work,because rates for low work never approached the percent rate testified to by galston.in that sense,therefore,the district court was presented with two divergent only percent of cash chec
