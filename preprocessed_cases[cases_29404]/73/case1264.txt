appellants robert and ellen amos,along with seventeen other glynn county property owners have taken this interlocutory appeal from the district court order denying their motions for class certification and preliminary injunction.appellees,glynn county board of tax assessors,along with several other glynn county agencies in turn,from the district court denial of their motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.because we conclude that the tax injunction act stripped the district court of subject matter jurisdiction over this lawsuit,we reverse the district court denial of the appellees motion to dismiss,vacate its order denying class certification and preliminary injunction,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the essential background and procedural facts are these.the appellants own residential property on simons island,an upscale coastal development located in glynn county,georgia.this lawsuit arises out of a grievance they have with the way glynn county assessed their ad valorem property taxes in the year.glynn county system for assessing property taxes and adjudicating assessment disputes is complex,and we therefore begin with an overview of that system.
the glynn county board of commissioners,the governing body of the county,appoints the glynn county board of tax assessors the board,which is responsible for assessing the county property taxes.to that end,the board appoints a chief tax appraiser,whose office conducts the actual assessments.the board must complete its review of the chief tax appraiser assessments by june of each year,at which point the board must notify any taxpayers whose assessments have been changed within five days.see.
a taxpayer who is dissatisfied with the board reassessment of his property may appeal through the process set forth in.the first step in that process is to appeal to the board itself within days of the date of the notice.see b.the board has days to decide the appeal.see e.if the board fails to decide an appeal within days or decides not to change the taxpayer assessment,the taxpayer appeal is automatically forwarded to the board of equalization boe.see id.in addition,if the board changes the taxpayer assessment but the taxpayer is still unsatisfied,he may appeal to the boe by notifying the board within days of the date the board sends notice of its decision.see e c.
the boe is a entity responsible for adjudicating tax appeals in the county.see.there are two such boards of equalization in glynn county.each is composed of three members and has jurisdiction over all property tax appeals involving questions of taxability,valuation,entitlement to homestead exemptions,or uniformity of tax valuation within the county.see e a.within days of receiving notice of an appeal,the boe must set a date for a hearing to be held within to days of the date of the notification of the hearing.see e.
notably,once the board of equalization returns its decision,the taxpayer may further appeal to glynn county superior court,where he is entitled to de novo review of all of his claims.see g.if the issues on appeal are purely legal,the taxpayer is entitled to a bench trial within days of filing his appeal.see g a.if the taxpayer appeal contains fact questions,he is entitled to a jury trial at the first term following the filing of his appeal.see id.from the superior court,the taxpayer may appeal upward through the state court system and eventually petition the united states supreme court for certiorari review.
meanwhile,the board provides the assessments to the glynn county tax commissioner,an independently elected official,who compiles the assessments into a digest and delivers the digest to the state revenue commissioner by august each year for examination and approval.once the state revenue commissioner approves the digest,glynn county is permitted to send out tax bills for the year.any taxpayer who is in the process of appealing his assessment when the tax bills are sent out is only required to pay of his assessed value and is entitled to a full refund with interest should his actual property tax turn out to be less than he paid.see e d iii.
unfortunately,glynn county entire tax assessment scheme has not been working well for close to a decade.in theory,all real property in the county should be reassessed at market value every year.but in practice,the board has not performed a reassessment since.in the interim,the board has reassessed certain properties in the county several times,while neglecting to reassess other properties at all.according to the board,the properties that are reassessed are chosen based on a sales price ratio study.the study collects sale prices for recently sold properties in the county and compares the sale prices to the former assessment values of the property.the board uses this information to determine which neighborhood properties have market values that are most out of line with their assessed values and selects these neighborhoods for reassessment.in,the board used this method to pick properties for reappraisal out of eligible residential properties in the county.the appellants properties were among the properties selected 
although,from the board perspective,the system is designed to promote equality by selecting the most wrongly valued properties for reappraisal,the appellants believe it penalizes them for living in neighborhoods with ever escalating sales prices.they contend that the board method unconstitutionally places a disproportionate share of the county tax burden on their shoulders.on may,the appellants filed this class action lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of georgia,pursuant to,claiming that glynn county tax scheme violated the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution by denying them due process and equal protection.as relief,they sought a declaratory judgment and permanent injunctive relief barring the appellees from using the allegedly unconstitutional tax digest in the collection of ad valorem taxes.specifically,the plaintiffs say that the board engaged in piecemeal or spot reappraisals and reassessments of residential property without addressing uniformity throughout glynn county,and returned a assessment of real property for the year.
however,this was not the first time that the property owners of simons island had asked for such an injunction.in haller glynn county bd.of assessors,case,two of the appellants,haller and dewhurst,purporting to act on behalf of the same class of property owners,brought suit in glynn county superior court,georgia,pursuant to,raising the same federal constitutional challenge and seeking the same injunctive relief barring the board from applying the tax digest of glynn county.the glynn county superior court granted that injunction,restraining appellees from billing or collecting taxes on the parcels of glynn county real property which were reassessed in in an amount greater than their value,but its order was later reversed by the georgia supreme court in glynn county bd.of tax assessors haller.
the georgia supreme court held that the plaintiffs had an adequate remedy at law with which to challenge the perceived constitutional infirmities in the tax digest,and specifically that et,provided the plaintiffs with an altogether sufficient mechanism for appellate review of their tax assessments.the georgia supreme court framed its holding in these terms 
the united states supreme court has held that state courts may not award either declaratory or injunctive relief against state taxes under section when there is an adequate legal remedy.similarly,we have held that a superior court should not grant an injunction in a tax case when state law provides an adequate remedy at law.provides a statutory appeals process for taxpayers to challenge a property tax assessment based on the issues of taxability,uniformity,and value.nothing in the statute prohibits taxpayers from challenging a board method of conducting spot reassessments as lacking in uniformity,appealing an unfavorable ruling to the county board of equalization,and appealing the equalization board ruling to the superior court,if necessary.because provides the glynn county taxpayers with an adequate remedy at law,we hold that the trial court erred in granting them injunctive relief.

two months after suffering that defeat,and without petitioning for certiorari review from the united states supreme court,appellants haller and dewhurst,along with seventeen other simons island property owners brought this suit in federal district court.the appellees moved to dismiss,arguing that under the tax injunction act of,the federal district courts are stripped of jurisdiction and may not enjoin,suspend or restrain the assessment,levy or collection of any tax under state law where a plain,speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such state.the appellees also argued,in the alternative,that basic principles of federalism and comity should deter a federal court from interfering with state tax administration where there is an adequate state remedy,especially when the highest court of the state has already held that the state law remedy was in fact adequate.
on august,after conducting extensive evidentiary hearings on the jurisdictional question,the district court denied the motion,concluding that the appeals process provided by is neither plain,speedy,nor efficient,and that accordingly,the tax injunction act did not strip the district court of the power to entertain the suit.the appellees first petitioned this court,pursuant to b,for permission to take an interlocutory appeal from the district court denial of their motion.we denied their petition on the ground that reviewing the georgia state remedy to determine whether it was plain,speedy,and efficient was too an inquiry for interlocutory review under b.see glynn county bd.of tax assessors amos,cir,order denying petition for interlocutory appeal revenue comm r of the state of georgia amos,cir,order denying petition for interlocutory appeal.
the case went back to the district court,which on september,denied the appellants motion for a preliminary injunction and class certification.the district court concluded that the taxpayers were not entitled to a preliminary injunction because they had failed to show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits that the threatened injury to them outweighed the damage the proposed injunction would cause to the appellees or that if issued,the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest.see four seasons hotels and resorts,consorcio barr,cir outlining requirements for issuance of a preliminary injunction.with regard to class certification,the district court held that although the proposed class was sufficiently numerous,the appellants had failed to show that their claims shared commonality and typicality with the taxpayers they sought to represent,and they had not shown they would adequately represent those taxpayers.see franze equitable assurance,cir describing prerequisites to class certification.
in this interlocutory appeal,the taxpayers argue that the district court should have granted the preliminary injunction because the inequality in the tax assessment scheme was inexcusably unjust and violated the united states constitution,they have been irreparably harmed and the public interest would not be disserved by the entry of injunctive relief.they also contend that the district court wrongly decided important evidentiary issues,which led to an incorrect decision on class certification.the appellees,on the other hand,say that the district court erred as a matter of law by entertaining the taxpayers claims at all,because the taxpayers had a plain,speedy,and efficient remedy under state law and their suit was therefore barred by the tax injunction act as for the merits,appellees say the district court properly denied the preliminary injunction and class certification under rules and of the federal rules of civil procedure.
the limitation imposed by the tax injunction act is jurisdictional.see colonial pipeline collins,cir see also rosewell lasalle bank,d.since once a federal court determines that it is without subject matter jurisdiction,it is powerless to continue,we must always first be sure of our own jurisdiction whenever it is in doubt.of am.tobacco,cir.we therefore begin with that issue.
when reviewing the district court denial of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,we review de novo the district court interpretation and application of the statutory provisions concerning the court subject matter jurisdiction,and review for clear error the district court factual findings with respect to jurisdiction.united states mcphee,cir.
the tax injunction act provides that t he district courts shall not enjoin,suspend or restrain the assessment,levy or collection of any tax under state law where a plain,speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such state.accordingly,we have held that the tax injunction act will bar the exercise of federal jurisdiction if two conditions are met the relief requested by the plaintiff will enjoin,suspend,or restrain a state tax assessment and the state affords the plaintiff a plain,speedy and efficient remedy.williams city of dothan,cir.here,it is undisputed that the first condition has been met,because this suit plainly seeks to enjoin a state tax assessment.the issue in this case is whether the second plain,speedy,and efficient also been met.
the supreme court has held that the plain,speedy and efficient exception requires the remedy to meet certain procedural criteria.california grace brethren church,d quoting rosewell,at.at emphasis in original.the touchstone for whether a taxpayer has a plain,speedy,and efficient remedy is whether she is entitled to a full hearing and judicial determination at which she may raise any and all constitutional objections to the tax.rosewell,at.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.importantly,we must construe narrowly the plain,speedy,and efficient exception to the tax injunction act.grace brethren,at.at emphasis added.as such,the burden rests on the plaintiffs to show facts sufficient to overcome the jurisdictional bar of the tax injunction act.see smith travis county educ.district,cir holding that the act applies where the plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the state courts have refused to entertain their federal claim see also colonial,at discussing whether plaintiff alleged sufficient facts to survive summary judgment.
the supreme court stringent interpretation of the exception is well founded.the tax injunction act was first and foremost a vehicle to limit drastically federal district court jurisdiction to interfere with so important a local concern as the collection of taxes.rosewell,at.at.
if federal declaratory relief were available to test state tax assessments,state tax administration might be thrown into disarray,and taxpayers might escape the ordinary procedural requirements imposed by state law.during the pendency of the federal suit the collection of revenue under the challenged law might be obstructed,with consequent damage to the state budget,and perhaps a shift to the state of the risk of taxpayer insolvency.moreover,federal constitutional issues are likely to turn on questions of state tax law,which,like issues of state regulatory law,are more properly heard in the state courts.
grace brethren,at.at quoting fair assessment in real estate,mcnary,d internal citations and quotation marks omitted.the supreme court has long recognized the dangers inherent in disrupting the administration of state tax systems.id.at.at.by enacting this jurisdictional rule,congress gave explicit sanction to the federal equity practice because interference with a state internal economy is inseparable from a federal action to restrain state taxation,the mere illegality or unconstitutionality of a state tax is not in itself a ground for equitable relief in the courts of the united states.if the remedy at law is plain,adequate,and complete,the aggrieved party is left to that remedy in the state courts.moe confederated salish and kootenai tribes of flathead reservation,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
this jurisdictional restraint emerges from t he scrupulous regard of the federal courts for the rightful independence of state governments and a proper reluctance to interfere by injunction with their fiscal operations.matthews rodgers.by passing the act,congress sought to end the disruption of local financing resulting from injunction actions in the federal courts.by bringing actions in the federal courts,taxpayers often frustrated the collection efforts of local officials,forcing them to compromise suits and lose tax revenues.waldron collins,cir.
rosewell and grace brethren are primary examples of the reluctance of the federal courts to interfere with the operation of state tax systems if the taxpayer ha s available an adequate remedy in the state courts.grace brethren,at.at.in rosewell,the plaintiff owned an apartment complex in cook county.year after year cook county require d the plaintiff to pay a tax that was three times as great as the amount actually due and then,after a delay,the county refund ed the without interest.rosewell,at.at stevens,dissenting.much like in the present case,appealing from an appraisal was a process that involved first exhausting an administrative remedy and then appealing to county circuit court.nevertheless,the supreme court held that the state court remedy was plain,speedy,and efficient for purposes of the tax injunction act,noting that w hen it passed the act,congress knew that state tax systems commonly provided for payment of taxes under protest with subsequent refund as their exclusive remedy.id.at.at.the court explained that the refund procedure,though certainly not ideal,provided the minimum full hearing and judicial determination at which constitutional objections to the tax could be raised.id.at.at.further,the plaintiff was able to appeal upward through the illinois state court system and ultimately petition the united states supreme court for certiorari review.as such,the illinois scheme was found sufficient under the act.
in grace brethren,the supreme court reiterated the stringent standard of rosewell that i n order to be faithful to the congressional intent to limit drastically interference with state tax systems,we must construe narrowly the plain,speedy,and efficient exception to the tax injunction act.at.at emphasis added.in grace brethren,the district court had exercised jurisdiction over the merits of a state tax dispute after finding that the possibility of injunctive relief was uncertain under state law and therefore the state remedy was not plain,speedy,and efficient.see id.at.at.the supreme court reversed,holding that since there is no dispute that the plaintiffs in the present case can seek a refund through state administrative and judicial procedures,plainly the district court had no jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs claims.id.at.at.
properly,our circuit has taken no more lenient a view of the plain,speedy,and efficient exception than the supreme court.explaining that s tate remedies must only meet certain minimal procedural criteria,we have held that a reviewing court should eschew any analysis of their substantive sufficiency so long as a complainant has some opportunity to raise his constitutional objections.colonial,at citation omitted.i t is not required that the state remedy be the best remedy available or even equal to or better than the remedy which might be available in the federal court.ayers polk county,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.t he applicability of the tax injunction act does not turn on which forum is best able to entertain the action.rather,the act bars the exercise of federal jurisdiction whenever the state provides adequate procedures to contest state tax matters.waldron,at.
in determining whether a state remedy is plain,speedy,and efficient under the act,we turn first to the state statutory language.see generally,colonial,at holding that adequacy of state remedies may turn on amendments to statutory language.here,to begin with,the face of the statute provides a plain,speedy,and efficient remedy.if a taxpayer is unsatisfied with his assessment,he may appeal to the board,which has days to decide his appeal.see e.if still unsatisfied,he may then appeal to the boe,which must promptly schedule a hearing.see e.t he supreme court of georgia ha s consistently held that the board of equalization is the appropriate forum for deciding not only questions of uniformity,valuation,and taxability,but also a taxpayer questions addressing constitutional and procedural issues.chatham county bd.of assessors jepson,emphasis added.once the boe reaches a conclusion,the taxpayer is entitled to prompt,de novo review in glynn county superior court.see g.if the issues being reviewed are purely legal,the taxpayer is entitled to a bench trial within days,and if not,to a jury trial at the first term following the filing of his appeal.see g a.he may then appeal upward through the georgia state system and eventually petition the united states supreme court for certiorari review.
the georgia supreme court has already ruled that,the very tax system at issue in this case,provides the glynn county taxpayers with an adequate remedy at law.glynn county,at.we can discern no reason to believe that the georgia supreme court use of the word adequate means something different from the plain,speedy,and efficient standard at issue before us.indeed,the georgia supreme court adequate legal remedy language is taken directly from private truck council.tax comm n,where the supreme court discussed the tax injunction act at length and explained that the same principle behind the tax injunction act also prevents state courts from granting relief where an adequate legal remedy exists,d.since the principle behind the tax injunction act and private truck council is federal interference in state tax can discern no reason why the narrow remedy at law exception to each would be different.indeed,as the above quotation from waldron illustrates,we ourselves have often used the expression,plain,speedy,and efficient interchangeably with adequate in the context of the tax injunction act.see also colonial pipeline,at deciding whether the state remedy at issue was adequate under the tax injunction act emphasis added see also williams,at describing the plain,speedy,and efficient analysis as one of whether a remedy is adequate enough town of ball rapides parish police jury,cir using plain,speedy,and efficient synonymously with adequate.
although the question of whether a state remedy satisfies the tax injunction act is a federal question,and therefore the district court was not bound by the georgia supreme court decision,the state highest court legal conclusions about state law are persuasive authority.julius johnson,cir.here,where the focus of the federal issue revolves around the adequacy of a state law,we believe that the georgia supreme court opinion of its own state law is entitled to particularly persuasive force.
the district court,nonetheless,rejected the georgia supreme court opinion,and found that instead of providing a plain,speedy,and efficient remedy,was a bureaucratic maze of delays and inadequate relief,and as a result,the appellants have simply been unable to and will continue to be unable to effectuate a change through the state process.district court opinion at.as such,it held that the taxpayers had no plain,speedy,and efficient remedy at state law,and jurisdiction was therefore proper in federal district court.based on our review of the text of et,the record,and unambiguous case precedent,we disagree.
the district court began its analysis with the plain prong,taking notice of the supreme court admonition in rosewell that uncertainty concerning a state remedy may make it less than plain under.at.at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.the district court concluded that the remedy was not plain because the plaintiffs could not challenge the tax digest as in its entirety and be assured of an adequate result.district court opinion at emphasis added.
we disagree with the district court judgment that the state court remedy was not plain because it failed to guarantee a injunction against the tax digest.in the first place,a state remedy need not provide for injunctive relief in order to be plain under the act.the supreme court has held that at the time that it passed the tax injunction act,congress was well aware that refund procedures were the sole remedy in many states for unlawfully collected taxes.grace brethren,at.at citation omitted.the supreme court has also held that we do not believe that congress intended federal injunctions and declaratory judgments to disrupt state tax administration when state refund procedures are available.id.at.at.by state refund procedures it is clear that the supreme court was talking about a remedy whereby an individual taxpayer brings an action to recoup her individual tax payment.see rosewell,at.at her only remaining state remedy was to pay the contested tax under protest,and then file a reverse suit for a refund grace brethren,at.at once a taxpayer has sought from,and been denied a refund by,the appropriate state agency,he may file an action in superior court for a refund of the taxes paid internal citation omitted.it is undisputed that the same sort of refund procedure was available here,and thus the remedy was plain regardless of whether relief was also available.
indeed,as the fifth circuit has held,t here is no indication that congress intended that the lower federal courts would provide supplemental relief whenever a litigant does not receive all the relief he seeks in state court.redd lambert,cir.similarly,in waldron,a panel of this court held that the failure of a state remedy to provide class action relief did not prevent it from being plain,speedy,and efficient,even though the various class members would have to bring all of their individual claims separately.at.in sum,simply because a state remedy does not provide a taxpayer with or injunctive relief,it does not follow that the taxpayer does not have an opportunity to raise any and all constitutional objections to the tax.rosewell,at.at.
but the district court analysis of the plain prong is erroneous in any event,because a reassessment is in fact a form of relief available under georgia state law.provides 
if in the course of determining an appeal the county board of equalization finds reason to believe that the property involved in an appeal or the class of property in which is included the property involved in an appeal is not uniformly assessed with other property included in the digest,the board shall request the respective parties to the appeal to present relevant information with respect to that question.if the board determines that uniformity is not present,the board may order the county board of tax assessors to take such action as is necessary to obtain uniformity,except that,when a question of uniformity is considered by the board,the board may order a partial or total revaluation only upon a determination by a majority of all the members of the board that the clear and convincing weight of the evidence requires such action.the board of equalization may act pursuant to this paragraph whether or not the appellant has raised the issue of uniformity.
d.on its face,this statute provides that the taxpayers may raise their concerns about uniformity to the boe and the boe may order relief.
the district court nevertheless posited four reasons why,under,the taxpayers may not be able obtain plain injunctive relief on their constitutional claims a citizen review board such as the boe is incapable of making the judicial determination contemplated by the supreme court in rosewell the boe power to order a reassessment is purely discretionary even if the boe orders a reassessment,it is powerless to enforce its order and a taxpayer would not be able to appeal claims to superior court if the boe granted him individual relief.
the district court first concern is easily dispensed with.as discussed,a taxpayer may appeal rulings of the boe to glynn county superior court,where he is entitled to de novo review.see g.the supreme court has found state remedies to satisfy the tax injunction act,even where a taxpayer must first exhaust administrative remedies.see grace brethren,at.at holding that nothing in the legislative history of the act suggests that requiring a taxpayer to seek a refund first through administrative procedures makes the state remedy less than plain,speedy and efficient.the fact that taxpayers must first appeal to the boe before reaching the state superior court is not fatal to the adequacy of the remedy.
the district court second concern was that the boe power to order a recount is purely discretionary.it based this finding on the statutory language i f the board determines that uniformity is not present,the board may order the county board of tax assessors to take such action as is necessary to obtain uniformity.d emphasis added.in noble joint bd.of tax assessors,like in this case,the taxpayers did not allege that their property was overvalued.see cir.rather,they claimed that the properties of others were undervalued and that they were therefore forced to pay taxes greater than their proportionate share.id.at.the taxpayers in noble argued that the state remedy would allow them to challenge only their own valuations and not the problems.after quoting the exact same statutory language as appears in d,we said t he former fifth circuit has held that this procedure provides a plain,speedy and efficient remedy to challenge the uniformity of assessments within a county,even in cases like this where the taxpayer does not contend that his property has been incorrectly valued.id.at citing adams smith,cir affirming district court on the basis of its opinion reported at.we can find no support in our caselaw for the suggestion that the word may in d is too discretionary to provide the taxpayers with a plain remedy.
the district court next concern was that the boe is powerless to enforce its orders,even when it decides to grant them.as evidence,the district court points out that the board failed to all of simons island and sea island,despite an order from the boe to do so.however,the record reveals that if the board disobeys the boe order,the boe is free to pursue a mandamus action in court against the board to enforce its order.for example,in,the boe of douglas county,georgia,ordered its board to perform a revaluation of all land in douglas county,after finding a lack of uniformity.after the douglas county board refused to do so,the douglas county boe petitioned the douglas county superior court for a writ of mandamus to force the board to obey its order.mandamus was promptly granted.see smith salvo,case,unpublished decision.the superior court found that the board was under a clear legal duty to comply with the provisions of the order of the board of equalization and therefore the petitioners were entitled to the issuance of an order of mandamus absolute compelling the board of assessors to carry out and complete the revaluation of land.id.
as ad valorem taxpayers directly affected by the boe order to revalue glynn county real property,we see no reason why the appellants in this case would not be able to bring a similar mandamus action in superior court.and since the board has a clear legal duty to comply with the provisions of the order under state law,we can discern no reason why their suit would not be successful.notably,however,the appellants have never attempted such action.the district court was concerned that it is most uncertain whether a mandamus action brought by plaintiffs in superior court would meet with dismissal on the basis of glynn county.this,though,misapprehends the georgia supreme court decision in glynn county.in that case,as discussed supra,the georgia supreme court found that injunctive relief would not lie because provides the glynn county taxpayers with an adequate remedy at law.glynn county,at.in other words,where the taxpayers had failed to attempt the administrative remedies of the statute,they could not attempt to those remedies to bring a federal claim directly to superior court.this situation is wholly different.if the taxpayers actually followed the procedures of and achieved success before the boe,and if the board unlawfully refused to obey the boe order,nothing in glynn county would prevent the taxpayers from petitioning the state superior court to enforce a boe order they lawfully obtained.in short,if the board unlawfully disobeys a boe order,the taxpayers may petition the superior court to enforce that order,and there is absolutely no reason to believe that the board would or could disobey a state court order 
the district court last concern was that it is entirely possible that a taxpayer may receive a favorable ruling from the board of equalization with respect to an individual property assessment without an order of revaluation.district court opinion at.the district court worried that such an outcome might prevent the taxpayer from appealing the issues to superior court.moreover,the district court noted that even if the taxpayer could appeal to superior court,relief may not be granted by the superior court on a basis because it is unable to enter a declaratory judgment or issue an injunction in light of the glynn county decision.id.
with respect to the first issue,the statute makes clear that taxpayers may appeal to the boe matters of uniformity of assessment of their property with other properties located within such municipality.e b.once the taxpayer has raised the uniformity issue with the boe,the statute explains that if he is unsatisfied with his result,he may appeal decisions of the county board of equalization to the superior court of the county in which the property lies.g.nothing in the state detailed statute suggests that a taxpayer may only appeal adverse decisions of the boe with respect to individual assessments,and can not appeal other adverse decisions.to the contrary,the broad language of the statute allowing the taxpayer to appeal decisions,without limiting what sorts of decisions,says quite the opposite.we believe the district court legal conclusion that taxpayers can only appeal rulings on individual valuations is unfounded.moreover,the district court finding that a superior court could not grant declaratory or injunctive relief in a properly filed case on the basis of glynn county misapprehends glynn county.the georgia supreme court in that case held only that taxpayers could not circumvent the process laid forth in,not that if they properly followed that process,injunctive relief would be denied to them.see glynn county,at.
in short,the four reasons offered for why taxpayers can not obtain injunctive relief do not reflect the legal options readily available to the taxpayers under the process set forth in.the taxpayers have simply failed to comprehensively pursue these options.moreover,we emphasize again that even if injunctive relief were actually unavailable to the taxpayers under georgia law,it would still not prevent the state remedy from being plain for purposes of the tax injunction act.supreme court precedent is unambiguous that a state court remedy may be plain,even where the sole relief afforded by the state is an individual refund,and such a remedy is undisputedly available here.see grace brethren,at.at rosewell,at.at.
turning to whether the remedy was speedy under the act,the supreme court has given only limited guidance as to how speedy a remedy must be for purposes of the tax injunction act.in rosewell,the supreme court held that a state remedy procedure that took two years to complete was sufficiently speedy.see at.at limiting ourselves to the circumstances of the instant case,we can not say that respondent delay falls outside the boundary of a speedy remedy.the court explained that n owhere in the tax injunction act did congress suggest that the remedy must be the speediest.id.at.at.although the district court suggested that the delay sanctioned in rosewell was an outer boundary for speediness,the federal courts have rejected such an interpretation.see,friarton estates city of new york,cir we do not read the rosewell decision as setting an outside limit of two years and precluding consideration of special circumstances that may justify further delay.long island lighting town of brookhaven,cir delays in excess of twelve years which resulted from delays in state court administration and from the taxpayer considerable tactical maneuverings did not undermine the proscription of tax injunction act lerch cascade county treasurer,cir unpublished table decision holding three year delay in state remedy for complex class action to be speedy under the act guertin city of eastport,d,two and a half year wait on decision permissible under the act.likewise,we do not interpret rosewell to stand for the proposition that two years is inevitably the outer boundary for speediness,but rather that speediness is a determination that pivots on the underlying facts of the case.see at.at.
in this case,the state statute itself manifests a strong concern for the speedy adjudication of claims.it requires the taxpayer to file an appeal to the board within days of the board original notice,and requires the board to decide the appeal within days of receipt of the filing.see b,e.if the board fails to adjudicate the claim within days or if it does adjudicate the claim but the taxpayer appeals to the boe within days,the appeal is automatically forwarded to the boe.see e c.the boe itself must schedule a hearing within days of receiving notice of the appeal,and it must conduct that hearing within to days.if the taxpayer wishes to appeal the boe decision to state superior court,the superior court must hear the case as a bench trial within days,or with a jury at the first term following the filing of the appeal.simply put,is comprehensively concerned with the speedy resolution of taxpayer appeals.
even if two years were an outer boundary,moreover,the district court clearly erred in finding that t he evidence in this case shows that the length of time to resolve a tax appeal on average far exceeds the delay at issue in rosewell.district court opinion at.the district court based this finding on an exhibit purporting to list the appeals still pending in the tax commissioner database as of july.the district court said that the exhibit,shows appeals pending for the years,including appeals from,appeals from,and appeals from.id.from this,the district court concluded that the average length of time for an appeal to be completed was more than two years.
the calculations that yielded this average are not altogether apparent from the court opinion,but it appears as if the district court used only those appeals still pending in and did not include those appeals that had already been resolved.in other words,the district court calculation seems based only on a small,biased sample of the aggregate.without knowing how many appeals were filed in each year and how long those appeals took to be resolved,there is no way of computing the average length of time for appeals.for example,the district court found that as of july,there were appeals still pending from.but the district court made no finding as to how many appeals were originally filed in,nor how many of those appeals were quickly resolved.perhaps there were thousands of appeals filed in and they were all resolved within one year,and only,for some reason here unexplained,remained pending.on this record,we can not tell.by including only appeals that were still pending in,the ones that took the longest to resolve the district court used an obviously inaccurate method for determining the average length of time for a tax appeal.
indeed,a review of this record suggests that while at most some appeals were still pending in from,that figure may be only a small fraction of the total appeals that were already resolved.steve fentriss,the deputy chief appraiser for glynn county,testified that there were as many as appeals filed between and total.see,exhibit b,affidavit of steve fentriss.the calculus of an average did not account for the thousands of appeals that were timely resolved.
in short,we are not satisfied that the average length of appeal actually exceeded two years,nor that we can answer that question based only on a review of the number of appeals still pending as of.but even if the district cour
