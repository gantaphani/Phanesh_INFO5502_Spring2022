textron and subsidiary companies textron appeals an order in the tax court holding its subsidiary,paul revere corporation paul revere,was not permitted to deduct its capital loss in textron taxable year.we reverse.
textron is the common parent of an affiliated group of corporations within the meaning of a.the general rule of requires consolidated groups to recognize gain or loss upon an exchange of property.however,if three listed conditions are met,reg.d i mandates the deferral of a capital loss,thus disallowing a deduction.the third condition,the only one presently contested,provides a loss shall be deferred if the obligation underlying the loss has never been held by a nonmember.reg.d i c.because in this case the obligation underlying the capital loss was held by a nonmember,paul revere,we hold textron is permitted to deduct in its taxable year.
background 
before joining the textron group in,avco corporation avco was the common parent of an affiliated group of corporations within the meaning of a.in february,paul revere,at the time a corporation unrelated to textron,purchased four million shares of avco stock for million.at the time,avco remaining shares were publicly traded.in november,avco acquired all of the stock of paul revere,making paul revere part of the avco consolidated return group.paul revere continued to hold the avco shares it had purchased in february.
on december,avco redeemed all of its stock held by paul revere.paul revere realized a loss on the redemption because avco stock had declined in value over the ten years paul revere held it.as part of the redemption,avco gave paul revere,among other things,a promissory note with a face value of.as provided under reg.b iii,paul revere did not recognize any gain or loss on the redemption instead,it took a basis in the note,which was allocated to the property received in the stock redemption.the tax treatment of the stock redemption is not in dispute.
in,textron began to acquire stock in avco,and by january,textron had acquired over of avco outstanding stock.as a result,the avco consolidated return group terminated.for the first time,all former members of the avco group,including its subsidiary paul revere,became members of the textron group.
in november,avco redeemed the note from paul revere for in cash.this was less than paul revere basis in that obligation.paul revere was liquidated into avco in a liquidation,authorized under,on december.in its consolidated tax return for the tax year,textron,as parent of the textron group,claimed a capital loss on the note redemption.
commissioner disallowed the claimed loss.textron timely filed a petition in tax court for redetermination of the deficiency and the case was heard on stipulated facts.
generally requires gain or loss to be recognized upon an exchange of property.see b the amount realized from the sale or other disposition of property shall be the sum of any money received plus the fair market value of the property other than money received.c the entire amount of the gain or loss,determined under this section,on the sale or exchange of property shall be recognized.additional provisions of the internal revenue code recognize the same general principle.a states,a mounts received by the holder on retirement of any debt instrument shall be considered amounts received in exchange therefore,and a provides,t he gain from the sale or other disposition of property shall be the excess of the amount realized therefrom over the adjusted basis and the loss shall be the excess of the adjusted basis over the amount realized.unless overridden by the consolidated return regulations,these provisions would allow textron to deduct the capital loss realized by paul revere when avco redeemed the note.
the consolidated return regulations set forth rules governing the tax liability of an affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated federal income tax return.during the taxable year at issue in this case,the regulations,substantially rewritten in,were in effect.
on appeal,as it did before the tax court,commissioner argues reg.d i,part of the regulations,disallows textron deduction of the loss.reg.d i provides that if three conditions are satisfied,gain or loss that otherwise could be deducted under on a note redemption is deferred 
exception for obligations acquired in exchanges.
a a member received an obligation of another member in exchange for property,
b the basis of the obligation was determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of the property exchanged,and 
c the obligation has never been held by a nonmember,then any gain or loss of any member on redemption or cancellation of such obligation shall be deferred,and subparagraph of this paragraph shall not apply.
at issue in this case is the applicability of reg.d i c,that an obligation has never been held by a nonmember.before the tax court and again on appeal,textron argues subsection c was not met because the avco note previously was held by paul revere,a nonmember of the textron group.noting the regulation does not specify how or when a corporation status as a member or nonmember is determined,the court held paul revere membership in the textron group in,when the note was redeemed,rendered condition c unsatisfied 
the salient fact is that paul revere,having held the note from the date of its issuance,was a member of the textron group when the note was redeemed for purposes of section d i,income tax,we determine the status of paul revere as a member or nonmember of the textron consolidated group at the time of redemption of the note.we interpret the word nonmember in that provision of the regulations as applying to cases where a member of the consolidated group cancels or redeems an obligation that is held,or was held,by a corporation that is a nonmember at the time of cancellation or redemption.
citing boris bittker lawrence lokken,federal taxation of income,estates and gifts,the tax regulations ed,the tax court observed 
t he consolidated return regulations are built on the premise that members of a consolidated group are a single economic entity with regard to intercompany transactions and distributions and that resulting gains or losses are given effect only when the transferred property,or stock of the transacting member,leaves the consolidated group.
at the time avco redeemed its note from paul revere,both were members of the textron group,and remained so until the end of the taxable year.thus,reasoned the court,there were no dealings with outsiders that would entitle textron to take into account the loss from this intercompany transaction.the court characterized textron position as incongruous with the purpose of the consolidated return regulations and as lead ing to an unreasonable result.
the tax court bolstered its holding by comparing the result in this case with a hypothetical redemption,had avco redeemed paul revere stock in for cash rather than a note.in the model,paul revere loss on the redemption would still have been deferred even though avco and paul revere were then members of the textron rather than the avco group.the court concluded it would be illogical to defer gains and losses on redemptions but recognize them where the consideration,in part,was a note.
the remaining issues in the case were resolved,and the parties agreed upon the resulting tax liabilities.with respect to the tax court interpretation of reg.d i c,textron timely appealed.
ii.arguments on appeal 
we review de novo the legal question whether the tax court correctly interpreted the consolidated return regulations for,including reg.d i.medchem,comm r,cir.the facts in this case are not disputed.
although the result advanced by the tax court and now by commissioner on appeal is the same,their rationales differ.the court reasoned the key moment in ascertaining membership status was the note redemption.because paul revere then was a member,reasoned the court,reg.d i c is unmet.rather than adopt this single point theory of membership determination,commissioner offers a plain language reading of reg.d i,looking to the relationship between relevant parties.because paul revere and avco,the tw
