background 
usa choice is an internet service provider isp that provides internet access to residential and business customers in pennsylvania.see generally cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d contrasting internet access with broadband service,and noting that t he traditional means by which consumers in the united states access the network of interconnected computers that make up the internet is through connections provided over local telephone facilities.using these connections,consumers access the internet by making calls with computer modems through the telephone wires owned by local phone companies internal citations omitted.usa choice provided network access servers equipped with modems at several locations throughout pennsylvania known as points of presence pops.
during the relevant time period,customers would connect to usa choice servers by using computer modems to dial a local telephone number or access number associated with one of these pops.one of the network server modems would answer this incoming call and establish a connection between the computers this connection required telephonic quality to successfully facilitate communication.usa choice.at.subsequent to establishing a telephonic quality connection between a usa choice network server modem at the pop and a customer computer modem,the following communication took place usa choice server requested a username and password the response was compared to usa choice records and if the user could be confirmed,usa choice provided a connection to the internet through its network.upon several failed authentication attempts,however,usa choice modem would instead disconnect the call.id.because neither usa choice nor the telephone companies blocked incoming calls from subscribers who were not usa choice customers,anyone could dial one of the isp access numbers and connect at least briefly to one of usa choice pops.if the caller used a regular telephone instead of a modem,however,he or she might hear a set of beeps before being disconnected.id.this accessibility allowed usa choice customers to connect to its servers from any telephone number,provided they used valid usernames and passwords.
customers connect to the local telephone company,known as a local exchange carrier lec,through a standard analog phone line known as pots,an acronym for plain old telephone service.by comparison,usa choice pops connected to the lecs via dedicated circuits consisting of a group of digital communications channels purchased by usa choice from telephone companies including alltel,sprint,verizon,and verizon predecessor entities gte and bell atlantic.id.at.the majority of these digital lines were generally known as primary rate interface pri or pra circuits.these lines could carry simultaneous communications,which could all be associated with a single local telephone number.id.at.other services purchased by usa choice included digital channel services dcs and basic rate interface bri or bra circuits.id.at.
at issue in this case are excise taxes levied on these lines connecting usa choice pops to the local telephone companies.id.at.section a of the internal revenue code imposes a three percent excise tax on communications services,which include local telephone service.b a.section a defines local telephone service as,inter alia,access to a local telephone system,and the privilege of telephonic quality communication with substantially all persons having telephone or radio telephone stations constituting a part of such local telephone system.a.local telephone service excludes toll telephone service and private communication service,which are defined in subsections b and d respectively.see a.
usa choice filed a refund request with the internal revenue service irs on may.after the irs disallowed this request,usa choice filed suit in the court of federal claims on may.usa choice argued that the services at issue fall outside the scope of a because lines do not meet the definition of local telephone service in a,and,alternatively,because they meet the private communication services exclusion from taxation as defined in d.it also presented argument pertaining to excise taxes on long distance service not relevant to this appeal.the court of federal claims held a trial in july and also considered briefing and argument.the court of federal claims ultimately issued an opinion granting usa choice the majority of the refund it desired,holding that usa choice lines were not local telephone service under a and that nearly all of the remaining contested lines met the private communication service exception of d.usa choice.at.the government timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

local telephone service 
the court of federal claims held that those lines that were,lines that did not permit outbound not meet the definition of local telephone service and thus were taxed improperly.usa choice.at.not all of usa choice lines were found to be truly,however,and these other lines were analyzed under the private communication service provision,discussed infra.
on appeal,the government argues that the statutory text does not preclude treatment of lines as local telephone service and that the restrictions placed by usa choice on communications over these lines were irrelevant to its privilege to use the underlying service,which is subject to the excise tax.the government also urges us to defer to various irs revenue rulings under chevron,natural resources defense council,d.usa choice argues that the revenue rulings do not bind us and responds to the government by asserting that its lines could not provide it with access to a local telephone system,nor the privilege of communication with substantially all other subscribers,because it could not affirmatively initiate calls.it further contends that because it disconnected calls from subscribers without modems and from persons who are not customers,it did not communicate with substantially all subscribers in the local system.
access to a local telephone system 
the statute provides 
a local telephone purposes of this subchapter,the term local telephone service means 
the access to a local telephone system,and the privilege of telephonic quality communication with substantially all persons having telephone or radio telephone stations constituting a part of such local telephone system,and 
any facility or service provided in connection with a service described in paragraph.
the term local telephone service does not include any service which is a toll telephone service or a private communication service as defined in subsections b and d.
a.in construing a statute,we begin with its literal text,giving it its plain meaning.hawkins united states.we begin with the requirement that local telephone service provide access to a local telephone system.a.the court of federal claims found this access prong unhelpful and thus did not rely on it.usa choice.at.it found that dictionary definitions of access could be read in multiple ways and that our prior decision in united states,interpreting access in the context of teletypewriter exchange service,which is also subject to the communications excise tax and is defined in section c,did not address the directionality of messages.usa choice.at.
on appeal,usa choice argues that this prong presents an alternative ground for affirmance.it argues,as it did to the court of federal claims,that access connotes the right to enter,and that because usa choice can only passively receive incoming calls,it can not affirmatively enter the local telephone system.usa choice also relies on our observation in that a particular device providing access to the telex network allowed subscribers to any other network subscriber.at.the government responds that another common definition of access is the ability to obtain or make use of.it also asserts that stands for the opposite proposition by citing the following discussion of the technological meaning of the word access in that opinion from the weight of the credible evidence,the trial judge determined that the word access was recognized in the communications field in general,and with respect to the telex network in particular,as meaning the interface or connection between the telex network transmission lines and the central exchange and the customer terminal.id.at emphases added.
we agree that general dictionary definitions of access provide little insight.definitions contemporaneous with the introduction of this statutory language include restrictive language implying a right to enter as well as broad language merely requiring the ability to make use of something.webster third new international dictionary defining access as,inter alia,permission,liberty,or ability to enter,approach,communicate with,or pass to and from,freedom or ability to obtain or make use of,and a way by which a thing or place may be approached or reached.our decision in,however,which involved a very similar and related subsection of the same statute,informs that the technological meaning of the word access in the communications field in general mean s the interface or connection between the central exchange and the customer terminal.at.because this provision is so closely related to the definition at issue,and because the language of this prong is so similar,compare a the access to a local telephone system,with c the access from a teletypewriter or other data station to the teletypewriter exchange system,we find this interpretation of access persuasive in concluding that access simply means connectivity.see finnegan leu,d certainly one would expect that if congress had intended identical language to have substantially different meanings in different sections of the same enactment it would have manifested its intention in some concrete fashion.we recognize that the opinion ultimately addressed a different legal issue,but this broad recognition of general industry understanding likely indicates that the directionality of messages bears no relation to the term access in the statute.we turn then to the second prong of the statutory definition of local telephone service.
b.the privilege of telephonic quality communication 
the court of federal claims held that usa choice did not enjoy the privilege of telephonic quality communication with substantially all persons having telephone stations constituting a part of such local telephone system,a emphasis added,on its lines because it could not choose to initiate communications with whomever it chose to call,usa choice.at,and because with does not encompass communications,id.at the government devotes the majority of its appeal to arguing that this language is consistent with service and that the court of federal claims erred by holding otherwise.
usa choice argues that congress must have intended with to require the ability to communicate to and from other telephone subscribers based on the contrasting statutory language used in an adjacent subsection.specifically,the definition of toll telephone service,requires the privilege of an unlimited number of telephonic communications to or from all or a substantial portion of the persons having telephone stations in a specified area which is outside the local telephone system area.b emphasis added.usa choice contends that without the ability to initiate calls,it did not enjoy the privilege of communicating with other local subscribers,and that construing this language to encompass lines would impermissibly import the allegedly broader language of subsection b.see dep t of hous.urban,in light of congress choice of different language in subsections of the same statute,it would be inappropriate to construe the narrower language that congress chose for the prohibition as if it were equivalent to the broader language that congress chose for the exemptions.it further argues that congress must have intended to impose these directional restrictions in the statute because subsection b was amended specifically to include wide area telephone service wats,which at the time could only be used to make outbound calls.
the court of federal claims agreed with usa choice and held that while t he words to or from capture communications the word with connotes reciprocity.usa choice.at citing webster seventh new collegiate dictionary indicating that with is used as a functional word to indicate one to whom a usu ally reciprocal communication is made alteration in original.even if we accept this conclusion,however,it does little to resolve the underlying dispute.after all,most telephone calls,including communications negotiated by computer modems,involve reciprocal communication once a connection has been established.for example,i spoke with jane on the phone does not indicate who initiated the conversation.as another court of federal claims decision dealing with nearly identical facts correctly observed,interpreting this statute requires us to recognize that inward dialing and communication are not synonymous phrases that once a call was initiated,communication occurred over lines that supported telephonic quality communication.comcation,united states.while the access prong of the statute is focused on connectivity,the communication with prong refers to what happens after that connection is established.the issue therefore is whether communication existed on usa choice lines after a call was initiated.here,even the authentication process demonstrates that communication occurred during connections to usa choice network servers because a server communicated requests for usernames and passwords,which were communicated back to the server by the subscribers who dialed the access number.
nor does congress use of different prepositions in subsection b compel the narrow reading of subsection a advanced by usa choice.a more natural reading of the statute indicates that this distinction likely relates to than.subsection a refers to communication singular with in the abstract,while subsection b is framed in terms of an unlimited number of individual communications plural to or from.even accepting usa choice argument,however,would not compel a different result.because the privilege of communication with another party requires only the possibility of communication after a call is initiated,as discussed above,the distinction usa choice reads into the use of communication with instead of communications to or from is irrelevant to the outcome of this case.
a review of the legislative history behind this language further supports our conclusion that congress did not intend for local telephone service to turn on the ability to make outbound calls.congress first levied excise taxes on telephone services as part of the spanish war act of,and since that time has updated,modified,repealed,and extended the communications excise tax numerous times.see generally officemax,united states,cir.the language at issue in this case originates in congress amendment to sections and as part of the excise tax reduction act of,stat,which created the local telephone service category as a successor to the general telephone service category defined in as part of the excise tax technical changes act of,stat.see,as reprinted in,the definition of local telephone service previously general telephone service ha s been updated and modified to make it clear that it is the service as such which is being taxed and not merely the equipment being supplied,as reprinted in,same.as we observed in,one of the primary motivations for this amendment was the creation of the private communication services exemption.see at.another motivation was the aforementioned desire to shift the focus of the tax to the services rather than the equipment being provided.additionally,as observed in comcation,the definition of general telephone service was redesignated local telephone service,and the definition of toll telephone service was updated to clarify that wats was included in toll telephone service and excluded from local telephone service.at and cites therein.usa choice argues that this change indicates a desire to exclude services that could be initiated only by one party from the local telephone service category.
first,there is no indication that the definition of general telephone service was in any way related to the ability to make outgoing calls.prior to,section defined general telephone service as 
any telephone service furnished in connection with any telephone station which may be connected directly or indirectly to an exchange operated by a person engaged in the business of furnishing communication service,if by means of such connection communication may be established with any other telephone station.
a.the legislative history surrounding the creation of this previous language indicates that the ability to originate calls was not essential.see,as reprinted in,if the existing facilities may be so connected as described in section a,it is immaterial that the practice of the subscriber is not to make such connections,or that the person engaged in the business of furnishing communication service denies permission to the subscriber to make such connections.because the definition of local telephone service was designed to track the earlier definition of general telephone service with the exceptions noted,and because the services purchased by usa choice are neither wats nor private communication services as discussed infra,we see no reason to infer that congress meant to impose other new limitations on local telephone service related to call initiation.
second,although usa choice argues that the amendment of the toll telephone service definition to include wats indicates an intent to remove any or lines from the definition of local telephone service,we find no support for this argument.the house and senate reports clarify that wats is included in toll telephone service,but their description of this service notably excludes any mention of restrictions on incoming or outgoing calls.see,as reprinted in,this is a service whereby,for a flat charge,the subscriber is entitled to make unlimited calls within a defined area sometimes limited as to the maximum number of hours,as reprinted in,same.these reports also discuss local telephone service without even mentioning the allegedly critical communication with substantially all persons language.see,as reprinted in,i n the case of local telephone service,the definition makes it clear that it is the right of access to a local telephone system and the privilege of telephonic quality communication which is taxed together with facilities or services provided with this service,as reprinted in,same.moreover,the inclusion of with in the amendments can not be accorded any significance as it relates to the prior statutory text because the replaced text similarly recited communication may be established with any other telephone station.emphasis added.accordingly,the more logical reading of the statutes and legislative histories indicates that the purpose of the amendments with respect to wats related to the long distance characteristics of the service rather than to any limitations related to directionality.
as previously mentioned,the court of federal claims also held that usa choice did not enjoy the privilege of communication with substantially all persons having telephone stations,because its pop servers could only communicate with subscribers who used a modem.usa choice.at.the court of federal claims further held that even if substantially all of the relevant subscribers used modems to call usa choice,there would be no communication with before they were disconnected by usa choice servers because t he transmission of the identification request is so limited that it can not be considered to be a telephonic quality communication in the ordinary sense of those words.id.at.usa choice presents several arguments defending these determinations,while the government responds that usa choice position improperly focuses on actual use instead of the privilege of use specified in the statute.
usa choice arguments ignore evidence that these use restrictions relate solely to usa choice own limitations.usa choice decision to connect these lines to modems in its network servers rather than to telephones through equipment such as a multiplexor or pbx,see id.at,though perfectly understandable for a commercial in limits that did not fundamentally alter the nature of the services that usa choice had the privilege to use,comcation.at.usa choice configuration decision no more limited the underlying service capabilities than would a subscriber choice to connect a facsimile machine rather than a telephone set to his or her telephone line furthermore,as the court of federal claims found in this case,a successful connection between one of usa choice server modems and another subscriber modem required telephonic quality.usa choice.at.this telephonic quality connection was established even where authentication ultimately failed and usa choice consequently disconnected the call.id.at.as with its choice to utilize modems,usa choice can not alter the inherent capabilities of the communication services it purchased merely by establishing a system for disconnecting calls with subscribers other than its customers.
it is undisputed that privilege implicates either a right or legal freedom rather than actual use.see id.at see also comcation.at nothing about the word privilege connotes that the service purchased must actually be used by the taxpayer in the fashion covered by the excise tax.the court of federal claims noted that usa choice agrees that it is a line actual capabilities,not its use,that govern taxability.usa choice.at quoting usa choice reply brief alteration in original see also comdata network,united states,holding that the toll telephone tax applied because the plaintiff had the right to utilize the telephone lines to communicate in accordance with b.that the service may not,in fact,be so used by plaintiff is irrelevant to the existence of the privilege accord rul,where a telephone service provides the subscriber the privilege of telephonic quality communication with substantially all other subscribers to the local telephone system,it is immaterial whether the subscriber exercises the privilege.this focus on the nature of the service comports with the legislative history of the excise tax reduction act of,which indicates that t he definition of local telephone service ha s been updated and modified to make it clear that it is the service as such which is being taxed and not merely the equipment being supplied,as reprinted in.here,it is undisputed that anyone could call usa choice access numbers and at least briefly connect,and that it was usa choice decision to implement modems and to enforce user logins to trigger disconnects that precluded further reciprocal communication.
for the foregoing reasons,we hold that neither the inability to place outgoing calls,nor the choice to communicate using computer modems,nor the password authentication scheme employed by usa choice excludes the communication services it purchased from the definition of local telephone service subject to the communications excise tax of section a.
we note that our holding does not conflict with revenue rulings in which the irs has held lines subject to the communications excise tax.see,rul,in defining taxable local telephone service,section a makes no distinction between systems that provide access to a local telephone network only by receiving calls and systems that both receive and originate calls accordingly,the fact that the system at issue can only receive incoming calls from a local telephone system is not material to the tax determination.citing rul.thus,we need not address the extent of accorded to these rulings.see generally of am.united states,noting that revenue rulings merely represent the position of the united states and do not bind this court,but that we may refer to revenue rulings for guidance and accept that reasoning in whole or in part to assist our understanding of the language of the revenue code.
nor do our interpretations of the access and communication with prongs render either prong of section a superfluous or redundant.see,walters metro.educ,d statutes must be interpreted,if possible,to give each word some operative effect.the words access and communication must be viewed within the context of the statute.see,davis.dep t of the treasury,d it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.the second prong is not rendered superfluous because the communication prong requires telephonic quality,whereas the access prong only requires connectivity.nor is the connectivity connoted by access encompassed within the communication requirement of the second prong.the statute requires access to a local telephone system and telephonic quality communication with substantially all persons having telephone stations constituting a part of such local telephone system.a emphases added.we need look no further than the next subsection of the statute to find an example of services providing communication with subscribers to a local telephone system but not access to that local system.section b explicitly provides that toll telephone service entitles the subscriber to the privilege of an unlimited number of telephonic communications to or from all or a substantial portion of the persons having telephone stations in a specified area which is outside the local telephone system area in which the station provided with this service is located.b.thus,toll telephone service provides communication with members of a local telephone system despite not having direct access to that local system.as another example,in the recent vonage case,we described how s ince vonage has provided telephone service to its subscribers through voice over ip voip technology vonage system uses the internet to transmit telephone signals,rather than using the traditional public switched telephone network pstn.when vonage subscribers place calls to on the pstn,vonage system transmits the signals through the internet,and then relays them to the pstn.verizon servs.vonage holdings.
although toll telephone services and voip technology can be said to indirectly access at least the local telephone network of the recipient,arguments that this qualifies as access under section a have been consistently rejected by other courts.for example,in officemax,the government argue d that officemax plan must be a service provided in connection with a local telephone service because all services eventually require access to local telephone systems.at.the court rejected this argument and held that the definition of service requires access to a local telephone system,not access to every local telephone system included within the boundaries of a plan.id.at accord reese,united states,cir am.bankers ins.group united states,cir am.online,united states.thus,in at least some circumstances,one can have the privilege of telephonic quality communication with persons in various local telephone systems without having access to those systems under the statute.accordingly,this prong of the definition retains independent meaning under our interpretation of access.
finally,we are mindful of the principle that if doubt exists as to the construction of a taxing statute,the doubt should be resolved in favor of the taxpayer.xerox united states,quoting hassett welch.however,this is not such a case.here doubts which may arise upon a cursory examination of the statutory provisions at issue disappear when they are read,as they must be,with every other material part of the statute,and in the light of their legislative history.white united states.internal citation omitted see also irwin gavit.noting that although the tax laws should be construed favorably for the taxpayers that is not a reason for creating a doubt or for exaggerating one.
private communication service 
having concluded that usa choice lines provided local telephone service,we must now turn to the court of federal claims decision that even the local telephone service lines were nonetheless exempt from the communications excise tax of a because they met the requirements of a private communication service.usa choice.at.section d defines private communication service as 
the communication service furnished to a subscriber which entitles the subscriber 
a to exclusive or priority use of any communication channel or groups of channels,
regardless of whether such channel,groups of channels,or intercommunication system may be connected through switching with a service described in subsection a local telephone service,b,or c.
the statute also requires that a separate charge is made for such service.d 
the court of federal claims analysis and the parties arguments on appeal focus on the statutory requirement that a private communication service must entitle usa choice to exclusive or priority use of any communication channel or groups of channels.d a.the parties debate the similarity between the private communication service defined in the statute and industry definitions related to private lines.usa choice also argues that the statutory language clearly contemplates private communication systems connected to a local telephone exchange,that it did not have to share its lines to the local,those lines only allowed calls to or from usa choice pops,and that the legislative history indicates congressional intent supporting a broad interpretation of this provision.the government principal argument is that while an exempted private communication service may be connected with an lec,the exemption does not extend to the very lines making that connection.additionally,the government again contends that we should defer to irs revenue rulings and makes various arguments based on the legislative history and a prior private communication service exemption.we conclude that the court of federal claims erred in applying the private communication service exemption to the lines at issue in this case.
the most significant shortcoming in the court of federal claims analysis is that it failed to recognize that usa choice lines did not serve to provide a distinct communication service regardless of whether that service may be connected through switching with a local telephone service.d emphasis added.this statutory language requires that the system at issue provide a communication service beyond that of mere local telephone service,not just connectivity to the local telephone system itself.dedicated lines that,alone or in combination with other privately owned or publicly shared equipment,do no more than furnish a subscriber with the ability to obtain local telephone service do not constitute the statutorily defined private communication service entitled to the exemption of d.as contrasted with typical private lines,pbx systems,centrex systems,and answering service switchboard systems in existence at the time this statutory provision was enacted,all of which could be characterized as having communication channels that facilitated communications services beyond mere local telephone service,the lines at issue in this case served only to provide connectivity to the lec and not to facilitate o
