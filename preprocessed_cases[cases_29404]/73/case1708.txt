in,the franchise tax board board informed the mcknight ranch,mcknight that it had underpaid state taxes by approximately.mcknight protested without success,then paid the disputed tax and filed a refund claim.in discussions with mcknight,the board reiterated the view that the tax was owed,but offered to deny the refund claim summarily so that mcknight could proceed in court.mcknight accepted the offer and filed suit.
the board now concedes that under the contested liability doctrine,no tax was ever owed.it nevertheless suggests that because of its summary denial of mcknight refund claim,mcknight failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and the board should be allowed to retain the excess tax.
equity does not allow such a result.the common law rule that the government could not be estopped was abandoned in california more than a century ago.where equity requires it,as where a government agent actions have induced noncompliance with procedural requirements,the government may be estopped from asserting those procedural bars against a citizen recovery.we affirm the trial court grant of judgment in favor of mcknight.
factual and procedural background 
mcknight operates a rice farm in butte county.in,bank of america represented to mcknight that it had substantial farm management and marketing experience,and persuaded mcknight to consolidate its banking with bank of america.bank of america extended annual lines of credit to mcknight and exerted substantial influence over mcknight farming operations over the next six years.between and,mcknight paid bank of america more than in principal and interest on approximately in loans.as of,bank of america contended approximately million was still owed.mcknight disputed this amount.
in,mcknight sued bank of america for breach of fiduciary duty,misrepresentations,misappropriation of funds,and assorted other malfeasance resulting in significant losses to mcknight.the parties settled in,with bank of america discharging the purported million debt for a payment of and dismissal of the suit.mcknight did not report the discharge as income on its income tax return.
the board audited mcknight return.in june,it determined that of the debt discharged by bank of america was taxable income and assessed in additional taxes.
in november,mcknight filed a protest of the assessment.mcknight protest contended that the was not taxable income under the tax benefit rule and the contested liability doctrine.in,the board protest unit denied mcknight protest.
mcknight attempted to resolve the dispute with the board settlement bureau.that effort failed.
in,mcknight paid the disputed in additional taxes and filed an amended return and refund claim.in february,the board denied mcknight refund claim.mcknight thereupon filed suit for refund in superior court.
the parties submitted a set of stipulated facts and documents.after a trial,the court issued a statement of decision ruling in favor of mcknight.on march,it entered judgment for mcknight,awarding it the in overpaid taxes plus pre and interest.
the board has timely appealed.on appeal,it contends that the trial court ignored mcknight failure to exhaust its administrative remedies in proceedings before the board.
discussion 
standard of review 
when the parties have submitted a tax matter on stipulated facts and documentary evidence and there is no conflict in that evidence,this court is confronted with questions of law rather than fact.we independently review the record and are not bound by the trial court determination.wilson franchise tax bd.th,d.however,when the trial court makes factual findings on disputed issues,we review those findings under the substantial evidence test.tenneco west,franchise tax bd.d.
the board contends that the trial court erred by failing to draft its own statement of decision,and that we should therefore review de novo even those findings that hinged on disputed evidence.estate of larson d.in estate of larson,the appellate court reversed because the record demonstrated that the trial court had misapprehended the legal standards governing a particular factual finding.in such circumstances,the appellate court declined to apply a substantial evidence standard of review because the trial court never weighed the evidence with the correct standard in mind.ibid.
estate of larson does not support a departure from the substantial evidence standard here.in order to free time to consider the merits of parties disputes,state trial courts routinely solicit draft statements of decision.the preparation of a statement of decision should place no extra burden on the trial courts.a party may be,and often should be,required to prepare the statement.whittington mckinney d,fn.a trial court may then select which findings it agrees with as supported by the evidence and adopt them,rather than having to prepare a statement of decision from scratch.that a court does so creates no inference that it has failed to engage in a thoughtful weighing of the evidence,and does not license us to ignore its findings of fact.see western aggregates,county of yuba th,d.here,the trial court adopted virtually all of mcknight proposed statement of decision,but struck the portion with which it disagreed,a finding that the board position was without substantial justification and that mcknight was entitled to attorney fees.we decline to displace the trial court from its role as fact finder and review its findings de novo.instead,we adhere to the traditional substantial evidence test.
ii.as a matter of substantive tax law,mcknight owed no tax under the contested liability doctrine 
after eight years,the board offers no substantive rebuttal to mcknight argument that it owed no tax under the contested liability doctrine.under that doctrine,the purported debt discharged by the bank of america was not taxable.
ordinarily,the discharge of a loan will give rise to taxable income.the doctrine applies when a taxpayer who has incurred a financial obligation is thereafter relieved of liability,in whole or in part.when that happens,the taxpayer recognizes taxable income equal to the difference between the initial obligation and the amount,if any,paid to discharge that obligation.estate of smith cir.this is so because b orrowed funds are excluded from income in the first instance because the taxpayer obligation to repay the funds offsets any increase in the taxpayer assets if the taxpayer is thereafter released from his obligation to repay,the taxpayer enjoys a net increase in assets equal to the forgiven portion of the debt and the basis for the original exclusion thus evaporates.united states centennial savings bank fsb,d.
however,an exception arises when the discharge results from a dispute over whether the greater amount actually was owed.under the contested liability doctrine,if a taxpayer,in good faith,disputed the amount of a debt,a subsequent settlement of the dispute would be treated as the amount of debt cognizable for tax purposes.the excess of the original debt over the amount determined to have been due is disregarded for both loss and debt accounting purposes.zarin cir.the law thus accepts the parties fixing of the amount of the debt and treats the greater asserted amount as a nullity.
here,mcknight contends that it disputed in good faith the amount it owed the bank of america.consequently,under the contested liability doctrine,the bank of america cancellation of million of the purported million debt owed by mcknight would not be taxable income,but simply a bookkeeping consequence of the parties liquidation of the amount of the disputed debt.at the close of trial,the trial court agreed with mcknight,adopted mcknight proposed statement of decision,and held that under contested liability principles mcknight owed no tax on the cancelled portion of the bank of america debt.
on appeal,the board does not dispute this conclusion.at oral argument,it expressly conceded that the contested liability doctrine exempted the cancelled portion of the debt from taxation.we thus treat it as established that mcknight did not owe the it paid when it filed its amended return 
iii.the board had actual notice of mcknight contested liability argument in the course of resolving the refund claim 
notwithstanding the fact that substantively,no tax was owed,the board contends that mcknight should be barred from a refund for procedural reasons.it argues that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to order a refund based on the contested liability doctrine because mcknight failed to exhaust its administrative remedies.we disagree.
under revenue and taxation code section,every administrative claim for refund shall be in writing,shall be signed by the taxpayer or the taxpayer authorized representative,and shall state the specific grounds upon which it is founded.an administrative claim for refund is a prerequisite to filing suit a fter payment of the tax and denial by the franchise tax board of a claim for refund,any taxpayer claiming that the tax computed and assessed is void in whole or in part may bring an action,upon the grounds set forth in that claim for refund,against the franchise tax board for the recovery of the whole or any part of the amount paid.
in essence,the board argues that these statutes set out a pleading requirement has the taxpayer pleaded a particular ground within the four corners of its filed refund claim,while mcknight argues that the statutes sets out a notice requirement has the taxing authority been given notice of a particular ground in the course of litigating the refund claim.we agree with mcknight and conclude that because the board had actual notice of mcknight contested liability argument,mcknight exhausted its administrative remedies.
when interpreting and applying sections and,our task is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.people coronado cal th,d.thus,we focus on the legislature intent in imposing administrative exhaustion requirements for tax refund actions.the purpose of these statutory exhaustion requirements is to ensure that the board receives sufficient notice of the claim and its basis.citation.the board then has an opportunity to correct any mistakes,thereby conserving judicial resources.citation.preston state bd.of equalization cal th,d,preston section requires no particular form the claim only must be in writing and state the grounds therefor.indeed,the purpose of the statute is to put the board on notice of a claim wertin franchise tax bd.th,d.
satisfaction of this to the board so that it may rectify mistakes and conserve judicial not hinge on whether a particular issue is recited expressly in the initial claim for refund.if the board has notice of the taxpayer argument from whatever source during the course of resolving the claim for refund,it has the opportunity to reevaluate its position,reach the correct result,and obviate the need for a subsequent lawsuit.we see no basis for construing the statutes setting out the administrative exhaustion requirement so as to ignore actual notice the board may have had from sources other than the four corners of the initial claim.
the supreme court has at least implicitly agreed with this conclusion.in wallace berrie state bd.of equalization cal d,the taxpayer did not expressly challenge a state board of equalization regulation in its refund claim.the board of equalization argued that this constituted a failure to exhaust administrative remedies and barred further judicial proceedings.the supreme court concluded that the refund claim at least indirectly challenged the regulation claim.more important for our purposes,it held that whether or not the refund claim actually raised the issue,the board of equalization subsequent conduct demonstrated that the board of equalization was aware of the issue and thus the exhaustion doctrine did not preclude the taxpayer challenge moreover,any question as to whether the refund claim actually raised the issue was dispelled by the board subsequent trial stance addressing the issue on the merits.although berrie refund claim might have been drafted with greater clarity,it appears that the board was well aware that berrie was challenging the validity of regulation c.on this record,we can not say that berrie failed to exhaust its administrative remedies prior to filing suit challenging the regulation.id.at,fn.the supreme court reasoning suggests that actual notice of the taxpayer position is sufficient to satisfy exhaustion requirements.
similarly,in jimmy swaggart ministries state bd.of equalization d,the court looked beyond the initial claim to determine whether the board had notice of the ground for refund.the court found a failure to exhaust,but only after considering the entire record before the board and determining that the taxpayer had not raised the claim.see id.at.
in arguing the absence of exhaustion,the board relies principally on shiseido cosmetics america franchise tax bd.d.shiseido.we do not find shiseido applicable.in shiseido,the taxpayer neglected to file a refund claim.id.at.consequently,it failed to exhaust its administrative remedies.shiseido thus stands for the unexceptional,and statutorily clear,requirement that a taxpayer must file a refund claim before proceeding with a suit for refund.it has no relevance where,as here,a refund claim was filed.see barclay bank internat.franchise tax bd.th,d.
our conclusion that exhaustion hinges on actual notice,not the precise language of the initial claim,comports with longstanding policy concerning refund claims.it has long been the policy of california courts to liberally construe claims for refund of taxes.in recognition of the reality that many,if not most,applicants are laymen who would be denied hearings if formalized technical rules were followed,it has been the judicial policy of this state to construe such applications liberally in favor of the applicant.it has been stated that an application is adequate and the purpose of the statutory requirement is served if the board may know from said application or have some reasonable means of ascertaining therefrom what the claim of the applicant is,to the end that such claims may be investigated by the assessing authorities prior to the hearing.citation.citation.focus cable of oakland,county of alameda d.
we decline to elevate form over function by disregarding matter outside the initial refund claim.instead,we consider whether on the evidence before it the trial court could conclude that the board had actual notice of mcknight contested liability argument.we hold that the trial court could so conclude.the evidence demonstrates that the board was aware of mcknight contested liability argument.
mcknight argued the contested liability doctrine in its original protest of the board audit conclusions.after its protest was denied,it paid the disputed amount and filed a claim for refund.mcknight initial claim for refund did not recite the contested liability doctrine as an express basis for refund of the tax,but it did indicate that mcknight was challenging the denial of its original protest in processing the refund claim,board auditor nathan greve greve reviewed the protest hearing report,including mcknight assertion of the contested liability doctrine 
mcknight attorney you were given possession of certain materials on the history of this claim is that true 
greve well,no.actually,what happens is the claim is assigned to me.we research to make sure there are any other issues involving this particular taxpayer that particular year.we found there had been an actual assessment issued and that there had been a protest of that.and then i ordered those files up and looked at those files.and upon examining the claim 
q so you looked at the protest file in examining the refund claim 
a yes,that true.
q you looked at all the materials in the protest file 
a yes,we did.
q and you read those materials thoroughly to understand what had happened 
a yes,i did.
q are you aware that the mcknights had raised in a protest hearing the issue of the contested liability doctrine 
q you were 
despite that awareness,the board position did not change.on march,after reviewing the claim file,greve wrote mcknight the information contained within the audit and protest hearing report appears to support the
