in pala,established an employees profit sharing plan and trust,for which pala served as trustee.the irs sent pala favorable determination letters,which stated that the plan was qualified as a profit sharing plan.in pala decided to terminate the plan and received a favorable termination letter from the irs.all of the plan assets were distributed except those belonging to jose ricardo tarajano,pala president.his assets consisted of pala stock.tarajano sought to place the stock in an ira account but could not find a willing financial institution.pala lacked sufficient funds to redeem tarajano stock and his assets remained in the plan.applying revenue ruling the irs consequently determined that the plan had not been terminated.on may,pala redeemed tarajano stock and distributed the balance to him.
on june,pala filed an additional request for an irs determination that the plan was terminated.the irs responded on april,by sending a proposed adverse determination letter to pala.in its letter,the irs indicated that,for the plan year ending may,and all years thereafter,the plan was not qualified as a tax exempt plan under.the irs asserted that the plan continued in existence and that no new employees had been admitted to participate the irs concluded that the plan was not terminated and that it was therefore not tax exempt for the years through.
pala filed form fiduciary income tax returns for the period and attached a request for waiver of penalties because the disqualification was retroactive pala appealed the irs proposed disqualification of the plan tax exempt status.in a letter to the irs dated may,pala argued that the irs could not retroactively disqualify the plan more than three years from the timely filing of a form with attached schedule pala argued that,because the proposed adverse determination letter was dated april,the irs could not retroactively disqualify the plan for any plan year prior to the plan year beginning june.moreover,pala also argued in its letter that the proposed disqualification was erroneous for all years.in the wake of this letter and discussions at an appellate conference,the irs refunded the tax paid for the plan years ending may,and.
on november,the irs issued its final determination letter,concluding that the plan was disqualified because it failed to meet the requirements of for the plan years beginning after may,and for all subsequent years.pala then sought a refund of taxes paid for and.it sent a letter to the irs on january,entitled,second request for refund,in which it reiterate d its prior request for refund for all taxes,interest and penalties paid for the years ending may,may,may,and may,plus interest thereon.on march,pala sent a follow up letter making the same request.the irs granted a partial refund on april,refunding only the tax.
pala filed suit for a refund of for the year ending may.the district court dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,asserting that pala did not file a timely administrative claim for refund of the tax.the court denied pala motion for new trial,which the court treated as a motion for reconsideration.pala appeals the dismissal of its claim 
in adopting a,congress waived sovereign immunity for purposes of civil actions against the united states for the recovery of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected.congress conditioned this waiver on the filing of refund claims within the appropriate statute of limitations according to the internal revenue code,a claim for a tax refund must be presented within years from the time the return was filed or years from the time the tax was paid,whichever of such periods expires the later,or if no return was filed by the taxpayer,within years from the time the tax was paid.in this case,the period of limitations began to run as of december,the due date for pala form with attached schedule p for fiscal year ending may.because pala return is deemed filed on december,pala had until december,to file a timely administrative claim for refund the code requires that a claim for refund be made on an amended version of the otherwise appropriate this case,form the timely filing of such a claim is a jurisdictional prerequisite to a refund suit 
pala argues that,although it never filed a refund claim within the limitations period,it presented a timely informal claim.while its theoretical underpinnings remain shrouded in some obscurity the informal claim doctrine has received the endorsement of the supreme court according to this doctrine,an informal claim is sufficient if it is filed within the statutory period,puts the irs on notice that the taxpayer believes an erroneous tax has been assessed,and describes the tax and year with sufficient particularity to allow the irs to undertake an investigation although an informal claim may include oral communications,it must have a written component there are no hard and fast rules for determining the sufficiency of an informal claim,and each case must be decided on its own facts with a view towards determining whether under those facts the commissioner knew,or should have known,that a claim was being made.however,it is not enough that the irs merely has information somewhere in its possession from which it might deduce that the taxpayer is entitled to a refund.
pala points to five potential sources of an informal claim pala may,letter the irs november,letter to pala the irs november,letter the irs april,letter and unspecified oral communications between pala and irs agents.none of the communications from the irs to pala indicate even indirectly that the irs was aware of a claim for the tax that was filed within the statutory period the portion of pala may,letter that addresses the limited retroactive application of the proposed ruling only extended to the years up to and including.as that portion of the letter did not specifically address the tax period,it did not provide the irs with notice sufficient to constitute an informal claim for that period 
the second portion of the may,letter initially provided the irs with the requisite notice.that section of the letter contained an objection to the basis for the proposed adverse determination itself.the letter requested that the entire adverse determination be withdrawn,thereby objecting to the tax levied on all of the years targeted by the proposed adverse.indeed,the irs proposed adverse determination letter,which was dated april,attempted to disqualify the plan for all plan years ending may,and subsequent years emphasis added the fact that pala letter does not specifically mention the year is irrelevant the irs had ample notice that the entire thus every year covered by the the subject of a claim for refund as this court has noted,the writing should not be given a crabbed or literal reading,ignoring all the surrounding circumstances which give it body and content.cases applying this doctrine have found informal claims in similar and arguably less compelling circumstances the may,letter is therefore consonant with the policy objective underlying the statute of,to provide the government with protection against stale demands.
however,in a submission to the district court,pala conceded that,although it had initially disagreed with the grounds for the disqualification,the disqualification of the plan in itself was ultimately not opposed by pala and is not a part of this proceeding.the dispute concerning the refund turns on how far back the plan could be retroactively disqualified.consequently,pala admits to abandoning its informal claim for refund of the tax.nothing in the record indicates that pala resurrected its cla
