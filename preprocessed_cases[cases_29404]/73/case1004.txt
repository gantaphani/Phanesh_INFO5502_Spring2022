the burlington northern santa fe railway company bnsf brought suit against two officials of the hualapai indian tribe,charles vaughn and wanda easter the tribal officials,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against their efforts to enforce or collect the hualapai tribe possessory interest tax against bnsf for use of the railroad through the reservation.the tribal officials filed a motion to dismiss,which the district court denied.the tribal officials bring this appeal.
we address the novel jurisdictional question whether,under cohen beneficial industrial loan,denial of a tribal sovereign immunity claim is appealable on an interlocutory basis as a collateral order.we hold that it is and proceed to review the district court ruling on the merits.we affirm the district court ruling that tribal sovereign immunity does not bar suit against easter,who is allegedly responsible for enforcing the tax at issue in this suit,but reverse with regard to vaughn,the tribe chairman,who has no alleged enforcement responsibilities to actually collect the tax.the tribal officials also appeal the district court denial of their exhaustion of tribal remedies claim.however,they do not assert an adequate basis to permit us to exercise jurisdiction over that claim now,and we dismiss the remainder of this interlocutory appeal.
viewed in the light most favorable to bnsf,as required on a motion to dismiss,see hydrick hunter,cir,the record reveals the following facts.bnsf operates its railroad on a congressionally granted through arizona that crosses the hualapai indian reservation.bnsf owns title to the,free of all claims by the tribe.
in,the hualapai tribal council enacted a tax by ordinance which imposes a tax on the value of certain possessory interests within the reservation.at oral argument,counsel for the tribe asserted the tax was intended to be in the nature of a use tax to reimburse the tribe for the cost of attending railway accidents or blockages since the mainline hosts upward of eighty trains daily that pass at one point through the heart of the tribal administrative center.in,bnsf brought suit challenging the tribe authority to apply the tax to the railroad.the parties settled and bnsf agreed to pay a lump sum to the tribe in lieu of any taxes,interest,and penalties that might otherwise have been assessed against it during tax years through.
on july,after the settlement agreement had expired,wanda easter,the tribe finance director,sent tax registration forms to bnsf.bnsf notified the tribe that it disputed the tribe jurisdiction to tax bnsf operation of the.the parties attempted to resolve their disagreement,but were unsuccessful.
bnsf subsequently filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of arizona seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the tribe efforts to enforce or collect the tax.the tribal officials responded with a motion to dismiss,claiming that the suit is barred by tribal sovereign immunity,bnsf failed to exhaust tribal remedies,and the tax does not violate federal law.the district court denied the motion,holding that tribal sovereign immunity did not bar bnsf claims against the tribal officials,bnsf was not required to exhaust tribal remedies because the tribal court plainly lacked jurisdiction,and bnsf allegation that the tax is unenforceable against it was sufficient to state a claim for relief.the tribal officials appealed.
our jurisdiction is circumscribed by,which provides the courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states a district court denial of a motion to dismiss is not a final decision within the meaning of.credit suisse dist.court for the cent.dist.of,cir.nonetheless,the supreme court has recognized an exception to the final judgment rule for that small class of orders which finally determine claims of right separable from,and collateral to,rights asserted in the action.cohen,at.
we have not previously decided whether a district court order denying a motion to dismiss on tribal sovereign immunity grounds is a collateral order which may be reviewed on an interlocutory basis.the tribe persuasively argues that by analogy to qualified immunity appeals under civil rights claims,the rule should be the same when an adverse decision is rendered denying tribal sovereign immunity as a complete defense to proceeding with the litigation.see mitchell forsyth,d.we agree.
as commonly expressed,the collateral order doctrine established in cohen permits interlocutory review of an order that conclusively determine s the disputed question,resolve s an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.coopers lybrand livesay,d.all three factors are met in this case.
the district court order conclusively determine d the disputed question,that is,whether the tribal officials are immune from suit,because there will be nothing in the subsequent course of the proceedings in the district court that can alter the court conclusion that the defendant s are not immune.see mitchell,at.
the district court order is also effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.see coopers lybrand,at.tribal sovereign immunity is rooted in federal common law and is a necessary corollary to indian sovereignty and.three affiliated tribes of the berthold reservation wold eng g,d.indian tribes,and tribal officials acting within the scope of their authority,are immune from lawsuits or court process in the absence of congressional abrogation or tribal waiver.kiowa tribe of,d united states yakima tribal court,cir.as with absolute,qualified,and eleventh amendment immunity,tribal sovereign immunity is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability and it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.see aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy,d quoting mitchell,at.osage tribal council dep t of labor,cir tamiami partners,miccosukee tribe of indians of,cir tribal sovereign immunity would be rendered meaningless if a suit against a tribe asserting its immunity were allowed to proceed to trial.
finally,the district court order resolve d an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action.see coopers lybrand,at.courts have generally found that claims of immunity are separate from the merits of the underlying action.see,mitchell,at.aqueduct sewer,at.compania mexicana de aviacion,dist.court for cent.dist.of,cir osage tribal council,at holding that whether the safe drinking water act abrogated the tribe immunity is distinct from the underlying merits of whether the tribe violated the plaintiff whistle blower rights under the act.likewise,the issue in this case,whether the tribal officials are subject to suit under the doctrine of ex parte young,is separate from the underlying merits of bnsf claim that the tax ordinance can not be enforced against its through the reservation.see verizon,pub.serv.comm of,d holding that the inquiry into whether suit lies under ex parte young does not include an analysis of the merits of the claim.
bnsf argues that interlocutory review is inappropriate because the district court did not resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,but rather applied settled precedent to determine that,under the doctrine of ex parte young,the tribal officials are not immune from suit.bnsf cites nixon fitzgerald,d,and in re kemble,cir,for the proposition that an issue is important only if it involves a serious and unsettled question of law.the serious and unsettled language bnsf cites does not define when an issue is important under this cohen factor.rather,it is a completely separate consideration,which is not normally cited as one of the elements of the collateral order doctrine.see charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure.
there is simply no requirement that the argument on appeal be novel.see schwartzman valenzuela,cir t he supreme court has authorized limited appellate review of a denial at the pretrial stage of a defense of immunity.state government
