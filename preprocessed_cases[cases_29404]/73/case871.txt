the panel affirmed the district court judgment in an action raising a statute of limitations challenge to the internal revenue service determination of tax liabilities in a partnership level proceeding under the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act.
in,the irs began investigating what it later determined to be a tax sheltering scheme and issued final partnership administration adjustments fpaas to many of the limited liability companies llcs that participated in that scheme.the adjustments effectively disallowed tax losses sustained through involvement in the scheme,and resulted in substantial tax liability for the llcs.the tax matters partner for the funds that constituted the tax shelters challenged the disallowance of losses.
taxpayers,an individual investor tom gonzales and his llc birch ventures,intervened in the action.the partnership tax return at issue was filed on april.absent an extension on the statute of limitations,the irs had until april,to assess taxes with respect to that return.gonzales personally signed two consents to extend the limitations period,and the irs issued a fpaa after the initial limitations period expired but within the extension granted by the consents.
the panel held that the statute of limitations extensions signed by gonzales were valid.the panel reasoned that an alleged conflict of interest,without more,does not vitiate the individual consent personally executed by a taxpayer and that,even crediting gonzales allegations in this case,the alleged actions by the irs do not constitute legal duress warranting relief.
thomas,chief judge 
we consider in this case whether consents to extend the statute of limitations for the assessment of tax attributable to a partnership item,signed by the,are invalid because of a third party alleged conflict of interest or duress.under the circumstances presented by this case,we conclude that they are not invalid,and we affirm the judgment of the district court.
this case arises out of an elaborate tax sheltering scheme that resulted in a massive internal revenue service irs investigation,multiple criminal indictments and convictions,and a senate investigation and hearing.the accounting firm kpmg developed and marketed an investment product called a bond linked issue premium structure,or blips.blips was a means of investing in foreign currencies that were pegged to the dollar,but its ultimate purpose was to generate tax losses for investors who sought to offset substantial taxable gains in a given year.in,several kpmg employees left the firm to form an investment advisory firm,presidio growth,llc presidio.presidio participated in the blips investment strategy and offered this program to its clients.
in order to participate in the blips program,a client would establish a limited liability company llc,which would take out a specific loan with a participating lender and contribute all of the loan funds to a strategic investment fund,an llc managed by presidio,which would then purchase foreign currency assets.after a brief period,usually about sixty days,the client would exit the blips program,the assets would be sold,and the loan would be repaid with interest and penalties.the result of this series of transactions was a tax loss for the client approximately equal to the amount of the offset he or she was seeking.
in,the irs launched an investigation into blips investments promoted by kpmg,presidio,and their principals.ultimately,several kpmg partners were indicted for conspiracy and tax evasion.see united states stein,supp.the irs also began auditing personal tax returns from and that claimed blips losses.when it became clear that blips was a tax sheltering scheme and not a true investment vehicle,the irs issued final partnership administration adjustments to many of the llcs that participated in the blips program.the adjustments effectively disallowed the tax losses sustained through blips involvement and resulted in substantial tax liability for the llcs.
presidio,as the tax matters partner for the strategic investment funds,brought the underlying action to challenge the irs determination disallowing losses on the partners tax returns.the government moved for summary judgment,arguing that the blips transactions lacked economic substance and should be excluded from affected tax returns.the district court concluded that the strategic investment funds constituted tax shelters,and granted summary judgment to the government.
an individual investor,tom gonzales,and his llc,birch ventures collectively gonzales,intervened in the action.gonzales participated in blips by forming birch ventures llc,which obtained a loan and invested the proceeds in the logan strategic investment fund logan presidio was logan tax matters partner logan filed its partnership tax return on april,so absent an extension of the statute of limitations,the irs had until april,to assess any taxes with respect to that return.see.gonzales personally signed consents on december,and october,that together extended the limitations period to june.the irs issued a final partnership administration adjustment to presidio for logan on april,after the initial limitations period expired but within the extension granted by the consents.
separately from presidio,gonzales moved for summary judgment,arguing that the irs failed to obtain valid extensions of the statute of limitations and that the final partnership administration adjustment issued to logan was therefore untimely.the district court granted summary judgment to the government,and gonzales appealed

the central issue in this case is the validity of the statute of limitation extensions signed by gonzales,the gonzales contends that the consents to extend the limitations period that he signed are invalid because his tax advisor had a conflict of interest and he signed the extensions under duress.
gonzales first argues that the consents to extend the limitations period that he personally signed are invalid because of the conflict of interest of his tax accountant and advisor,steve smith,because smith was instrumental in selling the tax shelter to gonzales,received a commission for involving gonzales in blips,and signed the tax return that the irs was auditing.according to gonzales,the irs was aware of these facts,but did not seek a waiver of the conflict.
other than this vague implication of wrongdoing,gonzales offers no evidence that smith involvement in promoting blips and his involvement in preparing gonzales tax return combined to create a conflict of interest three years later when the irs approached gonzales himself about extending the limitations period.there is no evidence in the record that the irs contacted smith during the time he was advising gonzales to request that gonzales agree to extend his limitations period.nor is there evidence that smith ever provided any advice to gonzales regarding extending his limitations period.furthermore,as the district court observed,a lthough steve smith represented gonzales during the audit that flowed from his tax return,gonzales had designated different representation before signing the consents.gonzales offers no evidence that his decision to consent to extend time was influenced by steve smith notwithstanding this latter designation.it was gonzales burden to point to evidence in the record showing a genuine dispute of fact on this point,fed.civ.c,and he has not done so.
although he does not explain precisely how smith involvement with blips and preparation of gonzales tax return taints the consents gonzales personally signed three and four years later,gonzales cites two cases in support of his argument that such a situation presents a disabling conflict of interest,transpac drilling venture comm r,cir,and phillips.these cases are easily distinguishable.
