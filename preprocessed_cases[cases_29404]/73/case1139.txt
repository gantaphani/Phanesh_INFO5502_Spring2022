the estate of richard simplot the estate appeals the judgment of the tax court determining an estate tax deficiency of.we hold that the tax court erroneously attributed a premium to minority voting stock in the simplot simplot.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the tax court and remand.
background and proceedings 
simplot is headquartered in boise,idaho and incorporated in nevada.it processes frozen food,in particular potatoes mines,processes and sells phosphate fertilizer owns large numbers of cattle and sells beef and owns over of the stock of micron technology.
simplot stock is divided into class a and class b common stock.only class a has voting rights.both classes have a right to dividends,if any are declared,on a per share basis.to date,no common stock dividends have ever been declared.class b stock has a slight advantage in its treatment on liquidation.class a stock is subject to a transfer restriction of days during which the company or another class a shareholder may purchase the stock.
at the time of evaluation the stock was owned as follows 
for the fiscal year ending august,simplot had net sales of and net income of.the equity value of the company,as found by the tax court,was million,so that the return to stockholders in was slightly over.
at the time of valuation,simplot,the company founder,was the chairman of the board and the dominant person in setting company policy.his three surviving children were also directors of the company,and there were four directors from outside the family circle.
the estate obtained a valuation of its stock from morgan stanley,and on this basis reported the class a and class b shares as worth per share.the commissioner of internal revenue valued the class a stock at per share and the class b stock at per share.he accordingly assessed a deficiency of with penalties of.
the estate petitioned the tax court for review.before the tax court the commissioner conceded that the assessed deficiency was erroneous,thereby forfeiting any presumption of correctness.clapp commissioner,cir herbert commissioner,cir.the commissioner offered two experts in valuation,herbert spiro and gilbert matthews,each of whom placed a premium on voting stock because of the skewed relation of the number of voting shares to the number of nonvoting shares.the estate offered two other valuation experts,paul much and john ettelson,who testified that the estate minority interest in the class a stock could not extract economic benefits for the shareholder.the tax court accepted the valuations proposed by none of the experts,but did accept the view of the commissioner experts that a premium should be added to the value of the class a shares.
the tax court found the class a shares on a per share basis to be far more valuable than the class b shares because of the former inherent potential for influence and control.the tax court added that a hypothetical buyer of the shares would gain access to the inner circle of simplot,and by having a seat at the class a shareholder table,over time,the hypothetical buyer potentially could position itself to play a role in the company.in this regard,we are mindful that a journey of a miles begins with a single step.
the tax court went on to consider the characteristics of the hypothetical buyer and supposed the buyer could be a simplot,a competitor,a customer,a supplier,or an investor.the buyer would probably be,with a investment horizon and no expectations of benefits.the hypothetical buyer might be primarily interested in only one of simplot two distinct business food and chemicals be a part of a joint venture that is,one venture being interested in acquiring the food division and the other being interested in acquiring the chemical division.the tax court entertained the possibility that simplot could be made more profitable by being better managed at the behest of an outsider who bought the shares.the tax court went on to envisage the day when the hypothetical buyer of the shares would hold the largest block because the three other simplot children had died and their shares had been divided among their descendants the tax court noted that,even earlier,if combined with don and gay shares together,or with scott shares alone,the shares would give control.
in the light of all of these factors,the tax court assigned a premium to the class a stock over the class b stock equal to of the equity value of the company,or million.dividing this premium by the number of class a shares gave each class a share an individual premium of,for a total value of,subject to a discount for lack of marketability with a resultant value of.class b stock was valued at per share.the tax court held no penalties should be exacted because the estate in good faith had relied on the advice of its adviser,morgan stanley.
the tax court determined a deficiency in federal estate tax of.the estate appeals.
the estate tax is levied not on the property transferred but on the transfer itself.young men christian ass davis.the tax is on the act of the testator not on the receipt of the property by the legatees.ithaca trust united states.consequently we look at the value of the property in the decedent hands at the time of its transfer by death,or at the alternative valuation date provided by the statute,a.that the tax falls as an excise on the exercise of transfer underlines the point that the value of the transfer is established at that moment it is not the potential of the property to be realized at a later date.
the tax court in its opinion accurately stated the law the standard is objective,using a purely hypothetical willing buyer and willing seller the hypothetical persons are not specific individuals or entities.the commissioner himself in his brief concedes that it is improper to assume that the buyer would be an outsider.the tax court,however,departed from this standard apparently because it believed that the hypothetical sale should not be constructed in a vacuum isolated from the actual facts that affect value.obviously the facts that determine value must be considered.
the facts supplied by the tax court were imaginary scenarios as to who a purchaser might be,how long the purchaser would be willing to wait without any return on his investment,and what combinations the purchaser might be able to effect with simplot children or grandchildren and what improvements in management of a highly successful company an outsider purchaser might suggest.all of these factors,all of these imagined facts,are what the tax court based its premium upon.in violation of the law the tax court constructed particular possible purchasers.
the tax court erred further by finding what premium all the class a shares as a block would command and then dividing this premium per each class a share.doing so,the tax court valued an asset not before the class a stock representing complete control.there was no basis for supposing that whatever value attached to complete control a proportionate share of that value attached to each fraction of the whole.under the applicable regulations,the fair market value of each unit of property is to be ascertained in the case of shares of stock,such unit of property is generally a share of stock.b.
the tax court committed a third error of law.even a controlling block of stock is not to be valued at a premium for estate tax purposes,unless the commissioner can show that a purchaser would be able to use the control in such a way to assure an increased economic advantage worth paying a premium for.ahmanson foundation united states,cir.here,on liquidation,all class b shareholders would fare better than class a shareholders any premium paid for the class a shares be lost.class a and b had the right to the same dividends.what economic benefits attended shares of class a stock no seat at the table was assured by this minority interest it could not elect a director.the commissioner points out that class a shareholders had formed businesses that did business with simplot.if these businesses enjoyed special advantages,the class a shareholders would have been liable for breach of their fiduciary duty to the class b shareholders.see est
