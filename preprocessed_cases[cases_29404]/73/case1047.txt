stanley johnson was formerly married to joyce johnson joyce.joyce was issued a decree of divorce on may.johnson was required to pay alimony to joyce in amounts ranging from per month at the outset to per month.on march,johnson filed a motion to modify the terms of the divorce and terminate alimony payments in the family division of the clark county nevada district court.joyce responded by filing a countermotion to increase alimony payments.on april,the district court released its findings of fact and conclusions of law.johnson then filed a notice of appeal to the supreme court of the state of nevada and was granted his application for stay re increase in alimony.
prior to oral argument in the supreme court of nevada,johnson and joyce entered into a settlement and release agreement the agreement.it provided that joyce would dismiss with prejudice her counterclaim to increase alimony payments,the nevada district court would not retain jurisdiction over any further claims in the case and johnson would pay in one no later than thursday,july.the agreement specified that the payment shall be stanley final alimony payment to joyce and constitute total and complete liquidation and discharge of all debts stanley owes to joyce.the agreement makes no reference to.on july,after johnson made the payment pursuant to the agreement,joyce countermotion was dismissed with prejudice by the family division of the district court for clark county,nevada.the dismissal order also stated that johnson had discharged any and all obligations to pay joyce alimony by the terms of the agreement.
on their tax return for the tax year,appellants claimed a deduction for their alimony payments from their income in the amount of.the commissioner disallowed of that deduction,and issued a notice of deficiency determination.appellants filed a petition in the tax court seeking a redetermination of the deficiency.in response to the parties for summary judgment,the tax court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the appellee the tax court determined that new section is applicable only to divorce instruments executed after december,or modified after december,where the modified instrument states that the amended version of section will apply.johnson commissioner,slip.op.at quoting marten commissioner,cch,aff sub nom.commissioner lane.cir.the tax court found the agreement,taken together with the stipulation and dismissal order,constituted a modification of the divorce decree.id.accordingly,the tax court held that the law applicable to divorce instruments executed before december,applies to the instant case.id.in its final tax court held that there is a deficiency in tax due from appellants in the amount of.the tax court conclusions of law,including construction of the tax code,are reviewed de novo.frontier chevrolet commissioner,cir.
payments are deductible as alimony pursuant to a.the term alimony is defined under.the pertinent part of b provides 
in general.the term alimony or separate maintenance payment means any payment in cash if 
a such payment is received by or on behalf of a spouse under a divorce or separation instrument,
b the divorce or separation instrument does not designate such payment as a payment which is not includible in gross income under this section and not allowable as a deduction under section.
c in the case of an individual legally separated from his spouse under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance,the payee spouse and the payor spouse are not members of the same household at the time such payment is made,and 
d there is no liability to make any such payment for any period after the death of the payee spouse and there is no liability to make any payment in cash or property as a substitute for such payments after the death of the payee spouse.
section was amended by congress in as part of the deficit reduction act defra.the old provides that payments are only deductible if they are made periodically.of a current version at however,the language requiring that payments be periodic in order to be deductible is absent in new.accordingly,if the old law applies,the payment to joyce is not deductible.it would be deductible under the new law.
appellants argue that the new applies because the agreement is a divorce or separation instrument according to b a.pursuant to b,the term divorce or separation instruments is defined as 
a a decree of divorce or separate maintenance or a written instrument incident to such a decree,
b a written separation agreement,or 
c a decree not described in subparagraph a requiring a spouse to make payments for the support or maintenance of the other spouse.
however,appellants argument is not persuasive because the most important question before the court is not whether the agreement,standing alone,satisfies the requirements of the new law.rather,the court must determine whether the agreement is merely a modification of the divorce decree,or a separate stand alone instrument of divorce.
this case turns on the relationship between,and e of defra.section e of defra defines the date on which the new law became effective,and provides guidance as to whether the new law applies to instruments of divorce created prior to the effective date of the legislation.it provides inter alia 
in general.except as otherwise provided in this subsection,the amendments made by this section amending,and shall apply with respect to divorce or separation instruments as defined in section b of the internal revenue code of,as amended by this section executed after december.
modifications of instruments executed before january.the amendments made by this section shall also apply to any divorce or separation instrument as so defined executed before january,but modified on or after such date if the modification expressly provides that the amendments made by this section shall apply to such modification.
defra,e,stat,emphasis added.
relying on the language of e,the commissioner argues that the tax court was correct in determining that the old law applies.the parties agree that new would apply by its own terms if the agreement is construed to be a new written instrument incident to a divorce,and not a further modification of the original decree,because the rule expressed in e of defra would then govern.if,however,the agreement is merely a modification of the divorce decree,as the commissioner contends,the old law governs.defra,e,stat.at.
appellants maintain the first paragraph of defra,e is independent of the second paragraph.they argue that the first paragraph of the statute controls this case and it is unnecessary to look at the second paragraph.however,appellants argument is not persuasive because the first part of the statute begins with the phrase except as otherwise provided in this subsection.defra,e,stat.at.this language indicates that the first and second paragraph of the statute should be read together.
appellants also contend any instrument,including the agreement,that materially alters the timing or amount of alimony payments is a new instrument of divorce and not therefore subject to the second paragraph of defra e.they cite treasury regulation to support that contention.this court will normally defer to an agency construction of a statute it administers provided that its interpretation is not contrary to congressional intent.miller commissioner,cir quoting seifert,cir.the tax court was correct in determining that the cited regulation is inapposite pursuant to tax decision,which states
