a nonresident landowner challenged a parcel tax imposed by a city after the city registered voters approved the tax by a majority.the superior court sustained the city general demurrer to the landowner complaint,which alleged the parcel tax violated limitations on the taxation of real property contained in the california constitution and violated the constitutional guarantee of equal protection.
the issues raised on appeal are whether taxes based on the mere ownership of real property are constitutionally required to be ad valorem taxes whether the parcel tax is a general tax and thus unconstitutional or,alternatively,is a special tax and therefore valid whether california law concerning voter eligibility requires that nonresident landowners affected by the tax be given the right to vote on the taxing measure and whether the equal protection clause prevents the city from using a residency requirement to determine who may vote on the tax when nonresident landowners are the largest source of revenue under the tax.
we hold that,as presently written,the california constitution does not prohibit a tax on the mere ownership of real property if the tax is a special tax and not an ad valorem tax.in this case,the parcel tax was assessed on the mere ownership of real property,was not an ad valorem tax,and was a valid special tax because it was approved by of the relevant electorate and its revenues were dedicated to specific governmental purposes.furthermore,california law governing the qualification of voters establishes that the relevant electorate for the municipal election that approved the parcel tax was the registered voters of the municipality.we also hold,under the rational basis test,that the equal protection clause does not require that nonresident landowners be given the right to vote on the taxing measure.therefore,judgment is affirmed.
facts and proceedings 
in march,the city council of the city of california city council passed resolution,which called a municipal election for june,and directed that voters be presented with a measure for a special tax of up to per lot or parcel for each of the next three fiscal years.the municipal election was consolidated with other elections scheduled for that date.
at the june special election,the proposed parcel tax was presented to the voters of the city of california city city as measure l.the impartial analysis of measure l by the city attorney,which was set forth in the sample ballot and voter information pamphlet,stated 
if this measure is approved by of the voters,the city will be able to levy a special tax for three years commencing july.the maximum amount of tax the city can levy is per lot or parcel per year.the city will use proceeds of the special tax to pay for police,fire and recreational services,and to repair streets,parks,water line replacement and repair,and building maintenance.
the argument in favor of measure l was presented by the mayor,vice mayor,and council members,and stated 
save our services there is no city anywhere with a greater need to renew a special tax.we have over subdivided lots in the city,and approximately registered voters.this means that every voter who votes for the special tax carries over times the taxing power to benefit the city,because every one of those property owners supports the city with their special tax payments.while some absentee owners object to the tax,the vast majority of them understand that it holds up property values and therefore their investment.
what we pay now for special tax is our personal investment in our city public safety services,parks and recreation,street repair and maintenance,and this time,funding for emergency repairs of water main breaks that cost the city hundreds of thousands of dollars every year.the only practical way to pay for the infrastructure needs of our city is a special tax.passage of measure is a renewal of our previous special tax for three years,not a new tax on top of old.
the most important reason for a california city special tax is that it is the only one we do not share with county,state or federal agencies.vote yes on measure.save our services.
of the registered voters in city,approximately percent voted.measure l passed by a vote of percent to percent,which exceeded a majority requirement.
on july,council passed resolution levying the special tax that the voters had approved.that resolution stated in part 
special tax levy.
a special tax in the amount of per lot or parcel is levied for the fiscal year commencing july.the city clerk is authorized and directed to transmit a certified copy of this resolution to the kern county tax collector and the kern county with a request for the tax to be levied and collect sic on the property tax rolls.
special tax expenditures.
a the proceeds of the special tax levy shall be deposited into a special tax fund to be spent,as nearly as practicable,as follows 
b on or before august,the city council shall reconcile expenditures of special tax proceeds.future expenditures within a category will be increased if the expenditure for the fiscal year is less than the above amounts.future expenditures within a category will be reduced if the expenditure for the fiscal year exceeds the above amount.unexpended surplus amounts shall be reserved for future expenditure within the category with the surplus.the annual reconciliation will be reported.
compliance.
the city council certifies this tax complies with california constitution,article xiii 
within three weeks of the passage of the foregoing resolution by council,plaintiff filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief to invalidate the parcel tax.the complaint alleged,as relevant here,that the tax violated section of article xiii a of the california constitution the tax was not a special tax for purposes of section of article xiii a,the tax violated the equal protection clause by making absentee landowners subsidize local residents,and the tax amounted to taxation without representation because the vast majority percent of those paying the tax were absentee landowners who could not vote on the tax.
city filed a demurrer,and the hearing was scheduled for september.prior to the hearing,plaintiff submitted a first amended complaint,but the superior court did not receive a copy until the beginning of the hearing.the superior court sustained the demurrer to the original complaint,stated it would treat the first amended complaint as plaintiff attempt to correct the failure to state a claim,set the matter for a further hearing on october,and told plaintiff that if he wanted to file further papers he should do so by october.plaintiff filed a second amended complaint on october.
shortly thereafter,city filed a supplemental demurrer to the first and second amended complaints based on the ground that the plaintiff failed to allege facts sufficient to demonstrate that the parcel tax was unlawful.city argued that the parcel tax was a special tax dedicated to specific purposes and,as a legal matter,the fact that the tax wa s dedicated to multiple special purposes does not in any way diminish its character as a special tax.
in opposition to the supplemental demurrer,plaintiff argued,among other things,that there must be some limit on when a series of stacked specific purposes crosses the line into general governmental services and,thus,the tax involved is a general tax rather than a special tax.plaintiff further argued that the determination of when that line was crossed required a trial on the merits.finally,at oral argument on the supplemental demurrer,plaintiff suggested that the trial court grant him summary judgment,and concluded everything we wanted in the record is in there so everything we want to take up is in there.
the superior court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and,on december,signed and filed a judgment in favor of city.
on appeal,the league of california cities,joined by the california state association of counties,have filed an amici curiae brief in support of the position of respondent city,and aaron katz has filed an amicus curiae brief in support of plaintiff position

ii.background on propositions,and 
the parties have cited various provisions of propositions,and,which one writer has characterized as parts of a taxpayer revolt.comment,is nothing certain but death the uncertainty created by california proposition,comment.we begin with a brief overview of those propositions.
proposition 
california voters approved proposition in,and its provisions,incorporated into article xiii a,limit ad valorem property taxes to percent of a property assessed value,limit increases in assessed value to percent per year unless ownership of the property has changed,and require voter approval of any special tax.art.xiii a,subds.a b.
the constraints of proposition caused local governments to look to new means of generating revenue.one local government imposed a payroll and gross receipts tax and used the proceeds for general revenue purposes.city and county of san francisco farrell cal d.the california supreme court held this type of tax was a general tax and not a special tax because the proceeds were placed in the general fund to be used for general governmental purposes.id.at.consequently,the tax was not subject to the vote requirement section of article xiii a imposed on special taxes.
proposition 
in,california voters approved proposition,which added sections through to the government code.the manifest purpose of proposition as a whole was to increase the control of the citizenry over local taxation by requiring voter approval of all new local taxes imposed by all local governmental entities the measure defines broadly and inclusively both the taxes and the entities to which it applies.santa clara county local transportation authority guardino cal th,d.
the voter approval requirements are set forth in government code sections and.section provides that a local government or district may not impose any special tax unless and until such special tax is submitted to the electorate of the local government,or district and approved by a vote of the voters voting in an election on the issue.italics added.section provides that n o local government,or district,whether or not authorized to levy a property tax,may impose any general tax unless and until such general tax is submitted to the electorate of the local government,or district and approved by a majority vote of the voters voting in an election on the issue.italics added.
proposition 
after proposition,local government resorted to the use of fees and assessments,which did not require voter approval,to fill the void.the increase in assessments and fees imposed by local governments led california voters,in november,to approve proposition,which was designed to provide voters with control over taxes regardless of whether they were called assessments,fees,or charges.comment,supra.at.
the fourth appellate district described the adoption of proposition as follows 
proposition allows only four types of local property taxes an ad valorem property tax a special tax an assessment and a fee or charge.a.xiii d,subd.a see also id,subd.a.it buttresses proposition limitations on ad valorem property taxes and special taxes by placing analogous restrictions on assessments,fees,and charges.howard jarvis taxpayers city of riverside th,d.
sections and of proposition amended the california constitution by adding article xiii c,which concerns voter approval of local tax levies,and article xiii d,which limits the ability of local governments to impose assessments,fees,and charges.for example,article xiii d prohibits fees or charges for general governmental services.art.xiii d,subd.b.
proposition is significant in this appeal because of its definitions and because,like proposition,it includes a provision requiring that special taxes receive approval.no local government may impose,extend,or increase any special tax unless and until that tax is submitted to the electorate and approved by a vote.art.xiii c,subd.d.
iii.valorem real property taxes are constitutional 
in his opening brief,plaintiff asks this court to settle a question of law concerning the meaning of a particular phrase in section of article xiii a.that section provides in full 
cities,counties and special districts,by a vote of the qualified electors of such district,may impose special taxes on such district,except ad valorem taxes on real property or a transaction tax or sales tax on the sale of real property within such city,county or special district.art.xiii a,italics added.
plaintiff contends that the california constitution requires that taxes based on the mere ownership of real property must be ad valorem taxes,and section of article xiii a can not be read to mean local governments are granted the authority to adopt valorem taxes,whether general or special,on the mere ownership of real property 
another constitutional provision relevant to plaintiff argument,however,is the limitation on property taxes,assessments,fees and charges set forth in proposition 
a no tax,assessment,fee,or charge shall be assessed by any agency upon any parcel of property or upon any person as an incident of property ownership except 
the ad valorem property tax imposed pursuant to article xiii and article xiii 
any special tax receiving a vote pursuant to section of article xiii 
assessments as provided by this article.
fees or charges for property related services as provided by this article.art.xiii d.
the use of the phrase a ny special tax and the language in article xiii d,section,subdivision a that introduces the enumerated exceptions clearly establish that a special tax receiving a vote may be imposed upon any parcel of property or upon any person as an incident of property ownership.therefore,to harmonize the constitutional provisions we must reject plaintiff interpretation of section of article xiii instead,we conclude that a valorem tax may be imposed upon real property if the tax is a special tax dedicated to specific purposes and approved by a vote of the qualified electors of the city,county,or special district imposing the tax.art.xiii a.
iv.plaintiff allegations,accepted as true,fail to demonstrate that the parcel tax is not a valid special tax 
city does not dispute that a parcel tax is unconstitutional if it is a general tax.see city of oakland digre d.general parcel tax was invalid under art.xiii,thomas city of east palo alto th,d general parcel tax was a property tax and not an excise tax question whether it was a special tax not reached because voter approval not obtained.city contends,however,that the superior court correctly sustained the demurrer because the record conclusively establishes that its parcel tax is not a general,but a special tax.
definitions of general tax and special tax 
pursuant to article xiii c,section,subdivisions a and d,added by proposition in,the term general tax means any tax imposed for general governmental purposes,and a special tax is any tax imposed for specific purposes,including a tax imposed for specific purposes,which is placed into a general fund.to prevent the creation of a new category of local taxes,proposition also provided that a ll taxes imposed by any local government shall be deemed to be either general taxes or special taxes.art.xiii c,subd.a.accordingly,the two types of taxes are distinguished by the purposes for which they were imposed,not the activity or rights on which they are imposed 
in howard jarvis taxpayers city of roseville th,d,the appellate court addressed the dividing line between general and special taxes created by the use of the term specific purposes in the definition of the latter 
pursuant to these definitions,a tax is special whenever expenditure of its revenues is limited to specific purposes this is true even though there may be multiple specific purposes for which revenues may be spent.citation.a tax is general only when its revenues are placed into the general fund and are available for expenditure for any and all governmental purposes.citation.id.at,d.
the roseville court then determined that a utility user tax,which generated revenues solely for police,fire,parks and recreation,and library services,was a special tax because it was imposed for specific purposes.howard jarvis taxpayers city of roseville,supra,th at,d.this was true even though those purposes accounted for approximately percent of the city general fund expenditures.id.at,d.because the utility user tax had received only a majority approval and not voter approval,the court held it was invalid.id.at,d.in reaching its holding,the court emphasized its view that the city had gained an advantage with the voters by announcing the revenues generated would be limited to specific purposes.ibid.
plaintiff allegation that the parcel tax is a sham 
plaintiff alleged and continues to argue that the parcel tax is a sham,designed to avoid proposition limit on ad valorem property taxes.he approaches this assertion in two ways.
first,plaintiff argues that the parcel tax is a general tax because the purposes for which its levies can be safety services,parks and recreation,street repair and maintenance,and water,by their nature,general governmental purposes for city.this construction of general is not convincing because it does not fit well with the dividing line created by the constitutional definitions,which looks to the question whether the purposes for which the tax can be used have been specified or not.the specification of purposes is important because it is the means for providing voters with control over the use of tax revenues.howard jarvis taxpayers city of roseville,supra,th at,d.when purposes are not specified,then the local government has the discretion to determine how the funds will be spent.in addition to the obstacles raised by the constitutional definitions,plaintiff has not adequately distinguished the list of purposes for which city parcel tax could be used from the list of purposes for the special tax in roseville.id.at,d.consequently,case law supports the proposition that police,fire,and parks and recreation services can be specific purposes when specified to voters,and they are not necessarily general governmental purposes.art.xiii c,subds.a d.plaintiff has cited no authority that contradicts the holding in roseville or supports his view that certain governmental expenditures,like salaries for local police,are by their nature for general governmental purposes.plaintiff may have confused general governmental purposes with general governmental services,which is a term used in article xiii d,section,subdivision b.that provision applies not to taxes,either general or special,but instead to fees or charges.plaintiff does not assert that the parcel tax is a fee or charge 
second,in opposing the demurrer,plaintiff supported his contention that the parcel tax is a sham special tax,and really a general tax,by arguing that there must be some limit on the specific purposes that can be stacked together before the line is crossed and the revenues are used for general governmental services.again,however,plaintiff fails to provide supporting authority.further,plaintiff ignores the opinion in roseville,a case in which the designated purposes of the special tax were so numerous as to account for some percent of the city general fund budget.howard jarvis taxpayers city of roseville,supra,th at,d.finally,we note that the use of the plural specific purposes in the definition of special tax shows that the enactors contemplated that a special tax could be used for more than one purpose without losing its status as a special tax.see generally silvio ford motor th,d use of plural in statutory requirement.
plaintiff does not suggest a means for determining at what point a special tax becomes a general tax because of the number of purposes for which its revenues may be used.though we can conceive of a special tax that permits expenditures for so many specific governmental purposes that the parts might swallow the whole,plaintiff has not pled sufficient facts to show that the parcel tax here is such a tax.neither does plaintiff suggest how he might cure this defect were he allowed yet another chance to plead.
plaintiff mere unsupported assertion that this tax is a a special but a general not sufficient to overcome city demurrer aubry hospital,supra,cal th at,d,and he suggests no way in which he could improve his pleading.we therefore need not decide whether a local electorate may,by a majority,approve as a special tax that which,in effect,allows expenditures beyond those provided for by ad valorem property taxes for all or virtually all governmental purposes.it is enough here to note that plaintiff has failed to plead sufficient facts to show that city parcel tax is not a valid special tax and has failed to show a reasonable possibility that the pleading deficiency can be cured by amendment.see blank kirwan,supra,cal d at.
v.who are the qualified electors 
section of article xiii a states cities,counties and special districts,by a vote of the qualified electors of such district,may impose special taxes on such district italics added.
plaintiff contends that the affected property owners,not the registered voters of city,were the qualified electors for purposes of section of article xiii by submitting the parcel tax to city registered voters,plaintiff claims,city disenfranchised percent of the property owners.
after article xiii a was added to the california constitution by the adoption of proposition,the idea that a special tax must obtain approval also was addressed in propositions and.
proposition enacted government code section,which provides no local government or district may impose any special tax unless and until such special tax is submitted to the electorate of the local government,or district and approved by a vote of the voters voting in an election on the issue.italics added.
similarly,proposition provides that n o local government may impose,extend,or increase any special tax unless and until that tax is submitted to the electorate and approved by a vote.art.xiii c,subd.d,italics added.
city contends that section of article xiii a should be harmonized with section of article xiii c and that various definitions in place at the time proposition was adopted lead to the conclusion that city resident voters are the relevant electorate 
the elections code defines elector to mean any person who is a united states citizen years of age or older and a resident of an election precinct at least days prior to an election.the elections code does not contain a formal definition of the word qualified,but it does contain variations of that word that are useful in determining its meaning.for example,division of the elections code is titled voters and it contains chapters titled voter qualifications ch,beginning with and registration ch,beginning with.pursuant to section of the elections code,e very person who qualifies under section of article ii of the california constitution and who complies with this code governing the registration of electors may vote at any election held within the territory within which he or she resides and the election is held.italics added.article ii,section provides that a united states citizen years of age and resident in this state may vote.also,elections code section provides that voter means any elector who is registered under this code.
based on the foregoing provisions,we conclude the phrase qualified electors of such district art.xiii a,means the registered voters of city who voted in the election.first,the prepositional phrase of such district means city because the tax is imposed by city on all parcels within its geographical limits.second,the term qualified electors means registered voters.third,vote means or more of the votes cast in the election at issue.thus,by combining these terms,section of article xiii a required the special tax to be approved by of city registered voters who voted in the election concerning measure 
we reject plaintiff different construction because the voting eligibility requirements that he proposes are set forth in article xiii d in regards to special assessments.we apply a fundamental rule of construction where a statute,with reference to one subject contains a given provision,the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject is significant to show that a different intention existed.city of port hueneme city of oxnard cal d,see also thompson department of corrections,supra,cal th at,d,principles of constitutional interpretation are similar to those of statutory construction.
vi.equal protection 
plaintiff argues the scheme by which voter approval was obtained for measure l violated equal protection because city did not enfranchise nonresident property owners with the right to vote on the measure.
our analysis of such a discrimination claim starts with the basic principle of one person,one vote that the united states supreme court has derived from the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution reynolds sims,d legislative apportionment system that gave districts with percent of population a majority of representatives in both houses violated equal protection requirement that votes be given equal weight.the one person,one vote doctrine addresses the dilution of one vote in comparison to the vote of another and the denial of a person right to vote through eligibility criteria that selectively distribute the franchise.see cole,special assessment law under california proposition and the,challenge mcgeorge.plaintiff claim involves the latter category.
a very useful introduction and summary of the law regarding equal protection and the right to vote was published by division four of the first appellate district in hoffman state bar of california th,d.that discussion will not be repeated here except for its description of restricting the right to vote to residents,which is at the heart of plaintiff equal protection challenge 
d residency restrictions bona fide residency is another acceptable restriction on the franchise.simply put,states may require voters to be bona fide residents of the relevant political subdivision.citations.as one commentator has explained i n deciding who may and who may not vote in its elections,a community takes a crucial step in defining its identity.tribe,american constitutional law ed.rights of political participation.t he rule that a state or municipality may restrict the franchise to its bona fide residents recognizes that nonresidents may be affected by and interested in what a state or municipality does,but nonetheless accepts territory as the best available means of drawing a boundary for purposes of the franchise,fn.omitted.hoffman state bar of california,supra,at,d.
the united states supreme court has considered an equal protection claim brought against a city by nonresidents who were not allowed to vote in its elections.holt civic club city of tuscaloosa,d holt.people residing in holt,a small,unincorporated community on the outskirts of the city of tuscaloosa,challenged an alabama statute that subjected holt residents to the city police and sanitation regulations,to the criminal jurisdiction of the city courts,and to the city power to license businesses,trades,and professions,but did not give them the right to participate in the political processes of the city by voting in its elections.id.at.the united states supreme court denied the equal protection challenge and stated 
from our earlier voting qualifications cases a common characteristic emerges the challenged statute in each case denied the franchise to individuals who were physically resident within the geographic boundaries of the governmental entity concerned.citations.no decision of this court has extended the one man,one vote principle to individuals residing beyond the geographic confines of the governmental entity concerned,be it the state or its political subdivisions.on the contrary,our cases have uniformly recognized that a government unit may legitimately restrict the right to participate in its political processes to those who reside within its borders.citations.holt,supra,at.
plaintiff and amicus curiae katz contend that city must show a compelling state interest to justify its failure to include nonresident landowners among the voters allowed to vote on measure see curtis board of supervisors cal d,statute that allowed nonresident landowners to prevent residents from voting on proposed incorporation of area into a city struck down because it lacked a compelling state interest.among other things,they contend this level of strict scrutiny is required because the measure primarily affected nonresident landowners.
based on existing case law,we reject the strict scrutiny test in favor of applying the rational basis test to the facts pled in this case.strict scrutiny is used to protect the right to vote of those who are otherwise qualified to vote.someone otherwise qualified to vote could be characterized as having a fundamental interest in the right to vote,which may not be infringed absent a compelling state interest.but strict scrutiny is not used to create a right to vote in nonresidents who are not otherwise qualified.
for instance,in kramer union free school dist,d,the united states supreme court stated that if a challenged state statute grants the right to vote to some bona fide residents of requisite age and citizenship and denies the franchise to others,the court must determine whether the exclusions are necessary to promote a compelling state interest.
similarly,a louisiana law that stated only property taxpayers could vote in elections to approve the issuance of revenue bonds by a municipal utility system was declared unconstitutional.cipriano city of houma,d.the united states supreme court held that the exclusion of otherwise qualified voters who were substantially affected and directly interested in the election issue must be reviewed under strict scrutiny.
in city of phoenix kolodziejski,d,the united states supreme court ruled that restricting the franchise to real pr
