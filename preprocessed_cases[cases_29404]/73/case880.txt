james francis murphy appeals the district court judgment convicting him of interfering with the administration of the tax laws,presenting fictitious financial instruments,and presenting false claims to the united states and sentencing him principally to four years imprisonment.for the following reasons,we vacate the fictitious financial instrument convictions,affirm the remaining convictions,and remand.
murphy interactions with the irs 
in,murphy,an osteopath,began diverting income from his medical practice to a trust.the result was a drastic reduction in income reported on his personal income tax returns.murphy adjusted gross income went from approximately in to in,in and less than in.he did not file a personal return at all in or.the trust,meanwhile,reported income of between and million,but virtually all of it was offset by claimed deductions.
the irs opened an audit of murphy and his trust in.though initially cooperative,murphy eventually stopped communicating with the irs examiner,who referred the case for collection.
in february,murphy contacted the irs in an attempt to settle his tax liability.as payment,he offered four bonded promissory notes.collectively,the notes purported to satisfy murphy tax liability for and his trust tax liability for.murphy was the maker of the notes,each of which was payable to the order of the secretary of the treasury and the irs examiner for credit to the department of the treasury and the irs.each note was secured by a private discharging and indemnity bond and private offset bond in the possession of secretary of the treasury henry paulson,holder in due course.
with the notes,murphy sent to the irs a copy of a certified deposit order directing secretary paulson to settle all obligations with the irs by means of an authorized setoff from prepaid exemption account.murphy payment was prefaced by the following explanation 
i am sending you payment in the form of a bonded promissory note along with accepting for value each of the most recent offers to expand funds under public policy you have sent.the secretary of treasury has been instructed via certified deposit order to deposit the accepted for value offers to expand funds under public policy.please forward payment immediately to the secretary of treasury,henry paulson,for settlement and closure as per terms listed on each bonded promissory notes.
the irs collection efforts continued.in response to the agency attempt to levy his personal assets,murphy submitted personal returns for.the returns for and were blank.those for claimed overpayments of approximately,and,respectively each of those returns lists the full amount of the reported overpayment as the a mount you want refunded to you and provides routing and account numbers for that purpose.no money was refunded to murphy.
murphy continued to correspond with the irs over the remainder of.none of the correspondence included any legitimate form of payment.
murphy conviction 
meanwhile,in february,murphy attempted to bypass security at san diego international airport by presenting fraudulent diplomatic papers.he was arrested and charged with making false statements to federal officers and related crimes.he proceeded to trial,waiving his right to a jury,and testified in his own defense.district judge thomas whelan found murphy guilty and sentenced him to time served and three years supervised release.
c.the present proceedings 
in june,murphy was charged with one count of interfering with the administration of the tax laws,in violation of a four counts of presenting fictitious financial instruments,in violation of and three counts of presenting false claims to the united states,in violation of.the a count was premised on a series of nine discrete acts occurring between september and the date of the indictment.the counts charged murphy with presenting fictitious documents purporting to be an actual security or financial instrument issued under the authority of the united states each count concerned one of the bonded promissory notes submitted to the irs in february.the three counts corresponded to murphy personal tax returns for.
murphy moved,inter alia,to dismiss the a count as duplicitous.the district court denied both branches of the motion.
the case proceeded to trial.murphy offered character witnesses to attest to his honesty and also testified in his own defense.evidence of murphy conviction for making false statements to federal officers was introduced during of one of the character witnesses and again during of murphy.
murphy moved for a judgment of acquittal,which was denied.the district court then instructed the jury.as pertinent here,murphy raised no objections to the instructions given.
the instructions on the a count informed the jury that it must agree that the defendant committed at least one of the nine acts listed in the indictment and must agree on which listed act he or she committed.although the instructions did not make reference to the dates of the various acts,the verdict form asked the jury to state whether it found that murphy has committed at least one of the act or acts charged after june,with all of us agreeing unanimously as to at least one act after that date.
with respect to the counts,the district court told the jury that the government had to prove,inter alia,that t he defendant passed,uttered or made or possessed a specified security that was false or fictitious.it did not state that the specified security had to purport to be issued under the authority of the united states,or explain what that phrase meant.
finally,the instruction on the counts required the government to prove that murphy knowingly presented a claim to the united states that was false,fictitious or fraudulent as to a material fact.although the instruction emphasized that the claim had to be against the united states,it did not inform the jury that an attempt to reduce tax liability would not constitute a claim.
during summation,defense counsel argued that murphy had a belief in the legality of his conduct.in rebuttal,the government asked the jury to consider murphy credibility.in that regard,the prosecution offered the following 
defense counsel said no one would call murphy a liar.no one would call him deceitful.
but you have now heard the evidence in this case,and you know that that is just plain wrong.that murphy sat in that same witness chair in another courtroom in this building and testified at his prior trial about his beliefs,about being a diplomat and an ambassador and why he was at the airport.and you have heard the evidence that he was convicted.he may have had those beliefs,but at the end of the day he was found guilty of making a false statement to a federal officer 
now,as you heard in that other trial,there was no jury.it was just a judge.that was the person who had to decide whether to believe murphy,whether to find him guilty.but in this trial you are that judge and you are the ones who get to make that decision.
defense counsel did not make a contemporaneous objection,but moved for a mistrial after summations had concluded.he characterized the prosecution rebuttal as implying that judge whelan had explicitly found murphy not credible,and us ing judge whelan,or a federal district court judge,as vouching for their case.
the district court denied the motion,but gave the jury the following curative instruction 
for legal reasons that need not concern you,no evidence there is no evidence that the judge in the case made an adverse credibility finding,and that would not necessarily have been a part of the prior conviction under the circumstances of that case.
a few hours later,the jury found murphy guilty on all counts.with respect to the a count,it unanimously found that murphy had committed at least one act of interference within six years of the indictment.
murphy subsequently made various motions.he renewed his motions for dismissal of the a count,for a judgment of acquittal,and for a mistrial.in addition,he moved for a new trial based on claimed inadequacies in the district court instructions on the and counts.the district court denied all motions and sentenced murphy principally to fou
