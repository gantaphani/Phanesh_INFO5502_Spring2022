this appeal follows the grant of a special motion to strike the plaintiffs complaint as a strategic lawsuit against public participation.the complaint alleged improper government expenditures for communications concerning a local initiative election.reviewing the matter de novo,we conclude that the defense motion was properly granted.we therefore affirm.
background 
the dispute in this case grew out of a local initiative called measure o,which qualified for the november ballot in the city of salinas.on one side of the dispute are plaintiffs and appellants,angelina morfin vargas and mark dierolf,proponents of measure on the other side of the controversy are defendants and respondents,the city of salinas and its manager dave mora.
had measure o passed,it would have repealed the city utilities users tax uut.that tax provides the city with approximately million in annual revenue,representing about percent of the city general fund budget.
in response to the qualification of measure o for the november ballot,city staff prepared a series of reports analyzing the effect of the loss of utility tax revenue and recommending the reduction or elimination of services and programs.starting in november,over the course of several public hearings,the city manager and the city department heads presented fiscal impact reports to the city council.the departments presentations,which were made in august,took the form of slide presentations.the presentations embodied staff recommendations for service cuts,some in dire terms.in july,the city council adopted the departments recommendations as presented,thereby identifying the service cuts that would be implemented in the event of measure o passage.
the staff reports,analyses,and presentations concerning measure o were placed on the city website.as a matter of course,the website also includes minutes of city council meetings the minutes of the meetings at which these reports were presented and discussed thus were posted on the website.the city also informed the electorate of its analysis of measure o through articles in the fall edition of the city periodic newsletter to residents,and by means of a summary of the anticipated service cuts,which the parties sometimes refer to as a leaflet or flyer.like the reports and presentations,the flyer was posted on the city website.
plaintiffs disagreed with the city analysis of the consequences of measure o.in plaintiffs view,repeal of the uut would benefit the city residents by reducing their taxes and by eliminating local government waste.they made written and oral presentations to the city council in august.the minutes of those meetings were placed on the city website.
the pleadings 
in october,plaintiffs filed a verified complaint that accused defendants of interference with the electoral process,improper use of public monies for campaign materials intended to influence voters against measure o,and violation of plaintiffs rights to free expression under the state and federal constitutions.plaintiffs sought the recovery of illegally expended public resources,which they believed to be in excess of they also requested declaratory,injunctive,and equitable relief.
concurrently with the filing of their complaint,plaintiffs made an ex parte application for a temporary restraining order.defendants opposed the application.the court denied the application for a temporary restraining order.the court set a hearing on plaintiffs request for a preliminary injunction for november,three days after the scheduled election.at the conclusion of that hearing,the court declined to issue the preliminary injunction sought by plaintiffs.
in may,the court granted defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the second,third,and fourth causes of action of plaintiffs complaint,thereby eliminating their claims for declaratory,injunctive,and equitable relief.in august,this court denied plaintiffs petition for a writ of mandate to overturn that decision.
in december,plaintiffs moved for permission to amend their complaint.in support of their motion,plaintiffs declared that the city had proposed a special tax initiative,measure p,which would be before the electorate in march.they urged the court to presume that the city would continue to improperly campaign concerning measure p as it had with measure defendants opposed the motion,arguing that it was an attempt to reinstate the three causes of action that had already been adjudicated adversely to plaintiffs.
following a hearing in january,the court took the plaintiffs motion under submission.in an order signed in february,the court granted plaintiffs permission to supplement their complaint.
in march,plaintiffs filed a supplemental complaint,which included allegations concerning measure p as well as measure o.as with the original complaint,plaintiffs supplemental pleading sought the recovery of public resources,as well as declaratory,injunctive,and equitable relief.
the defense motion to strike 
in april,defendants filed a special motion to strike plaintiffs complaint as a strategic lawsuit against public participation,pursuant to code of civil procedure section in support of their motion,defendants submitted declarations from the city clerk,city manager,city attorney,and city finance director,and from its computer system manager,whose duties included maintaining the city website.defendants also submitted declarations from other city officials who had made presentations to the city council on the fiscal impact of measure o.in addition,defendants supported their motion with voluminous materials,including copies of the communications challenged by plaintiffs as improper.
plaintiffs opposed the motion.their opposition included a statement of undisputed facts and three supporting declarations.among other things,plaintiffs asserted that the city had ignored offers by measure o proponents to provide material supporting their viewpoint,and that the proponents would have utilized access to the city website and other media had it been offered.
in may,the court heard and granted the motion to strike.plaintiffs promptly moved for reconsideration.defendants opposed the motion.
in june,the court conducted a hearing on the motion for reconsideration and took the matter under submission.the court subsequently denied the request for reconsideration on the merits.
the appeal 
this appeal by plaintiffs ensued.
both parties filed appellate briefs.in addition,we granted two applications to file amicus briefs.in august,the league of california cities filed a brief as amicus curiae in support of the city of salinas.the following month,californians aware filed a brief in support of plaintiffs,to which the city responded.
in august,we granted defendants request for judicial notice as to the november,agendas of the salinas city council and redevelopment agency.those agendas thus are part of the record on appeal.
contentions 
in their opening brief,plaintiffs identify the following issues on appeal whether defendants use of public funds on its website,newsletter,and leaflet is unlawful whether the illegality of the defendants conduct prohibits them from claiming statutory free speech protections whether defendants communications are exempt from the statutory protections whether defendants made the necessary initial showing in support of their motion and whether plaintiffs made the necessary showing to defeat the motion.notwithstanding that list of issues,the thrust of plaintiffs appellate arguments is that defendants improperly engaged in partisan campaigning intended to influence city voters in favor of measure plaintiffs argue that the style,tenor,and timing of defendants communications make it impermissible advocacy under standard set forth in stanson mott cal d,stanson.amicus californians aware agrees,arguing against a standard for judging whether political speech constitutes advocacy and urging that government speech is not desired or protected in the election process.
for their part,defendants assert that the trial court properly granted their special motion to strike since plaintiffs failed to carry their burden of showing that the city engaged in impermissible express advocacy.in support of defendants position,amicus league of california cities argues for a rule to determine what constitutes advocacy,asserting that such a rule is workable and that it furthers the goal of open government.
discussion 
in light of the procedural context in which this appeal arises,we begin our analysis by setting forth the general principles that govern special motions to strike.we then apply those principles to the case at hand,which brings into play substantive constitutional issues.
general principles 
strategic lawsuits against public participation are commonly referred to by the acronym slapp.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d,equilon.the paradigm action of this type is a meritless suit filed primarily to chill the defendant exercise of first amendment rights.wilcox superior court th,fn,d wilcox,disapproved on another ground in equilon,at,fn,d.see also navellier sletten cal th,d,navellier see generally witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading,id.supp,weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group to,to.
in,the legislature responded to the disturbing increase in such suits by enacting section,subd.a.the statute incorporates the legislature express declaration that it is in the public interest to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance,and that this participation should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process,subd.a.in,the statute was amended to clarify the legislature intent that this section shall be construed broadly.ibid.see equilon,supra,cal th at,d,vogel felice th,d.
more recently,the legislature enacted section,which exempts certain types of actions from the special motion to strike.see varian medical systems,delfino cal th,d,ingels westwood one broadcasting services,th,d.this legislation became effective january.its express legislative purpose is to address a disturbing abuse of the special motion to strike,subd.a see ingels westwood one broadcasting services,at,d see generally,weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial,supra,to,to.while the new statute exempts certain actions from statutory protection under section,it also provides certain exceptions to the exemption.among the exceptions is this any action against any person or entity based upon the creation,dissemination,exhibition,advertisement,or other similar promotion of any dramatic,literary,musical,political,or artistic work,including,but not limited to,a motion picture or television program,or an article published in a newspaper or magazine of general circulation,subd.d,italics added.see ingels,at,d.
motion to strike 
the statute furnishes a mechanism for quickly identifying and eliminating suits that chill public participation a special motion to strike,commonly called an motion.see vogel felice,supra,th at,d.the statute provides a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b.
the statutory definition of an act in furtherance of the constitutional right of petition or free speech comprises four categories any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.
a special motion to strike triggers a process in the trial court.varian medical systems,delfino,supra,cal th at,d,city of cotati cashman cal th,d,cotati.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity.cotati,at,d,citing,subd.b.if the court finds such a showing has been made,it then must consider whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.cotati,at,d.
in each part of the process,the party with the burden need only make a threshold,prima facie showing.cotati,supra,cal th at,d,du charme international brotherhood of electrical workers th,d.a prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,summary judgment.
in assessing the first prong of the the defendant has demonstrated that the action is one arising from protected trial court must consider the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based,subd.b.see,cotati,supra,cal th at,d,navellier,supra,cal th at,d.the trial court need not consider inferences arising from the pleadings,however.computerxpress,jackson th,d computerxpress.
in analyzing the second prong of the the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the trial court measures the plaintiff showing against a standard similar to that used in deciding a motion for nonsuit,directed verdict,or summary judgment.varian medical systems,delfino,supra,cal th at,d.the court determines only whether the plaintiff has made a prima facie showing of facts that would support a judgment if proved at trial it does not weigh the plaintiff evidence.computerxpress,supra,th at,d.but the plaintiff may not rely solely on allegations in the complaint rather,the plaintiff showing must be made by competent,admissible evidence.ibid.
reach of the statute 
strategic lawsuits against public participation encompass a variety of different factual contexts,a variety of different legal actions,and a variety of different defendants.see,church of scientology wollersheim th,d church of scientology,disapproved on another ground in equilon,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
government agencies and public employees are among those entitled to protection from strategic lawsuits against public participation.thus,a public official or government body,just like any private litigant,may make an motion where appropriate.san ramon valley fire protection dist.contra costa county employees retirement th,d.see also,bradbury superior court th,d weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial,supra.
appellate review 
an order granting or denying a special motion to strike is appealable,subd.j,subd.a.on appeal,we review the entire record de novo,first to determine whether the defendant has made the requisite initial showing that the plaintiff action arose from protected activity,and,if so,to assess whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a reasonable probability of success.san ramon valley fire protection dist.contra costa county employees retirement,supra,th at,d tuchscher development enterprises,san diego unified port dist.th,d.
ii.analysis 
with the foregoing principles in mind,we now turn to the specific contentions raised by plaintiffs appeal.addressing each prong of the analysis in turn,we conclude that the trial court acted properly in granting defendants special motion to strike.
a.this action arises from protected speech.
as explained above,the moving defendants bear the initial burden of making a prima facie showing that plaintiffs suit arises from protected activity.equilon,supra,cal th at,d.as courts applying the statute have recognized,the arising from requirement is not always easily met.ibid.the requirement can be satisfied only by showing that the defendant conduct falls within one of the four statutory categories described in section,subdivision e.ibid.as relevant here,the fourth category comprises any conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.
here,the challenged statements include the october edition of the city periodic newsletter to residents,which addressed measure o and other topics,and which was mailed to approximately city residences.also among the challenged communications are the following items,which were posted on the city website the flyer summarizing the facilities and services that would be affected by the repeal of the uut,as identified by the city council in july a document prepared by city staff,dated june,entitled report on the impact of the utility users tax repeal initiative a document prepared by city staff,dated august,entitled analysis of proponents utility users tax repeal implementation plans and the slide presentations made by each affected city department at city council meetings,showing the specific effects of repeal on that department facilities and services.in their opposition to the defense motion to strike,plaintiffs also cited the city website home page as a challenged communication.
plaintiffs contend that the statute permitting a special motion to strike does not apply to defendants conduct because the foregoing communications constitute unlawful campaign propaganda.moreover,plaintiffs assert,defendants do not enjoy the same broad rights of free expression accorded private citizens.plaintiffs apparently do not dispute that defendants statements were speech concerning a matter of public interest.nevertheless,given our task of independently reviewing defendants showing that this action arises from protected activity,we consider that question at the outset.
the statute applies,because the defendants statements concern a matter of public interest.
in this case,there can be no doubt that the statements concern a question of public interest.the definition of public interest within the meaning of the statute has been broadly construed to include not only governmental matters,but also private conduct that impacts a broad segment of society that affects a community in a manner similar to that of a governmental entity.damon ocean hills journalism club th,d.although the cases have not defined the precise boundaries of a public issue,the concept plainly encompasses conduct that could directly affect a large number of people beyond the direct participants citations or a topic of widespread,public interest citation.rivero american federation of state,county and municipal employees,th,d.where defendants are exercising their constitutional rights of free speech on a matter of public interest,their statements and writings fall within subdivision e of section.tuchscher development enterprises,san diego unified port,supra,th at,d.
plaintiffs acknowledge that defendants statements related to a question of public interest.in fact,in their opposition to the defense motion to strike,plaintiffs stated as an undisputed fact that the consequences of measure o were a matter of public debate.
plaintiffs nevertheless argue that government agencies and subject to limitations on their constitutional rights of free expression that are not imposed on private citizens.as plaintiffs put it,government does not enjoy the same first amendment freedom as citizens.amicus californians aware joins that argument.this case does not require us to test the validity or boundaries of that argument.as abundant authority makes plain,the government has the arguably even the speak on matters that concern the discharge of its responsibilities to its citizens.see,league of women voters countywide crim.justice coordination com.d,discussing stanson,supra,cal d,and cases cited therein.government has legitimate interests in informing,in educating,and in persuading an approach that would invalidate all controversial government speech would seriously impair the democratic process.miller california com.on status of women d.if the government can not address controversial topics,it can not govern.ibid.it is not government speech per se but rather the expenditure of public funds in support of one side only that is outside the pale.citation.league of women voters countywide crim.justice coordination,at.we take up the question of whether the city improperly used public funds to advocate for one side only in the second prong of the analysis.
in any event,plaintiffs contend,defendants are not entitled to the protection of section,since they were not validly exercising their free speech rights.we consider that point next.
the asserted illegality of the defendants conduct does not render the statute inapplicable.
plaintiffs assert that defendants statements are not protected under the statute as a valid exercise of free speech rights,because those statements represent unlawful expenditures of public funds.in support of that argument,plaintiffs cite paul for council hanyecz th,d disapproved on another ground in equilon,supra,cal th at,fn,d.that case does not support plaintiffs position.there,the defendants effectively conceded the illegality of their conduct,a campaign scheme.paul for council hanyecz,supra,th at,d.because there was no factual dispute about its illegality,the court concluded as a matter of law that the activity was not a valid exercise of constitutional rights under the statute.id.at,d.but as the court recognized,where the lawfulness of the underlying conduct is disputed,the claimed illegitimacy of the defendant acts is an issue which the plaintiff must raise and support in the context of the discharge of the plaintiff burden to provide a prima facie showing of the merits of the plaintiff case.ibid.
mere allegations that defendants acted illegally do not render the statute inapplicable.huntingdon life sciences,stop huntingdon animal cruelty usa,th,d.the legislature did not intend that to invoke the special motion to strike the defendant must first establish her actions are constitutionally protected under the first amendment as a matter of law.if this were the case then the inquiry as to whether the plaintiff has established a probability of success would be superfluous.fox searchlight pictures,paladino th,d,fn.omitted,quoted in navellier,supra,cal th at,d.to the contrary,the lawfulness of the defendant conduct is considered as part of the second prong of the analysis,in which the plaintiff must demonstrate a probability of success on the merits.see,huntingdon life sciences,stop huntingdon animal cruelty usa,at,d paul for council hanyecz,supra,th at,d.
there is no basis for an exemption from the statute here.
in their motion for reconsideration in the trial court,plaintiffs argued that defendants are not entitled to bring a special motion to strike because their statements are exempt from statutory protection,pursuant to section.in their opening brief on appeal,plaintiffs cite the point as one of the issues on appeal.but except for a brief mention in their reply brief,plaintiffs offer no argument on the question of the question of whether section applies here.
as a procedural matter,we may consider the point forfeited.the parties to an appeal are required to provide pertinent legal arguments,with citation to authority where possible.cal.rules of court,rule a b renden geneva development d.if none is furnished on a particular point,the court may treat it as waived,and pass it without consideration.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.accord,people stanley cal th,d,see also,rossiter benoit d.del real city of riverside th,d.arguments raised for the first time in the reply brief are considered untimely and may be disregarded by the reviewing court.see,shade foods,innovative products sales marketing,th,fn,d.points raised in the reply brief for the first time will not be considered,unless good reason is shown for failure to present them before.campos anderson th,fn,d.in this case,plaintiffs offer no reason for failing to assert their argument earlier.the california supreme court long ago expressed its hostility to the practice of raising new issues in an appellate reply brief.reichardt hoffman th,d.obvious reasons of fairness militate against consideration of an issue raised initially in the reply brief of an appellant.ibid.in sum,both for untimeliness and for lack of sufficient argument,we may consider the point forfeited.
in any event,on the merits,the exemption statute does not apply here.
as noted above,the legislature enacted section to address a disturbing abuse of section,the california law,which has undermined the exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances,contrary to the purpose and intent of section,subd.a see ingels westwood one broadcasting services,supra,th at,d.section exempts certain types of actions from the special motion to strike.subdivision b exempts actions brought solely in the public interest or on behalf of the general public if specified conditions exist,subd.b.subdivision c exempts actions against a person primarily engaged in the business of selling or leasing goods or services if specified conditions exist,subd.c.subdivision d then provides certain exceptions to the exemptions.
as relevant here,section expressly excepts actions arising from the creation and dissemination of political works,subd.d.our state high court has defined political speech as speech dealing with governmental affairs.gerawan farming,lyons cal th,d.under that definition,the defendants writings plainly constitute political works.
plaintiffs nevertheless insist that nonpartisan material should not be construed as political work within the exception of subsection d.we can not accept plaintiffs narrow view of the exception.the statutory scheme as a whole is geared to protect free expression.see,subd.a,subd.a.an appellate court,to the extent that it may do so,should give an interpretation favorable to the exercise of freedom of speech,not its curtailment.bradbury superior court,supra,th at,fn,d.the right to speak on political matters is the quintessential subject of our constitutional protections of the right of free speech.macias hartwell th,d.put another way,political speech is at the core of the first amendment griset fair political practices com.cal th,d.the right of free political expression needs breathing space to survive.kasky nike,cal th,d,quoting new york times sullivan,d.it needs an environment that fosters uninhibited,robust,and debate on public issues.gertz robert welch,d,quoted in kasky nike,at,d.the great principles of the constitution which secure freedom of expression preclude attaching adverse consequences to any except the knowing or reckless falsehood.garrison louisiana,d,quoted in bradbury superior court,at,d.see also,beilenson superior court th,d political debate includes immoderate speech.
to sum up,even assuming that plaintiffs have not forfeited their argument that defendants statements do not qualify as exceptions under section,that argument lacks merit.
defendants carried their burden of showing that the statute applies,because plaintiffs lawsuit arose from the city exercise of free speech rights.
we have undertaken a de novo review of the first step in the process of evaluating the special motion to defendants threshold showing.we did so keeping in mind that a moving defendant need not establish that his action is constitutionally protected rather,he must make a prima facie showing that plaintiff claim arises from an act taken to further defendant rights of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue.du charme international brotherhood of electrical workers th,d.see also,cotati,supra,cal th at,d,only a threshold showing is required to satisfy the first prong of the analysis.
we conclude that defendants have carried their initial burden of demonstrating that plaintiffs claims arose from constitutionally protected speech within the meaning of section.the burden to defeat the special motion to strike thus shifted to plaintiffs.
plaintiffs did not establish a probability of prevailing.
the second prong of the statutory analysis examines whether plaintiffs have made a prima facie showing of the likelihood of success on the merits.computerxpress,supra,th at,d church of scientology,supra,th at,d.to carry that burden,plaintiffs must show that they have a legally sufficient claim,which is supported by competent,admissible evidence.computerxpress,at,d church of scientology,at,d.in order to demonstrate a legally sufficient claim,plaintiffs evidentiary showing must negate defendants constitutional defenses.wilcox,supra,th at,d.other defenses are to be considered if necessary in determining plaintiff probability of success once the plaintiff has presented evidence of the probability of success.church of scientology,at,d,citing,subd.b.
in this case,assessing plaintiffs probability of prevailing requires us to determine whether defendants statements constitute permissible analysis or impermissible campaign propaganda.the substantive legal principle that governs that determination has been succinctly stated the city has broad discretion to make public expenditures,subject to the limitations that the expenditure be for a public purpose and not expressly forbidden by law.schroeder irvine city council th,d schroeder.however,a governmental agency may not spend public funds for a partisan campaign advocating the passage or defeat of a ballot measure.id.at,d.though easily stated,the principle is not so simply applied.problems may arise,of course,in attempting to distinguish improper campaign expenditures from proper informational activities.stanson,supra,cal d at.
our examination of the propriety of defendants expenditures necessarily brings us to the intersection of two fundamental interests the right to free expression and the right to fair elections.more colorfully put our inquiry forces us to step into the maelstrom created by the clash between one of our most fundamental constitutional rights to freedom of expression,and the public right to an electoral process that remains open and free from corruption.governor gray davis com.american taxpayers alliance th,d governor gray davis com.
in undertaking our analysis of this important question,we first consider the proper standard for judging whether defendants statements are informational or promotional.defendants argue for an express advocacy standard.plaintiffs urge us to examine the materials style,tenor,and timing,asserting that such a standard is compelled by stanson.as we now explain,we conclude that defendants are correct.
to be considered unlawful promotional materials,the challenged statements must expressly advocate the election outcome.
the tension between the right to free expression and the right to fair elections has been explored in both federal and california courts.plaintiffs complaint alleges violations of both federal and state constitutional free speech guarantees.we begin with a brief discussion of federal law on this point.
federal law 
the united states constitution first amendment,part of the bill of rights,provides in part that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech,amend.although by its terms this provision limits only congress,the united states supreme court has held that the fourteenth amendment due process clause makes the freedom of speech provision operate to limit the authority of state and local governments as well.kasky nike,supra,cal th at,d.
the seminal case on the issue of the implications of the first amendment on laws regulating political expenditures is buckley valeo,d buckley governor gray davis,supra,th at,d.in buckley,the united states supreme court considered the validity of provisions of the federal election campaign act of,as amended in,which limited the amount of political contributions by individuals and required reporting of amounts exceeding in a calendar year.governor gray davis,at,d.to ensure that the statutory reporting requirement was not an impermissibly broad infringement upon those who seek to exercise protected first amendment rights,citation the court limited the scope of the statute to only funds used for communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate,quoting buckley,supra,at.
the california constitution article i,entitled declaration of rights,guarantees freedom of speech in subdivision a of section.it provides every person may freely speak,write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects,being responsible for the abuse of this right.a law may not restrain or abridge liberty of speech or press.cal,art.i,subd.a.kasky nike,supra,cal th at,d.the california free speech clause is broader and more protective than the first amendment free speech clause.edelstein city and county of san francisco cal th,d.
just as federal legislation may impact federal constitutional rights of free expression,california statutes may affect the fundamental right of political communication afforded under the federal and state constitutions.governor gray davis,supra,th at,d.among those statutes are provisions of the government code found in title local agencies and in title political reform.
government code section appears in title,which concerns local agencies.that section is the sole provision of chapter,which is entitled unlawful expenditures.section was enacted in.it begins an officer,employee,or consultant of a local agency may not expend or authorize the expenditure of any of the funds of the local agency to support or oppose the approval or rejection of a ballot measure,or the election or defeat of a candidate,by the voters,subd.a.the statute then incorporates this definition expenditure means a payment of local agency funds that is used for communications that expressly advocate the approval or rejection of a clearly identified ballot measure,or the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate,by the voters,subd.b italics added.
the political reform act of is codified in title of the government code,et the political reform act covers a wide range of matters involving public officials,including lobbying,conflict of interest,and campaign disclosure.fair political practices com.suitt d.the act undeniably was intended to deal comprehensively with the influence of money,all money,on electoral and governmental processes.id.at.therefore,it does concern itself to some extent with the legality as well as the campaign expenditures.league of women voters countywide crim.justice coordination,supra,d at.the act governs public entities as well as private persons.fair political practices com.suitt,at.
as relevant here,the political reform act defines independent expenditure as a payment made in connection with a communication which expressly advocates the passage or defeat of a clearly identified measure,or taken as a whole and in context,unambiguously urges a particular result in an election but which is not made to or at the behest of the affected candidate or committee,italics added.see also,id,defining expenditure.
a regulation promulgated by the fair political practices commission similarly defines expenditure as any payment used for communications which expressly advocate the qualification,passage or defeat of a clearly identified ballot measure.of,tit,subd.b,italics added.the regulation further provides a communication expressly advocates the nomination,election or defeat of a candidate or the qualification,passage or defeat of a measure if it contains express words of advocacy such as vote for,elect,support,cast your ballot,vote against,defeat,reject,sign petitions for or otherwise refers to a clearly identified candidate or measure so that the communication,taken as a whole,unambiguously urges a particular result in an election,subd.b.this regulation was adopted in response to the standards announced in buckley,supra,d fair political practices com.suitt,supra,d at,fn.in buckley,the united states supreme court gave examples of express words of advocacy,including many of those found in the regulation.buckley at,fn.the high court examples include vote for,elect,support,cast your ballot for,smith for congress,vote against,defeat,reject.id.at,fn,fn.
as has been said,these statutory and regulatory provisions must be construed narrowly in accordance with first amendment standards to apply only to those communications that contain express language of advocacy with an exhortation to elect or defeat a candidate.governor gray davis,supra,th at,d.see also,schroeder,supra,th at,d concluding that payments for communications are political expenditures only if the communications include express advocacy.
despite the foregoing statutory and case law authorities,plaintiffs reject the express advocacy standard,relying on stanson.they argue that stanson articulates a constitutional standard,which can not be overcome by subsequent legislation.plaintiffs also attempt to distinguish the cases interpreting the statutes.as we now explain,plaintiffs arguments are unavailing.
c.the stanson case 
stanson was a taxpayer suit in which the plaintiff sued the director of the california department of parks and recreation,based on allegations that he had used department funds to promote the passage of a parks bond initiative.stanson,supra,cal d at.the defendant demurred to the complaint,arguing that the expenditure of public funds to promote the passage of a bond issue placed on the ballot by the legislature was not improper,and that,in any event,he could not be held personally liable for such expenditures.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and entered judgment in favor of defendant mott.ibid.on appeal by the plaintiff,the california supreme court reversed.ibid.as the high court explained,at least in the absence of clear and explicit legislative authorization,a public agency may not expend public funds to promote a partisan position in an election campaign in the present case,no legislative provision accorded the department of parks and recreation such authorization.id.at.
in its analysis,the stanson court first explained the general principle that expenditures by an administrative official are proper only insofar as they are authorized,explicitly or implicitly,by legislative enactment.stanson,supra,cal d at.the court found no such authority for the defendant expenditures.id.at.the court rejected the defendant contention that the use of such funds to promote a ballot measure or bond issue should be upheld by analogy to the more generally accepted practice of expending public funds for legislative lobbying efforts.id.at.in doing so,the court cited constitutional concerns underlying this uniform judicial reluctance to sanction the use of public funds for election campaigns rests an implicit recognition that such expenditures raise potentially serious constitutional questions.a fundamental precept of this nation democratic electoral process is that the government may not take sides in election contests or bestow an unfair advantage on one of several competing factions.a principal danger feared by our country founders lay in the possibility that the holders of governmental authority would use official power improperly to perpetuate themselves,or their allies,in office citation the selective use of public funds in election campaigns,of course,raises the specter of just such an improper distortion of the democratic electoral process.id.at.moreover,the court observed,the use of the public treasury to mount an election campaign which attempts to influence the resolution of issues which our constitution leave s to the free election of the people see cal,art.ii,does present a serious threat to the integrity of the electoral process.id.at.
the stanson court thus recognized the the serious constitutional question that would be posed by an explicit legislative authorization of the use of public funds for partisan campaigning,but it found no need to resolve that question since the legislative provisions relied upon by defendant mott certainly do not authorize such expenditures in the clear and unmistakable language required by the court earlier decision in mines del valle cal.stanson,supra,cal d at.see also id.at,overruling mines del valle on another point.
stanson then discussed the statute relied on by the defendant,public resources code section.the court concluded while,as we have seen,section does not authorize the department to spend funds for campaign purposes,we believe that,reasonably construed,the section doe
