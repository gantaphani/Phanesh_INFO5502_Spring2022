the internal revenue service irs imposed gift tax deficiencies and penalties on larry sather,kathy sather,john sather,sandra sather,duane sather,and diane sather related to gifts made by each of them in,and assessed transferee liability for gift tax deficiencies and penalties against the duane sather irrevocable trust the duane trust,the larry sather irrevocable trust the larry trust,and the john sather irrevocable trust the john trust related to gifts received by the trusts in from the individuals.the tax court dismissed the assessments against duane and diane sather as untimely as to the remaining sathers and their related trusts,the tax court found that the transactions at issue involved,denied claimed annual exclusions,and upheld the tax deficiencies and a portion of the penalties.we affirm the imposition of gift tax deficiencies but reverse the penalties.
this case involves the transfer of stock in a family business from one generation to the next.the sather brothers,larry,john,duane,and rodney collectively the brothers,along with larry,john,and duane wives,kathy,sandra,and diane,respectively collectively the wives,owned of the stock in sather,which they previously received from the brothers parents.at the time of the transfers at issue,rodney was unmarried and had no children.larry,john,and duane each had three children.in an effort to transfer the stock of sather,to the next generation of sathers,the brothers consulted their accountant for advice on structuring the transfer.upon their accountant advice,larry,john,and duane and each of their respective wives transferred worth of stock to each of their children and to each of their nieces and nephews on december.larry,john,and duane also transferred additional shares to their own children to effect the full transfer of sather,stock to the next generation of sathers.on january,larry,john,and duane each transferred worth of stock to each of their nieces and nephews and approximately worth of stock to each of their own children.the wives each transferred worth of stock to each of their own children the transfers were made to irrevocable trusts for each set of children larry,john,and duane.
each donor filed a separate gift tax return for,claiming nine gift tax exclusions,one for each donee each individual own three children and six nieces and nephews,or nine nieces and nephews in rodney case.each donor likewise filed a gift tax return for,again claiming nine gift tax exclusions and electing to have each gift treated as made by each spouse,as allowed under the internal revenue code.on august,the irs issued notices of gift tax deficiencies and penalties to each of the individual donors for the tax period.on october,the irs issued notices of gift tax deficiencies and penalties to each trust as transferee for the tax period the irs allowed only three exclusions per year for each of the,kathy,john,sandra,duane,and assessed gift taxes and penalties based on the remaining transfers.the irs reasoned that the gifts to each of the donors own children were valid gifts,but that the gifts to each niece and nephew were constructive gifts to the donors own children.
each donor and each trust filed separate petitions in the united states tax court,challenging the deficiencies,penalties,and transferee liability.the tax court consolidated the cases for trial purposes and tried the consolidated cases on june.the tax court issued a memorandum findings of fact and opinion on september,dismissing the assessments against duane and diane sather as untimely,and upholding the deficiency assessments against the remaining donors for the gifts and against the transferee trusts for the gifts.the tax court also upheld the penalties based on transfers made by kathy,sandra,and diane,but dismissed the penalties based on transfers made by larry,john,and duane,finding that the brothers but not their respective wives had reasonably relied on their accountant and attorney.the tax court entered judgment in each case on november.
ii.appellate jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction over appeals from tax court cases pursuant to section of the internal revenue code the irs argues that we lack jurisdiction to hear this appeal,however,because the appellants filed a single notice of appeal.while we recognize that a notice of appeal is jurisdictional,see klaudt united states dep t of the interior,cir,we hold that the notice in this case was sufficient to confer jurisdiction for each of the cases.
a notice of appeal is liberally construed and mere technicalities will not foreclose the court review,particularly where the intent to appeal is apparent,and there is no prejudice to the adverse party.see id.the sathers notice of appeal was filed on december,well within the days allowed to appeal from a tax court decision.see fed.a.rule of the federal rules of appellate procedure requires that the notice of appeal specify the party or parties taking the appeal by naming each one in the caption or body of the notice.fed.c a.however,a n appeal must not be dismissed for failure to name a party whose intent to appeal is otherwise clear from the notice.fed.c emphasis added.the emphasized part of the rule was added in in response to the supreme court torres oakland scavenger,d opinion,where the supreme court held that a notice which inadvertently omitted the name of one of interveners was insufficient to effect an appeal for that individual.see at.see also fed,amendments,note to subdivision c discussing change in rule following torres.the test for determining whether designations other than by name are sufficient is whether it is objectively clear that a party intended to appeal.fed,amendments,note to subdivision c,para.
the notice of appeal named the appellants as larry sather,donor,et and listed the docket numbers for each of the nine cases,which had been consolidated for trial purposes below.app.at.the notice stated that the petitioners,larry sather,et,hereby appeal from the decision of th e tax court entered in the consolidated proceeding on the seventeenth day of september.id.the decision referred to in the notice is the consolidated memorandum opinion,which likewise named the petitioners as larry sather,donor,et in its caption.based on these facts,the notice satisfied rule c a.torres,at.noting that the appellant was never named or otherwise designated on the notice of appeal emphasis added twenty mile joint venture,pnd,comm r,cir finding rule not met because there was no mention of a particular party in the notice of appeal by name or docket number dodger bar grill,johnson county bd.of county comm rs,cir holding that a notice stating that appeal is by dodger and the other plaintiffs is sufficient to confer jurisdiction.
rule c also requires designation of the judgment,order,or part thereof being appealed.fed.c b.although the notice specified the memorandum opinion rather than the individual judgments as the decision from which an appeal was sought,the notice sufficiently put the irs on notice that the final judgments were being appealed.the judgments contained only the final disposition of each case,which was also evident from the memorandum opinion.the irs conceded at oral argument that it was not prejudiced by the notice.the appellants reference to the memorandum opinion satisfied rule c b.see hawkins city of farmington,cir holding that where intent to appeal an order not specifically named in the notice of appeal is apparent and the appellee is not prejudiced,the court may hear the appeal.
the cases cited by the irs concerning the consolidation of appeals do not support the irs position that the notice of appeal was insufficient.there is no requirement that separate notices of appeal be filed on separate pieces of paper.the irs had sufficient notice that an appeal was being taken from each individual case.further,the appellants in the cases relied upon by the irs attempted to use a notice of appeal for one case to boot strap an appeal for a related case,which had been consolidated for trial purposes only,but which had been disposed of at an earlier date.the notice of appeal was untimely as to the disposition of one of the cases,and our brethren held in both instances that because the cases were not consolidated for disposition purposes,the notice of appeal was untimely as to the previously dismissed case.see mendel prod.credit ass of the midlands,cir holding a notice of appeal covering two informally consolidated cases untimely as to one because of the timing of the district court disposition of motions to reconsider in each,not commenting on the fact that both were included in the same notice of appeal page comm r,cir holding similarly where a motion to revise one tax court decision stayed the running of the time to appeal for that case but not the informally consolidated case for which no similar motion was filed,cert.denied,d.they did not hold that the notice of appeal was insufficient because it was on the same piece of paper as the notice for another informally consolidated case.
ii.reciprocal gifts 
the internal revenue code imposes a tax on the transfer of property by gift,a,whether the gift is direct or indirect,a.the first worth of gifts of a present interest made to any person in a calendar year is excluded from the definition of a taxable gift.b.thus,it is not uncommon for taxpayers to avoid the gift tax by structuring gifts just below the exclusion limit.this case requires us to determine whether the gifts in this case,similar gifts made by the donors to each other children,are really,that is,indirect gifts to their own children.
the tax court found that the cumulative transfers at issue lacked economic substance,relying on the reciprocal trust doctrine.the sathers argue that there is economic substance to the transactions as a whole when rodney gifts to the nieces and nephews are considered,as is required by the doctrine.whether a transaction lacks economic substance,and whether several transactions should be considered integrated steps of a single transaction,are both fact questions which we review for clear error.see lee comm r,cir reviewing economic substance robino.pension trust comm r,cir reviewing doctrine.
the reciprocal trust doctrine,a variation of the substance over form concept,see exch.bank and trust of united states,was developed in the context of trusts to prevent taxpayers from transferring similar property in trust to each other as life tenants,thus removing the property from the settlor estate and avoiding estate taxes,while receiving identical property for their lifetime enjoyment that would likewise not be included in their estate.see united states grace estate,d.the supreme court held that the reciprocal trust doctrine applies to multiple transactions when the transactions are interrelated and,to the extent of mutual value,leave the settlors in approximately the same economic position as they would have been in had they created trusts naming themselves as life beneficiaries.id.at.the doctrine seeks to discern the reality of the transaction the fact that the trusts are reciprocated or crossed is a trifle,quite lacking in practical or legal significance.id.at.quoting lehman comm r,cir,cert.denied.
substance over form analysis applies equally to gift tax cases.see,heyen united states,cir chanin united states.it is impliedly included in the gift tax statute indirect transfers within the definition of a taxable gift.see a.the terms property,transfer,gift,and indirectly are used in the broadest and most comprehensive sense the words transfer by gift and whether direct or indirect are designed to cover and comprehend all transactions whereby property or a property right is donatively passed dickman comm r,d quoting,and,some alterations in original.application of the reciprocal trust doctrine is likewise appropriate in the gift tax context as a method for discerning the substance of gift transfers.the purpose of the doctrine is merely to identify the transferor of property.exchange bank,at quoting bischoff comm r,wl.once the transferor is identified,the tax code determines whether the transfer is subject to tax.id.
applying the reciprocal trust doctrine to this case,there can be no doubt that the gifts were interrelated.the sather brothers together sought advice on how to transfer the stock to the next generation of sathers.the transfers to all the children were made on the same days and were for the same amounts of stock.we can not say that the tax court or determining that the transfers were interrelated.
the second prong of the grace estate analysis requires that the settlors be left in approximately the same economic position as they would have been in had they created trusts naming themselves as life beneficiaries.grace estate,at.we do not believe that the supreme court meant to limit the doctrine to cases involving life estate trusts,or even to cases where the donor retains an economic interest,but used that language in the context of the specific facts of the case.see,exchange bank,at holding that the doctrine applies to transfers made under the florida gifts to minors act,wherein each spouse transferred equal amounts of property to their children,naming the other spouse as custodian.grace estate does not speak in terms of a retained economic,that the arrangement leaves the settlors in approximately the same economic position id.at.in this case,the parents transferred stock to their nieces and nephews in exchange for transfers to their own children by the nieces and nephews parents.though the sathers received no direct economic value in the exchange,they did receive an economic benefit by indirectly benefitting their own children.the donors were in the same economic position of passing their assets to their entering the as if they had made direct gifts of all of their stock to their own children applying the analysis of the reciprocal trust doctrine,we hold that these interrelated gifts were reciprocal transactions that must be uncrossed to reach the substance of the transactions.see schultz united states,cir disallowing gift tax exclusions where two brothers made gifts to each other children as well as their own.
the purpose of the second grace estate prong is to discern the taxability of the transactions as uncrossed in the context of a particular set of facts.see exchange bank,at discussing bischoff.uncrossing the gifts in the present case,the tax court made the factual finding that each immediate family was in the same position as if each donor had made gifts only to the donor own children.thus,using the reciprocal trust doctrine to identify the actual transferor,each donor made transfers to each of his or her own children but no gifts to any of the nieces and nephews.see schultz,at.we can not say that the tax court clearly erred in making this factual finding.under b,each,kathy,john,sandra,duane,and entitled to one exclusion for gifts made to each uncrossed donee,their own children,for each year in which gifts were made.because each transferor has only three children but claimed nine exclusions,the irs correctly determined that the transferors understated their gift tax liabilities.
the sathers argue that the doctrine requires us to consider the gifts made by rodney to each of his nieces and nephews,and that in so doing,we will find economic substance in the whole transaction.each of larry,john,and duane immediate families had a net increase in economic value,while rodney immediate family consisting only of himself had a net decrease in economic value.true as this may be,it does not change the fact that uncrossing the reciprocal gifts leaves each of the transferors in the same position as if he or she had transferred stock only to his or her own children.the purpose of the reciprocal trust doctrine is to discern the actual transfers do not affect the reality of the other transferors gifts,which amounted to a transfer of their own stock to their own children.
the sathers also argue that the tax court erred in excluding evidence of their intent,which was purportedly to transfer the stock to the next generation of sathers,not to avoid taxes.noting that the subjective intent of the parties,particularly when the parties are related,creates substantial obstacles to the proper application of the federal estate tax laws,the supreme court held
