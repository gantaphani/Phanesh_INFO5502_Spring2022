background 
historical context 
after the arrival of captain cook in,the western world became increasingly interested in the commercial potential of the hawaiian islands.the nineteenth century saw a steady rise in american and european involvement in the islands political and economic affairs.as the resistance of the native hawaiian government mounted,american commercial interests eventually succeeded,with the complicity of the military,in overthrowing the hawaiian monarchy and establishing a provisional government under the title of the republic of hawaii.see rice,at.
in,president mckinley signed a joint resolution to annex the hawaiian islands as a territory of the united states.stat.this resolution,commonly referred to as the newlands resolution,provided that the republic of hawaii ceded all public lands to the united states and that revenues from the lands were to be used solely for the benefit of the inhabitants of the hawaiian islands for educational and other public purposes.id.two years later,the hawaiian organic act established the territory of hawaii and put the ceded lands in the control of the territory of hawaii until otherwise provided for by congress.act of,ch,stat.
b.the public land trust and the hawaiian homes commission act 
shortly after the establishment of the territory,congress became concerned with the condition of the native hawaiian people.rice,at.declaring its intent to e stablish a permanent land base for the beneficial use of native hawaiians,congress enacted the hawaiian homes commission act.act of july,ch,b,stat.hhca.the hhca set aside acres of lands previously ceded to the united states for the creation of loans and leases to benefit native hawaiians.these lands were to be leased exclusively,including by transfer,to native hawaiians for a term of years at a nominal rate of one dollar per year.id.the hhca defines native hawaiian as any descendant of not less than part of the blood of the races inhabiting the hawaiian islands previous to.id.a.
in,hawaii became the state in the union.under the hawaii statehood admission act,congress required hawaii to incorporate the hhca into its state constitution,with the united states retaining authority to approve any changes to the eligibility requirements for the hhca leases.act of march,stat.admission act.see haw.constt.art.xii.in return,the united states granted hawaii title to all public lands within the state,save a small portion reserved for use of the federal government.id.b d,stat.the admission act further declared that the lands,together with the proceeds from the sale or other disposition of any such lands and the income therefrom,shall be held by the state as a public trust for the support of the public schools,the conditions of native hawaiians and other purposes.id.f,stat.the land granted to hawaii included the acres previously set aside under the hhca and an additional million acres.
the hawaii constitution expressly adopted the hhca and declared that the spirit of the hawaiian homes commission act looking to the continuance of the hawaiian homes projects for the further rehabilitation of the hawaiian race shall be faithfully carried out.haw.const.art.xii.because the hhca purposes include support of public education,the constitution also provides that lands granted to hawaii under the admission act will be held in public trust for native hawaiians and the general public.id.see arakaki hawaii,cir.
the hhca established a department of hawaiian home lands dhhl,to be headed by an executive board known as the hawaiian homes commission hhc.act of july,ch,a,stat.by statute hawaii created both the department of hawaiian home lands and the hawaiian homes commission.together,administer the acres set aside by the hhca,and beneficiaries are limited to native hawaiians,as defined in the act.the dhhl is funded in substantial part by state revenue although the record is not clear on this point,this revenue likely derives from both tax and sources.
c.the office of hawaiian affairs 
in,hawaii amended its constitution to establish the office of hawaiian affairs to provide hawaiians the right to determine the priorities which will effectuate the betterment of their condition and welfare and promote the protection and preservation of the hawaiian race,and to unite hawaiians as a people.rice,at.quoting proceedings of the constitutional convention of hawaii of,committee of the whole.oha holds title to all property held in trust for native hawaiians and hawaiians,except for the acres administered by oha thus controls the million acres ceded by the united states in the admission act.the term native hawaiians has the same blood quantum requirement as under the hhca by contrast,the term hawaiians is broader and simply refers to any persons descended from inhabitants of the hawaiian islands prior to.haw.stat.oha statutory purposes include a ssessing the policies and practices of other agencies impacting on native hawaiians and hawaiians,conducting advocacy efforts for native hawaiians and hawaiians,a pplying for,receiving,and disbursing,grants and donations from all sources for native hawaiian and hawaiian programs and services,and s erving as a receptacle for reparations.haw.stat.
oha administers funds received from two principal sources.first,oha receives a percent share of any revenue generated by the million acres of lands held in public trust.haw.stat.second,oha receives revenue from the state general fund,which derives from tax revenue and other,sources.
d.the proceedings 
the plaintiffs some of whom qualify as hawaiians allege that they are citizens of hawaii,taxpayers of the state of hawaii and of the united states,and beneficiaries of a public land trust created in.the complaint alleges three causes of action.first,plaintiffs allege that the various programs of the oha and violate the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment and the equal protection component of the due process clause of the fifth amendment.second,they make these same allegations under.third,they claim that the administration of the oha and the constitutes a breach of the public land trust.
the district court dismissed plaintiffs claims on grounds of standing and political question.with respect to the dhhl hhc,the court ruled that the united states was an indispensable party to the lease eligibility requirements,but that plaintiffs had no standing to sue the united states.arakaki iv,d at.because any challenge to the lessee requirements of the hawaiian home lands lease program set up by the hhca,a state law,necessarily involves a challenge to the admission act,all claims against the were dismissed.id.at.
the district court took a slightly different route with respect to oha.the court dismissed the breach of trust claim on the ground that plaintiffs had not pleaded a breach of trust claim that is cognizable under the common law of trusts.arakaki ii,d at.finding that plaintiffs had state taxpayer standing to sue oha,the court declined to dismiss oha because,unlike,n othing in the admission act requires the creation of oha or governs oha actions.arakaki iv,d at.the court limited the plaintiffs taxpayer challenge,however,to oha programs funded from taxes,as opposed to programs funded from other sources.arakaki ii,d at arakaki iv,d at.in a subsequent decision,however,the district court dismissed all claims against oha on the ground that they were barred by the political question doctrine.the court observed that,although congress has plenary authority to recognize indian tribal status,it has given hawaiians some,but not all,of the privileges that go with formal tribal status.because resolving plaintiffs equal protection claims would require the court to determine hawaiians political status in order to determine the appropriate level of scrutiny,the court declined to decide hawaiians current political status in recognition of the continuing debate in congress and the principle that this is a political issue that should be first decided by another branch of government.arakaki vi,d at.
plaintiffs appeal the dismissal of all their claims.
ii.standard of review 
standing is a legal issue subject to de novo review.bruce united states,cir.in ruling on a fed.civ.b motion to dismiss for lack of standing,we must construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party.hong kong supermarket kizer,cir.as the district court noted,whether dismissal on political question grounds is jurisdictional or prudential in nature,and thus whether it is properly classified under rule b or b,is unclear.compare schlesinger reservists comm.to stop the war,d presence of a political question,like absence of standing,deprives court of jurisdiction,with goldwater carter,d the doctrine rests in part on prudential concerns calling for mutual respect among the three branches of government.either way,we review the district court dismissal de novo.see,decker advantage fund,cir dismissal under rule b reviewed de novo luong circuit city stores,cir dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,pursuant to rule b,reviewed de novo.
iii.plaintiffs standing to challenge the leases 
plaintiffs claim standing to challenge the leases as land trust beneficiaries,and as state taxpayers.we find that neither theory confers standing to challenge the lease requirements or the appropriation of state revenue in support thereof.the district properly dismissed all claims against the and the united states.
plaintiffs standing as land trust beneficiaries 
plaintiffs challenge the public lands trust administered by because it prefers native hawaiians in the lease eligibility criteria for the acres set aside in the hhca and incorporated into the hawaii constitution through the admission act.the plaintiffs argue that as members of the class of native hawaiians and general public,haw.constt.art.xii,they are trust beneficiaries,and may sue the trustee when the trustee actions violate the law.see restatement second of trusts.plaintiffs allege that the and the united enforced the provisions of the trust in violation of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.
the united states as trustee 
plaintiffs argue that the trust obligations of the united states arise through two acts,the newlands resolution and the admission act.plaintiffs claim the trust was first established in by the newlands resolution with the united states as trustee.congress,according to plaintiffs,then violated its duties as trustee by discriminating on the basis of race when it enacted the hhca in and again in the admission act when it required hawaii to incorporate the hhca into its constitution.alternatively,plaintiffs argue that the united states became a trustee as a result of the admission act 
the history of the land trust does not support either of plaintiffs theories.the united states is not currently a trustee of the lands in question by virtue of either the newlands resolution or the admission act.the newlands resolution recited that the government of the republic of hawaii ceded the absolute fee and ownership of all public government,or crown lands.newlands resolution,stat.it further provided that existing laws regarding public lands would not apply to hawaiian lands,but that congress shall enact special laws for their management and disposition provided,that all revenue from or proceeds of the same shall be used solely for the benefit of the inhabitants of the hawaiian islands for educational and other public purposes.id.although this passage did not specifically use the word trust,the attorney general of the united states subsequently interpreted it to subject the public lands in hawaii to a special trust.lands,op.att y.
assuming,arguendo,that the attorney general was right to construe the newlands resolution as establishing a trust,and assuming further that the united states became a trustee,the united states status as trustee was expressly subject to future revision.the resolution specifically provides that the united states shall enact special laws for the management and disposition of public lands.the attorney general construed this provision as vest ing in congress the exclusive right,by special enactment,to provide for the disposition of public lands in hawaii.id.the newlands resolution thus contemplated that congress would enact subsequent rules to govern the ceded lands.
congress enacted such rules in the hhca and the admission act.any trust obligation the united states assumed in the newlands resolution for the lands at issue here was extinguished by congress when it created the in the hhca and granted it control of defined available lands.act of july,ch,and see id.a upon the passage of this act,all available lands shall immediately assume the status of hawaiian home lands and be under the control of the department to be used and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of this act.any lingering doubt over the united states role as trustee was eliminated entirely in the admission act when the united states grant ed to the state of hawaii,effective upon its admission in the union,the united states title to all the public lands and other public property,and to all lands defined as available lands by section of the hawaiian homes commission act title which is held by the united states immediately prior to its admission into the union,b,stat.
our discussion here also resolves plaintiffs claim that the admission act established the united states obligations as a trustee.the admission act unambiguously requires that land be held in public trust,but by the state of hawaii,not the united states.nothing in the admission act suggests that the united states would serve as a with the state.nor does the fact that the united states must consent to changes in the qualifications of lessees under the trust make the united states a.see,stat.congress might have made the united states a instead it reserved to the united states the right to bring suit for breach of trust,id.f,a provision at odds with the suggestion that the united states remains a trustee.we conclude,as we noted in cmty.ass hawaiian homes comm n,cir,that t he united states has only a somewhat tangential supervisory role of the admission act,rather than the role of trustee.
the united states as an indispensable party 
although the united states can not be sued on plaintiffs trust beneficiary theory,plaintiffs nevertheless argue that they may at least sue the state defendants on the same theory.plaintiffs point to several cases in which we have held that native hawaiians,as trust beneficiaries,could bring suit under against the state to enforce the terms of the trust,price akaka,cir cmty.ass hawaiian homes comm n,cir see also price akaka,cir.those cases involved claims that the state was improperly administering the trust and sought to enforce the trust terms.
we believe that this argument is disposed of easily.those cases differ from the present challenge in a fundamental way although those previous cases have involved suits to enforce the express terms of the trust,this suit,by contrast,asks the court to prohibit the enforcement of a trust provision.that is,plaintiffs now raise a claim that is unique in that it does not seek to enforce the substantive terms of the trust,but instead challenges at least one of those terms as constitutionally unenforceable.
we have recently held that in any challenge to the enforceability of the lease eligibility requirements,the united states is an indispensable party.in carroll nakatani,cir,a hawaiian citizen challenged the homestead lease program administered by dhhl hhc.the plaintiff sued the relevant state actors,but failed to sue the united states.we held that section of the admissions act expressly reserves to the united states that no changes in the qualifications of the lessees may be made without its consent.carroll,at.we reasoned that because the qualifications for the leases can not be modified without the united states approval,the united states is an indispensable party to any lawsuit challenging the leases,and the plaintiff failure to sue the united states meant that his injury was not redressable.id.at.
here,unlike in carroll,plaintiffs properly named the united states as a party.carroll logic nonetheless applies.plaintiffs lack standing to sue the united states,but the united states is an indispensable party to any challenge to the lease eligibility requirements.plaintiffs therefore can not maintain their challenge to the lease eligibility requirements against the state.accordingly,the district court properly dismissed the plaintiffs trust beneficiary claim against the state defendants.
plaintiffs standing as state taxpayers 
plaintiffs also challenge the lease eligibility programs in their capacity as state taxpayers.the question is whether our decision in carroll bars plaintiffs equal protection challenge in their capacity as taxpayers,just as it barred plaintiffs suit in their capacity as trust beneficiaries.in particular,we must decide whether plaintiffs have standing to challenge hawaii spending of tax revenues on the lease program this is a more complicated question.
the standing doctrine,like other article iii doctrines concerning justiciability,ensures that a plaintiff claims arise in a concrete factual context appropriate to judicial resolution.valley forge christian coll.ams.united for separation of church state,d.standing ensures that,no matter the academic merits of the claim,the suit has been brought by a proper party.the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing requires that a plaintiff allege that he has suffered concrete injury,that there is a causal connection between his injury and the conduct complained of,and that the injury will likely be redressed by a favorable decision.united states hays,d quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d.
plaintiffs have alleged that hawaii has supported the lease program through tax revenues,a point that hawaii does not dispute.arakaki ii,d at.hawaii taxing and spending in support of the lease program is not mandated by the admission act or any other federal law.the admission act requires hawaii to adopt the hhca and forbids hawaii to change the lease eligibility requirement without the consent of the united states but neither the admission act nor the hhca,as incorporated by the hawaii constitution,mandates the expenditure of state funds,much less the expenditure of state tax revenues,stat.section f of the admission act does provide that proceeds from the sale or other disposition of the lands shall be paid into the trust for the identified purposes,but nothing suggests,much less requires,that the state of hawaii expend tax revenues to support the lease program.any tax revenues hawaii has appropriated to,then,resulted from decisions by the hawaii legislature.
plaintiffs claims might be construed as a limited challenge to the lease program plaintiffs challenge the lease program to the extent that hawaii of any federal obligation,including the admission in taxing and spending in support of the program.under this theory,unlike their trust beneficiary theory,plaintiffs would not challenge the lease eligibility requirements directly,nor would they implicate any substantial rights belonging to the united states.thus,plaintiffs might argue,even if they can not seek to enjoin the native rule directly,they can seek to enjoin further state funding of a provision that allegedly violates the equal protection clause.plaintiffs remedy,presumably,would be an injunction against spending state tax revenues,but not an order directing changes in the lease criteria.
plaintiffs theory,though game,ultimately fails under carroll.the only ground plaintiffs have alleged for enjoining the state from spending is that the spending is for purposes prohibited by the equal protection clause.any remedy that plaintiffs example,an injunction against expenditure of tax revenues for the lease that the district court decide whether the lease eligibility criteria are constitutional.the lease criteria are found in the hhca which is adopted by article xii of the hawaii constitution.we held in carroll,however,that article xii of the hawaiian constitution can not be declared unconstitutional without holding section of the admissions act unconstitutional.carroll,at.our decision in carroll effectively holds that any challenge to article xii is a challenge to section of the admission act,and no challenge to the admission act may proceed without the presence of the united states as a defendant.
as state taxpayers,plaintiffs have no basis for suing the united states.they claim no status that would distinguish them from any number of other persons who also do not qualify for the hawaiian home lands leases.the court has repeatedly refused to recognize a generalized grievance against allegedly illegal government conduct as sufficient for standing.hays,at.moreover,t he rule against generalized grievances applies with as much force in the equal protection context as in any other.see allen wright,d.federal taxpayer standing which,notably,plaintiffs do not assert,is simply one instance of the assertion of a generalized grievance.see frothingham mellon.the administration of any statute,likely to produce additional taxation to be imposed upon a vast number of taxpayers,the extent of whose several liability is indefinite and constantly changing,is essentially a matter of public and not of individual concern.
we hold that plaintiffs can not avoid the implications of carroll by limiting their claims to state spending in support of the lease program and then alleging their state taxpayer status.even if plaintiffs were to have standing as state possibility we address in part iv and hold is foreclosed by the supreme court decision in status can not supply standing against the united states.see,frothingham,at.citing crampton zabriskie.mining council watt,cir.accordingly,we conclude that plaintiffs lack standing to sue the united states,and that the united states remains an indispensable party to any challenge to the lease eligibility criteria.we affirm the district court dismissal of all claims against the united states and.
iv.plaintiffs standing to challenge oha programs 
as with,plaintiffs allege two theories of standing to challenge oha they challenge the appropriation of state tax revenue based on their status as state taxpayers,and they challenge the appropriation of trust revenue to oha based on their alleged status as trust beneficiaries.relying in large measure on our decision in hoohuli ariyoshi,cir,the district court held that plaintiffs had standing to sue oha as state taxpayers.arakaki ii,d at.the court further held,however,that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge state funding of oha that did not originate in taxes,specifically,any revenue that oha received from lease rentals,settlements,or state bonds.id.at.with respect to the trust revenue claim,the district court dismissed the breach of trust claim on the ground that plaintiffs had not pleaded a trust claim that was cognizable under the common law of trusts.id.at.
oha contends that the district court must be reversed in light of daimlerchrysler cuno,d,and because the united states is an indispensable party under carroll.plaintiffs allege that the district court erred by restricting the scope of their challenge to oha programs directly funded by taxes.we address each of these contentions in turn.we conclude that daimlerchrysler effectively overrules hoohuli,and plaintiffs,accordingly,do not have standing as state taxpayers to challenge the appropriation of state revenue to oha.we need not reach the issue of whether or not the united states is an indispensable party under carroll,nor need we discuss whether or not the district court properly limited the scope of plaintiffs challenge.finally,we conclude,as we did in the prior section,that plaintiffs can not prevail on their trust beneficiary theory of standing because the united states remains an indispensable party to a suit challenging the trust,and plaintiffs have no standing to sue the united states.
plaintiffs state taxpayer standing 
the vitality of hoohuli 
in hoohuli,residents of hawaii and a taxpayers group brought suit under for damages and injunctive relief to challenge programs administered by oha to the extent those programs favored hawaiians.at.we held that at least some of the individual plaintiffs had standing to seek an injunction prohibiting the appropriating,transferring,and spending of taxpayers money from the state treasury general fund.id.at.the plaintiffs alleged that they had been burdened with the necessity to provide more taxes to support a class composed of hawaiians and that this was sufficient to sustain a pocketbook action set forth in doremus board of education.id.internal quotations omitted.in our original opinion,we held that hoohuli remained the law of the circuit,and that justice kennedy opinion in asarco kadish,d,while persuasive,did not receive the requisite five votes to overrule hoohuli.see arakaki,at.since we issued our original opinion,the supreme court decided daimlerchrysler,d,which now effectively overrules hoohuli.see id.at noting that arakaki and hoohuli were inconsistent with the five circuits to have decided this issue and agreeing with those circuits.
in order to satisfy the case or controversy requirement of article iii,a plaintiff must demonstrate an injury in fact,a causal relationship between the injury and the conduct complained of,and redressability.lujan,at.in taxpayer suits,these requirements are particularly difficult to satisfy.the court has hesitated to recognize federal taxpayer standing because an injunction prohibiting spending on any given program may only remotely affect the parties tax bill and redress the alleged injury.as the court wrote in frothingham mellon,a federal taxpayer interest in the moneys of the treasury is shared with millions of others and the effect upon future taxation,of any payment out of the funds,is so remote,fluctuating and uncertain,that no basis is afforded for judicial review.at.
the court this view in daimlerchrysler,in which the plaintiffs alleged that a state tax credit violated the commerce clause.plaintiffs claimed standing by virtue of their status as ohio taxpayers,alleging that the franchise tax credit provided to daimlerchrysler depletes the funds of the state of ohio to which the plaintiffs contribute through their tax payments and thus diminishes the total funds available for lawful uses and imposes disproportionate burdens on them.at internal quotations and brackets omitted.
the court held that plaintiffs did not have standing because their injury as taxpayers was not concrete and particularized but instead a grievance the taxpayer suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally.id.citation and internal quotations omitted.the injury was conjectural or hypothetical in that it depends on how legislators respond to a reduction in revenue,if that is the consequence of the credit.id.e stablishing redressability,the court held,requires speculating that abolishing the challenged credit will redound to the benefit of the taxpayer because legislators will pass along the supposed increased revenue in the form of tax reductions.id.at.according to the court,the limitations on standing in federal taxpayer cases applied with undiminished force to state taxpayers.id.
daimlerchrysler plainly undermines hoohuli standing principles.under hoohuli,plaintiffs had to meet a test for state taxpayer standing taxpayer status,the funds in question were appropriated from the state general funds,and the state was spending the funds for an unlawful purpose.at.we did not require that the taxpayer prove that his tax burden would be lightened by the cancellation of the challenged expenditure.see also cammack waihee,cir noting that hoohuli,the leading case on this issue in the circuit,does not require that the taxpayer prove that her tax burden will be lightened by elimination of the questioned expenditure.
daimlerchrysler,by contrast,requires that state taxpayers establish a particularized,concrete injury that is redressable by the court judgment.as the supreme court observed,the plaintiffs alleged injury is speculative if redress ultimately depends on how the legislature responds to the court judgment.see daimlerchrysler.at.but the f ederal courts may not assume a particulate exercise of state fiscal discretion in establishing standing.id.at.the court concluded that state taxpayers have no standing under article iii to challenge state tax or spending decisions simply by virtue of their status as taxpayers.id.at footnotes omitted.
application of daimlerchrysler 
applying the reasoning of daimlerchrysler to the facts of the case at hand,we conclude that plaintiffs do not have standing as state taxpayers to challenge the appropriation of state revenue to oha.plaintiffs argue that they meet the test for standing under daimlerchrysler because their injury is concrete and particularized,the depletion of the state treasury is actual and ongoing,and the injury they suffer is redressable through declaratory and injunctive relief.we address each contention in turn.
first,plaintiffs maintain that because they are required to pay taxes to support racial discrimination against themselves,they suffer a particularized injury that is not shared by people in general or by hawaii state taxpayers generally,but only by taxpayers who lack the favored ancestry and benefit from oha programs.but plaintiffs do not allege that they have suffered any harm apart from the fact that they are taxpayers and do not like oha programs.plaintiffs argument,taken to its logical conclusion,would significantly expand state taxpayer article iii standing by allowing a taxpayer to challenge any governmental expenditure he does not like and for which he has not applied expenditures from the common fisc for veteran benefits could be challenged by any taxpayer who had not served in the military welfare benefits could be challenged by any individual not on welfare educational expenditures could be invalidated by a suit brought by an individual who does not have children in the public school system.under plaintiffs theory,even the ohio taxpayers in daimlerchrysler could argue that while all ohio taxpayers bore the burden of the depletion of funds from the fisc,taxpayers who were employed by daimlerchrysler received a benefit in the form of a paycheck and thus a taxpaying suffers a particularized injury.we think that the court reasoning in daimlerchrysler extends to such creative arguments.as the court noted,conferring standing on state taxpayers simply because their tax burden gives them an interest in the state treasury would interpose the federal courts as virtually continuing monitors of the wisdom and soundness of state fiscal administration,contrary to the more modest role article iii envisions for federal courts.daimlerchrysler.at internal quotations omitted.we decline to play such a role and accordingly reject plaintiffs contention that they suffer a particularized injury.
second,plaintiffs assert the injury they suffer is actual,imminent and ongoing as the state legislature continues to appropriate sums from the general fund for oha.they contrast this with the supreme court holding in daimlerchrysler,which they characterize as involving a tax rebate that was a conjectural depletion of the state treasury.however,the plaintiffs misapprehend what we look to when determining whether the injury is conjectural or hypothetical.as the supreme court noted,a plaintiff injury is conjectural or hypothetical when it depends on how legislators respond to a change in revenue.daimlerchrysler.at.plaintiffs here overlook the fact that whether or not their injury is redressable is entirely speculative.it is not certain that even if all funding for oha were terminated,that the legislature would pass the savings on to the plaintiffs in the form of tax breaks or refrain from spending the funds on programs benefitting yet another subgroup of the hawaiian population to which plaintiffs do not belong.the flow of funds from the treasury to support oha is actual and concrete what the legislature would do with those funds absent oha is speculative.
third,plaintiffs assert that their injury is redressable through declaratory or injunctive relief.for the reasons stated above,any benefit that would accrue to plaintiffs from an injunction or declaratory judgement is speculative.plaintiffs argue that the supreme court has allowed individuals who can allege a distinct and palpable injury to themselves to sue and invoke the public interest even if the injury is shared by a large class of other potential litigants.however,these cases are readily distinguishable and involved core functions of our democracy,such as voting,see baker carr,d involving a justiciable question of voting district apportionment see also harper.state bd.of elections,d striking down a poll tax,or issues of economic liberty outside the taxation context,see mcgowan maryland,d involving harm from economic loss and fines from sunday closing laws.the court has consistently denied both federal and state taxpayers standing under article iii to object to a particular expenditure of funds simply because they are taxpayers.see,valley forge,d denying standing to taxpayers to challenge conveyance of government land to a private religious college reservists,d denying taxpayers standing to challenge members of congress membership in armed forces reserve units united states richardson,d denying taxpayer standing to force publication of the receipts and expenditures of the cia doremus bd.of.holding that the rationales for rejecting federal taxpayer standing apply with equal force to state taxpayer suits.power ickes.holding that the interest of a taxpayer in the moneys of the federal treasury furnishes no basis to argue that a federal agency practices are unconstitutional.the court has allowed some establishment clause challenges to federal spending to go forward,but this is a narrow exception,not the rule.the court has declined to extend this exception to other areas.see,daimlerchrysler.at bowen kendrick,d although we have considered the problem of standing and article iii limitations on federal jurisdiction many times since flast,we have consistently adhered to flast and the narrow exception it created to the general rule against taxpayer standing flast cohen,d creating an exception for establishment clause challenges to the general standing bar for taxpayer suits.
in sum,we hold that these state taxpayers have no standing under article iii to challenge hawaii state tax or spending decision simply by virtue of their status as taxpayers.daimlerchrysler.at.although it appears to us that there are no plaintiffs who have standing to challenge the oha funding,we are unwilling to make that final judgment on this record before us.accordingly,we remand to the district court for further proceedings.
the united states as an indispensable party 
oha argues that even if plaintiffs have taxpayer standing,under carroll the united states is also an indispensable party to any equal protection challenge to its programs.the district court rejected the argument on the ground that and oha have distinct origins.in contrast to,n othing in the admission act requires the creation of oha or governs oha actions.arakaki iv,d at.
the district court is correct with respect to oha expenditure of tax revenue.oha was created nearly twenty years after hawaii admission to the union.in,hawaii amended its constitution to add sections and oha and defining its article xii.see haw.constt.art.xii.the constitution does not provide for oha funding,which is provided by statute.see,haw.stat.a pro rata portion of all funds derived from the public land trust shall be funded in an amount to be determined by the legislature,twenty per cent of all funds derived from the public land trust shall be expended by oha.unlike the lease eligibility requirement imposed by the hhca and administered by,the united states has no right to consent or withhold consent to the creation of oha or its administration of programs for native hawaiians or hawaiians.because plaintiffs can prevail against oha without holding section of the admissions act unconstitutional,nothing requires the participation of the united states.carroll,at.we decline to extend carroll to claims against oha concerning tax revenue.
plaintiffs trust beneficiary standing 
plaintiffs allege,as an independent basis for standing,that as trust beneficiaries they may sue oha because oha receives trust revenues.although the united states is not an indispensable party to a challenge to the appropriation of tax revenue,see part,supra,this is not true with respect to oha receipt of trust revenue.we have previously held that the expenditure of trust revenue is governed by the admission act.price akaka,cir.any challenge to the expenditure of trust revenue brought by alleged trust beneficiaries must challenge the substantive terms of the trust,which are found in the admission act.for the reasons we explained in part,supra,the united states is an indispensable party to any challenge to the admission act.accordingly,although the united states is not an indispensable party with respect to challenges to oha expenditure of tax revenue,it remains indispensable with respect to challenges to the expenditure of trust revenue.
