in a dispute involving a restaurant share of social security taxes on its employees tip income,we explore the outer bounds of the irs power to make tax assessments.
like most restaurants,fior employs waiters,table bussers,bartenders and others whose earnings come in part from tips left by customers.although these tips are paid by customers directly to employees,federal law deems them to have been paid by the employer for purposes of fica taxes.see,a q.this puts employers in an awkward position they are deemed,for purposes of tax law,to have paid large sums of money that they have never touched and whose exact amounts they have no way of ascertaining.see q yet employers need to know how much tip income employees receive in order to calculate their own fica taxes and withhold appropriate amounts from the wage portion of the employees compensation,pursuant to.
to make this information known to employers,tipped employees must submit monthly statements usually on form reporting all tip earnings that qualify as wages under the statute.see a reg.a.employers,in turn,must report to the government on form their gross sales,charged tips and the tip amounts reported by employees.see c.
the dispute before us arose because in and,fior reported aggregate tips that were significantly less than the tips that appeared on its credit card charge slips the internal revenue service assessed fior for additional fica taxes on what it deemed was unreported tip income for those years.to determine what fior owed,the irs used a simple calculation for each year,it divided total tips charged on credit cards by total credit card receipts,yielding an average tip rate of and for and,respectively.it then applied this tip rate to the restaurant gross receipts to get a presumed tip total for the year.the irs assessed fior additional fica taxes based on the difference between its presumed total and the amount of tips fior employees had reported the irs did not readjust the fica or income tax liability of the various employees who may have understated tip income on their forms.
fior challenged the assessment method in district court,arguing that it exceeded the irs authority.the district court agreed,fior,united states,d,and the government appeals.
because we must decide whether the irs assessment is valid,we begin by examining what exactly the irs is assessing.section imposes on every employer a tax equal to a percentage of the wages paid by him with respect to employment.a.these wages are defined to include tips received by an employee in the course of his employment.q.but congress did not treat all tips as taxable wages for this purpose.in section a,it excluded all remuneration from the employer salary plus tips that exceeds the social security wage base for that year in section a b,it excluded all cash tips received by an employee if that amount was less than in a given month.these latter two provisions are often described as defining the wages band outside of which tip income is not taxed.see bubble room,united states,bubble room ii.for the irs aggregate assessment method to precisely equal the tips on which the employer fica tax is calculated,the cash tipping rate must be exactly the same as the tipping rate on charge slips,and total tips received must be distributed among employees so that none falls outside the wages band.
neither condition will hold true in most cases.first,experience shows that charged tips generally exceed cash tips.see yukimura commissioner,cch,wl.one can think of many reasons why this would be so.spending credit is easier than spending cash,because actual payment is deferred.also,people dining on expense accounts generally pay with credit cards,and spending someone else credit is even easier than spending one own.then there is the convenience of being able to write a tip in precisely the amount one deems appropriate.people paying in cash,however generous they may feel,are limited by the amount actually in their wallets and the need to keep some cash until their next visit to gringott.applying the charged tip rate to cash receipts will thus tend to overestimate the cash tips actually paid.and charged tips paid to employees may be less than appears on the credit card receipts,because some employers pass on the three percent fee assessed by the credit card companies.see bubble room,united states,fed.cl,bubble room i,rev,bubble room ii.
the assumption that all tip income falls within the wages band is even more problematic because fior employees,like those of many other restaurants,engage in tip sharing.waiters receive tips from the customers and then share them with table bussers,bartenders and other employees.much like tips left by the customer,the exact amount shared with others depends on the waiter generosity and his evaluation of how much other employees contributed to customer satisfaction.looking only at the aggregate tips collected,we can not tell how many table bussers made less than in indirect tips per month for some or all of the periods in question nor is there any way of knowing how many waiters and hosts received salaries plus tips exceeding the social security wage we can not rule out for an upscale restaurant like fior.
while an employer may be aware that reported tips are less than actual charged tips,it can not be sure that employees are understating tips in their forms.some or all of the discrepancy could be explained by the fact that employees are not required to report tips falling outside the wages band.even if the employer suspects that some employees are understating their tip income,it has no way of knowing who is underreporting or by how much.restaurants can not force waiters to divulge how much they have actually received in tips,and how those amounts were shared with other employees.nor are employees likely to volunteer such information,because they would be admitting that they committed tax fraud by understating their tip income on the irs form they submitted to the employer.
the irs is unimpressed.it believes itself empowered to use any rational method for assessing the tax the difficulties the employer raises can be considered in determining the precise amount of tax actually owed.if the assessment is valid,the burden shifts to the taxpayer to prove the amount if any by which the assessment overstates the tax owed.the question remains whether the assessment is valid.
the irs authority to make assessments is a very powerful tool.by making a valid assessment,the irs shifts to the taxpayer the burden of proving that it does not owe the amount of tax the irs has assessed it.if the taxpayer can not persuade a trier of fact that the amount assessed is incorrect,the irs wins and the taxpayer is required to pay that amount.see palmer irs,cir.so long as the assessment is supported by a minimal factual foundation,the irs need not present any additional evidence the risk of uncertainty falls on the taxpayer.id.
in the income tax context,an assessment becomes even more powerful when coupled with the irs authority pursuant to to redefine the manner in which the taxpayer computes income.section has been interpreted as giving the irs authority to make an assessment based on an estimate rather than a computation.see mcquatters commissioner,cch,wl.this means that,in making the assessment,the irs need not rely on the actual records kept by the taxpayer.where such records are inadequate,the irs may make an educated guess as to how much tax is owed,and then put the burden on the taxpayer to prove it wrong.
mcquatters also involved tip income but,unlike our case,it involved the income taxes of the employees who had actually received the income.see also mendelson commissioner,cir.the tipped employees had failed to maintain adequate records of the tips they had received,and the courts held that the irs was authorized to use an estimate in making its assessment.because the employees should have maintained records of their income but failed to do so,it was deemed entirely appropriate to put the burden on them to prove that the irs estimate overstated their taxable income.see id.at obviously,where a taxpayer keeps no records disclosing his income,no method can be devised which will produce an exact result.the law does not require that much.mcquatters,cch at in the absence of adequate record keeping by petitioners,the irs was justified in reconstructing their tip income by an indirect method.
the taxpayer in our case is in a very different position from the taxpayers in mcquatters and mendelson.while each employee knows how much he receives in tips,the restaurant does not.employees,moreover,have an obligation to maintain records of their tip income and to accurately report such income to their employer on a monthly basis.the restaurant has no obligation to maintain records of tip income,except to the extent its employees report on form.unlike the taxpayers in mcquatters and mendelson,then,the taxpayer in our case did not fail to satisfy a legal duty imposed on it by the internal revenue code,and thus did not give the irs just cause for resorting to an estimate in constructing its assessment.
also,unlike the taxpayers in mcquatters and mendelson,fior is not in an inherently better position than the irs to determine what its employees actually earned in tips.quite the contrary fior lacks the irs power to audit its employees and has no other means of forcing its employees to divulge how much tip income they earned during a given year forcing the restaurant to prove that the estimate is wrong puts an impossible burden on it,making the already heavy presumption that attaches to an irs assessment virtually conclusive.
we find this particularly troubling because the irs estimate has some serious flaws.as discussed above,the irs method for estimating cash tips likely overstates the amount of such tips received.see supra.as to credit card tips,the irs method fails to take into account the three percent fee imposed by the credit card companies which may be passed on to employees by the restaurant.nor does the estimate make allowance for the statutory wages bands which limit the restaurant fica tax liability.
we ca ignore these inaccuracies on the theory that they will cancel each other out in the long run they all overstate the base on which the fica tax is calculated and thus will combine to overstate the amount the taxpayer owes.as judge plager noted in his dissent in bubble room ii,t hough it may be that the excess taxes assessed in this manner against the employer amount to a relatively small amount,a government demand for taxes that are not owed is unlawful on its face and remains unlawful regardless of the amount at issue.at plager,dissenting.
we have held that the irs power to rely on estimates in making its assessment is not without bounds rather,the irs must use a rational method for approximating the correct amount.palmer,at.where more accurate information does not exist because the taxpayer failed to maintain adequate records,or where the taxpayer has much better access to the information in question,we will generally defer to the irs decision as to what is a rational method for approximating the amount of tax due.but a case where the taxpayer has done everything the law requires of it,where the irs access to the relevant information is no worse and probably much better than the taxpayer,and where the estimation method adopted by the government ignores the statutory limits on what is taxable,sorely tests the limits of that deference.
fortunately,we need not decide whether the irs has stretched deference to the breaking point because its assessment suffers from a more fundamental flaw it rests on an estimate in circumstances where congress has not authorized the irs to use estimation as an assessment method.mcquatters and similar cases relied on,which as already discussed gives the irs broad authority to use estimates in making income tax assessments.but the irs can not rely on section as authority for the assessment here because the section does not apply to the collection of fica taxes.
while acknowledging that section is inapplicable,the federal circuit found it informative in concluding that the irs is authorized to construct its assessment by means of estimation.bubble room ii,at.like judge plager,we fail to understand exactly how that section is informative with regard to the specific issue before us.id.at plager,dissenting.to the extent section has any bearing at all,it suggests that the irs here was not authorized to proceed by estimation.congress obviously knew how to give the irs the authority to use estimation in lieu of actual calculations,and just as clearly thought it necessary to say so explicitly when it wished to confer that power.unlike our colleagues in the bubble room ii majority,we do not believe such an important and sweeping power can be derived from the penumbras and emanations of the internal revenue code.
the irs points to another source of authority for its assessment,namely q.this section provides that an employer is liable for its portion of fica taxes even when no statement including such tips is furnished or the statement so furnished was inaccurate or incomplete.but this section does help the government.all it says is that,where employees have not provided accurate tip information to the employer,and the irs finds some other means of determining how much the employer owes,the employer must pay its share.nothing in the text of section q speaks to the method the irs may use in making its assessment.in fact,section q is worded so differently from section that we can not conclude they were meant to do the same work.
the irs points to the fact that section q allows it to assess the employer even after the time for assessing the employee has passed.see rul,q a according to the irs,this implicitly authorizes the use of estimates.the chain of reasoning goes something like this if the irs is allowed to assess the employer when it may no longer audit the employees,it will have no way to conduct the assessment except by estimation.congress therefore must have contemplated that the irs would proceed by estimation in making the assessments.
we do not see this as a necessary implication.rather,we read section q as saying that the irs need not also conduct an audit of the employer while it is auditing the records of individual employees.congress doubtless understood that the only way the irs can determine fica taxes on tips is by examining the employees records there no point in auditing the restaurant at the same time because it will have no record of tips,other than the information provided by the employees in their and forms.but,if the normal limitations period applied,the irs might have to assess the employer before it finished auditing the employees.section q solves this problem by keeping the period open means for however long it takes to complete the audit of the restaurant tipped employees 
this does not mean that the irs may assess the employer only if it also assesses each of its employees.three other circuits have rejected this argument and,for reasons well expressed in those opinions,we reject it as well.see west hubbard restaurant united states,cir bubble room ii,at morrison restaurants,united states,cir.as the government correctly points out,the employer portion of fica is separate from the employee,and the irs need not collect the one as a condition for collecting the other.having audited an employee and determined the precise amount of fica wages the employee has received,the irs may then choose to assess only the employer,only the employee,or both.if the irs can not or will not assess the employee for additional fica tax,this will not jeopardize its right to assess the employer 
that having been said,it does not follow that the irs can dispense with auditing the employees records or otherwise determining the amount each employee earned in tips.for the reasons explained,there is no way to determine the employer fica tax liability without making an determination of the taxable tips each has earned.an aggregate assessment based on inaccurate estimates,as used by the irs in this case,is simply not authorized 
while recognizing that q does not fully address the question at issue here,the federal circuit nevertheless found that the section would seem to imply that an indirect method may be used to calculate the amount of employer fica tax in the absence of any better evidence.bubble room ii,at the federal circuit derived this implication as follows section q comes into play only where no statement including such tips was so furnished or to the extent that the statement so furnished was inaccurate or incomplete.q.because the section applies where the employer records are inadequate,the federal circuit reasoned,congress must have known that the irs would have no choice but to use an aggregate estimation method.see bubble room ii,at.
respectfully,we disagree with our colleagues.if the employer records are inadequate,it is because its employees have failed to report all their tips.the direct and obvious way of determining the taxable tips actually received is for the irs to audit the employees.proceeding by aggregate estimate,and thereby forcing the employer to pay the price for its employees dereliction,is simply not the only nor even the best way the irs may proceed.we therefore can not agree that congress must have had this in mind when it passed section q.
we are aware that auditing individual employees is much more cumbersome than slapping the employer with assessments based on aggregate estimates.the fact remains that congress authorized the irs to use estimates in collecting income taxes but withheld such authority in collecting fica taxes.by using an particularly one that ignores the statutory wages putting on the employer an impossible burden in rebutting the estimated amount,the irs has effectively increased the tax payable by the employer above that provided in the internal revenue code 
nor is the irs without recourse.if auditing individual employees proves too cumbersome,it can seek to have congress extend its section authority to the collection of fica taxes.or,it may proceed by regulation.a speaks to this situation 
if less than the correct amount of tax imposed by section,or is paid with respect to any payment of wages or compensation,proper adjustments,with respect to both the tax and the amount to be deducted,shall be made,without interest,in such manner and at such times as the secretary may by regulations prescribe.
id.emphasis added.this provision seems to authorize the secretary to give the irs authority to make assessments based on aggregate estimates by promulgating a regulation to that effect.but,before imposing such rough justice,the secretary must follow the procedural requirements of rulemaking.
these are not idle steps.the rulemaking process,by its very design,encourages public scrutiny of an agency proposed course of action.by giving notice of a proposed rule,the agency provides interested parties with the opportunity to express their views and bring their political influence to bear on the process.see kenneth culp davis richard pierce,administrative law treatise,ed noting that rulemaking enhances the political accountability of agency policy decisions adopted through the rulemaking process bernard schwartz,administrative law,ed.rulemaking provides the agency with a forum for soliciting the informed views of those affected in industry and labor before adopting a new policy.
the political process plays a particularly significant role in the arena of tax policy.congress has delegated to the secretary broad regulatory powers to adjust the legal obligations of taxpayers.see,a.but before the secretary can give a regulation legal force,he must endure the scrutiny of interested groups,legislative critics and the public at large.congress maintains a particularly vigilant oversight through the joint committee on taxation,whose large staff monitors and reports on the collection activities of the department of the treasury.see.
indeed,congress has blocked at least one of the irs recent efforts to enhance the collection of fica taxes on cash tips.in,the irs promulgated a regulation that constrained restaurants ability to take advantage of a fica tax credit by limiting the credit to the amount of tip income received and reported by the employee as opposed to the amount of fica taxes paid by the restaurant.see reg.the purpose of the regulation was to give employers an incentive for encouraging employees to report their tips.see,fior,d at quoting letter from leslie samuels,assistant secretary of the treasury,to senator trent lott.responding to industry complaints,congress rejected this incentive scheme in and provided that the tax credit would be available without regard to whether such tips are reported under section.b a.
this episode demonstrates the difficulty the executive and the legislative branches have had in reaching common ground on the problem of collecting taxes on employee tips.this should surprise no one,given both the substantial amount of revenue involved and the serious administrative difficulties in determining the amounts employees receive in tips.in the wake of political setbacks,the irs has tried to solve the problem by assessing restaurants based only on the rough,and somewhat inflated,estimates that we have seen in this case.but before it can take such a significant step,it must obtain authorization directly from congress or by exercising treasury own regulatory authority.either path involves significant political checks on agency discretion,and we decline to assist the irs in avoiding the public scrutiny such a process would entail.
the issue in this case is the authority of the internal revenue service to use the aggregate method of assessment for the employer share of social security taxes on unreported tip income.the separate issue of the accuracy of the assessment is not before us and the two and neither be confused nor mixed and matched.in affirming the district court rejection of the aggregate approach,the majority creates a circuit split on a tax issue of national importance.unlike quidditch or fizzing whizbees,there is nothing magical about the irs employer owes taxes on the unreported tip income and the irs has simply devised a practical means of calculating the tip income.in view of our respect for the decisions of sister circuits in tax cases,our deference to the irs in interpreting the tax code,and the logic and practicality of the aggregate method,i respectfully dissent.
a.other circuits.
the question of whether the irs is authorized to assess the employer share of federal insurance contribution act fica taxes,commonly known as social security taxes,based on the aggregate method without first determining the amount of by individual employees is one of first impression in this circuit.three other circuits,however,have already addressed this issue,and all three have held that the tax code code authorizes the irs to do so.see west hubbard restaurant united states,cir bubble room,united states,bubble room ii morrison restaurants,united states,cir see also lir mgmt.united states,d,quietwater entm t,united states,d,rev in part,vacated in part without,cir.
the majority position places the ninth circuit directly at odds with our sister circuits,which is of particular concern in this case,as u niformity among circuits is especially important to ensure equal and certain administration of the tax system.hill comm r,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.until now,we have hesitate d to reject the view of another circuit in this area.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
three years ago the eleventh circuit was the first circuit to address the question before us.in morrison restaurants,the employer sought a refund and abatement of fica taxes assessed on unreported employee tips.at.the employer argued that the irs does not have the authority under q to assess its share of fica taxes on unreported tips on an aggregate basis without first determining the by individual employees and crediting their wage history accounts.id.at.this is precisely the position advocated by fior.the eleventh circuit rejected this argument,noting that q 
clearly states than an employer can be assessed for its share of fica taxes on employee tips even if the employee fails to report all tips.it also suggests that the employer can be assessed its share of fica taxes even when the individual employee share is not determined.
id.emphasis added.the court concluded 
w e are unconvinced that congress silence can be construed to mean that an employer can not be assessed its share of fica taxes based on employees unreported tips in the aggregate without determining the underreporting by the individual employees and crediting the individual employees wage history accounts.
id.at.the eleventh circuit deferred to the irs use of the aggregate method because its interpretation of the code was reasonable.id.at.
the next year,in bubble room ii,at,the federal circuit similarly addressed whether the irs has the authority to assess the employer share of fica taxes on unreported tips on an aggregate basis without first determining the by the individual employees and then crediting their social security wage earnings records.the court concluded that the statutes authorize the irs to do so 
q expressly contemplates that the employer may be liable for its share of fica taxes even if the records supplied by the employee are missing,inaccurate,or incomplete.although not conclusive,q would thus seem to imply that an indirect method may be used to calculate the amount of employer fica tax in the absence of any better evidence.
however,q does not fully address the question at issue the particular indirect formula used by the irs to estimate the employer fica tax liability was illegal.speaks to this question.under,the irs is authorized and required to make the inquiries,determinations,and assessments necessary for all taxes imposed by the code,which have not been duly paid in the manner provided by law.implicitly authorizes the irs to use an indirect formula in order to carry out the general power granted in.for example,the irs would have to use an indirect formula to estimate the amount of fica tax owed by an employer when there is no other way to determine and assess the wages deemed to have been paid by the employer.
id.at.the federal circuit concluded that the statutes authorize the irs to use the aggregate method without first determining the individual employees tip income.see id.at.
most recently,in west hubbard restaurant,the seventh circuit addressed the issue and similarly concluded that the statutes authorize the irs to assess the employer share of fica taxes based on the aggregate method without first determining the amount of by individual employees.the seventh circuit was unequivocal 
we conclude that the employer has failed to demonstrate that the irs aggregate method of collecting employer fica taxes is an impermissible reading of the tax code.accordingly,we uphold the irs interpretation of its authority to use the aggregate method of collecting fica taxes.
every circuit court that has addressed the aggregate assessment issue has come to the opposite conclusion from the majority.the majority attempt to avoid the weight of circuit authority by suggesting that its position is somehow in line with that of west hubbard restaurant and morrison restaurants is transparently unsuccessful.see op.at our holding is entirely consistent with those of the seventh and eleventh circuits.as noted above,both the seventh and eleventh circuits held that the irs has the authority to use the aggregate method with respect to unreported tip income without determining the by individual employees and crediting their wage history accounts.see west hubbard restaurant,at,morrison restaurants,at.although the majority agrees that the irs need not assess the employees in order to assess the employer,the majority concludes that the irs may not rely on the aggregate method and must audit the employees.see op.at.requiring an audit is simply another way of saying that the irs can not estimate and that the only way the irs can assess taxes on unreported or tips is to undertake an individual accounting of employees.this view can hardly be viewed as entirely consistent with that of the seventh and eleventh circuits.the irs authority to use the aggregate method was at the heart of the cases in those circuits.the majority recharacterization can only pretend consistency with these cases.
b.the irs interpretation is reasonable.
the supreme court has instructed that we must defer to an agency interpretation of its statutes and that our review is restricted to determining whether that interpretation is reasonable.see chevron natural resources def.council,d i f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.united states bank of commerce,d the irs understanding of the terms of the code is entitled to considerable deference.bob jones united states,d this court has long recognized the primary authority of the irs in construing the internal revenue code.we have likewise limited our review of irs interpretations of the code.see walthall united states,cir concluding that where the irs interpretation is reasonable,w e must show the irs interpretation substantial deference durando united states,cir courts give deference to irs rulings and interpretations of the code.hawkins united states,cir recognizing the rule that an agency interpretation of a statute is entitled to deference unless it contradicts the statute plain meaning.
in reviewing the irs interpretation of the code,we need not find that the agency construction is the only one it permissibly could have adopted to uphold the construction,or even the reading that we would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding.chevron,at.accord walthall,at concluding that although t he statute is not susceptible only to the taxpayers interpretation the irs interpretation is reasonable and w e must therefore show the irs interpretation substantial deference.moreover,we owe deference to the irs interpretation of the code even absent a formal irs rule.see alexander glickman,cir we owe deference to the agency interpretation of the statute even absent a formal agency rule interpreting the statute.
the irs interpretation of the statutes at issue is,its conclusion that the statutes permit it to use the aggregate reasonable in light of the statutory language.nothing in the statutes or regulations requires the irs to determine the amount of unreported tips before assessing the employer fica tax liability,and nothing in the statutes or regulations prohibits the irs from using the aggregate method.rather,the irs use of the aggregate method is entirely consistent with the statutes and regulations and therefore is entitled to substantial deference.a brief review of the relevant code sections reveals that the code does not require or bar any method,but leaves selection of the method to the agency.
section imposes a fica tax on employers that is computed as a percentage of wages paid by the employer to its employees.wages includes all tips received by employees except those that amount to less than in any calendar month.a b,q a.section q requires employers to pay the taxes on the total amount of tips and other remuneration,up to the social security wage base.see a.as the federal circuit recognized,
i n the case of the employee fica tax,the employer need only consider those tips that are included in a written statement furnished by the employee to the employer pursuant to section a.unlike the employee fica tax,however,there is no parallel provision which limits the employer fica tax liability to tips that are included in the written statement furnished by the employee.
bubble room ii,at quoting c emphasis added.
although the statutes do not directly address whether the irs has the authority to make aggregate assessments with respect to unreported tips,see op.at,they are certainly broad enough to permit the irs to do so.in fact,it is precisely the statutes silence that requires chevron deference.see chevron,at.in particular,q provides that,even in cases where employees do not provide the employer with tip statements under a or where the statements are inaccurate or incomplete,the irs may issue a notice and demand for employer fica taxes.see q.the statut
