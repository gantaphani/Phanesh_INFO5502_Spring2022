when an ordinary taxpayer receives a refund for an overpayment of taxes,interest is applied to the overpayment amount at a rate equaling the federal rate fstr plus three percentage points.a b.if the taxpayer is a corporation,however,it is entitled only to a lower interest rate the fstr plus two percentage points on the first for each taxable period,and the fstr plus half a percentage point on the remainder.a.plaintiff appellant maimonides medical center mmc and the government agree that mmc is entitled to an overpayment refund and further agree on the amount of that overpayment,but disagree on the interest rate to be applied.mmc argues that,despite being organized as a corporation under new york law,it should receive the benefit of the higher interest rate applicable to,because it is a nonprofit corporation and the word corporation in a should be construed to refer only to corporations.we disagree,and hold that a lower interest rate applies equally to corporations and nonprofit corporations such as mmc.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
mmc,a teaching hospital located in brooklyn,is organized as a domestic corporation under new york law.pursuant to a of the internal revenue code,it is exempt from federal income tax as a c orporation organized and operated exclusively for religious,charitable,scientific,testing for public safety,literary,or educational purposes.c.it is not exempt,however,from paying taxes under the federal insurance contributions act fica,et,which requires employers and employees to pay a tax on wages from employment,a,b,the proceeds of which fund social security and medicare.
services performed by a student who is enrolled and regularly attending classes at a school,college,or university are excluded from fica definition of employment.b.for several years,teaching hospitals and the internal revenue service irs clashed over whether services performed by medical residents fell under that exclusion.eventually,the irs promulgated a regulation providing that,effective april,employee s whose normal work schedule is hours or more per week a category that includes medical residents are not within the student exclusion.reg.b d iii.mmc,which had been paying fica taxes on its residents wages since at least,then brought this action in the eastern district of new york,seeking a refund of the fica taxes that it had paid before the effective date of the regulation.in,the irs agreed that fica taxes paid on residents wages for tax periods before april,were refundable,see irs news release ir,and the parties agreed to discontinue this action.
on october,however,the case was reopened.the remaining point of contention between the parties is the interest rate to be applied to mmc refund.the government seeks to apply the lower interest rate which a provides for overpayments by corporations,whereas mmc argues that that interest rate does not apply to nonprofit organizations that happen to be organized as corporations under state law,and thus that it is entitled to the higher standard interest rate.the parties for summary judgment,and the district court vitaliano,granted the government motion and denied mmc.mmc timely appealed.
discussion 
the parties disagreement centers on the meaning of the word corporation in a,which specifies the interest rate to be applied to refunds for overpayments.as noted above,mmc concedes that it is a corporation both under new york law and for the purpose of obtaining an exemption from federal income tax under a c.it contends,however,that,as used in a,the word corporation does not include nonprofit corporations.for the following reasons,we disagree.
ordinary meaning of corporation 
we begin with the fact that the word corporation,standing alone,ordinarily refers to both and nonprofit entities without distinction.the dictionary definition of corporation is not restricted to entities that carry on activities for profit.see webster third new international dictionary defining corporation as an entity recognized by law as constituted by one or more persons and as having various rights and duties together with the capacity of succession,oxford english dictionary ed.online version defining corporation as an artificial person created by royal charter,prescription,or act of the legislature,and having authority to preserve certain rights in perpetual succession.the famous definition given by chief justice marshall in trustees of dartmouth college woodward is to the same effect a corporation is an artificial being,invisible,intangible,and existing only in contemplation of law.being the mere creature of law,it possesses only those properties which the charter of its creation confers upon it,either expressly,or as incidental to its very existence.wheat.a motive does not appear on the list of distinguishing characteristics of a corporation given in one leading treatise.see william meade fletcher,cyclopedia of the law of corporations listing those characteristics as follows a corporation is an artificial person,a legal entity,capable of acting through its corporate officers and agents,of suing and being sued,of taking and holding property,of contracting in its own name,and of continuing to exist independently of the individuals who compose it footnotes omitted 
mmc argues for a different starting point.it contends that,in ordinary,everyday usage,the word corporation refers only to entities,as in the assertion that corporations are a force for good in the world.that argument is unpersuasive.while it is true that,in the context of a bar or political discussion,corporation may refer exclusively to business entities,that is not,as we have seen,the ordinary,everyday definition supplied in the dictionary.further,in the colloquial sense advocated by mmc,corporation typically refers to any legal entity,regardless of form,and includes entities like partnerships,which are not treated as corporations by the internal revenue code.see a defining partnership as an unincorporated organization which is not,within the meaning of this title,a corporation.while such loose use of the word corporation may be appropriate in the context of a casual debate about the role of the profit motive in contemporary society,it can not be the meaning that controls in the internal revenue code.
ii.definitional provision 
next,we turn to a of the internal revenue code,which provides definitions for certain words that apply throughout the code,where not otherwise distinctly expressed or manifestly incompatible with the intent thereof.the provision relating to the word corporation has not changed since.it reads the term corporation includes associations,companies,and insurance companies.a.
as we have recognized,that language is not technically a definition it does not specif y the characteristics of the entity that it defines.mcnamee dep t of treasury,f d,cir alteration omitted.it does,however,serve to expand the federal tax law meaning of corporation beyond entities that would ordinarily fall under that term it offers no hint that congress intended to contract the ordinary meaning of the term in any way.the statutory definition thus strongly suggests that,at a minimum,all entities covered by the core definition of corporation are also included.section a does not provide that core definition itself,but because the ordinary meaning of corporation includes nonprofit entities that take the corporate form,the same should be true of the core term as used in a.that core definition most plausibly encompasses any entity upon which state law has conferred the rights and duties characteristic of a corporation as defined in the sources quoted above.judicial opinions have generally adopted that reading of a.see united states,cir holding that a corporation created under state law is a corporation within the meaning of a united states empey,cir noting the long followed administrative practice of treating a corporation organized and chartered under state law as a corporation for federal income tax purposes,which congress tacitly approved by repeatedly reenacting a definition of corporation 
several other code provisions use the word corporation in a manner that plainly includes incorporated nonprofit organizations,bolstering our conclusion that the code generally applicable definition of corporation under a is not limited to entities.for example,under a c,c orporations organized and operated exclusively for charitable purposes are exempt from federal income tax.if the word corporation referred only to entities,that provision would be.similarly,a a specifies that the rules governing the tax treatment of cooperatives apply to,inter alia,any corporation operating on a cooperative basis other than an organization which is exempt from tax under this chapter.the for organizations would not have been necessary if they were already excluded from the definition of corporation.the same is true of the in b,which deals with affiliated groups of corporations,and defines includible corporation to include any corporation except,inter alia,c orporations exempt from taxation under section.because we must give effect to every word of a statute wherever possible,leocal ashcroft,we can not easily write off these last two provisions as instances of overcautious drafting,as mmc urges.
iii.textual analysis of 
as noted above,a definition of corporation applies throughout the code,where not otherwise distinctly expressed or manifestly incompatible with the intent thereof.having concluded that that definition includes nonprofit corporations such as mmc,we must next determine whether distinctly expresse s a different definition,or whether applying a definition in the context of a is manifestly incompatible with the intent of the code.in that respect,mmc argument focuses on the relationship between a,the overpayment provision,and a c,which set the interest rate to be applied to underpayments of taxes.the relevant provisions are set out below 
a general rule.
overpayment rate.the overpayment rate established under this section shall be the sum of 
a the federal rate plus 
b percentage points percentage points in the case of a corporation.
to the extent that an overpayment of tax by a corporation for any taxable period as defined in subsection c,applied by substituting overpayment for underpayment exceeds,subparagraph b shall be applied by substituting percentage point for percentage points.
underpayment rate.the underpayment rate established under this section shall be the sum of 
a the federal rate plus 
b percentage points.
c increase in underpayment rate for large corporate underpayments.
in general.for purposes of determining the amount of interest payable under section on any large corporate underpayment for periods after the applicable date,paragraph of subsection a shall be applied by substituting percentage points for percentage points.
large corporate underpayment.for purposes of this subsection 
a in general.the term large corporate underpayment means any underpayment of a tax by a c corporation for any taxable period if the amount of such underpayment for such period exceeds.
b taxable period.for purposes of subparagraph a,the term taxable period means 
i in the case of any tax imposed by subtitle a,the taxable year,or 
ii in the case of any other tax,the period to which the underpayment relates.
like the overpayment provisions,the underpayment provisions apply a less favorable interest rate to tax payment errors by corporations above a certain dollar amount.in the underpayment context,however,the less favorable interest rate explicitly applies only to c corporations,because,under subsection c,it applies to any large corporate underpayment,which subsection c defines as an underpayment by a c corporation in excess of.mmc contends that the limitation to c corporations also applies in the overpayment context,and that,since it is not a c corporation it should receive the more favorable standard interest rate on its overpayment refund.the textual basis for mmc claim is the to subsection c in the flush language of subsection a that is,the sentence beginning with to the extent,which has the effect of reducing the interest rate on overpayments by corporations above from the ftsr plus two percentage points to the ftsr plus half a percentage point.the flush language refers to an overpayment of tax by a corporation for any taxable period as defined in subsection c,applied by substituting overpayment for underpayment.according to mmc,the words as defined in subsection c have the effect of adding the qualifier c to every instance of the word corporation in the overpayment provisions.
unfortunately for mmc,that argument does not withstand close scrutiny.the phrase as defined in subsection c presupposes a term to be defined.that term,reading the sentence most naturally,is the term immediately preceding the as defined parenthetical namely,taxable period.as it turns out,taxable period is defined in subsection c,and the only other term explicitly defined in that subsection large corporate underpayment does not appear anywhere in subsection a.further,using taxable period as the term to be defined gives meaning to the rest of the as defined parenthetical,because subsection c definition of taxable period includes the word underpayment,for which the word overpayment can be substituted as the parenthetical directs without doing any damage to the coherence of the statute.
mmc argues that this reading of a is untenable,because the parenthetical refers to subsection c,rather than to subsection c b,which is more specifically where the definition of taxable period is located.it emphasizes that the reference to subsection c survived a technical amendment to the as defined parenthetical itself according to mmc,this shows that congress intended to refer to the entirety of subsection c,rather than to subsection c b in particular.that argument is unavailing.the imprecision mmc complains of pervades the internal revenue code.see,k a referring to a qualified nonprofit organization as defined in subsection h,even though qualified nonprofit organization is in fact defined in subsection h c f a referring to a qualified housing issue as defined in subsection d,even though qualified housing issue is defined in subsection d b ii.further,because the as defined parenthetical unambiguously modifies only the term taxable period,for the reasons we explain below,there was no need for congress in to add a specific reference to subsection c b.
mmc proposed readings of a wreak havoc on the statutory language.first,the as defined parenthetical could conceivably be read as modifying the entire phrase that precedes it an overpayment of tax by a corporation for any taxable period.because subsection c defines large corporate underpayment,this reading has some superficial plausibility.upon closer inspection,however,it renders the statute incoherent.if an overpayment of tax by a corporation for any taxable period means the same thing as a large corporate underpayment substituting overpayment for underpayment,then,under subsection c a,it must exceed.but subsection a flush language only applies t o the extent that the overpayment exceeds.thus,if the parenthetical imported subsection c definition of large corporate underpayment,the flush language would in effect have to be read as applying only to the extent that an overpayment exceeding exceeds a nonsensical result which can not be what congress intended.
in its reply brief,mmc concedes as much,and suggests that the parenthetical more narrowly modifies only the phrase by a corporation for any taxable period.elsewhere,mmc states that the word corporation is the term in the flush language to be defined.we understand mmc to be arguing that the parenthetical modifies two terms corporation and taxable period.see reply br.recognizing that the flush language makes a cross reference to the definition of taxable period.
that reading,however,fares no better than the previous one.first,the parenthetical is most naturally read as modifying only the term that immediately precedes it,rather than that term and an additional term found a few words earlier in the same sentence.there is no reason why the parenthetical should modify taxable period and corporation,but not other terms in the flush language,such as overpaymen
