background 
in,agency retained a private consultant to audit county property tax assessment and allocation procedures the audit discovered county had failed to assign the proper tax rate code to certain parcels within the redevelopment project,which resulted in agency not receiving tax increment revenue to which it was entitled for and the previous four years tax year through tax year.those funds were instead divided up among other entities in the area.when agency brought these errors to county attention,county made the appropriate corrections to the current assessment roll.however,county refused to correct the miscoding retroactively and pay previously misallocated tax increment revenue that had been distributed to other entities.
in november,agency and the city of dinuba collectively,plaintiffs filed a formal tort claim with county for payment of the full amount of the tax increment funds agency had been entitled to for the previous four years.when county did not act on the claim,plaintiffs sued county,tulare county board of supervisors,tulare county assessor gregory hardcastle,and tulare county jimmy allen collectively,defendants.the petition and complaint,as amended,sought a writ of mandate compelling defendants to calculate and distribute the unpaid and underpaid tax increment funds for fiscal years through correct the tax rolls for all prior fiscal years in which defendants miscoded failed to properly code parcels and pay plaintiffs their respective shares of tax increment unlawfully withheld.plaintiffs also requested a declaration and determination that defendants were required to correct all previous fiscal year tax rolls in which defendants either failed to code or miscoded certain parcels and deprived plaintiffs of their respective share of tax increment revenue and calculate and pay to plaintiffs their respective share of tax increment funds as corrected.
defendants demurred to the petition and complaint on the grounds that the disputed tax revenue had already been distributed to other taxing agencies and defendants could not be required to either recover the funds or pay plaintiffs out of county general fund,and defendants were immune from liability under section,which states neither a public entity nor a public employee is liable for an injury caused by b an act or omission in the interpretation or application of any law relating to a tax.
in their opposition,plaintiffs argued that if the trial court were to grant the demurrer,petitioners should be granted leave to amend to put forth further causes of action supported by the allegations for constructive trust,breach of contract,and other causes of action.at the hearing on defendants motion,plaintiffs counsel discussed amending the complaint to add claims for breach of contract or the imposition of some type of equitable remedy,the constructive trust type theory.
the trial court sustained defendants demurrer on both grounds.the court ruled that plaintiffs had not stated a statutory basis to impose liability upon these public entities and their employees,stated a case on point to overcome the immunity afforded the public entities and their employees under government code section.however,the court granted leave to amend,noting that,because plaintiffs were not required to file a tort claim under section,subdivision i,the new theories for recovery were not barred.
rather than appeal the trial court ruling,plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint.the second amended complaint dropped the claim for a writ of mandate and instead asserted claims for imposition of a constructive trust and for money had and received against defendants and the nine taxing entities that had been mistakenly allocated a portion of the tax increment due to agency 
defendants again demurred.the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.the court stated no matter how plaintiffs attempt to plead this case,the facts are that the public entity and its officers have immunity under government code section for any act or omission in the interpretation or application of any law relating to a tax.plaintiffs have plead sic that the defendants miscoded the tax rate areas and collected taxes and failed to give them the proper credit for their fair share of the tax increment revenue.plaintiffs have attempted to allege causes of action for money had and received and for a constructive trust,but these fail as a matter of law c learly,the facts are that the defendants acts were either an interpretation or application of a law relating to a tax,and thus the defendants would have immunity for plaintiff injury.therefore,no further leave to amend is granted.judgment was entered dismissing defendants from the action with prejudice 
plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court,contending that their claims for relief are not encompassed by the act et.in reversing the trial court,the court of appeal concluded that plaintiffs claims do not arise from defendants breach of their statutory duty,but rather,are based on breach of a contractual duty.accordingly,defendants are not immune under government code section.we granted defendants petition for review.
