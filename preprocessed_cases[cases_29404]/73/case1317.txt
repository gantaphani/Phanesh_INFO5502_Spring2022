several cases over the last two decades have required this court to consider whether records and documents of the internal revenue service irs or the service are exempt from public disclosure under the freedom of information act foia.in this case,the district court determined that the irs legal memoranda lms and the office of chief counsel occ intradivisional technical assistance memoranda tas are exempt from disclosure pursuant to the deliberative process privilege encompassed in foia exemption,b.the district court further held that irs need not segregate and release agency working law from tas withheld pursuant to exemption attorney work product privilege.we affirm the district court judgment and adopt its reasoning and conclusions on these points.
the district court also ordered irs to release eight tas,finding the information not exempt from disclosure under foia exemption e,because the information did not concern investigations which focus directly on specifically alleged illegal acts,illegal acts of particular identified officials,acts which could,if proved,result in civil or criminal sanctions.tax analysts irs,d,hereinafter mem.op.ii.this was error.we therefore reverse and remand on this point so that the district court may reassess this material pursuant to the correct legal standard.
finally,the district court ruled that irs properly withheld five tas issued to program managers pursuant to exemption deliberative process privilege,but held that irs must release five other such tas.irs appeals the latter determination as to three of the five documents that were ordered released.after reviewing the tas in camera,we hold that the district court correctly distinguished between tas that are part of an internal discussion and tas that reflect occ considered legal conclusions.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court on these issues.
background 
tax analysts is a organization that publishes news and other material on taxation.in,tax analysts made a foia request for several categories of unpublished irs internal memoranda.in response,the service released certain documents but withheld others.tax analysts brought an action in the district court for the district of columbia.pursuant to intervening legislation and a partial settlement by the parties,most of the categories of memoranda were eventually released.the two categories still at issue are lms and certain of tas.
on the basis of a largely undisputed factual record,the district court described lms as follows 
lms are prepared by docket attorneys in the office of chief counsel to assist in the preparation and review of proposed revenue rulings.revenue rulings are official interpretations of the internal revenue code and other tax materials.before a proposed revenue ruling is published and achieves the status of precedent,it must pass through a review process that is not complete until the office of the assistant secretary tax policy at the department of treasury grants its final approval.as a proposed revenue ruling works its way through this process,it is accompanied by a publication package.sometimes,but not always,the publication package includes a lm.according to the chief counsel publications handbook,lms may include a restatement of the proposed revenue ruling issue and holding justification,arguments,and lines of research that are not reflected fully in the proposed revenue ruling and the principal arguments for reaching a contrary position.the lm serves as briefing material for the reviewers,providing a comprehensive summary of the drafter legal research as well as the drafter evaluation of the proposed ruling strengths and weaknesses.at various points in the approval process the publication package may be returned to the drafter for revisions.once approved by treasury,revenue rulings are published in the internal revenue bulletin for the information and guidance of taxpayers.there is no formal process,however,whereby the lm is conformed to reflect the final published revenue ruling.
after a proposed revenue ruling is definitively approved or rejected,the publication package is archived and can be retrieved by reference to the number of the proposed revenue ruling.the accompanying lm,if any,is archived with the rest of the publication package,but there is no indexing or retrieval system by which one can identify those files that contain an lm.irs attorneys sometimes keep copies of lms for their own reference,and may retrieve the revenue ruling file if they wish to probe the history behind a certain revenue ruling.attorneys may exchange lms informally,but they are not distributed through official channels.
tax analysts irs,d,hereinafter mem.op.i internal citations omitted.
as for tas,the district court offered the following description 
tas are prepared by the four technical divisions within the office of associate chief counsel domestic the office of assistant chief counsel passthroughs special industries,the office of assistant chief counsel income tax accounting,the office of assistant chief counsel corporate,and the office of assistant chief counsel financial institutions products.these technical divisions prepare tas in response to requests from many different offices for many different purposes.the irs has attempted to categorize the tas by requester.one such category,tas to the district or regional offices of the irs or office of chief counsel,or service centers the field were dismissed from the case in the context of the irs motion to dismiss.four categories remain tas to program managers in the national office,tas to component offices of the national office of chief counsel office tas,tas to specific taxpayers,and tas to federal and state government agencies.within each of these four categories,the tas can be further categorized by their purpose.for example,tas to program managers fall into eight different categories,and office tas fall into four different categories.
id.at internal citations omitted.
the district court reviewed sample documents in camera,along with a vaughn index prepared by irs.both parties moved for summary judgment.the court granted irs motion as to lms,which irs had claimed were exempt under foia exemption deliberative process privilege.id.at.the district court held that the withheld portions of lms did not constitute irs working law and were therefore exempt under the privilege.id.the district court reasoned that,like the background information notes in arthur andersen irs,lms were written by attorneys for use by senior decisionmakers.id.at.the district court found that lms are not officially approved by the senior decisionmakers and do not emanate from occ with any appearance of authority.id.at.
the district court distinguished lms from the general counsel memoranda at issue in taxation with representation fund irs,hereinafter twrf,which were used to promote uniformity in irs policy.mem.op.i at.the court found that,unlike general counsel memoranda,lms are not updated to reflect the national office current position,widely distributed within irs,or officially reconciled to reflect uniform policy.id.the district court also distinguished lms from the field service advice memoranda fsas at issue in tax analysts irs,because lms flow upward from staffers to reviewers,while fsas flow outward from occ to field personnel.id.citing tax analysts,at.thus,the district court upheld irs policy of redacting the portions of lms reflecting the authors opinions and analysis.id.at.
with regard to tas,the district court ordered further briefing.id.at.the court then rejected tax analysts argument that irs was required to demonstrate that it had complied with the harm rule,a policy set forth in the internal revenue manual manual.id.at.the harm rule stated that irs would grant foia requests unless the record is exempt and disclosure would significantly impede irs actions in carrying out a responsibility or function.id.the district court found that the rule is.id.tax analysts moved for reconsideration of this ruling.in mem.op.ii,the district court denied tax analysts motion as untimely.the district court also revisited the merits and found that the manual harm rule,which had been revised,was still not binding because it lacked mandatory language and did not demonstrate that irs intended to be bound by the policy.id.at.
the district court then turned to tas.with respect to tas withheld pursuant to foia exemption e,the court held that eight of the tas were not exempt because they did not focus on a specifically alleged illegal act of any particular identified case or individual,and therefore were not compiled for law enforcement purposes as the exemption requires.id.at.with respect to tas withheld in their entirety pursuant to the attorney work product privilege encompassed by exemption,the court held that irs was not required to segregate and release the portions of the tas that constituted agency working law.id.at.
with respect to tas withheld pursuant to exemption deliberative process privilege,the district court made two rulings that tax analysts now appeals.first,the court addressed certain tas to program managers.these tas contain occ answers to questions submitted by program managers in irs national office,sometimes concerning individual taxpayers.the district court ordered irs to release five of these tas and rejected the request for disclosure of another five.id.at.the court found that the five tas that were held subject to disclosure are treated as final documents that represent the considered position of occ,while those held to be exempt are merely part of a deliberative process involving occ and irs program managers.id.at.the court likened the tas it ordered released to the fsas at issue in tax analysts.id.at.
second,the district court addressed tas,which are issued when one component of occ advises another component that has been assigned to create a private letter ruling or other official document.id.at.the district court found that these tas are predecisional and deliberative,because they are solicited from a component of the agency that lacks the authority to issue a final legal decision.id.at.the content of these tas is subject to modification or rejection prior to the finalization into the final work product.id.the district court thus found that these tas are exempt from disclosure under the deliberative process privilege.id.at.
both parties moved for reconsideration.in tax analysts irs,d,mem.op.motion for reconsideration,may,hereinafter mem.op.iii,the district court denied both parties motions in relevant part.the court rejected tax analysts argument that tas withheld pursuant to the attorney work product privilege should not be protected in their entirety.id.at.the court also restated its holding that tas not focusing on an individual investigation were not records compiled for law enforcement purposes as required by exemption e.id.at.
ii.discussion 
lms,tas,the attorney work product privilege,and the irs manual 
foia exemption protects or memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.b.the exemption allows an agency to withhold those materials that would be privileged from discovery in civil litigation.nlrb sears,roebuck,d.as such,it is interpreted to encompass,inter alia,three evidentiary privileges the deliberative process privilege,the privilege,and the attorney work product privilege.burka hhs.
the district court correctly found that lms and intradivisional tas do not constitute agency working law and are exempt pursuant to the deliberative process privilege.the district court also correctly determined that the harm rule articulated in the manual does not bind irs or create rights in tax analysts.finally,the district court correctly determined that irs need not segregate and release agency working law from tas withheld in their entirety pursuant to the attorney work product privilege.because the district court analysis and conclusions on these points are eminently sound,no further elaboration is necessary.we therefore affirm the district court judgment on these issues and adopt its reasoning and conclusions.
exemption e 
the service withheld portions of tas pursuant to exemption e.this exemption allows an agency to withhold 
records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes,but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information e would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions,or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law 
b.the dispute in this case turns on whether irs has shown that the disputed records or information were compiled for law enforcement purposes.
there are several overarching principles that the courts follow in assessing whether records or information satisfy the threshold requirement of b.first,law enforcement purposes under exemption includes both civil and criminal matters within its scope.pratt webster.second,the foia makes no distinction between agencies whose principal function is criminal law enforcement and agencies with both law enforcement and administrative functions.id.at.therefore,agencies like irs,that combine administrative and law enforcement functions,as well as agencies like the federal bureau of investigation fbi,whose principal function is criminal law enforcement,may seek to avoid disclosure of records or information pursuant to exemption.finally,courts can usually assume that government agencies act within the scope of their legislated authority.id.at.however,courts apply a more deferential standard to a claim that information was compiled for law enforcement purposes when the claim is made by an agency whose primary function involves law enforcement.id.this point was amplified in pratt webster 
on the one hand,the assumption that a agency is acting within the scope of its authority tells a court nothing about whether it has met the exemption threshold requirement of a law enforcement purpose.law enforcement,indeed,is often one of such an agency proper functions,but other functions are also a major part of the agency business.thus,a court must scrutinize with some skepticism the particular purpose claimed for disputed documents redacted under foia exemption if courts accept a agency claims of law enforcement purpose without thoughtful consideration,the excessive withholding of agency records which congress denounced and sought to avoid might well result.
on the other hand,the generally accurate assumption that federal agencies act within their legislated purposes implies that an agency whose principal mission is criminal law enforcement will more often than not satisfy the exemption threshold criterion.thus,a court can accept less exacting proof from such an agency that the purpose underlying disputed documents is law enforcement.this less exacting judicial scrutiny of a criminal law enforcement agency purpose in the context of the foia exemption threshold is further bolstered by congress concern that inadvertent disclosure of criminal investigations,information sources,or enforcement techniques might cause serious harm to the legitimate interests of law enforcement agencies.

in the instant case,the district court correctly identified irs as a agency,subject to an exacting standard when it comes to the threshold requirement of exemption.the district court,however,relied on rural housing alliance united states department of agriculture,in holding that a agency may only withhold information pursuant to exemption when the information concerns investigations which focus directly on specifically alleged illegal acts,illegal acts of particular identified officials,acts which could,if proved,result in civil or criminal sanctions.mem.op.ii at quoting.this was error.
rural housing and its progeny apply only when an agency seeks to invoke exemption in a situation in which there is an ongoing law enforcement investigation.the court recently explained the development of this line of authority in jefferson department of justice,
in assessing whether records are compiled for law enforcement purposes,this circuit has long e
