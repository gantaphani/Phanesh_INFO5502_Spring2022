background 
since,cody has owned several parcels of real property in the town of woodbury in orange county.the county has levied real property taxes on these parcels,which cody has not paid since and which continue to be due and owing.cody argues that the parcels are tax exempt because it is a religious corporation and uses the land exclusively for religious and educational purposes.see real prop.tax law a mckinney.
cody has litigated the status of its property for the tax years in a number of different forums.cody has applied for exemptions from the town assessor and filed tax grievance complaints with the town board of assessment review the bar for the tax years,and,all of which were denied after a hearing pursuant to new york real property tax law.cody filed tax certiorari petitions under article of the new york real property tax law in supreme court,orange county,for the tax years,and.the tax certiorari proceeding was dismissed in september because cody had failed to file a note of issue within four years of commencing the action.see real prop.tax law mckinney.the tax certiorari proceedings for,and were still pending when cody filed a petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code in july.
in november,cody filed a complaint in the southern district of new york alleging that the town assessor failure to grant it status violated the first and fourteenth amendments.the district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to the tax injunction act,because cody could have obtained review of the assessor decision under an adequate procedure.cody,town of woodbury,d.
in october,the county petitioned in supreme court,orange county,to foreclose on certain parcels for which the taxes were delinquent.cody answered,asserting that the parcels were exempt from taxation because it was a religious corporation using the land exclusively for religious and educational purposes.the county moved for an order striking cody answer and directing foreclosure.at cody request,the hearing on the motion was postponed.
before the hearing date,cody filed its chapter petition and commenced an adversary proceeding against the county and the town seeking a determination pursuant to a of the nature and extent of liens with respect to the debtor real property,including real estate taxes assessed against its property.compl.cody moved for summary judgment on the basis of its alleged status.the county disputed that the parcels had been used exclusively for purposes,contending that cody used them to provide loan and services and that thousands of dollars generated by the property were paid to cody officers.for summary judgment,the town contended that the bar denial of cody written grievance complaints for tax years,and deprived the bankruptcy court of jurisdiction under a for those years.the town also sought abstention under the tax injunction act,because tax certiorari petitions for,and were pending in new york state court and a because the primary benefit of the adversary proceeding would inure to cody,whose largest unsecured creditors were insiders,see new haven projects.liability,at.
the bankruptcy court declined to decide whether it had jurisdiction over the proceeding,determining that,if it had jurisdiction,it would abstain from exercising it.it then abstained under a and c and dismissed the adversary proceeding,concluding that new york law provided procedures for a taxpayer to challenge the imposition of real estate taxes.the court determined that cody had had ample opportunity to invoke these procedures and had done so in varying degrees,and that the parties dispute was of a quintessential state law character.order dismissing adversary proceeding,at.cody appealed to the district court,but only insofar as tax years,and were concerned 
the district court held that the doctrine deprived the federal courts of jurisdiction over cody claims regarding tax year,for which cody tax certiorari proceeding had been dismissed for failure to file a note of issue.the court noted that,if cody use of the parcels did not change after,then cody claims regarding tax years,and may be inextricably intertwined with the judgment in the certiorari proceeding for,depriving the federal courts of jurisdiction over,and as well.the court concluded,however,that it could not make such an assessment on the record before it,and proceeded to review the bankruptcy court abstention decision.
the district court held that the bankruptcy court had properly abstained under c.the district court also concluded,in the alternative,that the bankruptcy court had the discretion to abstain under a,cody,county of orange in re cody,even though the bankruptcy court had not relied on that section.cody appealed.
we conclude that,under a a,the district court lacked jurisdiction over cody claims regarding tax years and.we therefore affirm the dismissal of cody adversary proceeding with respect to those years.we also conclude that,under d,we lack appellate jurisdiction to review the bankruptcy court abstention decision.accordingly,we dismiss the appeal insofar as it concerns the tax years over which the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction,and.

ii.subject matter jurisdiction 
the district court was correct to address the jurisdictional issue before reviewing the bankruptcy court abstention decision.as the district court properly noted,a court that lacks jurisdiction over a matter can not abstain from deciding that matter.cody,at.thus,we turn first to the question of the bankruptcy court jurisdiction over cody claims.
the defendants make two separate jurisdictional arguments.first,the town and the county argue that,as the district court determined,the doctrine deprives the federal courts of jurisdiction over cody claims regarding tax year because of the state court dismissal of the certiorari proceeding that addressed that year.second,the town argues that a a deprives the federal courts of jurisdiction over the tax years and because the status of the parcels at issue was contested before,and adjudicated by,the bar with respect to those years.because we conclude that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction over and under a a,we need not address the applicability of the doctrine.
we begin our jurisdictional analysis by looking to a,which provides
