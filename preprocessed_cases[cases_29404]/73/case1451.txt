psi energy,and cincinnati gas electric together the appellants appeal the judgment of the united states court of federal claims,holding them liable for tax levied on users of enriched uranium for generation of nuclear power,although the appellants did not use the enriched uranium or produce nuclear power we conclude that the tax was improperly levied on the appellants,and reverse the decision of the court of federal claims.
background 
a nuclear reactor operates using the uranium isotope.as the reactor fuel is depleted,the reverts to the inactive form.to use the uranium,it is necessary to increase the concentration of to that needed for nuclear reaction,a process called enrichment.since the united states government has performed this enrichment and has charged the for the cost thereof.the fee is calculated by a formula that includes the difference in the amount of in the starting material,and the amount of in the enriched fuel that is returned to the utility.this difference is defined in terms of separative work units swu.the appellants explain that swus are not tangible objects,but are the method used to quantify the amount of effort expended to produce the enriched uranium.thus although the utility does not receive back the same batch of uranium that it delivered to the government,it is charged a fee based on the amount of enrichment acquired by the utility.
over the years,this activity contaminated the government uranium processing facilities with various radioactive and other waste products.in congress enacted the energy policy act epact,a et,whose purpose was to recover the part of the cost of decontamination that was due to this work done for utilities the cost due to military uses was not charged to the utilities.the epact levied a special assessment on the utilities whose spent nuclear fuel was processed by the government.the assessment was measured by the number of swus purchased from the doe and used by the utility.the epact provides that if the utility sells the swu,it will not be considered to have purchased the swu from the government 
a utility shall not be considered to have purchased a separative work unit from the department if such separative work unit was purchased by the utility,but sold to another source.
c.for discussion of the background of the statute,see commonwealth edison united states,en banc.
the appellant utilities purchased enriched uranium from the government from to,but ultimately did not use any of it to generate electric power.in the appellants sold their entire stock of nuclear fuel to other utilities in the secondary market.due to market standardization,the selling price was stated as if the resold fuel contained fewer swus than the utilities had purchased from the government.
the government levied a tax of on psi and over on cincinnati gas,on the theory that because these utilities sold nominally fewer swus than they received from the government,they were liable for the assessment on the purportedly missing swus,whether or not they were used by these utilities.the court of federal claims held that the tax was correctly applied.
discussion 
the appellants argue that the statute levies the tax on the user of the fuel,and that since they did not use the fuel,they are not subject to the tax.they argue that it is incorrect to tax the appellants as if they used the fuel,when they sold their entire stock.the appellants state that although the tax provisions of the epact designate the swu as a convenient measure of the amount of enrichment,the statute explicitly exempts liability for the tax when the enriched fuel is resold.the appellants state that since the entire quantity of fuel was sold,the statute eliminates their liability for the tax,and that it is irrelevant that they had restated the swus present in the fuel that was sold.
the government responds that the tax is based on swus,and that by selling the fuel as if the fuel had fewer swus,it was as if the appellants used the fuel embodying the difference in swu.although the statute does not contemplate this apparently rare fact situation,it is clear that the tax was intended to be levied on the user of the enriched uranium.on any theory,the appellants did not use any of the enriched uranium they simply resold it.in union electric united states,this court explained 
a s to those utilities that submitted the uranium to the government for processing,the tax was effectively imposed on their utilization of the government enrichment services.with respect to companies that purchased uranium from those that had utilized the government enrichment services,the tax was effectively imposed on their purchase of the enriched uranium.
the court held that the tax was properly imposed on the ultimate user,and that the tax did not apply to domestic utilities that sold their uranium prior to october.id.a swu does not exist independently of the uranium nuclear fuel,for it measures the degree of enrichment acquired by the utility.when the appellants sold all of their enriched uranium,and retained none,they could not be charged with the tax levied on users.
the government argues that its interpretation of c should be accorded deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,stating that the statute is ambiguous and that the government interpretation of an ambiguous statute must be given deference.however,we discern no ambiguity.the government argues that the department of energy stated the position now taken,in a comment during a rulemaking hearing in.that comment,however,concerned the actual assay of resold uranium,not a discounted price.nor is deference warranted for informal comments when the statute deals with the issue.there is no ambiguity in the statutory requirement and the precedent of yankee atomic electric united states,and union electric,supra,that the cleanup tax is levied on the user of the fuel,not on a who simply resells the fuel 
when all of the enriched fuel was resold by the appellants,by statute they are not liable for the tax.it is irrelevant that the fuel was resold for less than its cost in swus.the judgment of liability is reversed on remand the appellants shall recover the assessment,with interest in accordance with law.
reversed and remanded 
the court today resolves that the court of federal claims has misread the relevant statutes in imposing liability on the appellants.for the reasons that follow,it is the court today that errs,not the court of federal claims.in a nutshell,congress designed a program for industry participation in enrichment plant costs that keys to the number of separative work units swus purchased from the government,not the number of pounds of uranium used by a utility.
this interpretation is in keeping with prior precedent involving the epact statute by this court.see union united states.holding that the special assessment under epact was a constitutional excise tax.power light united states,holding that the contract disputes act did not apply to enrichment contracts with the government because they are contracts for services commonwealth edison united states,en banc holding that the special assessment under epact was not a taking or a breach of the utilities contracts by the government and was not a violation of due process maine yankee atomic power united states,holding that the special assessment was not unconstitutional under the equal protection clause yankee atomic united states,holding that the special assessment did not breach the enrichment contracts between the utilities and the government by retroactively increasing the price of previously purchased uranium.
psi energy and cincinnati gas electric the appellants claim that they are specially situated because,unlike other utilities that contracted with the government for enrichment services,or secondary purchasers,who used the enriched fuel in nuclear power plants,the appellants sold the entirety of their supply without depleting one ounce in fission reactors.at oral argument in this court,both parties asserted that this is the only case of its kind in the universe of utility claimants under the relevant statutes that is,no other utility was left with unus
