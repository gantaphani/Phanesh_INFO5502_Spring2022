after hearing oral arguments,we requested additional briefs from the parties on questions pertaining to sovereign immunity and subject matter jurisdiction.having considered the arguments of the parties and the record in this case,we conclude that,because the allegations of the complaint do not establish that the government had or claimed a lien or a mortgage on the property of the trust when the suit was filed,the complainants may not hale the united states into court under.accordingly,we must dismiss this appeal and remand the case to the district court with instructions to dismiss the suit against the united states and to remand the case to the state court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.although the parties and the district court did not raise these jurisdictional issues,federal trial and appellate courts have the duty to examine the basis for their subject matter jurisdiction,doing so on their own motion if necessary.torres southern peru copper,cir perez region educ.serv,cir holding that sovereign immunity issues may be raised sua sponte as they bear on subject matter jurisdiction.
background 
turner hunt lewis,a resident of lincoln parish,louisiana,died october,without issue and without ever having been married.he left no will and,under the louisiana laws of intestate succession,his only heirs were his nieces and nephews.one of his nieces,caroline lewis hunt,would have inherited of his estate as an intestate heir.prior to his death,however,lewis was interdicted and his estate,which exceeded million,was placed in the turner hunt lewis trust.the trust instrument provided that,upon his death without a valid will,each of his heirs under state law,except for caroline lewis hunt,would be his successor principal beneficiaries and that any property that would have devolved to his niece and intestate heir,caroline lewis hunt,would vest in her descendants as if she had predeceased turner hunt lewis.
as the trustees undisputed pleadings establish,many years before lewis interdiction,caroline lewis hunt and her husband entered a collateral agreement with the internal revenue service to turn over any inheritances that they received in order to discharge their federal income tax liability.it is also conceded that the only reason that lewis was interdicted and his property placed in trust was to prevent a share of lewis assets from going to caroline through intestate succession,and subsequently to the federal government to pay off the back taxes owed by caroline and her husband.
the underlying issue,which is res nova under louisiana law,may be restated more fully as follows whether the curator of a fully interdicted person without a will can,with court approval,supersede the law of intestate succession by acting for the interdict to create a trust,place the interdict property in the trust,and name persons as successor beneficiaries different from those who otherwise would have been entitled to succeed as intestate heirs.the louisiana statutes do not provide a clear and unambiguous answer to this question 
on october,the plaintiffs,the,filed this suit in state court pursuant to louisiana revised statutes and for trustees instructions or,alternatively,for concursus proceedings,to address the question of whether the trust instrument successor beneficiary provisions were valid under louisiana law.the trustee complaint also named the united states as a party to this suit,claiming the authority to hale it into the state court under on the grounds that the united states may have or claim a lien against the trust property through caroline hunt.
specifically,in respect to waiver of sovereign immunity,the allegations of the complaint,in pertinent part,state 
jurisdiction over the united states of america with respect to the trust is conferred on this court by,in that,as shown below,the united states of america may have a lien interest in certain of the trust assets,and provides that the united states of america may be named a party in any civil action in any state court having jurisdiction of the subject matter to quiet title to real or personal property on which the united states of america may have a sic claim a lien.
on september,the new orleans district of the internal revenue service filed in the records of lincoln parish,louisiana,in mortgage book at page a notice of federal tax lien under internal revenue laws hereinafter the notice regarding caroline hunt,residing at lakeside drive,dallas,texas.pursuant to its terms,the notice operates as a certificate of release of the federal tax lien as of october.subsequent to the filing of the notice but before october,caroline lewis hunt entered into that certain collateral agreement between herself,her spouse,and the internal revenue service dated december,the collateral agreement,which obliges her to turn over to the internal revenue service one hundred percent of the amount of any devise,bequest,or inheritance she receives.
in the event the trust instrument does not comply with louisiana code of civil procedure articles d and,regarding the placing of the property of an interdict into trust,defendant,caroline lewis hunt,as lewis heir,is entitled to an undivided interest in the assets standing in the trust,and,defendant,the united states of america,may,as a result of the collateral agreement,have or claim a lien on a portion of the assets standing in the trust.

ii.waiver of sovereign immunity under 
in order to hale the federal government into a court proceeding,a plaintiff must show that there has been a valid waiver of sovereign immunity.a waiver of the federal government sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text and will not be implied.lane pena,d citing united states nordic village,d.the mere agreement in court between parties and their counsel is not sufficient to constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity.shaw,at.no officer by his action can confer jurisdiction.moreover,a waiver of the government sovereign immunity will be strictly construed,in terms of its scope,in favor of the sovereign.lane,at.we may not enlarge the waiver beyond the purview of the statutory language.united states williams,d.absent a waiver of sovereign immunity,the federal government is immune from suit.loeffler frank,d.the absence of such a waiver is a jurisdictional defect.kulawy,cir bodin vagshenian,cir holding that a lack of a waiver of sovereign immunity deprives federal courts of subject matter jurisdiction.
under,congress has waived the government sovereign immunity to a limited class of civil actions,solely with respect to property on which the united states has or claims a mortgage or other lien.in pertinent part,section provides t he united states may be named a party in any civil action or suit in any district court,or in any state court having jurisdiction of the subject matter to quiet title to or of interpleader or in the nature of interpleader with respect to property on which the united states has or claims a mortgage or other lien.a.
in addition to requiring that the united states must have or claim a lien or mortgage on the subject property,section places other conditions on the government consent to be a requirement that the pleadings be sufficiently specific as to give notice to the government of the nature of the lien or mortgage.for example,t he complaint or pleading shall set forth with particularity the nature of the interest or lien of the united states and,if the case involves a federal tax lien,the complaint shall include the name and address of the taxpayer whose liability created the lien and,if a notice of the tax lien was filed,the identity of the internal revenue office which filed the notice,and the date and place such notice was filed.b.
in keeping with the supreme court decisions regarding the construction of statutory waivers,a noncomplying complaint under does not invoke the statutory waiver of sovereign immunity granting consent to suit,and,consequently,can not state a claim upon which relief could be granted.see macklin united states,cir dahn united states,cir see also hussain boston old colony ins,cir holding that the waiver must be narrowly construed to comport precisely with congressional intent citing estate of johnson,cir.thus,no suit may be maintained against the united states unless the suit is brought in exact compliance with the terms of a statute under which the sovereign has consented to be sued.hussain,at quoting koehler united states,cir.
further,in interpreting and applying section we must be mindful of its purpose and history as a lien removal statute.before the enactment of its predecessor,as the supreme court observed in united states brosnan,d 
i t was already then well established that the united states was an indispensable party to any suit affecting property in which it had an interest,and that such a suit was therefore a suit against the united states which could not be maintained without its consent.furthermore,the laws of many states themselves required all persons claiming an interest in property to be joined as parties to any suit to foreclose a lien or quiet title to the property.thus there was no way in which a party who held a lien on property senior to that of the united states could get a judicial decree extinguishing the government interest.
to remedy this situation,congress in passed the predecessor of s,s,which gives the holder of a lien the right to enforce it by civil action against the united states,subject to the exhaustion of certain administrative remedies 
in,congress,for similar reasons,passed the predecessor of s,s,which gives a private lienor the right to name the united states a party in any action or suit to foreclose a mortgage or lien or to quiet title to property on which the united states claims any kind of mortgage or lien,whether or not a tax lien.
footnotes omitted.
thus,the statutes only apparent purpose is to lift the bar of sovereign immunity which had theretofore been considered to work a particular injustice on private lienors,brosnan,at,and not to allow any party against whom the government might have any kind of claim to hale the united states into court.
accordingly,this court and others have consistently held that section waiver of sovereign immunity is inapplicable if the government did not have or claim a lien or mortgage on the property that is the subject of the suit at the time the suit was filed.section applies only if at the time plaintiff files suit the government had a mortgage or other lien on the property that is the basis of the taxpayer quiet title action.koehler united states,cir for example,t here is no waiver when a taxpayer seeks to challenge the validity of any underlying tax assessment citing montgomery united states,cir,when the government is claiming a title interest in property rather than a lien interest,citing cummings united states,cir or when the government no longer has a mortgage or a lien upon the property in dispute when the suit was filed.citing koehler,at.hussain,at.
furthermore,if the complaint or pleading does not set forth with particularity the nature of the government interest showing that it has or claims to have a lien or mortgage against the property that is the subject of the suit,the complaint fails to satisfy the conditions necessary to waive the sovereign immunity of the united states and invoke federal jurisdiction.b the complaint or pleading shall set forth with particularity the nature of the interest or lien of the united states.see also dahn united states,cir holding that a complaint that fails to meet the pleading requirements does not invoke the statutory waiver of sovereign immunity macklin united states,cir noting that consent to suit by the united states is conditioned on proper pleading under section.
iii.adequacy of the complaint 
keeping these principles underlying sovereign immunity and section in mind,we review the adequacy of the pleadings in the trustee complaint.the complaint here fails to assert,or to allege facts from which it may be inferred,that the government had or claimed a lien or mortgage on caroline lewis hunt property when the suit was filed on october,of those with potential claims to the estate,only caroline was alleged to have owed any tax deficiency at that time.therefore,unless the government had or claimed a lien on her property when suit was filed,and a share of the trust assets became hers upon lewis death because the trust provision diverting it to her descendants was invalid,there is no way the government could have had a lien on the trust assets when the suit was filed as required by koehler.in section of the complaint,the trustees alleged that the government had a tax lien on caroline property that was due to or expire on october,but the complaint failed to allege that the lien did not or expire on that date or that the government or renewed the tax lien before its expiration.
section does go on to allege that prior to that date,caroline entered into the collateral agreement between herself,her spouse,and the internal revenue service dated december,which obliges her to turn over to the internal revenue service any devise,bequest,or inheritance she receives.however,we have reviewed the collateral agreement,which is in the record as an exhibit,and find that it contains nothing which purports to continue,renew or create a tax lien.the collateral agreement is simply a contract by which caroline agreed to turn over future inheritances,and it did not grant the government any lien or security interest in her property the complaint does not contain any allegation that controverts or obviates the only reasonable and logical inferences that can be drawn from the pleadings,that the government tax lien particularly described in the complaint was the only lien the government ever had against caroline property,that pursuant to its terms as described in the complaint it or expired on october,and that the government therefore did not have or claim a lien on caroline property when the present suit was filed on october.
because of the complaint evident insufficiency,we asked for and received supplemental briefs from the parties on questions pertaining to sovereign immunity and subject matter jurisdiction the trust beneficiaries filed a supplemental brief that does not attempt to convince us that the complaint expressly and definitely establishes that the government had or claimed a lien on caroline property at the time the suit was filed.instead,they set forth several imaginative arguments that an additional lien was created other than the federal tax lien which apparently.they argue for the first time in this case that,under one of the bankruptcy code definitions of a lien and also under the laws of louisiana and texas,the collateral agreement itself granted the united states a lien on any inherited property caroline might receive in order to secure her performance under the collateral agreement.the government has not argued,in its letter briefing or at any other time,that the collateral agreement could,on its own,constitute a lien.
the beneficiaries argument is without merit.first,the complaint did not allege with particularity as required by section b that the collateral agreement created a lien for the government on caroline property in existence at the time of the filing of this suit the complaint does not quote any specific language or provision of the collater
