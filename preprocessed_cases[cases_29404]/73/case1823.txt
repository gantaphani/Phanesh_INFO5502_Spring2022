standard of review 
in the case at bar,we are called upon to review the appellate court construction of the property tax code ilcs et west and the court determination that section of the code is constitutional ilcs west.the primary rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature,aldridge,quoting illinois power mahin,in re.to do so,we examine the language of the statute,usually the best indicator of the legislature objectives in enacting the law.michigan avenue national bank county of cook.we afford the language of the statute its plain and ordinary meaning michigan avenue national bank,at,and construe the statute as a whole sylvester industrial comm n.we do not view words and phrases in isolation but consider them in light of other relevant provisions of the statute.sylvester,at,michigan avenue national bank,at.

postjudgment motion practice 
turning to the merits of the appeal,we consider first the interplay between the filing of a postjudgment motion and the filing of an appeal.section of the code of civil procedure ilcs west provides 
motions after judgment in cases.a in all cases tried without a jury,any party may,within days after the entry of the judgment or within any further time the court may allow within the days or any extensions thereof,file a motion for a rehearing,or a retrial,or modification of the judgment or to vacate the judgment or for other relief.
b a motion filed in apt time stays enforcement of the judgment.
thus,a party may seek review in the circuit court within the statutorily allotted time,and the filing of the postjudgment motion stays enforcement of the circuit court judgment.
supreme court rule governs the filing of an appeal.the rule provides in part 
a time filing transmission of copy.
except as provided in paragraph b below,the notice of appeal must be filed with the clerk of the circuit court within days after the entry of the final judgment appealed from,or,if a timely motion directed against the judgment is filed,whether in a jury or a nonjury case,within days after the entry of the order disposing of the last remaining motion.
when a timely motion has been filed by any party,whether in a jury case or a nonjury case,a notice of appeal filed before the entry of the order disposing of the last pending motion shall have no effect and shall be withdrawn by the party who filed it,by moving for dismissal pursuant to rule.this is so whether the timely motion was filed before or after the date on which the notice of appeal was filed.a new notice of appeal must be filed within the prescribed time measured from the entry of the order disposing of the motion,as provided in subparagraph a of this rule.
the rule expressly reserves the jurisdiction of the circuit court to consider a posttrial motion directed against the judgment.jurisdiction is conferred upon the appellate court through the timely filing of a notice of appeal.berg allied security.however,the notice of appeal is of no effect and must be withdrawn if a timely postjudgment motion was filed before or after the date on which the notice of appeal was filed.a.
as noted above,the circuit court entered an order on july,directing the county clerk to issue a tax deed to the property to forus.on august,denis dwyer and lillian dwyer each filed a posttrial motion seeking to have the court vacate the order.the postjudgment motions were timely since they were filed within days after entry of the order for issuance of the tax deed.when a posttrial motion directed to the judgment is timely filed,the motion tolls the time for filing the notice of appeal.the appeal is timely if the notice of appeal is filed within days after the entry of the order disposing of the last pending postjudgment motion.steinbrecher steinbrecher,a.the circuit court here denied the postjudgment motions on october,and,the dwyers filed a notice of appeal on november.the appeal was timely in that it met the requirements of rule.
c.the property tax code 
the revenue act of,ch,par.et,the predecessor statute to the property tax code,was amended extensively in.significantly,the legislature authorized the county court,rather than the county clerk,to determine whether the purchaser at a tax sale had complied with the provisions of the act and was entitled to a tax deed for the property,ch,par.in the legislature further amended the act to provide that the notice of the filing of the petition for tax deed and the notice of the hearing on the petition were to be in conformity with rule or practice of court in regard to motions as in other civil actions,ch,par.as modified by these and further amendments,the property tax code is a comprehensive statute regulating the assessment and collection of taxes,the forfeiture of property for the nonpayment of taxes,the sale of property to satisfy delinquent taxes,and the redemption of property upon payment of delinquent taxes,interest and costs associated with the sale of the property.ilcs et west.
article of the property tax code contains specific procedures for the issuance of a tax deed following the sale of property and the expiration of the redemption period.article provides,inter alia,for notice of the sale and of the property owner redemption rights ilcs west notice of the expiration of the period of redemption ilcs west notice by publication ilcs west a petition by the purchaser for issuance of a tax deed ilcs west issuance ilcs west or denial of the tax deed ilcs west and an order placing the tax deed grantee in possession of the property ilcs west.
three sections of article are particularly relevant to the present appeal.section provides that a tax deed executed by the county clerk is prima facie evidence that the property was subject to taxation the taxes or special assessments were not paid the property was advertised for sale the property was sold for taxes or special assessments the sale was conducted in the manner required by law the property was not redeemed within the time provided by law and the grantee in the deed was the purchaser or assignee of the purchaser.ilcs west.the section further provides 
any order for the sale of property for delinquent taxes,except as otherwise provided in this section,shall estop all parties from raising any objections to the order or to a tax title based thereon,which existed at or before the rendition of the order,and which could have been presented as a defense to the application for the order.the order itself is conclusive evidence of its regularity and validity in all collateral proceedings,except in cases where the tax or special assessments were paid prior to the sale or the property was exempt from general taxes or was not subject to special assessment.ilcs b west 
section of the property tax code is entitled tax deeds to convey merchantable title.the section provides this section shall be liberally construed so that tax deeds shall convey merchantable title.ilcs west.

tax deed incontestable unless order appealed or relief petitioned.tax deeds issued under section are incontestable except by appeal from the order of the court directing the county clerk to issue the tax deed.however,relief from such order may be had under section of the code of civil procedure.ilcs west

the effect of the appellate court decision was to deny the dwyers the right to seek review in the circuit court,a right generally available to parties in an action pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure ilcs west and supreme court rule.in contrast,this court has given conclusive effect to an order for issuance of a tax deed without infringing upon the parties right to seek review in the circuit court.in cherin v.the,the property owners filed petitions to vacate and set aside the orders for issuance of tax deeds approximately eight months after the orders had been entered.the petitions alleged that the affidavits for publication did not comply with the statute and diligent inquiry had not been made.the court first explained the history and purpose of the incontestability provision,now found in the property tax code
