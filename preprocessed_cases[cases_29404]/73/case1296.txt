on application for attorneys fees 
barry finkelstein petitions this court under section f of the ethics in government act of,as amended,the act,for reimbursement of attorneys fees in the amount of that he claims were incurred during and as a result of the investigation conducted by the independent counsel ic.because we find that finkelstein has established his entitlement under the statutory criteria for reimbursement of a portion of the fees we will,for the reasons set forth more fully below,allow recovery of.
background 
in allegations arose that henry cisneros,of housing and urban development,during his appointment process may have made false statements to the fbi concerning alleged payments made by him to his mistress.after conducting a preliminary investigation pursuant to the independent counsel statute,the attorney general requested that this court appoint an independent counsel to further investigate the matter,and the appointment was made on may.approximately one and a half years after his appointment,the independent counsel requested that his jurisdiction be expanded to include investigation of possible tax violations by cisneros in years,and.this request was granted only for the year.
during his subsequent investigation,the ic apparently came into possession of an internal irs memorandum that contained allegations of impropriety by the irs washington,office in its decision not to recommend prosecution of cisneros for tax violations.the memorandum alleged possible improprieties by assistant chief counsel criminal tax.the ic,beginning in,then undertook his own investigation into whether obstruction of justice occurred in the decisions of certain irs and doj officials in not authorizing the investigation or prosecution of cisneros for possible tax violations hereinafter the obstruction investigation.barry finkelstein,the fee applicant here,was investigated by the ic in his capacity as the head of the assistant chief counsel office for criminal tax.
in the obstruction investigation was temporarily suspended,until.upon resumption,on may,the office of the independent counsel oic informed finkelstein attorney that finkelstein was a subject of the grand jury investigation.apparently on the following day,may,finkelstein was granted use immunity under.in the following seven months he would be called before the grand jury times.he was never indicted and now,pursuant to the act,seeks reimbursement for his attorneys fees generated between may,and may,in the amount of.as directed by section f of the act,we forwarded copies of finkelstein fee petition to the attorney general and the ic and requested written evaluations of the petition.the court expresses its appreciation to the ic and the attorney general for submitting these evaluations,which we have given due consideration in arriving at the decision announced herein.
discussion 
the ethics in government act provides for reimbursement of attorneys fees expended in defense against an investigation under the act by subjects who qualify under f.that section provides 
upon the request of an individual who is the subject of an investigation conducted by an independent counsel pursuant to this chapter,the division of the court may,if no indictment is brought against such individual pursuant to that investigation,award reimbursement for those reasonable attorneys fees incurred by that individual during that investigation which would not have been incurred but for the requirements of this chapter.
because the act constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity it is to be strictly construed.in re nofziger,per curiam.under the act,therefore,we can only order reimbursement for attorneys fees when we determine,inter alia,that the fee petitioner was a subject of the independent counsel investigation and would not have incurred the attorneys fees but for the requirements of the act.see,in re pierce kisner fee application,per curiam.the petitioner bears the burden of establishing all elements of his entitlement.in re north reagan fee application,per curiam.there is apparently no dispute that finkelstein incurred his attorneys fees during the ic investigation.the remainder of the discussion will therefore address the subject,but for,and reasonable requirements.
subject status 
we have previously defined the term subject as a person whose conduct is within the scope of the independent counsel investigation such that the independent counsel might reasonably be expected to point the finger of accusation at him.in re north dutton fee application,per curiam see also in re north shultz fee application,per curiam.additionally,in shultz we held that,under any definition of the term,the criterion for subject status is squarely met when the independent counsel tells a person that he is in fact a subject.at.finkelstein notes that on may,the oic indicated that he was a subject of the investigation.citing shultz,finkelstein argues that subject status is squarely met when an independent counsel office tells a person that he is a subject.
finkelstein goes on to argue that although he was granted use immunity the next day,that grant did not alter his status.he first cites dutton,at,for the proposition that a subject granted use immunity does not automatically lose his subject status upon the immunity grant.he then cites two additional fee application cases in the north investigation in which the court determined that a grant of immunity did not change the fee applicant subject status.in in re north cave fee application,per curiam,according to finkelstein,the fee applicant remained a subject after the grant of immunity because the information he provided to the grand jury could have been derived from two to four other witnesses,providing the government an independent source for the testimony if it chose to pursue charges against the applicant.and in in re north haskell fee application,per curiam,finkelstein notes that although the fee applicant was granted use immunity,he was thereafter interviewed twice,with the court concluding that he was still under threat of prosecution until the independent counsel determined that the information he provided was truthful.
analogizing his case to cave,finkelstein claims that the testimony he provided could have indeed likely from other witnesses,obtained from two of his colleagues at the irs who provided testimony concerning the same events and circumstances as he did.as such,according to finkelstein,the oic had a wholly independent source of information if it chose to pursue charges against him.and in analogizing his case to haskell,finkelstein notes that he was called before the grand jury times,where h e was routinely and rigorously questioned about his contemporaneous communications with others involved in the independent counsel inquiry and asked whether he was discussing his grand jury testimony with those individuals.because of the numerous requests for his grand jury appearances and the nature of the questioning during those appearances,finkelstein argues that although he was granted use immunity,there was still a realistic possibility that he would become a defendant.
in its evaluation of finkelstein application,the oic responds in two short paragraphs to finkelstein claim to subject status.although the oic does not outright dispute finkelstein claim,it does note that a person still considered a subject after receiving use immunity is not the norm,in re pierce abrams fee application,per curiam,that a grant of use immunity changes the reasonable perception as to whether the immunized witness can apprehend becoming a defendant,and that t herefor
