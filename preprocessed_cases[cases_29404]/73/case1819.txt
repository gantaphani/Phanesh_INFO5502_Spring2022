plaintiffs are the owners of various parcels of real estate in cook county.in,they filed a class action complaint against defendant treasurer,alleging that they had made duplicate payments of their real estate taxes and seeking a return of their money.most of the plaintiffs had paid taxes in escrow to their respective lenders.when plaintiffs received their tax bills,they paid them,apparently unaware that their lenders were also paying the same bills,resulting in the taxes being paid twice.the earliest duplicate payments were made in.defendant filed a motion to dismiss under section a of the code of civil procedure ilcs a west,alleging that the statute of limitations contained in section of the property tax code code ilcs west had expired and that plaintiffs request for a refund was,therefore,untimely.the circuit court of cook county agreed and dismissed plaintiffs complaint.the appellate court affirmed the circuit court judgment.d.
background 
a complete statement of the facts in this case is contained in the appellate court opinion.briefly,plaintiffs filed their complaint in september,alleging that they had overpaid their taxes and seeking a refund.the complaint contained six counts,alleging causes of action for conversion violation of equal protection and due process unlawful taking without just compensation unjust enrichment violation of the uniform disposition of unclaimed property act unclaimed property act ilcs et west and violation of state pensioners rights.
in their complaint,plaintiffs alleged that defendant was the only county treasurer in the state who refused to refund duplicate tax payments when the refunds were requested more than five years after the payment had been made.plaintiffs alleged that defendant lacked authority to collect the duplicate taxes or to disburse them to taxing districts.they further alleged that defendant had knowledge at the time plaintiffs made their payments that no taxes were then due and owing.as stated,defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the statute of limitations contained in section of the code had expired.the circuit court agreed and dismissed the complaint.the appellate court affirmed.d.
in the appellate court,plaintiffs argued that their overpayments were not tax payments and were thus not subject to section.they further argued that their request for a return of the payments were not claims for a refund.they also argued that the payments constituted tangible property subject to the unclaimed property act.the appellate court rejected all of these contentions.the court also found that a reading of the language of section,together with the legislative history of the statute,demonstrates that plaintiffs tax payments were overpayments of their taxes and were therefore subject to the statute of limitations contained therein.d at.this court granted plaintiffs petition for leave to appeal a.we now affirm the judgment of the appellate court.
standard of review 
the question of whether a cause of action was properly dismissed under section a of the code of civil procedure is reviewed de novo.ferguson city of chicago.we are also called upon in this case to interpret section of the code.the interpretation of a statute is a question of law that is subject to de novo review.wisniewski kownacki.
section of the code provides in pertinent part 
if any property is twice assessed for the same year,or assessed before it becomes taxable,and the erroneously assessed taxes have been paid either at sale or otherwise,or have been overpaid by the same claimant or by different claimants,the county collector,upon being satisfied of the facts in the case,shall refund the taxes to the proper claimant.a claim for refund shall not be allowed unless a petition is filed within years from the date the right to a refund arose.emphasis added.ilcs west.
this section provides an exception to the voluntary payment doctrine.under that doctrine,a taxpayer may not recover taxes that are voluntarily paid,even if the taxing body imposed or assessed the taxes illegally.such taxes may be recovered only if the recovery is authorized by statute.getto city of chicago.this court has explained the doctrine as follows 
it has been a universally recognized rule that money voluntarily paid under a claim of right to the payment and with knowledge of the facts by the person making the payment can not be recovered back on the ground that the claim was illegal.it has been deemed necessary not only to show that the claim asserted was unlawful,but also that the payment was not voluntary that there was some necessity which amounted to compulsion,and payment was made under the influence of such compulsion.getto,at,quoting illinois glass chicago telephone.
it is undisputed that plaintiffs requested a refund of their duplicate payments more than five years after they were paid to defendant.thus,if section applies to plaintiffs payments,any refund requests are barred.
in an effort to remove their duplicate payments from the operation of section,plaintiffs argue that their payments were not tax payments.they reason that they were simply mistaken payments of property tax assessments that had already been satisfied.according to plaintiffs,their making duplicate payments was no different than if they had inadvertently given defendant too much money or had left cash on the counter at defendant office.such funds belong,not to defendant but to the taxpayer,and the monies should be returned.thus,plaintiffs reason,such payments would not constitute tax payments and a return of those funds would not be a refund.the appellate court rejected this argument,declining to characterize plaintiffs payments as anything other than tax payments.recognizing that they have cited little authority for their argument,plaintiffs contend that they should not have the burden of showing their right to a return of their duplicate payments.they attempt to shift that burden to defendant,arguing that at the time they made their payments,their taxes had already been paid and defendant was aware of that fact thus,they argue,defendant had no authority to accept payments for taxes that were not then due and no authority to transmit those payments to the taxing districts.
plaintiffs cite this court decision in gannaway barricklow,as support for their position.gannaway,however,is not analogous to plaintiffs situation.in gannaway,the plaintiff,who was administrator of an estate,was summoned before the county board of review and informed that the decedent had failed to pay property taxes for the years to.the total of the taxes allegedly owed was.faced with the threat of a penalty if the taxes were not paid by a certain date,the plaintiff paid the taxes.the plaintiff then discovered that no assessment had been entered on the assessor book and that no taxes had been levied or extended.he filed suit to recover the money he had paid.the county treasurer admitted that he had no claim to the money,but argued that the plaintiff payment was a voluntary payment of a tax and could not be recovered.a jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff.this court affirmed,finding that the treasurer had no authority to collect or receive the money from the plaintiff.it was not a tax and did not appear on any book as a tax.in addition,the court concluded that because the taxing districts had not levied the tax,the money could not be distributed to them and,in fact,the money did not belong to them.the voluntary payment doctrine did not apply because the money paid by the plaintiff was not a tax.the court noted that the money was in the treasurer hands without authority of law thus,it belonged to the plaintiff and the treasurer was equitably bound to refund it.gannaway,at.
in the case at bar,there is no claim that the taxes were not levied or extended.plaintiffs do not contend that the tax bills they received were improper in any way.their sole claim is that because the taxes had already been paid,nothing was owed on the tax bills and,therefore,the payments were something other than tax payments.
plaintiffs argue that section of the code ilcs west supports their description of their payments as inadvertent payments rather than payment of taxes.that section is entitled double payment and provides 
when taxes on a property have been paid more than once for the same year,by different claimants,the county collector shall report to the county clerk all surplus taxes so received,together with the names of the claimants.certified copies of the report,or the county clerk record thereof,shall be prima facie evidence in all courts of the payment of tax on the property therein described for the year or years mentioned.the township collectors shall report to the county collector taxes paid more than once,by different claimants for the same year,and the county collector shall report to the county clerk.ilcs west.
plaintiffs seize upon the word surplus as meaning that no taxing district has a right to rely on the payments or receive them.plaintiffs also believe that section implicitly directs that these surplus funds are not to be distributed to taxing districts and could not have been included in any district levied amount.according to plaintiffs,these surplus payments are not treated as tax payments and they reason that their duplicate payments should also not be treated as tax payments.we note that plaintiffs cite no authority for their interpretation of section.that section simply contains a reporting requirement.the reports sent to the county clerk may then be used as prima facie evidence in court of payment of tax on particular parcels of real estate.the very use of the word tax by section in describing the double payments undercuts plaintiffs argument that such payments are not taxes.
the code does not treat excess property tax payments as nonpayments or as payments of something other than a tax rather,such payments are described as overpayments of taxes.the legislature anticipated that there will be situations in which taxpayers may overpay their taxes and it has provided mechanisms to obtain a refund of those taxes.for example,section ilcs west of the code,entitled refund of overpayment accelerated billing,provides that in any county which uses accelerated billing,if a taxpayer pays more in estimated taxes than is due for the entire year as shown on the actual tax bill,the county collector shall refund the amount of the overpayment to the person who paid the estimated installments.section also describes certain excess payments as overpayments.
in support of its characterization of plaintiffs payments as overpayments of their taxes,the appellate court cited a united states supreme court decision,united states dalm,d.that case involved a taxpayer who paid gift tax on certain payments she had received.later,the internal revenue service irs determined that the taxpayer should have paid income tax instead.after petitioning the tax court for a redetermination and settling with the irs,the taxpayer sought refund of the amount she had paid in gift tax.however,the statute of limitations had expired and the district court rejected the taxpayer contention that her suit was timely under the doctrine of equitable recoupment.the court of appeals reversed.the supreme court affirmed the district court.in a footnote responding to a point made by justice stevens in dissent,the court stated that there was no difference between a refund of overpaid gift taxes and a claim for recovery of a tax overpayment.the court noted that the statute applied to claims for refund of a tax overpayment.according to the court,the commonsense interpretation of overpayment is that a tax is overpaid when a taxpayer pays more than is owed,for whatever reason or no reason at all.dalm,at.at,d at.
in determining the meaning of undefined terms in a statute,a court may turn to the dictionary for assistance.people ex rel.daley datacom systems.webster dictionary defines overpayment as payment in excess of what is due.webster third new international dictionary.plaintiffs do not dispute that they paid more than was due on their taxes.
we reject plaintiffs attempt to characterize their payments as something other than tax payments and conclude that plaintiffs payments are properly characterized as overpayments of their property taxes.in addition,as did the appellate court,we also reject plaintiffs argument that their request for return of their money was not a claim for a refund.black law dictionary defines refund as t he return of money to a person who overpaid,such as a taxpayer who overestimated tax liability or whose employer withheld too much tax from earnings.black law dictionary ed.since plaintiffs requested a return of their overpaid taxes,their claims are for a refund of their taxes.
plaintiffs also argue that their payments constituted tangible personal property subject to the unclaimed property act.plaintiffs claim that defendant violated that law by failing to turn the money over to the state treasurer.the unclaimed property act requires persons who are in possession of abandoned tangible and intangible personal property belonging to another to timely remit the property to the state treasurer.property is presumed abandoned if it is unclaimed by the owner for a period of five years.ilcs west.thereafter,the state assumes custody of the property and is responsible for its safekeeping.ilcs west.the state treasurer is required to publish notice to the owner of the property that all claims to the property must be directed to the state.ilcs west.ownership of the property remains with the owner and never vests in the state.canel topinka,quoting presley city of memphis.
plaintiffs rely on canel however,that reliance is misplaced.in canel,the issue was whether the state could retain dividends issued on shares of stock that were presumed abandoned and delivered to the state.this court held that the state could not retain the dividends because they were the private property of the owner of the stock.canel,at.the difference between the situation in canel and plaintiffs case is that,in canel,the owner of the stock did not transfer ownership of the stock to the state.here,plaintiffs did not retain ownership of their funds they transferred ownership to defendant.plaintiffs payments of the taxes were made pursuant to tax bills sent to them by defendant.they did not just leave money on a counter somewhere.plaintiffs intended to pay the amounts they did,they intended to pass title to the funds to defendant,and they intended those payments to be applied to the tax bills they had received.that plaintiffs were mistaken in believing that the tax bills had not otherwise been paid does not change the character of the payments.although plaintiffs argue that defendant had no authority to receive or retain their overpayments,they cite no authority for this proposition.the property tax code mandates that defendant,as county collector,mail tax bills to property owners.ilcs west.tax payments received by the county collector in cook county must be disbursed on a monthly basis upon receipt to the taxing districts.see ilcs west.section imposes a monetary penalty for willful failure to disburse tax monies as required.ilcs west.we find nothing improper in defendant acceptance of plaintiffs payments.
we also reject plaintiffs claim that the estrays and lost property act ilcs et west applies to their payments.section of that act requires that any finder of lost money must notify the owner,if his or her identity is known,and return the money to the owner.ilcs west.plaintiffs argue that defendant knew the identity of those who made the payments at issue here,but made no effort to return the funds to plaintiffs.this argument lacks merit.plaintiffs did not lose their money.they intended to pay their money to defendant with the expectation that defendant apply the money to their respective property tax bills.
we now turn to the question of whether plaintiffs claims for refund are barred.this requires us to construe section of the code.the principles guiding our analysis are familiar.the primary objective in construing a statute is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature.general motors state of illinois motor vehicle review board.all other rules of statutory construction are subordin
