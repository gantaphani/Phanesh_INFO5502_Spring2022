in this appeal,we interpret revenue and taxation code sections section and section in the context of a bulk sale.a bulk sale is a sale of most or all of a business inventory and equipment.sections and apply when a business that owes sales or use taxes is being sold.section requires the buyer of the business or the business assets to withhold the amount of the taxes from the purchase price until the seller produces a receipt from the state board of equalization showing that the tax has been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due.section specifies that if the buyer fails to do this,the buyer becomes personally liable for the taxes to the extent of the purchase price.these statutes are known as successor liability statutes.
using the bulk sales law a procedure affording the creditors of a business that is being sold an opportunity to satisfy their claims before the business can transfer its assets,the buyers of the business here,john and walter schnyder the schnyders,through their escrow agent,filed an interpleader action with the purchase funds the idea was to allow the business multiple creditors,including the state sales and use tax agency,to resolve the amounts owed that tax agency,the state board of equalization the board,informed the schnyders that the issue of successor liability was not involved in the interpleader action,determined that the schnyders were personally liable as successors under section,and levied on the schnyders bank account to pay the taxes owed.
the schnyders sued the board for a tax refund,contesting the determination of successorship.the trial court agreed with the board,and awarded it summary judgment.we shall affirm the judgment.
background 
the relevant facts are undisputed.in the summer of,the schnyders contracted to buy the business assets of arbuckle food center,arbuckle,a grocery business,for slightly over.one of the contractual provisions required the schnyders to obtain tax clearance certificates from the board regarding arbuckle sales and use tax liabilities.
the schnyders proceeded under the bulk sales law and placed all of the approximately in purchase funds into an escrow account.california bulk sales law is found in division of the commercial code it is based on article of the national uniform commercial code the central purpose of the bulk sales law is to afford the creditors of a business that is being sold an opportunity to satisfy their claims before the business can transfer its assets and vanish with the sale proceeds the bulk sales law applies when a business sells more than half of its inventory and equipment in a sale that is not in the ordinary course of the business the law protects creditors by requiring that a specified advance notice of the sale be published and recorded,and that creditors be paid to the extent possible purchasers in a bulk sale often conduct the sale through an escrow a buyer who fails to comply with the notice and creditor payment requirements of the bulk sales law is liable to a claimant for damages in the amount of the claim,reduced by any amount the claimant would not have realized if the buyer had complied to address creditor claims,a bulk sale buyer or its escrow agent may file an interpleader action with the purchase funds 
in september,the schnyders escrow agent wrote to the board,informing it of the proposed sale and requesting a certificate of tax payment.in early november,the board responded with two letters.the first letter,termed a withhold letter,stated that the board,to issue the requested certificate,required a cash deposit of the entire purchase price as security pending the closeout of arbuckle sales tax liability.the second letter warned the schnyders that they could become liable for any unpaid sales and use taxes under the successor liability statutes if the board did not issue a certificate of payment,and that compliance with the bulk sales law would not extinguish this liability.
by january,the schnyders escrow agent had received multiple creditor claims against arbuckle that exceeded the escrow amount,including claims from the internal revenue service irs.pursuant to the bulk sales law,the escrow agent filed an interpleader complaint that named as defendants the irs and the board,among others the irs removed the action to federal court.
in may,the board determined that the schnyders were personally liable as successors for arbuckle unpaid sales and use tax liabilities,totaling approximately.in response,the schnyders escrow agent informed the board attorney that the pending interpleader action sought to resolve the board lien rights with respect to the arbuckle sale.the board attorney responded in a letter that the successorship issue as it relates to the board is not involved in the interpleader action.i would suggest that a petition for reconsideration of the board successorship determination against the schnyders be filed.the schnyders never petitioned for reconsideration the successorship determination became final in june.
in july,the parties resolved the interpleader action by stipulation.in the stipulation,the board disclaimed any interest it may have in the interpled funds.
the schnyders never had arbuckle produce a receipt from the board showing the taxes were paid or a certificate stating that no amount was due.the board levied on the schnyders bank account pursuant to its successorship determination.the board seized approximately to pay the tax owed.
the schnyders sued the board for a tax refund they argued that the interpleader action resolved the sales tax issue regarding successor liability.the board disagreed and moved for summary judgment it contended the schnyders were personally liable for the sales and use tax amount under sections and.the trial court agreed with the board and awarded it summary judgment.the schnyders have appealed that judgment.
discussion 
the schnyders contend they withheld the purchase funds in compliance with section by depositing those funds initially in escrow and then in the interpleader action where multiple and conflicting creditor claims are raised,interpleader under the bulk sales law is the appropriate course of conduct and the board is collaterally estopped from imposing successor liability on them given its stipulation in the interpleader action.
in this appeal we interpret the successor liability statutes against a set of undisputed facts.we are therefore presented with a question of law that we determine independently our objective in interpreting a statute is to determine legislative intent so as to effectuate the law purpose the first thing we do is read the statute,and give the words their ordinary meanings unless special definitions are provided if the meaning of the words is clear,then the language controls if not,we may use various interpretive aids here we find that the meaning of the pertinent words in sections and is clear and the language controls.
section provides

c failure of the b oard to mail the notice referred to in subdivision b will release the purchaser from any further obligation to withhold from the purchase price as above provided 
the purpose of sections and was enunciated nearly years ago by this court in people buckles,which construed the substantively similar forerunner to these sections
