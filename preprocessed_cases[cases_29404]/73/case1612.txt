section,article vi of the california constitution requires that the legislature prescribe compensation for judges of courts of record.the duty to prescribe judicial compensation is not delegable.thus the practice of the county of los angeles the county of providing los angeles county superior court judges with employment benefits,in addition to the compensation prescribed by the legislature,is not permissible.accordingly,we must reverse an order granting summary judgment in favor of the county in an action brought by a taxpayer who challenged the validity of the benefits the county provides to its superior court judges.
factual and procedural background 
judicial benefits provided by county 
although the record is not entirely clear,it appears that at some point in the late the county began providing its superior and municipal court judges with employment benefits in addition to the salary prescribed by the legislature.over the years that program has been expanded and altered as the county has modified the benefits it provides its salaried employees.
currently,the largest component of benefits provided to judges is the county contribution to its megaflex cafeteria benefit plan megaflex.the county pays its salaried employees an amount equal to percent of their monthly salary in the form of a tax free contribution to megaflex.each employee can use the county contribution to purchase medical,dental and vision coverage or life and disability insurances.any portion of the county contribution that is not used to purchase benefits is paid to the employee as taxable income.the county treats its superior court judges as salaried employees of the county for purpose of megaflex contributions and thus the county superior court judges receive megaflex contributions equal to percent of their salary 
in addition to the megaflex contributions,the county provides its judges with a professional development allowance pda.according to the county,the pda permits judges to participate in educational and professional development programs.each judge is given discretion in the manner in which his or her pda is expended.in fiscal year the pda amounted to per judge.
the county will also match the contribution of each of its salaried employees to a k program up to four percent of his or her salary.in fiscal year this amounted to an additional the judges were eligible to receive.finally,the record indicates that since july,the judges have also received employment benefits provided by the state.
in sum,in addition to the salary,benefits and retirement prescribed by the legislature,in fiscal year each superior court judge in los angeles was eligible to receive in benefits from the county.this amount represented approximately percent of their prescribed salary and cost the county approximately million in fiscal.
plaintiff challenge 
plaintiff and appellant harold sturgeon is a county resident and taxpayer.in april sturgeon filed a complaint against the county under code of civil procedure section in which he challenged the validity of the benefits the county provided its superior court judges.sturgeon alleged the benefits the county pays its judges are unlawful under cal,art.vi,cal,art xvi,and cal,et,among other relevant statutes and provisions of law,and constitutes an unconstitutional gift of public funds under cal,art xvi.sturgeon asked for declaratory and injunctive relief.
the county answered the complaint and moved for summary judgment.the county argued the benefits it provided to its judges were authorized by the trial court funding act of et stats,ch,and therefore were neither gifts nor a waste of public funds.the county argued that even in the absence of,the benefits were not gifts because,in light of the high cost of living in the los angeles area and the high salaries paid to lawyers in the region,the benefits were needed to attract and retain skilled and experienced judges.the county argued the legislature authorization of the benefits was not an impermissible delegation of the legislature duty to prescribe judicial compensation because the benefits were consistent with the legislature fundamental approach to judicial compensation and because the marketplace placed inherent limits on how much in the way of benefits the county would be willing to provide its judges.
the trial court granted the county motion.the court found the county benefits contributions were neither gifts of public funds nor a waste of public funds and in fact were authorized by.sturgeon filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
a defendant motion for summary judgment should be granted if no triable issue as to any issue exists as to any material fact and the defendant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.citation.we review the record and the determination of the trial court de novo.kahn east side union high school dist.cal th,d.
like the trial court,we do not believe sturgeon can establish that the benefits the county provides its judges are gifts of public funds which violate the terms of article xvi,section of our state constitution or amount to the waste of public funds within the meaning of code of civil procedure section.
by its terms,article xvi,section prevents the legislature from making or authorizing any gift of public funds for private purposes.this prohibition applies to counties and general law cities.see goodall brite d.the term gift in the constitutional provision includes all appropriations of public money for which there is no authority or enforceable claim,even if there is a moral or equitable obligation.citation.an appropriation of money by the legislature for the relief of one who has no legal claim therefor must be regarded as a gift within the meaning of that term,as used in this section,and it is none the less a gift that a sufficient motive appears for its appropriation,if the motive does not rest upon a valid consideration.
it is well settled that the primary question to be considered in determining whether an appropriation of public funds is to be considered a gift is whether the funds are to be used for a public or private purpose.if they are to be used for a public purpose,they are not a gift within the meaning of this constitutional prohibition.citation.citation.jordan department of motor vehicles th,d.importantly,t he determination of what constitutes a public purpose is primarily a matter for the legislature,and its discretion will not be disturbed by the courts so long as that determination has a reasonable basis.citations.county of alameda carleson cal d.
with respect to a public employer provision of benefits to its employees,including bonuses for work already performed,the cases have been fairly uniform in finding that such benefits serve public rather than private purposes.in jarvis cory cal d,the plaintiff challenged the legislature decision to award payments to certain state employees for work performed.in rejecting the plaintiff argument that the payments were gifts of public funds,the court stated t he legislature found that the adjustments made by the bill were necessary to ensure the continued recruitment and retention of qualified and competent state employees.we will not disturb the legislature finding of a public purpose so long as it has a reasonable basis.citation.
in this case,we can not doubt the substantiality of the purpose stated.nor can we doubt the legislation serves the purpose by assuring state employees they will not be abandoned in troubled times,and by raising salaries to a level more competitive with those in the private sector.jarvis cory,supra,cal d at,fn.
in san joaquin county employees,county of san joaquin d.a retroactive salary increase was also challenged as a gift of public funds.in rejecting the challenge,the court stated it is incontestable fact of governmental employment practices that governmental agencies must compete in the labor market with employers.such competition includes not only salaries but sick leave time,vacations and numerous other conditions of employment.it has been,for instance,a judicially noticeable practice of governmental agencies to correlate vacation time allowed to the years of service by an employee we cite these examples only to show that in the area of employment,public agencies must compete,and if to so compete they grant benefits to employees for past services,they are not making a gift of public money but are taking steps to further the governmental agency in recruiting the most competent employees in a highly competitive market.id.at.
as in jarvis cory and san joaquin county employee,county of san joaquin,here there can be little doubt the benefits that the county provides its judges enhance the recruitment and retention of judges who serve in los angeles.indeed,in support of its motion for summary judgment,the county relied upon a report on judicial compensation that found judicial salaries were not by themselves sufficient incentive to retain or recruit judges in the los angeles area.thus,as in jarvis cory and san joaquin county employee county of san joaquin,the benefits the county provides promote the public interest in recruiting and retaining high caliber judicial officers and therefore are not gifts within the meaning of article xvi,section of the constitution.
for much the same reason we must reject sturgeon contention that the benefits constitute waste within the meaning of code of civil procedure section.t he term waste as used in section means something more than an alleged mistake by public officials in matters involving the exercise of judgment or wide discretion.to hold otherwise would invite constant harassment of city and county officers by disgruntled citizens and could seriously hamper our representative form of government at the local level.thus,the courts should not take judicial cognizance of disputes which are primarily political in nature,nor should they attempt to enjoin every expenditure which does not meet with a taxpayer approval.on the other hand,a court must not close its eyes to wasteful,improvident and completely unnecessary public spending,merely because it is done in the exercise of a lawful power.citation.sundance municipal court cal d.
in county of ventura state bar th,d,the court,in discussing the propriety of ventura county payment of the noncompulsory portion of its attorney bar dues,stated the proper question in reviewing a perquisite of employment for waste of public funds is whether the perquisite is necessary or useful or provides a benefit to the public agency.citation.normally the answer will be yes.payment for a as vision care insurance,a private office,or a decent desk the public agency in that,as part of an overall employee benefits package,it helps attract and keep superior employees.such expenditures are beneficial,useful,and as a practical matter necessary to the staffing of a high quality office of public attorneys.
in this regard we recognize that the legislature,by way of,has assumed responsibility for trial court funding.however,even following,counties still have a continuing legitimate interest in assuring that the judges who administer justice to their residents are competent and skilled because they improve recruitment and retention of judicial officers,the disputed benefits the county provides serve a public purpose and thereby defeat sturgeon waste theory as well as his gift of public funds contention.
we also agree with the trial court that nothing in prevents the county from providing its judges with the disputed benefits,and in fact appears to contemplate payment of such benefits by the county.
section of states in pertinent part the legislature finds and declares f it is increasingly clear that the counties of california are no longer able to provide unlimited funding increases to the judiciary and,in some counties,financial difficulties and strain threaten the quality and timeliness of justice.stats,ch.in section the legislature declared its intention to a provide state responsibility for funding of trial court operations commencing in the fiscal year.b provide that county contributions to trial court operations shall be permanently capped at the same dollar amount as that county provided to court operations in the fiscal year with adjustments to the cap,as specified.c provide that the state of california shall assume full responsibility for any growth in costs of trial court operations thereafter.stats,ch.importantly,section,subdivision g of the act states in adopting this plan,the legislature intends to provide that no personnel employed in the court system as of july,shall have their salary or benefits reduced as a result of this act.
the legislature effected its intention of relieving counties of any increases in the costs of operating courts by requiring that,in fiscal year,each county submit to the department of finance an annual maintenance of effort moe payment which was set at the amount each county paid in the fiscal year for court operations,subd.b.of some relevance here,the legislature permitted counties to deduct from their moe payments the amount of benefits they provided to judges in the fiscal year,subd.c.under section,subdivision c,counties were required to submit a declaration to the department of finance that the amount it is required to submit to the state either includes or does not include the costs for local judicial benefits upon verification that the amount the county is required to submit to the state includes the costs of local judicial benefits,the department shall reduce the amount the county is required to submit to the state in which case the county shall continue to be responsible for the cost of those benefits.in the event there was any dispute with department of finance as to the amount of either the moe or the deduction for judicial benefits,the counties were permitted to ask for an audit by the controller,subds.c,d.
contrary to sturgeon contention,the deduction for judicial benefits permitted under section,subdivision c,was not limited to deductions from the moe due for fiscal.by way of section the legislature reduced each county respective moe for each year after fiscal and in section,subdivision b,expressly continued the adjustments permitted by section,subdivision c.
although section,subdivision c,permitted counties to request an audit in the event there was any dispute as to the amount of the adjustment for judicial benefits,such an audit was not required in order to make the adjustment.thus contrary to sturgeon alternative argument,the reference in section,subdivision b,to the procedures set forth in section,subdivision c,including in particular the audit procedures,can not be read as limiting the judicial benefits adjustment to counties which in fact requested an audit.as the trial court noted,such a reading of the statutes would have required a county to request an audit even when the department of finance did not challenge the amount the county submitted in its declaration.we can not adopt a statutory construction which would lead to such an absurd consequence.see lungren deukmejian cal d.
for our purposes the most significant aspect of is what is not in the act nothing on the face of the statute prevents a county from continuing to provide judicial benefits,such as those the county provides its judges.the provisions of that the parties have vigorously circumstances under which a county may receive an adjustment of its moe for the payment of such not directly impact sturgeon claims.even if did not provide for an adjustment for judicial benefits,the statute would not otherwise prevent payment of the benefits by the county.rather,in the absence of the adjustments allowed by section,subdivision c,and,the cost of the benefits would be borne entirely by the county.
although the adjustment provisions of do not directly impact sturgeon claims,they are relevant in that they support the county contention that the legislature was well aware of the benefits the county provides and,in permitting the adjustments,expressly approved the benefits.this inference is of course buttressed by the express statement in section of that the legislature intended that no court personnel suffer any reduction in salary or benefits.the inference is also supported by the provisions of section,which was enacted in and provides in pertinent part employees of the superior court in each county having a population of over shall be entitled to step advancement,vacation,sick leave,holiday benefits and other leaves of absence and other benefits as may be directed by rules of the court.where statutes require implementation by local ordinance for the extension of benefits to local officers and employees,these may be made applicable by rule to court personnel,including but not limited to jurors,and judges.los angeles local rule in turn provides in accordance with government code section all county of los angeles benefits extended to employees and local officers by local ordinance are applicable to superior court of california,county of los angeles,personnel,jurors and judges.super.county,local rules,rule see also.
in sum,does not prevent payment of judicial benefits beyond the compensation set by the legislature but,under any fair reading of the act,authorizes them.
the fact the legislature appears to have authorized the benefits by way of does not end our inquiry.section,article vi of the california constitution requires that the legislature prescribe compensation for judges of record.italics added.in sevier riley cal,the court interpreted the precursor to this portion of section,article vi,and stated there is no room for doubt as to the interpretation to be given to this clause in said amendment to the constitution,since it makes manifest as clearly and tersely as words could do the intent of the framers thereof that the entire matter of the compensation of justices and judges of courts of record in this state,both as to the amount thereof and as to the time and manner of payment thereof,should be transferred from the constitution and reposed in the legislature.this is made all the more manifest when we take note of the meaning of the word prescribed as employed therein.the term prescribe is defined by the lexicographers as meaning,to lay down beforehand as a rule of action to ordain,appoint,define authoritatively.century dictionary.to lay down beforehand as a guide,direction,or rule of action to impose as a peremptory order to dictate,appoint,direct,ordain.in sevier riley the court considered a previously adopted constitutional limitation on the legislature ability to increase salaries and noted the substantial disparities it created among the salaries that could be paid to judges in various counties.id.at.the court found in light of the clear intention of the amendment to give the legislature unfettered authority over judicial compensation,that limitation was repealed by implication.id.at.
attorney general opinions 
in two opinions the attorney general has concluded that in light of section,article v,counties may not lawfully provide superior court judges with the same employment benefits they provide their own employees.see.in the attorney general first opinion he was asked about the version of government code section.by way of sections the legislature authorized local governments,including counties,to provide health and welfare benefits to their officers and employees.in section the legislature further provided for the limited purpose of this article,judges of the superior and municipal courts and the officers and attaches of said courts whose salaries are paid either in whole or in part from the salary fund of the county are county employees.stats,ch.in finding this provision unconstitutional,the attorney general noted a duty which is prescribed by the constitution is a duty,supra,at see also county of madera superior court d,fn.thus the attorney general noted any attempt to delegate such a duty would be unconstitutional,supra,at.the attorney general,based on his prior opinions and on legislative reports on the issue,further concluded employee benefits were part of an employee compensation.ibid.
the attorney general noted a legislative body may give another administrative body the power to determine facts subject to a rule or standard determined by the legislature and thereby avoid an improper delegation of its power,supra,at.several equally well established principles,however,serve to limit the scope of the doctrine proscribing delegations of legislative power.for example,legislative power may properly be delegated if channeled by a sufficient standard.kugler yocum cal d,see also blumenthal board of medical examiners cal d.however,the attorney general concluded the power channeled to the counties by section is totally without standards and thus would not satisfy this requirement set forth in kugler,supra,at.
in response to the attorney general first opinion,the legislature amended section by adding to the first sentence of the statute the phrase and shall be subject to the same or similar obligations and be granted the same or similar employee benefits as are now required or granted to employees of the county in which the court of said judge,officer,or attache is located.stats,ch.in his second opinion the attorney general found the amended statute was invalid for the same reason the original statute was defective a s was the case prior to the amendment,the legislature authorizes the individual county legislative bodies to determine if,and in what form,and to what extent judges shall be compensated with health insurance benefits.citation.there is a complete absence of effective legislatively established standards to guide county authorities in the making of this determination.the legislature has thus failed to address itself to those omissions that caused the original statute to be constitutionally defective,supra,at.
the county asks that we reject the attorney general opinions.in particular,the county argues the attorney general erred in concluding employee benefits are part of judicial compensation within the meaning of section,article vi of the california constitution.the county relies on the legislature enactment in of section,which states whenever a section of the california constitution uses both the terms salary and compensation,with respect to a public officer or employee,the terms shall apply only to salary.the legislative history of section indicates it was enacted as a means of excluding employee benefits from the term compensation wherever the terms compensation and salary appeared in a single provision of the constitution.see off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of bill reg.sess,off.of local affairs,enrolled bill on bill reg.sess.by its terms,section applies to section,article vi,because the second paragraph of the constitutional provision prevents any judge from receiving his or her salary if any matter before the judge has been pending more than days.
we recognize we owe deference to interpretations of constitutional provisions enacted by the legislature.see methodist hosp.of sacramento saylor cal d,san francisco industrial acc.com.cal.however,such a legislative construction is only permitted i f the terms of a statute are by fair and reasonable interpretation capable of a meaning consistent with the constitution.county of los angeles legg cal d.
our consideration of the express language of section,article vi,its origins and purposes and the potential consequences of adopting a narrow interpretation of its scope,convince us that notwithstanding section,the employment benefits provided by the county are part of each judge compensation and therefore must be prescribed by the legislature.
constitutional interpretation 
the principles of constitutional interpretation are similar to those governing statutory construction.in interpreting a constitution provision,our paramount task is to ascertain the intent of those who enacted it.citation.to determine that intent,we look first to the language of the constitutional text,giving the words their ordinary meaning.citation.if the language is clear,there is no need for construction.citation.if the language is ambiguous,however,we consider extrinsic evidence of the enacting body intent.citations.thompson department of corrections cal th,d.in interpreting constitutional provisions,courts have relied on such extrinsic evidence as ballot materials and contemporaneous interpretations by the legislature and administrative agencies.see silicon valley taxpayers,santa clara county open space authority cal th,d,itt world communications,city and county of san francisco cal d.
express language 
the ordinary and common understanding of the word compensation is broad,unrestricted and encompassing s omething given or received as an equivalent for services,debt,loss,injury,suffering lack,the random house dict.of the english language ed,italics added.something given or received as an equivalent or as reparation for a loss,service,or debt a recompense an indemnity.the american heritage dict.of the english language,italics added.p ayment for value received or service rendered remuneration.webster third new internat.dict.of the english language unabridged.remunerate itself is defined as t o pay,recompense,or reward for work,trouble,the random house dict.of the english language,supra,at.importantly,in its common understanding the term compensation is not restricted to any particular method or mode of payment the ordinary meaning of the term compensation,as applied to officers,is remuneration in whatever form it may be given,whether it be salaries and fees,or both combined.state bland,italics added cited by black law dict.ed.
although in many contexts salary is used interchangeably with compensation see sevier riley,supra,cal.at,martin santa barbara cal,salary is usually defined somewhat more narrowly than compensation.s alary a fixed compensation periodically paid to a person for regular work or services.the random house dict.of the english language,supra,at.a fixed compensation for services,paid to a person on a regular basis.the american heritage dict.of the english language,supra.f ixed compensation paid regularly as by the year,quarter,month,or week for services.webster third new internat.dict.of the english language unabridged,supra.salary in a more limited sense a fixed periodical compensation paid for services rendered a stated compensation,amounting to so much by the year,month,or other fixed period,to be paid to public officers and persons in some private employments,for the performance of official duties or the rendering of services of a particular kind,more or less definitely described,involving professional knowledge or skill,or at least employment above the grade of menial or mechanical labor.black law,supra.
still narrower than compensation or salary is the related term wages.wages are money that is paid or received for work or services,as by the hour,day,or week.the random house dict.of the english language,supra,at.alternatively,a wage is p ayment for services to a workman usually,remuneration on an hourly,daily,or weekly basis or by the piece.the american heritage dict.of the english language,supra.significantly,wage has also been defined as a pledge or payment of monetary remuneration by an employer for labor or services according to contract and on an hourly basis and often including bonuses,commissions,and amounts paid by the employer for insurance,pension,hospitalization,and other benefits.webster third new internat.dict.of the english language unabridged,supra.
given the breadth of the term compensation,any common understanding of it includes the employment benefits the county provides its judges.in this regard it is significant for us that in a host of cases that have arisen since the middle of the last century,when such benefits became relatively commonplace,courts have uniformly determined such benefits are part of an employee compensation,salary or wages.in wise southern pac.cal d,the defendant in a wrongful discharge case argued that because under its collective bargaining agreement it was only required to pay an unfairly dismissed employee his lost wages,the plaintiff should not have been provided a recovery which included the cost of replacing his fringe benefits.in rejecting this argument,the court stated e ven if it be assumed without deciding that the contract could properly limit plaintiff damages to the extent and in the respect for which defendant contends,it is our view that in an action for wrongful discharge,and pursuant to the present day concept of relations,the term wages should be deemed to include not only the periodic monetary earnings of the employee but also the other benefits to which he is entitled as a part of his compensation.ibid.
in ware merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,d,the plaintiff argued amounts due under the terms of his employer profit sharing plan were part of his wages within the meaning of labor code section,which prevented employers from compelling arbitration of wage disputes.in agreeing with the plaintiff and finding the plaintiff claim to amounts due under the profit sharing plan were not subject to arbitration,the court stated in its legal sense,the word wage has been given a broad,general definition so as to include compensation for services rendered without regard to the manner in which such compensation is computed.ibid.
in foremost dairies industrial acc.com.d,the court rejected an employer contention it should receive a credit against its workers compensation liability to an injured worker for amounts paid on behalf of the worker by an health plan.the court rejected the claim because it determined the benefits,whether funded by the employee or the employer,were part of the employee wages t he record discloses that the policy was provided by the employer as a fringe benefit to the employee and as such formed a portion of the wages paid to decedent as an employee.thus,in effect,the employee paid the premiums.the result is the same whether the employer paid the premiums as an employment benefit to the employee or whether he paid the employee direct and the employee procured his own private medical insurance.ibid.
in martin city county of d,the court was called upon to interpret a city charter provision which required certain skilled workers receive the same rate of pay as their counterparts in the private sector.in the private sector those workers received an hourly wage plus health benefits.the court found the city could not deduct the cost of the workers health benefits without diminishing their rate of pay.i t is clear that in the instant case the plaintiffs were not receiving the same take home pay as their counterparts in private industry,because of the compulsory deduction by the employer for the city health plan.id.at.
the holding and rationale in people alves,d supp,has additional import here because in that case the court found health and welfare benefits were wages within the meaning of our constitution.in people alves the defendant was charged with a misdemeanor violation of the labor code for failing to pay the benefits required under a collective bargaining agreement.the defendant argued that under our constitution he could not be imprisoned for debt.see former art.i,cal.const.in rejecting the defendant argument,the court noted an employer liability for wages was not a debt subject to the constitutional proscription against imprisonment for debt and criminal liability was imposed for failure to pay wages.the court then found the health and welfare benefits were part of an employee wages within the meaning of the constitution.there is no doubt that payments to a health or welfare fund made as part of the compensation for services rendered by employees are wages as that word is used in the foregoing case.people alves,supra,d supp.at.
we agree with the county contention that at the time the predecessor of section,article vi,was adopted by voters in,employment benefits such as the ones the county provides were not as commonplace as they are today.however,they were not entirely unknown.for instance,in the legislature adopted a n act to create a police relief,health,and life insurance and pension fund in the several counties,cities and counties,and towns of the state.stats.it provided police officers in the state with a pension and as well as disability and death benefits.moreover,in the late and early centuries the term compensation was,like it is today,interpreted broadly rather than narrowly.see state bland,supra,at western metal supply pillsbury cal,martin santa barbara,supra,at.
in addition to the fact employment benefits somewhat similar to those provided by the county existed in limited areas of the employment market in when the predecessor section,article vi,was adopted,we note such benefits were widespread in when the legislature placed on the ballot and the voters adopted,as part of the comprehensive revision of the constitution,section,article vi,as it now appears.the drafters of the constitution certainly were aware both that employers provided such benefits and that courts consistently found such benefits were part of an employee wages or salary.
in sum,the term compensation is itself broad,and courts have had no difficulty over the last more than in repeatedly finding employment benefits such as the county provides are part of the relatively narrower terms wages or rate of pay.moreover,during that period of time,when such employment benefits became more commonplace,the people readopted the broad language which now appears in section,article vi.under these circumstances,where the plain meaning of the constitution appears to clearly encompass the benefits in dispute,arguably our analysis is complete.see itt world communications,city and county of san francisco,supra,cal d at.however,in an abundance of caution,we will nonetheless consider whether any variance from that plain meaning can be found in either the history surrounding the limitation or any manifestation of its underlying purposes.ibid.
judicial compensation 
the ballot materials with respect to both the amendment which initially gave the responsibility for setting judicial compensation and the revision which readopted that delegation of responsibility do not discuss judicial compensation.admittedly,we do have,in section,the legislature interpretation of compensation.however,as the court noted in city and county of san francisco county of san mateo cal th,d,it is contemporaneous constructions by the legislature which are persuasive in interpreting ambiguous provisions of our constitution.see also board of supervisors lonergan cal d.the enactment of section was by no means contemporaneous with either the adoption of an amendment giving the legislature the obligation of prescribing compensation or the reenactment of that provision as part of the comprehensive revision of the constitution thus we turn to the historical origins of the term compensation as it has been used with respect to the judiciary.
concern over judicial compensation existed at the time the federal constitution was adopted.the federal constitution compensation clause guarantees federal judges a compensation,which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office,art.iii.t he compensation clause,along with the clause securing federal judges appointments during good behavior,art.iii,practical equivalent of life to guarantee what alexander hamilton called the complete independence of the courts of justice.the federalist,rossiter ed.hamilton thought these guarantees necessary because the judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three branches of government,at.it has no influence over either the sword or the purse,at.it has no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society.ibid.it has neither force nor will but merely judgment.united states hatter,d.
the drafters of our state constitution went further in protecting judicial independence by limiting not only the power of the legislature to reduce the compensation of judges during their respective terms of office,but also in preventing the legislature from raising judges compensation.article vi,section of the constitution provided judges shall r eceive for their services a compensation which shall not be increased or diminished during the term for which they shall have been elected.the drafter of the constitution carried this limitation forward.see art.vi.in addition to continuing this limitation,the drafters of the constitution added a separate provision which stated no judge of a superior court nor of the supreme court shall,after the first day of july,one thousand eight hundred and eighty,be allowed to draw or receive any monthly salary unless he shall take and subscribe an affidavit before an officer entitled to administer oaths,that no cause in his court remains undecided that has been submitted for decision for the period of ninety days.art.vi.
in the judicial compensation provision of the constitution,article vi,section,was amended.stats,xxvii.under the amendment the compensation of justices of the supreme court and courts of appeal were set by the constitution itself at annual salaries of and respectively.ibid.with respect to the superior court judges,the amended version of section provided the salaries of the judges of the superior court,in all counties having but one judge,and in all counties in which the terms of the judges of the superior court expire at the same time,shall not hereafter be increased or diminished after their election,nor during the term for which they shall have been elected.ibid.as the court in sevier riley explained,this limitation on judicial salaries combined with the legislature addition of new judges in various counties created some disparity among the salaries paid to superior court judges t he state legislature,responding to the demands of the more populous counties of california,due to their increase in population and corresponding increase in litigation,adopted various enactments increasing,and in some counties again and again increasing,the number of superior judges assigned to such regions,and in so doing provided for the expiration of the terms of these additional judicial officers at different times from that of those holding office under previous conditions of the law.the result of these changes in the statutes,especially since,has been that of enabling a goodly number of counties of the state to be exempted from the constitutional inhibition against an increase in the salaries of their respective terms of office,by the simple expedient of adding one or more to the number of their superior court judges with terms expiring at different times than those already provided.the result of these changes in the constitution and statutes prior to and up to the year was this that as to the supreme and appellate justices the salaries of these,both as to the amount and payment thereof,were rigidly fixed by the terms of section of article vi of the constitution that as to superior judges the salaries of these were subject to fixation by the legislature,limited by the provision in said section of article vi of the constitution to the effect that in counties having but one superior judge,or,if more,having the terms of these expiring at the same time,there should be no legislative increase in the salaries of these one or more judges which could become effective during their terms of office while as to counties which had by legislative action effected an increase in the number of their judges so worded as to make the terms of their judgeships expire at different times,the constitutional inhibition was inapplicable and that the increases in such salaries as the legislature from time to time provided for in such counties became effective immediately.sevier riley,supra,cal.at.
in the voters approved a number of amendments to the constitution,including an amendment establishing the municipal courts.in addition to establishing municipal courts,the amendment added the following language to section,article vi the compensation of the justices or judges of all courts of record,shall be fixed and the payment thereof prescribed by the legislature.stats,xxv.although the amendment adopting this provision did not expressly repeal the limitations of former section,article vi,in sevier riley the court found those limitations had by implication been repealed.the court found retention of the earlier limitations would be hostile to the spirit and intent of the amendment in so far as the latter was designed to commit the matter of judicial salaries in all these various courts of record to the flexible control of the legislature rather than to the rigid limitations of the constitution.sevier riley,supra,cal.at.
in the constitution was once again revised,and section,article vi,was adopted in its current form.the first sentence of section,article vi,is derived from former section,article vi of the constitution,and the second sentence is the same language which appeared in former section,article vi of the constitution 
nothing in the foregoing history of section,article vi,suggests that at any time since the term compensation was first used in the constitution in did the drafters intend that it have a narrow or constrained meaning.rather,it is clear that while the drafters of the and constitutions were,like the drafters of the federal constitution,concerned about protecting judges from political influence,in those concerns gave way to a concern that judges be paid on some rational and relatively uniform basis.neither the need to provide protection from political influence nor the desire to give the legislature plenary power over compensation as a means of promoting rationality and uniformity support a narrow reading of the term compensation.
the county judicial benefits 
on this record,notwithstanding section,the benefits the county provides to judges are compensation within the meaning of section,article vi.the megaflex benefits provided by the county equal percent of a judge salary and judges may elect to receive that benefit in cash as taxable income.the judges are not limited in the manner in which they choose to use their respective pda and that,if they are willing to suffer the adverse tax consequences,they can have access to their k accounts.thus the judges have a great deal of control over the benefits once they are paid.we also note that the county,in opposing sturgeon gift and waste theories,made a convincing case both in the trial court and here on appeal that the benefits were needed for recruitment and retention.in this factual context,any common understanding of the term compensation would include these benefits because of the judge access to them once they are paid and because of the purpose they serve.
in addition,we believe the benefits are compensation within the meaning of the constitution because collectively the benefits substantially increase the amount los angeles judges receive for their services.the size of the benefits and the resulting potential for disparity with the remuneration paid to judges in other counties directly implicates the very reasons the legislature was given plenary power over judicial compensation by way of adoption of the precursor to section,article vi.see sevier riley,supra,cal.at.
prescribed compensation 
the county also argues that even if the judicial benefits it provides are compensation within the meaning of section,article vi of the constitution,the legislature has adequately prescribed those benefits.as we explain more fully below,we do not find any statutory provision or other enactment which meets the requirements of the constitution.
prescribed duties 
when the constitution has prescribed a duty the named authority must itself exercise the function described in other words,it imposes a nondelegable duty.the more general term provide is used when it is intended not to require action by the named authority itself in other words,it permits the delegation of the function to others.judicial council of california,annual report to the governor and the legislature,fn.omitted see also sevier riley,supra,cal.at,county of madera superior court,supra,d at.importantly,even when a legislative body bears a nondelegable duty,it may nonetheless permit other bodies to take action based on a general principle established by the legislative body so long as the legislature provides either standards or safeguards which assure that the legislature fundamental policy is effectively carried out.kugler yocum cal d.we have said that the purpose of the doctrine that legislative power can not be delegated is to assure that truly fundamental issues will be resolved by the legislature and that a grant of authority is accompanied by safeguards adequate to prevent its abuse.citations.this doctrine rests upon the premise that the legislative body must itself effectively resolve the truly fundamental issues.it can not escape responsibility by explicitly delegating that function to others or by failing to establish an effective mechanism to assure the proper implementation of its policy decisions.ibid.
in kugler yocum,supra,cal d,the court considered a proposed ordinance which set the minimum salary of firefighters in the city of alhambra by reference to the average pay of firefighters in the city of los angeles.in the instant case,the adoption of the proposed ordinance,either through promulgation by the alhambra city council or by initiative,will constitute the legislative body resolution of the fundamental issue.once the legislative body has determined the issue of policy,that the alhambra wages for firemen should be on a parity with los angeles,that body has resolved the fundamental issue the subsequent filling in of the facts in application and execution of the policy does not constitute legislative delegation.thus the decision on the legislative policy has not been delegated the implementation of the policy by reference to los angeles salaries is not the delegation of it.id.at.the court found the proposed ordinance would not have unlawfully delegated alhambra function to another body because of the inherent interest of los angeles in not paying excessive salaries.id.at.
the court reached a similar conclusion in martin county of contra costa d.martin.in martin the court approved legislation which set the salary of municipal court attaches in contra costa county at the same rate as comparable county employees and expressly provided the court employees would be entitled to the same raises as their counterparts in the county.in finding the legislature met its constitutional obligation to prescribe the salaries of municipal court attaches by tieing their salaries and benefits of other county employees,the court stated this provision is not an abdication of the legislature duty to prescribe the compensation of the attaches of each municipal court.it fixes the compensation of the employees,declares a policy that such compensation shall be commensurate with that furnished county employees with equivalent responsibilities and provides for interim changes,subject to review by the legislature,in the event there are local changes which would otherwise cause discrepancies in compensation in violation of the legislative policy.id.at.
constitutional considerations 
in the context of judicial compensation,we must carefully observe the limits of legislative delegation.as we have seen,early drafters of our constitution were concerned about protecting the judicial branch from excessive and improper political influence and imposed rigid limits on judicial compensation.in the interests of bringing rationality and uniformity to judicial compensation,the responsibility of protecting the judiciary has now been left largely in the hands of the legislature.because the legislative responsibility with respect to judicial compensation,including of necessity the participation of the executive branch in the legislative process,is now the principal means of protecting the independence of the judicial branch in considering compensation judges receive we must be careful that in fact the legislature has exercised its prescriptive role.in particular,unlike the concern employees might receive excessive pay which animated the litigation in kugler yocum and martin,we must in addition be sensitive to the potential that,in the absence of proper direction from the legislature,judges might be subject to substantial variations in compensation determined solely by local authorities.
the county judicial benefits 
we have been unable to identify any enactment of the legislature which prescribes the judicial benefits the county pays its judges.
although its framework is similar to the enactments considered in kugler yocum and martin,as the attorney general concluded,section does not fully meet the requirements of the constitution.under section,subdivisio
