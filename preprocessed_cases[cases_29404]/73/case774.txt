jerry crum medical license was revoked under missouri revised statutes section supp,because he failed to file state income tax returns for,and.although crum license was reinstated after he belatedly filed his returns,he brought this action against the missouri director of revenue the director and the missouri board of the healing arts the board.the lawsuit seeks a declaration that section violated several of crum rights under federal and missouri law,including his rights to due process and equal protection,and that the revocation of his license was void.he also seeks damages and a mandatory injunction directing the board to expunge all records of the revocation.the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case.crum appeals,and we affirm.
crum has been licensed to practice medicine in missouri since.although he knew he was required to file income tax returns with the missouri department of revenue the department,he did not do so for tax years,and.he later explained that he did not consider filing his returns to be a priority,because he believed that he was entitled to a refund for each year.
in,the missouri general assembly passed house bill,section of which was codified as missouri revised statutes section.see.legis.serv,west.section requires many missouri licensing boards to report the names and social security numbers of licensees to the director.if the director discovers that any licensee is delinquent on state taxes or has failed to file a tax return in the last three years,the director must send the licensee a notice indicating this delinquency or failure.as of,unless the director could verify that the licensee had made arrangements to remedy the delinquency or failure to file,the licensee license was revoked ninety days after the mailing of the notice other sections of house bill provided for sanctions on state employees,judges,and elected state officials who fail to pay taxes or file their tax returns.see.legis.serv,west,codified as.supp.
in late,the board sent crum a license renewal packet containing a note that explained the operation of section.on january,crum signed a license renewal application included in the packet and mailed it to the board.
on january,shortly before crum submitted his renewal application,the department mailed crum notices that he had not filed his state income tax returns for,and.these notices also stated that if he did not file his returns within ninety days,his missouri medical license would be revoked by operation of law.
the department received only an irrelevant federal tax form in response,with no explanation of crum failure to file returns or why he had sent the federal form.the department then sent crum another letter on february,explaining that it still required his missouri tax returns with all schedules and forms.
after receiving no further response from crum,on april,the director mailed crum notices of deficiency for tax years,and.these notices calculated crum total tax liability at,including interest.they represented crum final notice to pay the taxes,and advised crum that he could object by filing a protest with the department.they also informed crum that he must respond in some form by april.if he did not respond,the notices of deficiency automatically would become a final assessment of his tax liability after sixty days,without any further notice to him.crum acknowledges that he received these deficiency notices and that he made no effort to protest or appeal.
finally,on june,the director sent a certificate of to the board.the certificate indicated that ninety days had elapsed since the department informed crum that he had failed to file tax returns,and that crum had not remedied this failure.accordingly,the certificate concluded,pursuant to section,the professional license shall be revoked.the board then mailed crum a letter on june,informing him that his medical license was revoked by operation of law as of july.after crum license was revoked on july,the board reported this revocation to the healthcare integrity and protection data bank,the national practitioner data bank,and the federation of state medical boards of the united states.
crum claims that before he received the june letter from the board,he was unaware that his license could be revoked if he failed to file his tax returns.nonetheless,he apparently took no action in response to this letter until july,when he called the department to request an extension of time to file his returns and was informed that the department did not grant extensions for house bill accounts.crum did not actually file his returns until september,when he submitted them in person at the department of revenue jefferson city office.when he did so,the department issued crum a certificate of tax compliance.crum then presented this certificate to the board,which reinstated his license the same day.
crum claims that section deprives a licensee of property without due process of law,in violation of the fourteenth amendment and article i,section of the missouri constitution.generally speaking,these constitutional provisions prohibit the state from depriving a person of his property without notice and an opportunity to be heard.jones flowers,d conseco fin.servicing missouri of revenue.crum contends that section deprived him of a property right in his license,without either the requisite notice or opportunity to be heard.the defendants concede that crum has a property interest in his license,but argue that section provides sufficient notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
the due process clause requires notice that is reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.mullane cent.hanover bank trust.it does not require a showing by the state that an interested party received actual notice,jones.at,and n otice by mail is ordinarily presumed to be constitutionally sufficient.nunley dep t of justice,cir.
section requires that the department inform a licensee of his tax deficiency and then wait ninety allow the licensee to cure the a license is revoked.crum received notice three times the january notices,the february letter,and the april notices.he concedes that the notices were sent to the correct address and acknowledges receiving the april notices.although he suggests that his staff may have misplaced the other notices,he has not identified any unusual circumstances that would have made notice by mail inadequate.jones.at.thus,the state repeatedly provided crum with notice that he had failed to file his tax returns and specifically gave notice in the january mailings that this failure could lead to the revocation of his license.crum therefore received constitutionally adequate notice.
crum also claims that the state could not revoke his license until he received a hearing.the state satisfied the requirements of due process,however,by giving crum an opportunity for a hearing at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.see armstrong manzo,d.the tax deficiency notices mailed to crum in april explained how he could request a hearing to challenge the department assessment.crum never received such a hearing simply because he never requested one.
we also reject crum argument that he was constitutionally entitled to opportunities for two to challenge the tax deficiency and another to challenge the revocation of his license.so long as one hearing will provide the affected individual with a meaningful opportunity to be heard,due process does not require two hearings on the same issue.see goldberg kelly,d mitchell fankhauser,cir holding a hearing was required where a hearing was insufficiently meaningful.both the director finding of a tax deficiency and the subsequent license revocation had the same factual failure to file his tax returns.a license revocation hearing could add nothing to a tax deficiency hearing in this case,because the outcome of the tax hearing would necessarily determine the outcome of the revocation hearing.crum had notice that he could lose his license if he failed to file his returns,and
