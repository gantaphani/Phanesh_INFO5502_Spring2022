opinion on rehearing 
respondent cingular wireless,llc cingular advertised a cellular phone for sale at half the retail price if the purchaser also enrolled in a calling plan package.the california code of regulations requires that sales tax be computed on the price of the product.the regulation permits,but does not require,that the charge be passed on to the customer.cingular did so without informing the customer prior to sale that the tax would be based on the full price of the cell phone.the amount of tax is shown on the sales invoice furnished to the customer at the time of sale.
appellant richard yabsley alleged that cingular engaged in unfair competition in violation of business and professions code section and misleading advertising in violation of section by failing to inform the consumer that the tax would be imposed on the full price of the cell phone.the trial court sustained cingular demurrer to yabsley first amended complaint without leave to amend finding that the provisions of california code of regulations,title,section regulation requiring that the sales tax be calculated based on the price of the phone and permitting the retailer to collect this amount from the customer provided a safe harbor from such claims.we affirm on that basis and also for the reasons stated in the recent decision of loeffler target corporation th,d.
factual and procedural history 
cingular advertised a cell phone for,a percent reduction in the phone retail price,if the purchaser enrolled in a cingular wireless calling plan.yabsley saw the advertisement and purchased the cell phone with the calling plan.when he received the sales receipt,he noticed that the sales tax was imposed on the regular price of the cell phone,rather than the discounted price of,resulting in the payment of more in sales tax than he had anticipated.
yabsley filed a class action complaint for declaratory relief against the state board of equalization board,asserting that regulation,governing taxation of sales of wireless communication devices,was invalid because it conflicted with revenue and taxation code section imposing a sales tax on gross receipts.
yabsley filed a first amended complaint fac,naming the board and cingular as defendants,but dismissed the board the same day.the fac alleges that cingular advertising practices were deceptive under sections and by failing to apprise prospective customers that sales tax would be charged on the undiscounted price of the cell phone.
cingular filed a demurrer asserting it has immunity from such a claim under the safe harbor provided by regulation.this regulation requires that sales tax on a bundled cell phone sale,a cell phone purchased with a call plan,be calculated based on the phone higher,unbundled price.
prior to a hearing on cingular demurrer,yabsley sought to file a second amended complaint sac.the proposed sac added a claim that cingular violated the consumer legal remedies act clra,civil code section et.the trial court denied the motion for leave to file the sac and,after hearing on the fac,the court sustained cingular demurrer without leave to amend and entered a judgment of dismissal.
after we filed a published opinion affirming the trial court judgment,we were informed by the california attorney general that the parties were required to notify it of any lawsuit involving the unfair competition law ucl and false advertising law fal,cal.rules of court,rule.we granted the attorney general leave to intervene and ordered a rehearing.we granted requests by cingular to file a supplemental brief and by the state board of equalization to file an amicus curiae brief.
subsequently,we requested and received supplemental briefing by the parties on the issue of whether yabsley had standing to bring this action.prior to oral argument,our colleagues in division three of this court decided loeffler target corporation,supra,th,d.we invited supplemental briefing from the parties as to whether loeffler is applicable.

standard of review 
when reviewing an order sustaining a demurrer,we review the trial court ruling de novo,exercising our independent judgment to determine whether the complaint states a cause of action under any legal theory.citation.we accept as true the properly pleaded allegations of facts in the complaint,but not the contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.ochs pacificare of california th,d.it is the validity of the trial court action in sustaining the demurrer,not its reasons,which is reviewable.rodas spiegel th,d.
the revenue and taxation code provides the exclusive method for obtaining sales tax reimbursement 
the ucl prohibits any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.california fal prohibits advertising property or services with untrue or misleading statements or with the intent not to sell at the advertised price.quelimane stewart title guaranty cal th,d.the remedies for violation of the ucl and fal are equitable in nature,injunction and restitution.buckland threshold enterprises,th,d.
the holding in loeffler precludes yabsley claim for a refund or reimbursement of sales tax collected by cingular.in that case,the plaintiffs filed a complaint seeking reimbursement of sales tax collected by target on coffee they purchased to go.they alleged that target was precluded from collecting sales tax on food items by revenue and taxation code section.among other remedies,they sought restitution and injunctive relief under the ucl and clra.with respect to the ucl,plaintiffs alleged that target was engaged in unfair and unlawful business acts or practices by imposing sales tax on the purchase of coffee to go and for take out.they sought to enjoin target from improperly charging sales tax to consumers and restitution of the sales tax paid.with respect to the clra,plaintiffs alleged target misrepresented that it had the legal right to charge consumers sales tax on coffee purchased to go or for take out.they sought reimbursement from target for the amount of sales tax wrongfully collected.
the court of appeal affirmed the trial court dismissal of the action after a demurrer was sustained without leave to amend.the court ruled that the action was barred by article xiii,section,of the california constitution and that the administrative remedies in the revenue and taxation code were the exclusive means by which to recover sales taxes wrongfully collected.
article xiii,section of the california constitution states no legal or equitable process shall issue in any proceeding in any court against this state or any officer thereof to prevent or enjoin the collection of any tax.after payment of a tax claimed to be illegal,an action may be maintained to recover the tax paid,with interest,in such manner as may be provided by the legislature.in compliance with this constitutional mandate,the legislature has adopted a comprehensive system permitting retailers to file administrative claims with the board and lawsuits challenging imposition of sales taxes and obtaining sales tax reimbursement.
the legislature has provided that filing a claim with the board is a prerequisite to maintaining a suit for a refund of sales taxes.revenue and taxation code section states no suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any amount alleged to have been erroneously or illegally determined or collected unless a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed pursuant to article commencing with section.the purpose of requiring a taxpayer to file a claim with the board before commencing a tax refund lawsuit is to give the board an opportunity to correct any mistakes.loeffler target corporation,supra,th at,d,citing preston state bd.of equalization cal th,d.
the statutory scheme provides a remedy for consumers such as yabsley.revenue and taxation code section requires a retailer who has collected excess sales tax reimbursement from a customer to return the money to the customer who paid it or remit the funds to the state 
after careful consideration of these statutes and related administrative regulations and cases construing these provisions,as well as the law relating to standing and private rights of action,the loeffler court concluded that plaintiffs lawsuit was barred because the regulatory scheme enacted by the legislature was the sole means by which to obtain reimbursement of wrongfully collected sales tax.
in rejecting the assertion that claims brought pursuant to the ucl and clra are not subject to the administrative remedies in the revenue taxation code,the court noted plaintiffs can not plead around article xiii,section and section by recasting their causes of action as violations of the ucl and the clra.see communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d,a plaintiff may not plead around an absolute bar to relief simply by recasting the cause of action as one for unfair competition.loeffler target corporation,supra,th at,fn,d.
the court reasoned p laintiffs here seek an injunction,damages and restitution without providing the board with an opportunity to administratively determine the merits of plaintiffs interpretation of the sales tax laws.this is not permitted by the sales tax statutes and their underlying policies.although the board interpretation of the tax laws does not bind the courts,the board has expertise regarding sales tax issues that is entitled to consideration and respect.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d.further,circumventing the claims process could result in involving the board,retailers and customers in unnecessary litigation.this undermines the policy underlying section,which is to give the board an opportunity to correct any mistakes,thereby avoiding the cost of litigation and the consumption of judicial resources.see preston state bd.of equalization,supra,cal th at,d.loeffler target corporation,supra,th at,d.
yabsley asserts that loeffler was wrongly decided,as it is contrary to the supreme court opinion in javor state board of equalization cal d.we disagree.as noted in loeffler,the javor case presented unique circumstances.loeffler target corporation,supra,th at,d.one of those circumstances,not present here,was that the customers entitlement to a tax refund was not in question.
we agree with the loeffler court reasoning and its conclusion that the ucl and fal and the policies they promote can not take precedence over article xiii,section and the orderly administration of the tax laws require strict adherence to statutory procedures for the administration of the sales tax law.
yabsley does not meet the standing requirements of the ucl and fal 
yabsley and the attorney general assert that loeffler does not preclude an action seeking to enjoin false or deceptive advertising by a retailer.assuming this argument is correct in the abstract,it does not help yabsley.the fac does not seek to enjoin cingular from engaging in a deceptive advertising practice.the fac seeks a declaration that revenue and taxation code section requires a retailer to collect sales tax based on the actual retail price of the product and that cingular practice of charging sales tax based on the undiscounted price of the product violates section.the second cause of action against cingular based on the ucl and fal does not ask for injunctive relief,but for special damages in the sum of,attorney fees and costs.the only injunctive relief sought is in connection with the declaratory relief cause of action and seeks to enjoin the board from engaging in the practice.
the proposed sac requests an injunction against cingular prohibiting all unlawful practices of defendant as alleged herein as well as restitution.yabsley describes the alleged unlawful practice as the taxation process but also alleges that he was induced to purchase the phone because cingular advertising failed to advise him that sales tax would be calculated on the undiscounted price of the phone rather than the actual purchase price.although the proposed sac seeks an injunction against false or deceptive advertising,it would not survive demurrer because yabsley fails to satisfy the standing requirements of the consumer remedy laws 
the right to maintain a claim is essential to the existence of a cause of action.buckland threshold enterprises,supra,th at,d.the issue of a plaintiff standing may be raised at any time during the pendency of an action.ibid.to have standing under the ucl,a person must allege injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition.id.at,d.
an injury in fact is an invasion of a legally protected interest which is concrete and particularized buckland threshold enterprises,supra,th at,d.yabsley has not alleged the invasion of a legally protected interest.he argues that he has a legally protected interest in receiving truthful advertising under the consumer remedy laws.this is insufficient.the legally protected interest for standing purposes must be an interest that is protected by a source other than the remedial provisions of the ucl or fal.see,communications,los angeles cellular telephone,supra,cal th at,d,section borrows violations of other laws and treats them as unlawful practices that the unfair competition law makes independently actionable.the only independent statute yabsley cites is revenue and taxation code section.that section requires that a retailer pay sales tax based on gross receipts.that statute neither expressly nor impliedly creates in yabsley any legally cognizable right to avoid paying sales tax on the undiscounted price of the phone.as discussed below,the opposite is true.regulation expressly authorizes cingular to collect sales tax based on the undiscounted price of the phone and to collect that amount from the customer.
yabsley also fails to meet the lost money or property requirement.t he ucl and fal lost money or property requirement limits standing to individuals who suffer losses that are eligible for restitution.buckland threshold enterprises,supra,th at,d.there has been no determination by the board that he is eligible for restitution of the alleged excess sales tax he paid at the time he purchased the phone.loeffler target corporation,supra,th at,d.
lastly,yabsley can not meet the causation requirement.t here must be a causal connection between the harm suffered and the unlawful business activity.the causal connection is broken when a complaining party would suffer the same harm whether or not a defendant complied with the law.troyk farmers group,th,d.cingular alleged nondisclosure of the amount of sales tax to be collected on the purchase did not affect the amount of sales tax due on the sale of the phone because regulation permits cingular to collect sales tax from the consumer based on the price of the phone.
even if the loeffler case and standing requirements were not fatal to yabsley complaint,the trial court correctly determined that it has no substantive merit.although section broadly prescribes any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice,it does not apply when specific legislation provides a safe harbor for the conduct at issue.communications,los angeles cellular telephone,supra,cal th at,d.when specific legislation provides a safe harbor,a plaintiff may not use the general ucl to assault that harbor.ibid.if the legislature has permitted certain conduct or considered a situation and concluded that no action should lie,courts may not override that determination.ibid.
cingular asserts,and the trial court agreed,that regulation provides a safe harbor for the conduct yabsley asserts violates the ucl.regulation,subdivision a states bundled transaction.the retail sale of a wireless telecommunication device which contractually requires the retailer customer to activate or contract with a wireless telecommunications service provider for utility service for a period greater than one month as a condition of that sale.a transaction is a bundled transaction within the meaning of this regulation without regard to the method in which the price is stated to the customer.also,it is immaterial whether the wireless telecommunication device and utility service are sold for a single price or are separately itemized in the context of a sale or on a sales invoice.a transaction is a bundled transaction if goods and services are sold as a single package,whether
