we must decide whether a law firm can bring an action against the united states to recover attorney fees from monies that its client was awarded as a result of a settlement with the federal highway administration,but never received because the internal revenue service requested that payment be withheld to offset unpaid tax liabilities.
the united states,through the western federal lands highway division of the federal highway administration fhwa,contracted with environmental reclamation,eri to work on the warren profile gap road project project in south central idaho.after the government terminated the contract for default,eri engaged the law firm dunn black,dunn black to file an action in the court of federal claims to recover in damages for wrongful termination of the contract.the government asserted a counterclaim for reprocurement costs in the amount of.
until november,dunn black represented eri at an hourly rate on matters concerning the project.at that time,eri owed dunn black for legal services rendered on the project and other legal matters.on november,dunn black renegotiated its hourly fee agreement with eri,changing it to a contingency fee arrangement,which provided that dunn black shall be entitled to the first of any recovery from any claims related to the project,for eri debt on this and other matters.the agreement further provided that dunn black shall receive compensation for its future services regarding the claims arising out of the project in the amount of of any remaining recovery.eri remained responsible for all litigation costs.
on march,the fhwa,without admitting liability,settled the dispute with eri,stipulating to entry of judgment in favor of eri for.on april,the court of federal claims entered a judgment against the government in the amount of.upon learning of the judgment,the internal revenue service irs,requested that the secretary of the treasury withhold payment of the judgment for setoff against eri unpaid tax liabilities.on may,the government informed dunn black that the irs would be making claims to the settlement funds as an intended offset of the entire amount of the judgment based on an unrelated tax debt purportedly owed by eri.on the same day,dunn black served the government with a notice of attorney lien.on may,eri terminated its relationship with dunn black without paying any fees owed.
on june,the united states filed a civil action in the district court to reduce eri federal tax assessments to judgment.the government originally demanded in unpaid tax assessments,but amended the complaint to demand only for unpaid federal employment and unemployment tax liabilities plus interest and certain penalties.the district court entered judgment in the amount of,upon the government motion for default judgment against eri.
on june,dunn black commenced the instant action by filing a complaint for declaratory judgment in district court against the united states and eri.dunn black requested that the district court declare that its fees in the amount of were reasonable for the legal services rendered.furthermore,dunn black requested that the district court declare its attorney lien superior to all subsequent liens,claims,and interest in and to the judgment.alternatively,dunn black requested that the district court declare that the government setoff constituted unjust enrichment without fairly compensating the firm for services in creating the judgment fund.lastly,dunn black requested that the district court declare that the government setoff was a violation of a property interest in the contingent fee and therefore an unlawful property taking without compensation and a violation of due process.the government asserted in its answer that eri owed the irs as of april.

dunn black timely appealed 
as a threshold matter,the government contends that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because dunn black claim is barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity,which,of course,is an important limitation on the subject matter jurisdiction of federal courts.vacek postal,cir.
it is well settled that the united states is a sovereign,and,as such,is immune from suit unless it has expressly waived such immunity and consented to be sued.such waiver can not be implied,but must be unequivocally expressed.where a suit has not been consented to by the united states,dismissal of the action is required because the existence of such consent is a prerequisite for jurisdiction.gilbert dagrossa,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the supreme court has frequently held that a waiver of sovereign immunity is to be strictly construed,in terms of its scope,in favor of the sovereign.dep t of the army blue fox,d.
unless dunn black satisfies the burden of establishing that its action falls within an unequivocally expressed waiver of sovereign immunity by congress,it must be dismissed.cunningham united states,cir.dunn black invokes a and as the basis of waiver of sovereign immunity in this case the district court concluded that jurisdiction was proper pursuant to a,and proceeded to the merits.dunn black,d at.we consider each provision in turn.
dunn black first relies on a as the basis for waiver of sovereign immunity in this case.that section waives the government sovereign immunity by authorizing federal district courts to hear a ny civil action against the united states for the recovery of any tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected,or any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority or any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected under the laws.a united states williams,d see also imperial plan,united states,cir title a waives the sovereign immunity of the united states to permit suit in the united states district courts for the recovery of taxes which have been erroneously collected.however,d espite its spacious terms,a must be read in conformity with other statutory provisions which qualify a taxpayer right to bring a refund suit upon compliance with certain conditions.united states dalm,d.
one express condition of congress waiver of sovereign immunity is a,which,tracking the language of a,provides that 
n o suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected,or of any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority,or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected,until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the secretary,according to the provisions of law in that regard,and the regulations of the secretary established in pursuance thereof.

if a person neglects to file an administrative claim as required by a,that person has failed to satisfy a necessary condition of the waiver of sovereign immunity under a,and,as we have repeatedly held,the district court is necessarily divested of jurisdiction over the action other circuits have reached the same conclusion 
dunn black does not assert,and the record does not suggest,that it satisfied a statutory requirements by filing an administrative claim with the irs.accordingly,even if dunn black otherwise would have standing to maintain an action under a,dunn black is barred from relying on that section as a basis of waiver of sovereign immunity in this case.
dunn black makes the curious argument that a does not apply in this case because that section establishes a condition precedent to an action to recover taxes paid that the taxpayer duly file a claim for refund or a credit with the irs and that the claim be disallowed,but,here,dunn black is clearly not the taxpayer.emphasis in original.as indicated above,a language virtually mirrors that of a yet dunn black argues that a applies to,but a applies only to taxpayers.if we were to accept dunn black argument here,we would find ourselves pointed in diametrically opposite directions with respect to nearly identical statutory language.such an interpretation of a would,of course,fly in the face of the familiar canon of interpretation that courts should interpret similar language in different statutes in a like manner when the two statutes address a similar subject matter.united states novak,cir.because dunn black offers no reason for such contradictory interpretation of nearly identical statutory language involving the same subject matter,we reject this argument as unpersuasive.
we also reject dunn black suggestion at oral argument that the government waived the exhaustion of administrative remedies argument by not raising it below.it is well established that the federal government can not waive sovereign immunity by failing to raise it before the district court only congress enjoys the power to waive the united states sovereign immunity.army air force exch.serv.sheehan,d.
as discussed above,a requirement that a person first file an administrative claim before commencing an action against the united states in district court is a statutory limitation on congress express waiver of sovereign immunity pursuant to a.as such,a government officer can not waive the exhaustion requirement by failing to raise it below.see quarty united states,cir.
contrary to dunn black assertion,we have never held otherwise.section a requires that any taxpayer seeking a refund must first file an administrative claim with the secretary of the treasury before filing suit in federal court the exhaustion requirement.a.treasury regulation b,in turn,provides that the administrative claim must set forth in detail each ground upon which a credit or refund is claimed and facts sufficient to apprise the commissioner of the exact basis thereof the specificity requirement.while we have held that the treasury may waive the regulatory specificity requirement in limited circumstances the treasury has no power to waive the exhaustion requirement,which is an inseverable condition on congress waiver of sovereign immunity under a.see quarty,at gallo cattle dep t of,cir see also kikalos,at the supreme court has held that while the treasury may not waive the congressionally mandated requirement that a claim be filed,the treasury can waive its own formal requirements.citing angelus milling,at.
dunn black relies on bear valley mutual water riddell,cir,for the proposition that the statutory exhaustion requirement is waivable.but in that case,we recognized the very distinction emphasized above the interpretation of these provisions is that the filing of a claim with the internal revenue service is a jurisdictional prerequisite to a suit for refund,and,in the absence of a waiver by the government,the taxpayer can not recover in its suit for refund on a different ground than that set forth in the claim for refund.id.at emphasis added footnotes omitted.
dunn black alternatively contends that provides an express waiver of sovereign immunity in this case.the government responds that does not apply because the government claims an ownership interest,not a mortgage or lien interest,in the judgment.
section states,in relevant part,that the united states may be named a party in any civil action or suit in any district court to quiet title to,or to foreclose a mortgage or other lien upon real or personal property on which the united states has or claims a mortgage or other lien.a emphasis added.we have held that this section operates as an express waiver of sovereign immunity.arford,at.at the same time,however,we have strictly limited the reach and application of this statute.hughes united states,cir.
congress expressly limited waiver of sovereign immunity under to actions where the united states has or claims a mortgage or other lien.and we have repeatedly held that congress in did not consent to suits against the united states where the united states claims a title interest as distinguished from a lien interest,bertie apple valley farms united states,cir per curiam,or where the monies have already come into the hands of the irs,farr united states,cir 
in this case,at the time dunn black commenced this action the government never claimed a lien or mortgage interest in the judgment rather,the government exercised its right of setoff against that judgment and therefore claimed title in the proceeds that had come to rest in the hands of the irs at the time dunn black filed this action.accordingly,does not waive sovereign immunity in this case.
our prior decision in arford united states,is not to the contrary.there,the irs sent a notice of levy on the taxpayer retirement benefits to the retirement pay division of the air force,another government agency that disbursed those retirement benefits.id.at.the taxpayer sued the united states,alleging that congress waived sovereign immunity by as to the request for recovery of the amount levied on past retirement payments,and by as to the request to quiet title on the levy against continuing retirement payments.id.we held that does not serve as a waiver of sovereign immunity as to the requested recovery because that section only applies where the person is not the one against whom is assessed the tax.id.at quoting a.we also held that serves as a waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to the request to quiet title on the continuing retirement payments,because the taxpayer challenged procedural aspects of the lien.id.at.we rejected the government attempt to avoid the waiver of sovereign immunity under by asserting that the transfer of money from the other agency to the irs was a setoff not subject to the procedural requirements governing transfers by lien and levy,even though the transfer occurred pursuant to a formal notice of levy.id.
arford does not disturb the rule that a person can not invoke where the government asserts a title interest in the disputed property or where the monies have already come to rest in the hands of the irs.rather,arford stands for the simple proposition that the government can not avoid the waiver of sovereign immunity under by attempting to mask a transfer occurring pursuant to a formal notice of levy as a setoff beyond the procedural requirements for liens and levies but here,the government never filed a notice of levy,but simply withheld those funds pursuant to its statutory right of setoff.
second,as our subsequent precedents make clear,arford also stands for the limited proposition that a person can only use to challenge the continued collection of taxes through the garnishment of wages or retirement pay.hughes,at emphasis added.dunn black,however,does not challenge the continued collection of unpaid tax liabilities.for these reasons,arford does not compel a contrary conclusion with respect to in this case.
neither a nor operates to waive sovereign immunity in this case.accordingly,the district court lacked jurisdiction over dunn black action against the united states.we vacate the district court summary judgment and remand with instructions to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
the parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.
