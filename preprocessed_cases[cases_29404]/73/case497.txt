arif adam adam appeals from his conviction for failure to pay over taxes and from the district court failure to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea.he also appeals from the district court decision to impose a sentence enhancement for obstruction of justice.for the following reasons,we hereby affirm.
factual and procedural history 
adam was charged in june of by a superseding indictment with three counts of wilfully failing to pay over taxes to the internal revenue service irs,in violation of.the counts of the superseding indictment charged violations occurring in the first,third,and fourth quarters,respectively,of.adam moved to dismiss the indictment as barred by the applicable statute of limitations.the motion was denied.
on september,pursuant to a plea agreement,adam pleaded guilty to count three of the indictment and signed a factual resume.according to the factual resume,adam was in charge of several temporary employment agencies between the summer of and late.adam admitted that he filed a false tax return,failed to truthfully account for the total amount of employee payroll taxes due in the fourth quarter of,and failed to pay over to the united states the full amount of payroll taxes required by law.the trial judge reserved acceptance of the plea agreement and of the plea of guilty until sentencing.
adam filed a notice of intent to withdraw his guilty plea on october,and on november,he filed a motion to withdraw the guilty plea.adam argued in the motion that he had learned of exculpatory information shortly before his scheduled trial.the information was that automatic data processing adp,a private company that performed various tax services for the businesses run by adam,had records of tax deposits and filings made on behalf of the businesses in.adam averred that the irs,the government,and his former counsel had previously relied on adp assertions that such payments had not been made.adam also averred that his former counsel had discouraged him from presenting such information as a defense and had pressured him into pleading guilty.according to adam,he succumbed to this pressure because he was in a weakened mental state due to his father serious illness,and his counsel advised against seeking a continuance as adam had requested.the district court ruled that adam did not have an absolute right to withdraw his plea and must show a fair and just reason.after a hearing,the district court denied adam motion to withdraw his guilty plea.
the probation officer initially determined that adam total offense level was.the government objected to the presentence report,requesting an enhancement for obstruction of justice based on adam alleged perjury at the hearing on his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.the probation officer agreed that an enhancement for obstruction of justice should be applied and two points for obstruction of justice were added,bringing adam total offense level to.the district judge overruled adam objection as to the obstruction of justice enhancement,ruling that adam had repeatedly lied when he appeared before the court on his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.
adam was sentenced to months of imprisonment,three years of supervised release,and was ordered to provide restitution in excess of.adam appealed.
discussion 
on appeal,adam raises several points of error.first,he contends that the statute of limitations barred his indictment.second,he asserts that the district court erred by requiring him to give a fair and just reason for withdrawing his plea.in the alternative,he asserts that the district court abused its discretion by not allowing him to withdraw his plea.next,he argues that the district judge should have further inquired into adam use of medication to ensure that his plea was knowing and voluntary.finally,he asserts that the court erred in enhancing his sentence for obstruction of justice based on the testimony he gave at his hearing and by failing to inform him of the consequences of giving untruthful statements to the court.we address these arguments in turn.
adam,originally indicted in april of,pled guilty to count three of his superseding indictment,which alleged conduct that occurred in the fourth quarter of.on appeal,adam renews his argument that his indictment under was barred by the statute of limitations.issues of statutory interpretation are reviewed de novo.united states,cir.
a general limitations period applies to violations of the internal revenue laws.however,the statute provides eight specific exceptions for which a statute of limitations applies.id.as briefed by the parties,the dispute centers on the scope of the exception contained in,which establishes a limitations period for the offense of willfully failing to pay any tax,or make any return at the time or times required by law or regulations.at issue is whether applies to violations of,which covers a ny person required to collect,account for,and pay over any tax who wilfully fails to collect or truthfully account for and pay over such tax.
as the government points out,every circuit court to have considered the issue has held that covers.united states gilbert,cir united states gollapudi,cir united states musacchia,cir,vacated on other grounds,united states musacchia,cir united states porth,cir.
adam argues that the circuit courts have relied on flawed logic to support their holdings as to the statute of limitations issue.he contends that the holding in musacchia is questionable given that congress prescribed statutes of limitations for various felony tax offenses.relying on district court decisions in united states block,and united states brennick,adam also suggests that the approach taken in gollapudi is incorrect because it is inconsistent with the structure of the statute.
in holding that limitations period established by did not apply to offenses under,the block court found it obvious that congress had the statutory scheme of et in mind when considering what offenses should be exempted from the period of limitations generally applicable.at.the court noted that several of the eight exceptions of mention certain code sections by number,noting by way of example that references and.id.the court also found it significant that in there is substantial borrowing of statutory language from certain of the code sections in the et series.id.noting that the key words of,collect,account for,and pay over are entirely absent from the subsections of which establish the longer period of limitations,the block court concluded that it was unlikely that congress would omit use of the key words of if it had intended to make failure to pay over third party taxes subject to the statute of limitations.id.
adam also argues that there is a significant distinction between taxes owed by the income earner and taxes owed by a responsible person who is obligated under law to collect taxes on behalf of the government for liabilities arising from a different taxpayer activities.this view also finds support in block,which,drawing attention to the subtle difference in language used in and,noted that failure to pay over third party taxes as proscribed by is substantively different from failure to pay taxes.at.
we are not persuaded.the plain language of encompasses the conduct engaged in by adam.as the third circuit noted in gollapudi 
under a plain reading of this statute,we find it clear that violations of are subject to a statute of limitations under.specifically,makes it an offense for an employer to willfully fail to account for and pay over to the irs taxes withheld from employees.given that pertains to failing to pay any tax,the district court correctly found that the failure to pay taxes as covered by constitutes failure to pay any tax,and thus,is subject to the statute of limitations under.
further,we are also persuaded by musacchia reasoning that it would be inconsistent for congress to establish a statute of limitations for the misdemeanor offense prescribed in,while setting a limitations period for the felony offense of.at.
because adam has not shown a persuasive reason for creating a split among the circuits on this issue,and because we believe the plain languag
