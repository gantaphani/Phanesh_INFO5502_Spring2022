anthony and harriet jinwright,former of greater salem church in north carolina,appeal their convictions and sentences arising from a tax evasion scheme in which they omitted millions of dollars of taxable income from their jointly filed tax returns.the jinwrights raise a variety of challenges on appeal.finding each contention to be without merit,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
and jinwright were convicted of conspiracy to defraud the united states in violation of and of three counts of tax evasion for the years,and aiding and abetting the same,in violation of and.jinwright was convicted and acquitted of three additional counts of tax evasion for the years,as well as six counts of filing a false tax return in violation of u.the jinwrights were also acquitted of several other charges not at issue in this appeal.the jinwrights convictions followed a trial that involved the admission of over pages of documentary evidence and the testimony of more than witnesses.the facts most relevant to this appeal are summarized here.
prior to this litigation,jinwright had served as senior pastor of greater salem church gsc since.jinwright played an active role in church life during her husband ministry and began to draw a salary from gsc as a pastor of the church in about.over the course of their time with gsc,the jinwrights were of the gsc board of directors and served on a number of committees within the church,including those responsible for financial decisions.jinwright had final authority over employee salaries and church finances more generally.
when jinwright first became pastor at gsc,his salary was about.by,his salary had increased to approximately.it reached about by.between and,gsc provided jinwright with substantial benefits,in addition to his salary,that he underreported on his tax returns.he received housing allowances of between and per year,travel allowances of to per year,payments for his children tuition and his federal income tax liability,and unlimited use of a luxury car leased by the church in addition to an annual vehicle allowance.jinwright also received annual bonuses of to,as well as separate christmas bonuses.he had use of a gsc credit card and received reimbursements for purported expenses that remained unsubstantiated.taken together,jinwright total gsc compensation between and totaled nearly million.during that time,jinwright received similar compensation from gsc in the form of salary,bonuses,allowances,and reimbursements,totaling nearly million.
the jinwrights earned more income outside of gsc.together they earned tens of thousands of dollars in additional income for speaking at other churches that they failed to report to the irs.jinwright established an organization known as jinwright ministries,aljm,purportedly to receive his income from outside speaking engagements.jinwright was responsible for handling aljm bank statements and providing the corporation financial information to the jinwrights cpa.although defendants kept the income earned through this business,gsc paid its operating expenses.jinwright also founded the pastors consortium.the consortium,with a membership of other pastors,held annual events celebrating the anniversaries of the members churches.during these celebrations the participants would exchange gifts to one another in the form of checks for thousands of dollars.
irs revenue agent linda polk reconstructed defendants taxable income for the years and testified at trial as to her conclusions regarding defendants income and tax liabilities for those years.she treated as taxable income all gsc compensation by check,all payments for expenses for which there was no substantiation,and payments received by defendants for speaking at other churches.polk testified that defendants understated their taxable income by between and,resulting in a tax deficiency of for those years.
in light of the substantial evidence that the jinwrights underreported their income from through,the central dispute at trial concerned the defendants knowledge of wrongdoing.see sansone united states,elements of tax evasion under are willfulness the existence of a tax deficiency,and an affirmative act constituting an evasion or attempted evasion of the tax internal citations omitted.jinwright testified that he and jinwright did not intend to evade their tax obligations.to establish that defendants knowingly understated their taxable income,the government introduced evidence of unreported income in the form of allowances,unsubstantiated reimbursements,bonuses and gifts.the government also tendered evidence of defendants extravagant spending that exceeded the income they reported,including over a million dollars spent between on mortgage and lease payments for two homes and several luxury cars.
between and,defendants reported total income of slightly more than million,but claimed personal deductions of nearly million,which would have left them with only about to spend per year on nondeductible expenses.yet the jinwrights spent substantially more than that.analysis of defendants bank accounts revealed that from the jinwrights deposited and spent million in excess of their reported income for those years.they also reported income on multiple loan applications between and that exceeded the reported income on their corresponding tax returns.they claimed tens of thousands of dollars in deductions for aljm,even though the corporation had no employees and gsc bore its primary operating costs.
the government also presented evidence that the jinwrights were informed multiple times of their legal duties and continued to breach them.between and,gsc undertook several audits to assist the church in obtaining status under c.the auditors identified several problems with gsc finances and informed the jinwrights that they should be reporting their entire compensation package,including reimbursements for unsubstantiated expenses,as well as payments from gsc and other churches designated as love gifts.nonetheless in,for example,the jinwrights tax return reported almost less than the auditors determined to be jinwright total compensation from gsc for that year.several gsc employees,including three individuals who worked in the position of finance administrator,similarly told the jinwrights that the variety of payments they were receiving from gsc constituted taxable income.
yet the jinwrights failed to inform their personal cpa terry lancaster about gsc compensation other than salary and housing allowances,which lancaster testified he would have included as income in their returns had he known about it.according to the government,the defendants also structured their gsc compensation to conceal it from the irs.for example,they directed that their compensation be paid out of the gsc operating account,rather than the payroll account.as a result,those payments were not included on the jinwrights w forms and,per jinwright instruction,no forms were issued to disclose the added income to the irs.jacqueline joyner jones,who served as an administrative assistant to the jinwrights from,testified that the defendants instructed her to forge numerous checks from gsc women of faith ministry,a subsidiary of gsc ministry.the checks were designated as reimbursements and included a check in to cover jinwright tax liability.
the government presented evidence that defendants instructed gsc employees to alter gsc financial records to mislead both the congregation and the irs.by,the church began experiencing financial difficulties.according to several former gsc finance administrators,the jinwrights paired extra months of revenues with fewer months of expenses in gsc financial reports to conceal the church level of debt.the financial reports also buried the amount of the jinwrights compensation by including all gsc employee salaries in one line item.several of these misleading reports were submitted to the irs with gsc applications for section c status.
although gsc section c application in understated jinwright total compensation,the irs nonetheless denied the application on the basis that his compensation was too high.cpa robert howze assisted with a second application in,and reported jinwright compensation at more than even though jinwright had reported only about on his tax return.as a result,the irs began an investigation into the jinwrights tax filings and uncovered evidence that between and the jinwrights had understated their taxable income by over million.the government eventually obtained a superseding indictment against the jinwrights.their trial resulted in conviction on charges of conspiracy to defraud the united states,tax evasion and aiding and abetting the same,and for jinwright,filing false tax returns.
at sentencing,the district court determined that the jinwrights had willfully omitted more than million in taxable income from their joint returns,causing a tax loss to the united states and the state of north carolina of approximately million.the court relied on testimony from irs agent polk,who accounted for tax losses from through,as well as tax losses for the years,and.in calculating their base offense levels and the amount of restitution each defendant owed,the court held jinwright responsible for losses from,and jinwright responsible for losses from and.
the court applied sentencing enhancements for role in the offense two levels,the use of sophisticated means two levels,and abuse of a position of trust two levels.jinwright also received a enhancement for obstruction.each defendant was sentenced within the calculated guidelines range jinwright to months imprisonment and restitution in the amount of,and jinwright to months imprisonment and restitution in the amount of.the jinwrights appeal their convictions and sentences.they raise a number of challenges and we shall address each in turn.
the jinwrights contend that the district court issued two jury instructions that impermissibly relieved the government of its burden of proof.we turn first to the trial court instruction on willful blindness,against which appellants advance two arguments.first,that the trial evidence did not support the issuance of a willful blindness instruction.second,that the instruction misstated the legal standard of willful blindness.we review for abuse of discretion both the district court decision to offer an instruction and the content of that instruction.see united states lighty,cir.
the jinwrights are correct that requests for willful blindness instructions should be handled with caution.id.at.but they come close to seeking the categorical exclusion of such instructions while pointing to no court that has adopted so absolute a rule.there are cases where the evidence demonstrates that a defendant undertook an active and deliberate effort to avoid imbuing himself with the knowledge that would support a criminal conviction.to allow the most clever,inventive,and sophisticated wrongdoers to hide behind a constant and conscious purpose of avoiding knowledge of criminal misconduct would be an injustice in its own right.as much of one,in fact,as a conviction under a plainly impermissible recklessness or negligence standard.see global tech appliances,seb,the traditional rationale for this doctrine is that defendants who behave in this manner are just as culpable as those who have actual knowledge.for the reasons that follow,we think the district court properly set a high bar in its instruction for the government to prove willful blindness,while simultaneously recognizing the powerful evidence of such blindness in this case.
the jinwrights first contend that the evidence did not support a willful blindness instruction.the trial court issued such an instruction at the government request and over the jinwrights objection.the crimes for which the jinwrights were convicted both jinwrights for conspiracy to defraud the united states and tax evasion,jinwright also for filing false tax returns each required the government to prove that the defendants acted willfully.willfulness with respect to tax crimes has been defined in essence as a knowledge requirement,or the intentional violation of a known legal duty.united states pomponio,per curiam.when applied,the doctrine of willful blindness permits the government to prove knowledge by establishing that the defendant deliberately shield ed himself from clear evidence of critical facts that are strongly suggested by the circumstances.global tech.at.willful blindness may satisfy knowledge in a criminal tax prosecution,where the evidence supports an inference that a defendant was subjectively aware of a high probability of the existence of a tax liability,and purposefully avoided learning the facts pointing to such liability.united states poole,cir.
these conditions were satisfied here.jinwright denied knowledge of his legal obligations and testified that he and jinwright did not know that their tax returns contained a deficiency.but the government presented evidence to suggest that defendants were aware of a high probability that they were understating their income to the irs.for example,defendants tax returns for to claimed personal deductions of nearly million despite reporting about million of taxable income.during those years,defendants deposited into their bank accounts and spent over million more than they reported as income on their tax returns.
in addition,the government introduced evidence indicating that the defendants purposely avoided learning the fact of their liability.between and,several auditors and gsc administrators advised the defendants that they were underreporting their income,but defendants never raised these concerns with their personal cpa,who could easily have explained the law.the jinwrights also failed to clarify their alleged confusion regarding the tax treatment of honoraria and love offerings,instead simply excluding these payments from income.the jinwrights cpa testified that the jinwrights never informed him of the substantial compensation from gsc that they specifically structured so as not to appear on their w.
the government presentation of evidence that the jinwrights actually knew of their tax code violations did not preclude it from seeking a willful blindness instruction.united states abbas,cir.in light of jinwright denial of knowledge and the evidence supporting an inference of deliberate ignorance on the part of defendants,the court provision of a willful blindness instruction was not an abuse of discretion.
appellants next take issue with the content of the willful blindness instruction.they contend that the court violated their fifth amendment due process rights by allowing the jury to convict them based on recklessness,thereby diminishing the government burden of proving willfulness.the fifth amendment due process clause and the sixth amendment jury trial right together require criminal convictions to rest upon a jury determination that the defendant is guilty of every element of the crime with which he is charged,beyond a reasonable doubt.united states gaudin.a court runs afoul of this protection when it issues an instruction that relieves the government of its burden of proof with respect to an element of a charged offense.see carella california,per curiam.we conclude,however,that the instructions,taken as a whole,adequately state the controlling law.united states wills,cir.
appellants rely heavily on the supreme court recent decision in global tech appliances,seb,which emphasized that willful blindness has a limited scope that surpasses recklessness and negligence.the court defined a reckless defendant as one who merely knows of a substantial and unjustified risk of wrongdoing and a negligent defendant as one who should have known of a similar risk but,in fact,did not.id.at.
unlike the instruction at issue in global tech,however,the one here specifically admonished the jury that it was not enough to find that defendants were reckless or foolish in failing to recognize what was occurring and that a showing of negligence is not sufficient to support a finding of willfulness or knowledge.the court cautioned the jury that a willful blindness charge does not authorize you to find that the defendants acted knowingly because they should have known what was occurring,or that in the exercise of hindsight they should have known what was occurring,or because they were negligent in failing to recognize what was occurring.
the trial court instruction here was thus faithful to the willful blindness standard set forth in global tech.global tech synthesized the case law on willful blindness to identify two basic requirements the defendant must subjectively believe that there is a high probability that a fact exists and the defendant must take deliberate actions to avoid learning of that fact.global tech.at.the district court included this relevant language here,instructing the jury if you find that the defendants were aware of a high probability that they were violating the law and that the defendants acted with deliberate disregard to these facts,you may find the defendants acted knowingly emphasis added.the jinwrights were convicted before the global tech decision,but the language of the willful blindness instruction still tracks the factors enumerated there by the supreme court.
at the end of the day,the trial court instruction required that defendants ignorance be solely and entirely the result of a conscious purpose to avoid learning the truth.taken as a whole,the instruction plainly conveyed the government burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt conduct that transcended recklessness and negligence,which the evidence shows overwhelmingly the defendants conduct did.see united states martin,cir.
the jinwrights also object to the district court instructions to the jury regarding the tax treatment of payments from an employer to an employee.as part of its burden of proof on the charged offenses,the government was required to prove that the jinwrights received income that they did not properly report on their tax returns.see,boulware united states,one element of tax evasion under is the existence of a tax deficiency.to that end,the government sought to establish that gsc made payments to the jinwrights that they were required to include in gross income as compensation from their employer.
during the government,however,three former gsc employees business administrator varnell gray,administrative assistant jacqueline joyner jones,and finance administrator travis mauney described payments from gsc to the jinwrights as gifts.because gifts are excludable from gross income,see a,the government objected in each instance that this testimony would mislead the jury to conclude that the compensation was nontaxable as a matter of law.the court thus instructed the jury three times during the presentation of evidence,and again during the final jury charge,as follows 
any amount transferred by or for an employer to or for the benefit of an employee is income.such payments are not gifts under the internal revenue code and may not be excluded from gross income regardless of how the payments by the employer to the employee are characterized.
additionally,payments by an employer to an employee,or on the employee behalf as reimbursements for expenditures,must be included in the gross income of the employee unless the expenses are ordinary and necessary business expenses,the business nature of the expenses has been substantiated,and any unsubstantiated payments have been returned to the employer.
the jinwrights contend that the instruction unconstitutionally directed the jury to find an element of the offenses charged,namely that the jinwrights received payments that they were required to report as gross income.see carella,at.for the reasons that follow,we disagree.
a district court may instruct the jury on applicable law and is permitted to instruct the jury before or after the arguments are completed,or at both times.c.here,the court did just that.it is apparent that the relationship between an employer and employee is one that is commonly established for some kind of mutual benefit,a dynamic that is altogether different from the detached and disinterested generosity that normally prompts the tender of a gift.comm r duberstein.the instruction at issue correctly explained the relevant tax law,which is clear that payments from an employer to an employee are not gifts,but are presumed to be included in gross income.a taxpayer must report as gross income all income from whatever source derived,unless excluded by law,a see comm r banks.to be sure,a of the code excludes from gross income the value of property acquired by gift.a.but the code is explicit that payments from an employer to an employee do not constitute gifts under a,which shall not exclude from gross income any amount transferred by or for an employer to,or for the benefit of,an employee.c.
absent a clarifying instruction,the jury may have mistaken the testimony from several witnesses that gsc payments to the jinwrights were gifts as a legal conclusion that these payments were nontaxable.to prevent juror confusion,the district court alerted the jury that as a matter of law,payments from an employer to an employee do not qualify as nontaxable gifts,irrespective of the employer intent.but the jury was left to determine that the jinwrights did in fact receive payments from their employer,gsc an uncontroversial point which the jinwrights essentially conceded.from this factual finding,it followed as a matter of law that gsc payments to the jinwrights did not constitute gifts qualifying for exclusion from gross income.
although payment from an employer does not qualify as an excludable gift,the jury instruction elaborated that employer reimbursements may qualify for deduction from gross income if certain conditions are satisfied.see a a.appellants argue that the court thus created a presumption that any employer payments were includable gross income,impermissibly shifting the burden to defendants to prove that the unreported payments were deductible reimbursements for substantiated business expenses.but we will not fault the district court for being thorough,as well as accurate,in its explanation of the relevant law.under the tax law,the burden of clearly showing the right to the claimed deduction is on the taxpayer.indopco,comm r,internal quotation marks omitted.
our sister circuits have consistently applied this principle in criminal tax cases recognizing that the burden is on the defendant to prove that he had allowable deductions which were not shown in his return once the government establishes unreported income.elwert united states,cir see also united states tarwater,cir w hile the government bears the burden of proof throughout any criminal tax case,the government is not required to negate every possible source of nontaxable income,to track down all possible expenses,or to prove the absence of any costs or deductions.collecting cases united states nathan,cir the applicable rule here is that uniformly applied in tax evasion cases that evidence of unexplained receipts shifts to the taxpayer the burden of coming forward with evidence as to the amount of offsetting expenses,if any.quoting siravo united states,cir.
this case is unlike united states mogavero,cir,where the instruction in a net worth tax prosecution actually shifted to the defendant the government ultimate burden of proof.here,it is plain that the government retained its burden of proof on every element of the charges,including the burden to establish that the jinwrights failed to report income to the irs.before the burden shifted to the defendants to demonstrate the deductibility of unreported income,the government established that the jinwrights received several millions of dollars from their employer that they omitted from gross income.this offer of proof created a presumption that the income was taxable as a matter of law.in turn,the defendants failed to establish that these payments satisfied the reimbursement criteria under a plan qualifying for deduction pursuant to.see.because the instruction contained no constitutional infirmity,but correctly guided the jury on the relevant law,it did not constitute an abuse of discretion.
in addition to instructing the jury on the tax treatment of payments,the trial court limited the defense ability to gray,joyner jones,and mauney about their belief that payments from gsc to the jinwrights constituted gifts.the jinwrights insist that the court evidentiary limits burdened their ability to disprove the offense element of willfulness,which for purposes of criminal tax offenses requires the government to prove that the law imposed a duty on the defendant,that the defendant knew of this duty,and that he voluntarily and intentionally violated that duty.cheek united states.appellants argue that the belief within the church community that the gsc payments were nontaxable gifts,even if mistaken on the law,was relevant to show the jinwrights own ignorance of their legal duties.
a defendant fifth amendment right to due process guarantees the right to a fair opportunity to defend against the state accusations,which,under the sixth amendment,includes the rights to confront and witnesses and to call witnesses in one own behalf.chambers mississippi.the right to,however,is not absolute.id.at.a trial court retains discretion in limiting needless or confusing inquiry into collateral matters.united states cole,cir per curiam.moreover,a defendant sixth amendment right to be confronted with the witnesses against him does not give defendants a plenary right to elicit friendly testimony.united states crockett,cir quoting const.amend.vi.instead,that is the purpose of the sixth amendment right of a defendant to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.id.quoting const.amend.vi.
the decision to limit was a reasonable precaution,in conjunction with the jury instruction on payments,to prevent juror confusion regarding the taxability of income from gsc.the testimony that the gsc payments were gifts although offered by witnesses called by the government was favorable to the defense and contrary to the government effort to establish that the payments were taxable gross income.the defense desire for the witnesses to elaborate on their beliefs under therefore fell outside the confrontational essence of the confrontation clause.id.at.appellants mistakenly conflate a defendant right to challenge adverse testimony,id.at,with his sixth amendment right to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor,const.amend.vi,a right with which the district court did not interfere.in fact,the court explicitly invited the jinwrights to recall the favorable witnesses during their in the event the testimony proved relevant to the defense.
cheek united states,is not to the contrary.cheek held that a good faith misunderstanding of one legal duties is a defense in a criminal tax prosecution whether or not the claimed belief or misunderstanding is objectively reasonable.id.at.the trial court in cheek therefore ran afoul of the sixth amendment when it instructed the jury to disregard the defendant testimony that he misunderstood his obligations under the tax law.id.at.here,by contrast,the district court did not impede the jinwrights good faith defense.in fact,the court admitted,and the jury considered,jinwright testimony that he and jinwright were ignorant that they were violating the tax law.
moreover,cheek emphasized that it would of course be proper to exclude evidence having no relevance or probative value with respect to willfulness.id.none of the witnesses at issue claimed to have discussed with the jinwrights his or her belief that the payments from gsc were gifts and no evidence established at that point that the jinwrights relied on a misunderstanding of the law.the district court therefore properly concluded that testimony from these witnesses on about their own beliefs was not relevant to the jinwrights ignorance of the law.nonetheless,as appellants concede,the trial court left open the possibility of recalling these witnesses during the defense case once jinwright testified and a foundation had been laid for a cheek defense.defendants failure to do so rests squarely on their shoulders.we shall therefore uphold the evidentiary ruling of the district court.
jinwright contends that the district court erred by calculating her tax loss amount at greater than million,resulting in a base offense level of.see.the loss amount is critical to sentencing in criminal tax cases simply because the greater the fraud upon the treasury,the more substantial the punishment.for an offense involving tax evasion or a fraudulent or false return,tax loss is the total amount of loss that was the object of the offense.c.it includes losses arising from relevant criminal conduct that is part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan.united states fleschner,cir see cmt.in the case of conspiracy,relevant conduct that occurred during commission of,or in preparation for,the offense of conviction extends to all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.a b.
the district court determined that jinwright was responsible for a combined tax loss of for the years,adopting in large part the loss amounts calculated by irs agent polk.jinwright does not challenge the accuracy of the loss computations,but argues instead that the district court erroneously included loss amounts that were not attributable to her criminal conduct.the jury acquitted jinwright of tax evasion for years preceding and,according to appellant,thereby discredited any evidence that she had criminal knowledge before.
we are not persuaded.although relevant conduct under the guidelines must be criminal conduct,see united states dove,cir,an acquittal does not necessarily establish the criminal defendant lack of criminal culpability,united states scott,brennan,dissenting,and a jury can not be said to have necessarily rejected any facts when it returns a general verdict of not guilty,united states watts,per curiam.instead,the different standards of proof that govern at trial and sentencing enable the sentencing court to find a fact by a preponderance of the evidence that the jury may not have found beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.
the sentencing court was therefore entitled to consider conduct of the defendants underlying charges of which they had been acquitted in determining the appropriate sentence.id.at.what is more,as part of its relevant conduct analysis the district court was required to consider evidence of losses not contained in the indictment but relevant to the offense of conviction.united states hayes,cir see also united states jones,cir relevant conduct may include criminal acts that preceded the date the convicted offense was committed.thus the district court did not err in considering jinwright criminal conduct before.
the court moreover provided a sufficient explanation of its rationale to support its tax loss finding.united states wilkinson,cir.the district court found a pattern of conduct that went on for,in the court eyes,approximately a decade.unlike the three tax evasion counts of which jinwright was acquitted,both she and her husband were convicted of conspiracy.although count one of the indictment charged the jinwrights with conspiring to defraud the united states between and,the indictment alleged overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy committed as early as and.the government presented evidence at trial to support these allegations,offering proof that the jinwrights underreported their income and filed false joint tax returns beginning in.
the district court therefore had ample basis to conclude that losses arising from acts committed before occurred as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan.fleschner,at.and it held jinwright,as a,responsible for all reasonably foreseeable acts taken by jinwright in furtherance of the joint scheme.see a b.the court found that the jinwrights tax deficiencies from to,arising largely from unreported gsc compensation to jinwright,were not reasonably foreseeable by jinwright.thus,it declined to count those amounts in calculating jinwright tax loss amount.by contrast,the court found that jinwright was responsible for all the other years that through because based on the evidence at trial,she began to get much more involved in the operation of the church and of the jinwright ministries.jinwright increasing role at gsc supports the conclusion that by she was a participant in the conspiracy who
