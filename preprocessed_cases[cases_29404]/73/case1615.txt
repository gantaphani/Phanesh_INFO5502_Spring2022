introduction 
appellant tracfone wireless,tracfone,paid the county of los angeles county use taxes from its own funds,and later sought a refund when it determined that the long distance service it provided was tax exempt.respondent county refused the request for a refund,and this action ensued.the trial court held that appellant lacked standing,because it was the service provider responsible for collecting the tax from the consumer,and thus not the intended taxpayer under the los angeles county code section imposing the tax.the trial court also held that the first amended complaint fac failed to state a cause of action for a tax refund,because appellant had paid the tax voluntarily.we hold that appellant payment of the tax conferred standing,and that the fac adequately alleged an involuntary payment.accordingly,we reverse the judgment.
background 
the fac alleged that tracfone was a florida corporation in the business of selling prepaid telephone calling cards throughout the united states,including california,for use in cellular telephones also sold by tracfone.the cards provided access to a national telephone network,allowing callers to telephone almost anywhere in the united states.the fac alleged that most sales were made to retailers who resold the cards to the ultimate consumers.between january and january,tracfone paid a user tax to the county of los angeles,amounting to five percent of the value of calls made with the cards in the county.the fac alleged that tracfone did not collect the tax from consumers because it was unable to do so,having no point of sale contact with the vast majority of ultimate consumers.the fac further alleged tracfone belief that respondent would hold appellant liable for the tax,and that appellant paid the tax to avoid an assessment with interest and penalties.
the fac alleged that under the los angeles county code section d,telephone communication services that were not subject to the tax imposed under section of the internal revenue code were also exempt from the county tax.beginning in,several federal courts held that section did not apply to certain national calling plans the fac alleged that in may,consonant with these holdings,the internal revenue service issued notice,stating that the federal excise tax did not apply to cards of the type sold by tracfone.accordingly,appellant claimed a refund of the taxes paid,and filed this action when respondent denied its claim.
the factual allegations of the fac were incorporated into three counts,each demanding a refund of the tax under a different legal theory.the first demanded a refund on the ground that tracfone was exempt from the tax under the los angeles county code the second charged that respondent refusal to refund the tax violated appellant constitutional right to due process and the third alleged that respondent refusal to refund the tax constituted an unconstitutional taking of private property without adequate compensation.
respondent interposed a general demurrer to each cause of action and special demurrers for uncertainty,claiming that the facts necessary to state a cause of action were not alleged with sufficient particularity.the trial court sustained the general demurrers for the reasons stated in them because appellant lacked standing to seek a refund,having paid the tax as a tax collector,not a taxpayer,and because appellant had paid the tax voluntarily.the court denied leave to amend and dismissed the action march.appellant timely filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of dismissal.

standard and scope of review 
on appeal from a judgment of dismissal entered after a general demurrer is sustained,our review is de novo.mccall pacificare of,cal th,d.in the construction of a pleading,for the purpose of determining its effect,its allegations must be liberally construed,with a view to substantial justice between the parties.code civ.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law w e give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.blank kirwan cal d.we may also consider matters that have been properly judicially noticed.ibid.
appellant contends the court erred in holding that appellant was a volunteer who had no standing to seek a refund of monies erroneously paid as taxes.as lack of standing and failure to adequately allege an involuntary payment were the sole grounds stated in the general demurrers and relied upon by the trial court,we may affirm the judgment of dismissal only if such grounds were proper.see carman alvord cal d.
in general,one who is beneficially interested in the outcome of a controversy has standing to sue.cashcall,superior court th,d.beneficial interest means a personal interest in the outcome.municipal court superior court d.in the tax context,this means that the person is barred from seeking a refund of a tax he or she has not paid.delta air lines,state bd.of equalization d.delta.the court below found that tracfone,though required to collect taxes,was not a taxpayer and thus lacked standing to sue for a refund.
the court found that the essential facts alleged in the fac brought this action squarely within the holding of scol city of los angeles d.scol.scol corporation,a retailer of alcoholic beverages,sued the city of los angeles for a refund of the tipplers tax the city imposed on the purchase of alcohol,to be collected from consumers by the seller.id.at.scol had paid a portion of the tax from its own funds without having collected it from its customers,and the remainder from taxes collected from customers.id.at.scol sued for a refund,claiming the tax was unconstitutional or otherwise illegal,and sought,on behalf of itself,others similarly situated and its customers,to have the tax ordinance declared unconstitutional.ibid.the appellate court held that scol had no interest in the lawsuit or in the monies collected,because i ts role was not that of a taxpayer,but that of a tax collector of this special use tax.id.at.accordingly,the court held,scol had no standing to sue either for itself,all others similarly situated,or on behalf of its customers.ibid.
appellant contends that scol is distinguishable,or,in the alternative,that it was wrongly decided.to the extent scol stands for the proposition that a party lacks standing to challenge a tax unless it is the denominated taxpayer under the statutory or regulatory scheme imposing the tax,it is outdated.since scol was published,t here have been some refinements of the rule barring suits for refund to persons not technically regarded as taxpayers,however,resulting from unusual circumstances which have been subject to judicial review.delta,supra,d at.see also andal city of stockton th,d andal.the person who paid the tax must be afforded some remedy to prevent the unjust enrichment of the taxing authority.delta,at.
thus,in andal,the court rejected a city claim that the phone company plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge a local fee assessed on calls because they were merely collectors and not the party taxed.andal,supra,th at,d.in delta,the court held that an airline had standing to sue for a refund of sales taxes it allegedly overpaid on fuel it purchased from vendors.delta,supra,d at.the court expressly rejected the board of equalization claim that the airline lacked standing because it was not the designated taxpayer under the law.id.at.acknowledging the general rule that persons who have not paid the tax in question are barred from bringing suits for refund of that tax,the court nevertheless concluded that it would be irrational to hold that delta has no standing to contest a determination of substantial funds due for which delta was legally responsible.to hold otherwise might permit unjust enrichment of the board.id.at.
respondent contends that appellant would not be without a remedy,because the court in scol left open the question whether scol possessed a right of reimbursement against its customers.see scol,supra,d at,fn.we disagree.the facts adequately alleged that appellant would be left without a remedy if
