brenda clydette dove collier and the internal revenue service irs,the parties to the adversary proceeding on appeal,have each filed a secured claim against charco,dove signs,the debtor in this chapter bankruptcy proceeding.we now decide which claim has priority in the limited funds that remain in the bankruptcy estate.
collier obtained a judgment in a virginia court against the debtor and filed it in west virginia before the irs recorded its tax lien against the debtor,but she recorded her judgment in west virginia after the tax lien was recorded.even though,under west virginia law,collier obtained a lien on the debtor real property when she obtained her judgment in west virginia against the debtor,under federal law an irs tax lien still takes priority over an unrecorded judgment lien i f recording or docketing is necessary under local law before a judgment becomes effective against third parties acquiring liens on real property.treasury regulation h g.west virginia law requires recordation for a judgment to become good as against creditors,one class of lienors,even though recordation is not required before a judgment becomes good as against other lienors.
construing treasury regulation h g,we hold that the regulation gives the united states tax lien priority over collier unrecorded west virginia judgment lien.even though collier recorded her judgment lien,she did so after the irs had recorded the tax lien.accordingly,we affirm the district court judgment denying collier lien priority.
on june,the irs assessed in unpaid taxes against charco,charco,of princeton,west virginia,and on september,another.it then recorded a combined tax lien of on november,in the mercer county west virginia commission clerk office because charco real property was located in mercer county.
collier obtained a judgment against charco in roanoke county virginia circuit court on september,in the amount of plus interest and costs.to enforce that judgment in west virginia against charco real property,collier filed the judgment in the mercer county circuit court on october,pursuant to the uniform enforcement of foreign judgments act,which provides that a judgment so filed has the same effect and is subject to the same procedures,defenses and proceedings for reopening,vacating or staying as a judgment of a circuit court of this state and may be enforced or satisfied in like manner.she recorded her judgment with the mercer county commission clerk office on january.
thus,collier obtained judgment in west virginia against charco before the irs recorded the united states tax lien,but she recorded her judgment after the irs had recorded the tax lien.
in september,creditors of charco placed it in involuntary bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code.during the proceedings,both the irs and collier filed proofs of secured irs for the united states,in the amount of and collier,in the amount of.the proceeds from the sale of charco real property during the bankruptcy proceedings amounted to only after deducting administrative costs and attorneys fees.
collier commenced this adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy case against the united states by and through the irs,seeking a declaratory judgment that her judgment lien had priority over the united states tax lien with respect to the remaining funds in the bankruptcy estate.the bankruptcy court ruled that the united states tax lien had priority,and the district court affirmed.both courts reasoned that collier judgment lien had not been perfected,as federal regulations define the term,until collier recorded it in january.this appeal followed.
collier contends that when she filed her virginia judgment against charco in west virginia on october,she perfected a lien against charco real property pursuant to west virginia code,which provides in part that e very judgment for money rendered in this state shall be a lien on all the real estate of the defendant within the state.believing she had perfected her lien against charco property before the irs recorded its lien,she asserts priority in the remaining funds in charco bankruptcy estate.
the irs contends that collier did not perfect her judgment lien until she recorded it in january and that the irs has priority because it recorded its tax lien in november.
the priority of federal tax liens as against competing liens asserted against a taxpayer property is governed by federal law.aquilino united states,d.
the internal revenue code provides that the amount of assessed tax,interest,and penalty not paid by a person after demand becomes a lien in favor of the united states upon all property and rights to property belonging to the person.the lien arise s at the time the assessment is made.id.but it is not valid as against any purchaser,holder of a security interest,mechanic lienor,or judgment lien creditor until it is recorded locally.id.emphasis added.the priority between a recorded tax lien and a judgment lien is governed by the rule of first in time,first in right.united states pioneer am.ins,d see also united states equitable life assurance soc y of the united states,d air power,united states,cir.but before a judgment lienholder can have priority over tax lien,she must be a judgment lien creditor as that term is used in.
as used in,judgment lien creditor is defined by treasury regulation h g as a person who has obtained a valid judgment,in a court of record and of competent jurisdiction,for the recovery of specifically designated property or for a certain sum of money,and who has perfected a lien under the judgment on the property involved.h g emphasis added.
in this case,collier contends that she perfected her lien on charco property on october,when she domesticated her virginia judgment by filing it in mercer county,west virginia.she argues therefore that her lien was valid against the irs subsequently filed tax lien.even though collier did not record her judgment until january the irs had recorded its tax argues that recordation was not required under west virginia law to perfect her lien.she relies on west virginia code,which provides in part that every judgment for money rendered in this state shall be a lien on all the real estate of the defendant.
it is federal law,however,not state law,that defines when a judgment lien is perfected 
a judgment lien is not perfected until the identity of the lienor,the property subject to the lien,and the amount of the lien are established if recording or docketing is necessary under local law before a judgment becomes effective against third parties acquiring liens on real property,a judgment lien under such local law is not perfected with respect to real property until the time of such recordation or docketing.
h g emphasis added.thus,before a judgment lien is perfected,a judgment lienor must identify the lienor,identify the property subject to the lien,identify the amount of the lien,and record the lien i f recording or docketing is necessary under local law before a judgment becomes effective against third parties acquiring liens on real property.id.the determinative question in this case is whether collier had to record her judgment lien in order to perfect it,which depends on whether recording is required by local law before a judgment becomes effective against third parties acquiring liens on real property.id.emphasis added.
at oral argument counsel for the parties debated whether it was more natural to read third parties acquiring liens on real property as any third party acquiring liens on real property or as all third parties acquiring liens on real property.neither position,however,captures precisely the clause meaning ordinarily,an unmodified plural is used to describe a class of objects.for instance,a person who claims to enjoy eating apples does not necessarily claim to enjoy eating all apples.she very well might dislike overripe apples,or she might never have tried granny smith apples.for these reasons,she might not be satisfied if a friend just gave her any apple to eat.when she declares that she enjoys eating apples,she simply communicates that there exists a class of apples that she likes to eat.and if there are apples that she in fact enjoys,the claim about enjoying apples is an accurate one even if it does not include all apples.
likewise,ordinary language analysis does not permit us to cabin third parties acquiring liens on real property with the limiting terms one,any,some,or all.these terms were not used in the treasury regulation,and we conclude deliberately so.the choice not to use such terms is justified with respect because regulatory background within which the regulation operates.states have independent authority to create liens and to regulate how they become effective against others.given the variations in state laws,it would have been impractical,if not impossible,for the regulation to have cataloged each type of lienor against which a judgment in each state would have to become effective before it could have been perfected a federal tax lien.moreover,the class label accommodates changes in state lien laws without requiring a change in the regulation for each change in state law.in this case,therefore,we conclude that the use of an unmodified plural,third parties,identifies a class,the content of which varies with local lien laws 
thus,we read the federal regulation to state that,to be considered a judgment lien creditor with priority over a federal tax lien,the creditor must perfect her judgment lien by recording it if a state has identified a class of third parties acquiring liens against whom a judgment is ineffective until it is recorded.such a class of third parties need not include every possible third party acquiring a lien,for the federal regulation does not require recording only if state law requires recording against any or all third parties.rather,the regulation requires recording against a class of third parties acquiring liens,no matter how many third party lienors are part of the class.because we conclude that west virginia law creates just such a class of third parties against whom a judgment creditor must record her judgment lien,we hold that a judgment lien creditor in west virginia must record her judgment lien to be valid against a recorded federal tax lien.
in west virginia,every judgment becomes a lien on real property at the date of judgment,but those judgments are not liens against bona fide purchasers until they are recorded.although bona fide purchasers are third parties,they are not specifically third parties acquiring liens on real property,so this class would not be a class of third parties that fulfills the condition of the treasury regulation.but the west virginia supreme court has extended to apply also to creditors,and creditors,who essentially are mortgagees,are indeed third parties acquiring liens on real property.see cooper cooper,amato hall,weinberg rempe.
in sum,west virginia law identifies two distinct classes of third parties acquiring liens on real creditors and everyone else.although a west virginia judgment is effective against the class of everyone else whether or not it is recorded,it is not effective against the class of creditors unless recorded.thus,recording is necessary under west virginia law before a west virginia judgment becomes effective against a class of third parties acquiring the condition of the treasury regulation,therefore,is fulfilled.collier accordingly would have to record her judgment lien in order to perfect it under federal law.
although congress could have retained absolute priority under the common law first in time,first in right rule,it was satisfied to have the irs be treated no better and no worse than other lienors under state law.united states kimbell foods,d observing that,in passing,congress recognized the priority of many state claims over federal tax liens.we note that our statutory interpretation in effect agrees with that of the eleventh circuit,which concluded,when interpreting other regulations promulgated under,that the regulations essentially grant the irs most favored nation status so that it receives the best possible priority the state law would provide to a lienor.see in re haas,cir concluding that the treasury regulation operates to the put the irs in the shoes of any subsequent judgment creditor,including the most favorable shoes 
at bottom,we hold that if a state requires that a judgment be recorded before it is effective against a class of third parties acquiring liens on real property,an unrecorded judgment in the state is not,under the treasury regulation,effective against a recorded federal tax lien.because west virginia law does require recordation for a judgment lien to be valid against a class of third parties acquiring liens on real,federal regulation requires collier to record her judgment lien to be valid against a federal tax lien.thus,collier judgment lien obtained before the irs recorded its federal tax lien was ineffective against the tax lien until it was recorded,and because it was recorded after the tax lien was recorded,the irs lien has priority over collier.accordingly,the judgment of the district court is 
i have no idea what the treasury department intended when it promulgated the regulation that is before us today.however,whatever its intent,i suspect the department drafted the regulation against a background belief that state recordation laws do not generally distinguish among creditors.but whether or not this was its belief,i am confident as to the most defensible reading of the language that the department chose to effectuate whatever its intent was and,incidentally or not,that reading is consistent with what i suspect was the department background belief.
i am confident that when the regulation states that a judgment must be recorded if third parties must record,it is most plausibly read,absent any contextual evidence to the contrary as here,to mean that judgment lien creditors in the state must record their judgments only if the state requires that a judgment be recorded before it is effective against all creditors.not just one creditor.not just some creditors.and not just some unspecified,substantial class of creditors.all creditors.indeed,this may well be the only even arguably plausible interpretation of the actual language of the regulation.
the want to interpret the regulation contrary to its language most naturally read is prompted,i believe,by nothing more than the discomfort of uncertainty that is felt when one is faced with state law,like that in west virginia,that simply happens to be more nuanced than i suspect the department realized existed at the time it promulgated the regulation.this is a want to which it is particularly inappropriate for a court to yield,however,because to do so results not in an interpretation,but in a rewriting,of the regulation language.
the alternative interpretations to the one i would place upon the regulation,including the one embraced by the majority,are informed by rank speculation as to the department possible intent.and,to no surprise,these interpretations require constructions of the regulatory language that the language can not even possibly bear.
the majority interpretation of the regulation is a perfect example.the majority asserts that the purpose of the irs regulation must have been to ensure that the irs was always the equal of the most favored third party creditor in a given state,an assertion for which the majority does not offer even a hint of evidence.based upon nothing more than this pure speculation,and without any regard for the text of the regulation,the majority proceeds directly to hold that the regulation must mean that if a state requires that a judgment be recorded before it is effective against any one creditor,then judgment lien creditors in the state must record their judgments before their liens are interpretation that would best effectuate that assumed purpose.the majority cloaks this holding in formulation that is comforting to the casual reader and no doubt to the majority as well because it masks the difficult interpretive question.the majority states that recordation is required when state law requires any class of third parties to record.but its holding that such a class may consist of but a single individual could not be clearer t he regulation requi
