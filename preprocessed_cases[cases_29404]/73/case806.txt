ii.discussion 
robert dupont.
dupont states in his appeal that he and his attorney believed that,in exchange for dupont guilty plea,all charges against his stepdaughter,kelley liveoak,would be dropped.because only one of two counts against liveoak was dropped after his plea,dupont argues that the district court should have set aside his guilty plea due to the failure of consideration for the plea.the government responds that there was no such element in the plea agreement and that dupont failed to object or move for relief in the district court.
we review the denial of a motion to withdraw a plea for abuse of discretion.united states gamble,cir.we find the district court did not err in failing to set aside the guilty plea.
even assuming dupont satisfied procedural requirements below,his contention that his plea agreement included dismissal of all charges against liveoak is without support in the record.there is no mention in the plea agreement of either of the charges against liveoak being dropped.further,the plea agreement states 
the defendant has read the plea agreement,understands it,and by his signature,states that it is true and accurate and not the result of any threats or coercion.both parties agree that no promises or agreements have been made other than those set forth in the plea agreement,nor has the united states promised the defendant any additional consideration to induce him to sign this plea agreement.
dupont plea agreement at page.dupont signed the agreement on february.the statements therein directly contradict the argument he brings on appeal.therefore,we find that the district court did not err in failing to set aside his guilty plea for lack of consideration.
kelley liveoak 
kelley liveoak argues on appeal that the district court erred in failing to sever liveoak case for trial and failing to grant liveoak motion for judgment of acquittal at the end of the government case.
