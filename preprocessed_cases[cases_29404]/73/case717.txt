this is an appeal from the united states tax courts decision affirming the commissioners determination that freightways freightways improperly deducted certain expenses during the tax year.although we acknowledge that even after united states mead,d,we owe some deference to the commissioner interpretation of his own regulations,we conclude here that the lack of any sound basis behind the commissioner interpretation,coupled with a lack of consistency on the commissioner own part,compels us to rule in favor of freightways.because the tax court did not reach the commissioner alternative argument that freightways method of accounting for the expenses in question did not clearly reflect its income,we remand for the limited purpose of allowing that court to consider this issue in the first instance.
this case was tried before the tax court on stipulated facts.freightways is a freight trucking company that operates throughout the continental united states.in,it had a fleet of trucks and was growing.every year it is required to purchase a large number of permits and licenses and to pay significant fees and insurance premiums in order legally to operate its fleet of vehicles.these items are referred to collectively as flip expenses in the record,and we will follow that convention.during the tax year,freightways flip expenses totaled.none of the licenses and permits at issue was valid for more than twelve months,nor did the benefits of any of the fees and insurance premiums paid extend beyond a year from the time the expense was incurred.but because the various flip expenses were incurred at different times during the tax year,freightways enjoyed the benefits of a substantial portion of them in more than one tax year.according to freightways own accounting,or approximately,of the flip expenses it incurred in actually benefitted the company during.
despite the subsequent tax year benefits of its flip expenses,freightways,which otherwise uses the accrual accounting method for bookkeeping and tax reporting purposes,deducted the entire in flip expenses on its federal income tax return.this had been its com mon practice for a number of years.after auditing freightways tax return,the commissioner concluded that freightways should have capitalized its flip expenses and deducted them ratably over the and tax years.freightways disputed this conclusion and petitioned the tax court for a redetermination of the irs proposed judgment.the tax court sided with the commissioner,concluding that under the relevant provisions of the tax code,freightways,as an accrual method taxpayer,was required to capitalize these expenses.given this holding,the court declined to reach the commissioners alternative argument that freightways use of the accrual accounting method did not fairly reflect its income.
whether a taxpayer is required to capitalize particular expenses is a question of law,and our review is therefore de novo.see heffley commissioner,cir.in order to place the issues in context,we begin by addressing the tax court resolution of the case.the court recognized that whether freightways could properly deduct its flip expenses in full depends on whether they are ordinary and necessary business expenses as defined by a,or capital expenditures covered by a.citing indopco,commissioner,d,the court explained,accurately,that the essential reason behind the need to distinguish between currently deductible expenses and those that are subject to capitalization is to match expenses with the revenues of the taxable period to which they are properly attributable,thereby resulting in a more accurate calculation of net income for tax purposes.at.some mismatching is inevitable it is not necessary to count every pencil on hand at the end of a tax year to determine whether it will be useful in the next tax year and,if so,to treat it as a capital asset.the critical consideration in determining whether an expense should be treated as a capital expenditure is whether the expenditure produces more than an incidental future benefit or,as the treasury regulations put it,whether a benefit for the taxpayer extends substantially beyond the tax year.see,regs.a,a.
this means that,but for the accident that freightways expense year does not correspond with its tax year,there would be no problem in treating the flip expenses as current.the licenses and fees freightways purchased conferred a month benefit on the company if it had incurred those expenses on january of each year and they had all expired on december the tax year for freightways,no one would have argued that capitalization was required.but for reasons unrelated to taxation,that is not the way the flip expenses worked.the tax court task was thus to unravel the tax implications of this quirk,which turn on the lines that must be drawn conceptually between deductible expenses and capital expenditures.
turning to the question whether freightways flip expenses were deductible in full in the year they were incurred,the tax court understood freightways to be arguing that it should be allowed to deduct its flip expenses in full under a rule permitting the deduction of any current expense with a benefit that extends less than months into the subsequent tax year.the application of this principle would rid the commissioner position of its intrinsic arbitrariness under a rule,nothing would turn on the accident of the date during a year when a expenditure was made.the worst case from the commissioner standpoint one could imagine of a between the year of payment and the year of benefit would be the one in which a taxpayer bought all its licenses on december of year and deducted their entire cost in that year,even though the entire benefit accrued in year.the worst for the taxpayer might be a case in which the license was purchased on february of the first year and expired on january of the next year,if the commissioner regarded a full month as substantial enough to require capitalization.the tax court rejected freightways reliance on a rule for two reasons.first,it questioned whether such rule was,in fact,well established in the case law.second,it found that freightways had a more fundamental problem,namely the fact that even if such a rule were widely recognized,it would be inapplicable to an accrual method taxpayer.on these two grounds,and without further explanation,the court affirmed the commissioner deficiency judgment.
this is a difficult case because the language of the code,the regulations,and the presumption in favor of capitalization to varying degrees support the commissioner position,but the rationale for distinguishing between immediate expenses that should be deducted from a single year income and longer term expenses that are suitable for amortization strongly cuts in freightways direction.furthermore,as we explain below,the tax court alternative ruling that any one year rule ought not logically to be available to accrual taxpayers is not supportable.because so much turns on the degree of deference we owe to the commissioner in these circumstances,we begin with a brief discussion of that subject and then turn to the merits of the case.
at the most general level,this case turns on which of two provisions of the code itself should apply to freightways situation section a,which permits the deduction of ordinary and necessary business expenses,or a,which calls for the capitalization of all other expenditures.the commissioner has issued regulations that elaborate on the way this choice should be made.as we noted above,those regulations provide that expenditures producing nothing more than an incidental future benefit are eligible for current year deductions,while expenditures whose benefits extend substantially beyond the tax year must be capitalized.see regs.a,a.but this is not a case where the regulations themselves fully answer the question before us.instead,another layer of interpretation has been laid on top of the regulations the commissioner has informed the courts throughout the course of this litigation that the term substantially as used in the regulations should be interpreted to cover anything that extends more than a few days,or perhaps a month,into the second tax year.this is so regardless of the implications for the capitalization decision of the other factors normally used to draw the line between ordinary and capital expenses.
in the ordinary case,our focus is on the deference we must give to a regulation itself.after mead,we know that we give full deference under chevron natural resources defense council,d,only to regulations that were promulgated with full or comparable formalities.see mead,at.at.we also know that deference to agency positions is not an proposition more informal agency statements and positions receive a more flexible respect,in which factors like the degree of the agency care,its consistency,formality,and relative expertness,and the persuasiveness of the agency position,are all relevant.id.finally,in the typical case where the validity of a regulation is at issue,we have explained before that chevron requires us to apply a analysis 
we examine the text of the this case,the relevant section of the tax code.if the plain meaning of the text either supports or opposes the regulation,then we stop our analysis and either strike or validate the regulation.but if we conclude the statute is either ambiguous or silent of the issue,we continue to the second step 
we examine the reasonableness of the regulation.if the regulation is a reasonable reading of the statute,we give deference to the agency interpretation.

in the present case,however,no one is arguing that the regulations the commissioner has promulgated are invalid or that they are inconsistent with the text of the code.the issue is instead whether the commissioner interpretation of his own regulations is a reasonable one.and as to that,there is no question but that the interpretive methodologies he has used have been informal.the interpretation with which we are concerned has emerged inferentially in the way the irs has applied the rules to different cases and it has appeared through the litigating positions the service has taken.
both the informality of this interpretation and the context in which it has arisen persuade us that full chevron deference is not appropriate here.mead expressly disapproved of the exercise of such deference for the customs regulations that were at issue there,in part because of the that could otherwise occur.with full chevron deference,agencies could pass broad or vague regulations through procedures,and then proceed to create rules through ad hoc interpretations that were subject only to limited judicial review.all told,we think this is a clear case for the flexible approach mead described,relying on the supreme court earlier decision in skidmore swift,and we thus proceed on that basis.
one reason the tax court gave for accepting the commissioner disallowance of freightways deductions was that,even if there is some kind of rule for deductible expenses,accrual taxpayers are never entitled to it.this,we conclude,is an unsustainable position.in flatly rejecting the rule for accrual taxpayers,that court relied largely on implications from its own earlier decision in johnson commissioner,wl.johnson involved an accrual taxpayer that had purchased various insurance policies covering periods of one to seven years.the tax court held that regardless of the length of the policy,to the extent that part of the premiums paid was allocable to subsequent tax years,capitalization and amortization was required.we think the court read too much into johnson,and from a broader point of view since we at least are not bound by earlier tax court decisions it confuses the time when income is generated or expenditures are incurred when paid or received,versus when the rights accrue with the length of the economic benefit they will yield.although johnson used broad language that could be interpreted to be inconsistent with the existence of a rule,it did not link its holding to the taxpayer method of accounting.
moreover,johnson relied on commissioner boylston market association,cir,for the proposition that lump sum payments for multiyear insurance coverage generally are capital expenditures.see johnson,at.boylston market involved a cash basis taxpayer and specifically concluded that a taxpayer,regardless of his method of accounting must capitalize a prepaid insurance policy because it is an asset having a longer life than a single taxable year.id.at.while boylston market statement of the rule may be ambiguous,the court clearly believed it applied to both accrual and cash basis taxpayers.in fact,the tax court commented in johnson that boylston market supported a rule for cash basis taxpayers,who,it acknowledged,could fully deduct insurance premiums covering a year or less.in freightways case,the tax court also found support for its position in zaninovich commissioner,cir.zaninovich permitted a deduction for a rental payment that extended eleven months into the subsequent tax year and sought to reconcile its position with the board of tax appeals contrary holding in bloedel jewelry,commissioner,by pointing out that bloedel involved an accrual method taxpayer.at nn.this is a fairly weak reed for present purposes,as the effort to distinguish bloedel was unnecessary in any event to the ninth circuit decision,and that court made no effort to think carefully about what consequences should flow from a taxpayer choice of accounting methods.
in our view,the decision whether to expense or capitalize a particular item should not turn on whether the taxpayer uses the cash or accrual basis of accounting.as freightways points out,even the treasury regulation on which the commissioner has relied here,reg.a,uses identical language in subpart relating to cash basis taxpayers and in subpart relating to accrual basis taxpayers both must capitalize an expenditure that results in the creation of an asset having a useful life which extends substantially beyond the close of the tax year.the mere fact that freightways is an accrual method taxpayer thus does not disqualify it from expensing the items at issue here.
we turn thus to the central reason the commissioner,as affirmed by the tax court,gave that no matter what other characteristics an expenditure has,if it is made in one tax year and its useful life extends substantially an undefined term beyond the close of that year,then it must be capitalized.perhaps this rule works in some simple cases.it relies on an implicit spectrum between things that are consumed immediately and those that last well beyond a year.consumable office supplies,such as paper and pens,might not be thought to have a useful life that will extend substantially beyond a given year,even if they are acquired late in the year though it depends on the disposable pens bought in november might well be functioning four or five months into the new year.something like computers or furniture,on the other hand,predictably will last beyond one tax year.the problem is that many things fall somewhere in the middle of this hypothetical spectrum.some employers,for example,pay for employee training seminars,which surely create human capital that lasts for many years.are the training expenses deductible items must they be capitalized what about a light bulb that the company expected would last for eight months,but turned out to be burning brightly after anything else whose useful life was estimated at approximately a year,but that might have failed sooner or lasted longer the license fees,permit fees,and insurance premiums freightways pays are,in a sense,easier to characterize as deductible expenses than the pens or the light bulbs because the issuing entities and insurance companies have strictly defined the useful life of the item to be exactly one a minute more or less.the only reason that the flip expenses are also in the middle range of the spectrum is because the period each one covers will usually lap across two tax years.
looking at the language of reg.a,we find two somewhat contradictory clues.on the one hand,there is the simple word substantially,which the commissioner seems to interpret as meaning at least a month or maybe two,three,or four months into a sec
