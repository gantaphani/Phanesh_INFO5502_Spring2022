background 
john dunkin and his former wife julie married on august,separated on february,and were divorced on august.for most of this period and continuing until his retirement in,john was employed by the los angeles police department.as part of his compensation package,john participated in a defined benefit plan administered by the los angeles board of pension commissioners pension board.under the plan,upon retirement,john was entitled to receive monthly payments for life,based on the length of his service,his rank,and his monthly salary.as of may,john pension rights were fully vested and mature the pension benefits earned during marriage were community property.gillmore,at in re marriage of benson,cal th,d,explaining that pension benefits represent deferred compensation for work performed during the marriage.
under california law,upon the dissolution of a marriage,a divorce court is required to divide the community estate equally.cal.in addition,the court may order spousal support,commonly referred to as alimony.cal.a.in this case,the divorce court explicitly declined to order spousal support.
as part of the division of community property,the divorce court awarded one half of the community interest in the pension to each spouse.a california court may value and distribute a community interest in a pension in a number of different ways.a court may,for example,award the employee spouse the full pension and award an offsetting representing one half of the present value of the pension to the spouse usually out of other community assets if the estate is sufficiently large.gillmore,at in re marriage of skaden,cal d,bergman.at in re marriage of shattuck,d,noting that this represents the preferable mode of division internal citation omitted.alternatively,a court may decline to calculate the present value of the pension and simply order a division of each payment as it comes due.gillmore,at in re marriage of stenquist,cal d.
of course,pension payments typically do not come due until the employee spouse has retired.further,the employee spouse alone may decide whether and when to retire.in gillmore,the california supreme court recognized that an employee ability to unilaterally delay retirement,and thereby deprive the of his or her interest in a pension,presented an opportunity for abuse,at.as a result,in california,if an employee spouse chooses to continue to work following divorce,the spouse may demand reimbursement for his or her share of the benefits that would have been forthcoming if the employee spouse had retired.id.at.
in this case,the divorce court did not calculate the present value of the pension and,instead,awarded an division of benefits.the court calculated the community interest as per benefit that would have been forthcoming had john retired on the date of julie share as.julie exercised her rights under gillmore,and john was ordered to reimburse his for the amounts she lost as a result of his decision to continue working.the court also ordered the pension board to make similar payments to julie following john retirement.because these payments were related to julie community property interests and were not alimony,there was no provision for their cessation upon her death or remarriage.instead,john was required to make payments until he retired,and the pension board was ordered to make payments for as long as benefits were payable,even if julie died in the interim,in which case benefits would flow to her designated beneficiaries.
in,john paid to julie pursuant to the divorce court order.while he was free to use any property at his disposal,he funded the payments out of the wages he earned in exchange for his continued employment with the john claimed this amount as deductible alimony on his federal income tax return and the irs disallowed the deduction.he then sought and was granted relief by the united states tax court which allowed him to reduce his income by without specifying whether appellant was entitled to exclude a portion of his wages from gross income or deduct,as alimony or otherwise,the payments made to his.dunkin comm r,wl.

jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction over the final judgment of the united states tax court under a.we review decisions of the tax court on the same basis as we would any decision rendered by a district court in a civil bench trial.condor,comm r,cir.therefore,we review the court factual findings for clear error,its discretionary rulings for abuse of discretion,and its conclusions of law de novo.id.
under the internal revenue code,income taxes are assessed based on a person taxable income,defined as gross income less deductions allowed by the code,a.broadly speaking,the question in this case is whether john was entitled to exclude from gross income the in wages that he paid over to julie in or,if not,whether he was entitled to deduct the payments as alimony.

general principles 
the first step in arriving at taxable income is to determine an individual gross income.although the term is defined broadly and somewhat circularly to include all income from whatever source derived,a,certain accessions to wealth that would ordinarily constitute income may be excluded by statute or other operation of law.see listing items specifically excluded from gross income.however,given the clear congressional intent to exert the full measure of its taxing power,comm r glenshaw glass.internal citations and quotation marks omitted,exclusions from gross income are construed narrowly in favor of taxation.merkel comm r,cir.
there is no statutory provision that could plausibly be said to exclude from gross income the accessions to wealth at issue in this case,the wages paid by the to john during the year.indeed,wages received in exchange for labor are the very paradigm of income.a.although john owed a debt to julie which he satisfied out of his monthly wages,standing alone,this is not a reason to exclude the wages from his gross income.alex comm r,cir it is not true that one paycheck is excludable from gross income whenever it is spoken for by creditors.
attribution of income in the marital context 
although the mere fact that john used a portion of his wages to satisfy a debt does not justify any exclusions from his income,the fact that the payments were made to his under the direction of a divorce court makes this case seem difficult.federal tax is imposed on the income of individuals.in poe seaborn,the supreme court,noting that of denotes ownership,held that where the community property laws of a state create in married persons vested property right s in the income of the community,including salaries or wages of either husband or wife,or both,id.at,each has taxable income in the amount of of such inflows.see also,united states mitche
