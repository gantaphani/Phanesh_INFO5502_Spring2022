this is an appeal by florida state lottery winners from the united states tax court decision that proceeds from the sale of the rights to future installment payments from lottery winnings lottery rights are taxable as ordinary income,rather than at the lower tax rate applied to the sale of a long term capital asset.the tax court specifically held that lottery rights are not capital assets as defined in section,under the judicially established substitute for ordinary income doctrine.we affirm.
background 
roland womack won a portion of an florida state lottery florida lotto prize on january.at the time,the prize was payable only in twenty annual installments of.womack received four such annual installments from to,and he reported those payments as ordinary income on the federal tax returns he filed jointly with his wife,marie womack.
in,florida amended its law to permit lottery winners to assign lottery rights.stat.womack subsequently sold the right to receive the remaining sixteen payments to singer asset finance company singer in exchange for a sum of.the total face value of the remaining payments was.the womacks reported the amount received from singer on their joint federal income tax return as proceeds from the sale of a long term capital asset.
maria spiridakos is also a florida lotto winner.she won a prize on january,payable in annual installments of.she received ten annual payments and,from to,she and her husband,anastasios spiridakos,reported those payments as ordinary income on their jointly filed federal income tax returns.spiridakos sold the right to receive her remaining payments to singer for,which the spiridakoses reported on their joint federal income tax return as proceeds from the sale of a long term capital asset 
the irs issued notices of deficiency to the womacks and the spiridakoses collectively,taxpayers for failure to pay tax on the lump sum payment as ordinary income.taxpayers each filed a petition with the tax court seeking a redetermination.the tax court consolidated the petitions and denied both on november.taxpayers now appeal

iii.discussion 
the question before us is whether lottery rights are capital assets as defined by section of the internal revenue code.income representing proceeds from the sale or exchange of a capital asset that a taxpayer holds for over a year is considered a capital gain,and is taxed at a favorable rate other income,or ordinary income,is taxed at a higher rate.section defines a capital asset as any property the taxpayer holds,but excludes certain items from the definition taxpayers held their lottery rights for more than one year before selling them,so taxpayers may report the lump sum payment they received in consideration as a capital gain if lottery rights are considered a capital asset.
the tax court and the four circuit courts to consider the question have concluded that lottery rights are not a capital asset within the definition set forth in section,prebola comm r,cir watkins comm r,cir lattera comm r,cir,cert.denied,d united states maginnis,cir davis comm r,wl.these decisions are based on the substitute for ordinary income doctrine,which provides that when a party receives a lump sum payment as essentially a substitute for what would otherwise be received at a future time as ordinary income that lump sum payment is taxable as ordinary income as well.comm r lake,d.we agree that the substitute for ordinary income doctrine applies to lottery rights,and therefore that proceeds from the sale of lottery rights are taxable as ordinary income.
a.the substitute for ordinary income doctrine 
the statutory definition of capital asset has never been read as broadly as the statutory language might seem to permit,because such a reading would encompass some things congress did not intend to be taxed as capital gains.maginnis,at.congress intended ordinary income to be the default tax rate,with capital gains treatment an exception applicable only in appropriate cases.in fact,the term capital asset is to be construed narrowly in accordance with the purpose of congress to afford treatment only in situations typically involving the realization of appreciation in value accrued over a substantial period of time.comm r gillette motor,d.this interpretation prevents taxpayers from circumventing ordinary income tax rates by selling rights to future ordinary income payments in exchange for a lump sum.see lake,at.at.
the doctrine is attributed to four seminal supreme court cases hort commissioner,commissioner lake,commissioner gillette motor transport,and united states.the taxpayer in hort,a building owner,received a lump sum in exchange for cancelling a lease on the property.the sum was taxable as ordinary income because it was essentially a substitute for the rental payments,themselves obviously ordinary income.id.at.at.in lake,at.at,the taxpayer,a corporation,assigned a portion of oil and sulphur payment rights to its president in consideration for the cancellation of a debt the corporation owed to the president.the supreme court considered the profit to be in essence a substitution for the oil and sulphur payments that the corporation would have otherwise received in the future,and held it taxable as ordinary income for that reason.id.at.at.
the gillette taxpayer owned a motor vehicle facility during world war ii,which the government assumed control of and for which it paid just compensation.gillette,at.at.though the taking involved property for purposes of the fifth amendment takings clause,that fact did not answer the entirely different question whether the compensation comes within the provisions of the internal revenue code.id.at.at.indeed,the supreme court held the compensation paid to taxpayer taxable as ordinary income.id.at.at.finally,in,d,the taxpayer bought promissory notes subject to an original issue discount,and then sold them for more than the issue price but still less than face value.the supreme court held that the gains attributable to the original issue discount were taxable as ordinary income,noting the similarity to stated interest.id.at.at.the overall effect of these cases has been to narrow what a mechanical application of section would otherwise cause to be treated as a capital asset.
with that background,four circuits have reviewed the precise legal question we face here under materially identical circumstances each circuit has concluded that lottery rights are substitutes for ordinary income,but came to this conclusion in different ways.the ninth circuit used a analysis,but focused on two factors in particular that the taxpayer did not make any underlying investment of capital in return for the receipt of his lottery right,and the sale of his right did not reflect an accretion in value over cost to any underlying asset he held.maginnis,at.though the maginnis court noted that these factors would not be dispositive in all cases,the third circuit in lattera,at,found the factors problematic,and instead formulated its own approach,which it termed the family resemblance test.within the confines of this test,the third circuit analyzed the nature of the sale and the character of the asset,specifically,whether the payment was for the future right to earn income or for the future right to earned income.id.at.the second and tenth circuits did not explicitly adopt the maginnis reasoning or the lattera test,but held that whatever the substitute for ordinary income doctrine outer limits,this case falls squarely within them.prebola,at see watkins,at w e need not formulate any specific test regarding the appropriate limits of the doctrine application.wolman comm r,cir for the same reasons stated in watkins,we reject the wolmans argument and hold that the lump sum payments were taxable as ordinary income.
we agree with our sister circuits that lottery rights are a clear case of a substitute for ordinary income.a lottery winner who has not sold the right to his winnings to a third party must report the winnings as ordinary income whether the state pays him in a lump sum or in installments.see d describing tax treatment for losses from wagering transactions comm r groetzinger,d describing the lottery as a form of public gambling subject to d provision regarding wagering losses.thus,when a lottery winner sells the right to his winnings,he replaces future ordinary income.in defining capital asset,congress did not intend for taxpayers to circumvent ordinary income tax treatment by packaging ordinary income payments and selling them to a third party.see lake,at.at illustrating courts need to protect against artful devices.
there are important differences between lottery rights and the typical capital asset.the sale of a capital asset captures the increased value of the underlying asset.perhaps the most common example occurs when a taxpayer purchases shares of stock,owns the shares for longer than a year,and then sells them at a higher price.the taxpayer makes an underlying investment in a capital asset when he purchases the stock.when he sells the shares at a higher price,the gain represents an increase in the value of the original investment.as the ninth circuit noted in maginnis,at,lottery rights lack these characteristics emblematic of capital rights involve no underlying investment of capital.furthermore,any gain from their sale reflects no change in the value of the asset.it is simply the amount taxpayers would have received eventually,discounted to present value 
furthermore,when a lottery winner sells lottery rights,he transfers a right to income that is already earned,not a right to earn income in the future.see lattera,at.the fifth circuit long ago drew this distinction in united states dresser industries,cir,when it held that proceeds from the grant of an exclusive license to use an oil well surveying patent warranted capital gains treatment.recognizing the vast difference between the present sale of the future right to earn income and the present sale of the future right to earned income,id.at,the dresser court noted that an exclusive patent license is property that can produce unknown income in the future,as opposed to property that represents income payments already certain in amount,but to be paid in the future.
a capital asset has the potential to earn income in the future based on the owner actions in using it.lottery winners,by contrast,are entitled to the income merely by virtue of owning the property.note,thomas sinclair,limiting the doctrine an analysis through its most recent application involving the sale of future lottery rights,see lattera,at dresser,at.income need not be accrued for tax purposes to be earned in this sense.thomas united states,d,aff,cir holding that a lottery winner must report income from winnings during the period the payment was received.thus,income from a lottery payment is earned income despite the fact that it does not accrue until the scheduled annual payment date.proceeds from the sale of lottery rights are a clear substitute for ordinary income and are taxable as ordinary income.
effect of arkansas best 
we briefly address taxpayers argument that the supreme court decision in arkansas best comm r,d,significantly limited the substitute for ordinary income doctrine.like other courts that have confronted it,we reject this contention.maginnis,at lattera,at davis,at gladden comm r,wl,rev on other grounds,cir fnma comm r,wl.
the arkansas best court discussed the substitute for ordinary income doctrine in a footnote the footnote reads,in full 
petitioner mistakenly relies on cases in which this court,in narrowly applying the general definition of capital asset,has construed capital asset to exclude property representing income items or accretions to the value of a capital asset themselves properly attributable to income,even though these items are property in the broad sense of the word.united states,d.see,comm r gillette motor transport,d capital asset does not include compensation awarded taxpayer that represented fair rental value of its facilities comm r lake,d sic capital asset does not include proceeds from sale of oil payment rights hort comm r.capital asset does not include payment to lessor for cancellation of unexpired portion of a lease.this line of cases,based on the premise that property does not include claims or rights to ordinary income,has no application in the present context.petitioner sold capital stock,not a claim to ordinary income.
best,at.at emphasis added and citation formatting modified.this footnote affirmed that the substitute for ordinary income doctrine applies to property that represents a claim to ordinary income.
taxpayers urge a different interpretation.they focus on the court use of the word narrowly and insist that the factual scenarios corresponding to the four supreme court cases cited in the footnote,hort,lake,gillette,and,are the only surviving remnants of the substitute for ordinary income doctrine.they argue that because the footnote directly clashes with the body of the opinion the only logical reading of the use of the term narrowly in footnote is that only in those particular narrow factual situations that existed in the cited cases is the d octrine applicable.br.for the appellants.
taxpayers reading is not the natural one.in the footnote,the word narrowly modifies the phrase that immediately follows,applying the general definition of capital asset.the footnote unambiguously explains that in the cited cases,the court applied the statutory definition of capital asset narrowly.it in no way implies that the court applied the substitute for ordinary income doctrine narrowly,nor hints that the court would confine the doctrine to the facts of the cases it cites.to the contrary,the court cites general language that indicates that it would apply the doctrine in any situation involving income items or accretions to the value of a capital asset themselves properly attributable to income.best,at.at quoting,at.at.we have no trouble reconciling this footnote with the body of the arkansas best opinion for the reasons stated in the footnote itself the taxpayer in that case sold capital stock,not a claim to ordinary income.id.we reject taxpayers attempt to limit the substitute for ordinary income doctrine in an unreasonable manner not suggested by the relevant case law.
this is not to say that the substitute for ordinary income doctrine applies upon the sale of every asset that produces ordinary income.taken to its logical extreme,the substitute for ordinary income doctrine would obliterate capital gains treatment altogether because a capital asset present value is often based on its future ability to produce revenue in the form of ordinary income.maginnis,at.we acknowledge that the doctrine has its outer limits,but we do not define them here.we merely recognize that arkansas best did not circumscribe the substitute for the ordinary income doctrine.see,maginnis,at lattera,at.
property under section 
as taxpayers note,arkansas best makes clear that if a given asset is not listed within section exclusions,it is a capital asset unless it is not considered property.best,at.at.the pertinent treasury department regulation also provides that t he term capital assets includes all classes of property not specifically excluded by section.a.the parties do not dispute that lottery rights are not within the statutory exclusions.therefore,in deciding that the substitute for ordinary income doctrine applies,we necessarily find that lottery rights do not constitute property as that term is used in section.mertens law of federal income taxation hereinafter mertens in situations where the court determines that the intangible right is a substitute for ordinary income,the court concludes either implicitly or explicitly that the asset sold does not constitute property for purposes of section.
taxpayers also note that lottery rights are property in the ordinary sense of the term and for purposes of other state and federal laws.we recognize
