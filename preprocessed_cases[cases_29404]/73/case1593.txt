plaintiffs appeal from a judgment denying their petition for a writ of mandate directed to defendants the city of anaheim,mayor curt pringle,and city attorney jack white collectively,anaheim.plaintiffs sought to compel anaheim to litigate tax assessment proceedings without the assistance of outside counsel retained pursuant to a contingency fee agreement.they contend outside counsel contingency fee arrangement violates a government lawyer duty of neutrality.see people ex rel.clancy superior court cal d,clancy.
clancy grants that there are cases in which a government may hire an attorney on a contingent fee to try a civil case.clancy,supra,cal d at.but clancy bars contingency fee lawyers from being the government representative in a vaguely defined class of civil actions clancy,supra,cal d at,that require a balancing of interests and a delicate weighing of values id.at.the only california appellate case applying this restriction is clancy itself,which barred a contingency fee lawyer from trying public nuisance actions as the city attorney.clancy does not bar contingency fee lawyers from assisting government lawyers as in ordinary civil litigation.this is such a case.the tax assessment proceeding is a civil administrative action that does not require the delicate weighing of values described in clancy.we affirm the judgment denying plaintiffs writ petition.
the taxes and the contingency fee agreements 
plaintiffs are online travel companies that provide the service of facilitating the reservation of hotel rooms at hotels in the city,or are corporate affiliates of such companies anaheim through the law firm kiesel,boucher and larson informed plaintiffs in october they were liable for failing to remit transient occupancy taxes.
the transient occupancy tax is a local hotel tax.anaheim,et every city hotel guest or other transient,must pay a tax in the amount of fifteen percent of the rent f or the privilege of occupancy of space in any hotel.every hotel o perator,shall collect the tax at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient,and remit the collected taxes to anaheim each month.
plaintiffs responded to the tax notice by asking anaheim whether its outside counsel was serving on a contingency fee basis.plaintiffs later asked for a copy of the retention agreement and followed with a formal request under the california public records act,et.
anaheim produced three retention agreements in march.in the first agreement,dated april,anaheim retained kiesel,boucher and larson,llp,and baron and budd,as special counsel to represent it in litigation seeking relief for the or underpayment to the city of transient occupancy taxes by online booking companies collectively,the litigation.the law firms agreed to obtain prior approval from the city concerning all substantive matters related to the litigation including dispositive motions,selection of consultants and experts,and resolution of the litigation.the city agrees to consult in good faith with special counsel prior to making a recommendation regarding any such substantive matter.anaheim designated its city attorney to direct special counsel this designation is intended to establish a clear line of authority and to minimize potential uncertainty 
the retention agreement provided for compensation on a contingency fee basis.outside counsel would receive percent of any gross recovery and t he sole contingency upon which the city would pay compensation to special counsel is a recovery and collection on behalf of the city,whether by settlement,arbitration award,court judgment,or otherwise.
the retention agreement contemplated legal challenges to the contingency fee agreement.it provided,in the event that this contingency fee agreement is found to be invalid,special counsel agrees to continue to represent the city in the litigation with the understanding that,if there is no recovery,the city will owe nothing for attorneys fees or costs.if there is a recovery including collection of the recovery,and this contingency fee agreement is found to be invalid,the city shall pay a reasonable fee for the services rendered,plus costs.
in the second agreement,dated october,anaheim retained diamond mccarthy llp as additional associate counsel in the tax litigation.the agreement had similar terms regarding the scope of the representation and the relationship between anaheim and outside counsel,though it now also specified that t he city attorney,as the chief legal officer for the city,is charged with representing the city in legal proceedings with respect to which it has an interest.its contingency fee provisions mirrored those in the first agreement.the third retention agreement provided for fee sharing among the three law firms acting as outside counsel.
anaheim issued estimated tax assessments to plaintiffs in may,which plaintiffs appealed by requesting an administrative hearing plaintiffs challenged the propriety of the contingency fee agreements in their hearing request and subsequent filings with the hearing officer.the administrative hearing officer ruled he lacked jurisdiction to consider anaheim contingency fee arrangement with outside counsel.
the writ proceedings 
plaintiffs petitioned for a writ of mandate directing anaheim to immediately cease and desist using contingency fee counsel in the administration and enforcement of the city transient occupancy tax.they asserted anaheim violated its duty of neutrality by involving persons in the tax enforcement and collection process that have a financial interest in the outcome.
plaintiffs offered a declaration from their counsel.plaintiffs counsel stated,contingency fee counsel has represented and acted for the city in every aspect of the anaheim administrative appeal hearing process.contingency fee counsel have handled all communications and negotiations with plaintiff online travel companies regarding those proceedings,prepared and submitted all briefing to the hearing officer,made legal argument for the city at the hearings,made all evidentiary objections for the city,all witnesses for the city,and has been the city exclusive mouthpiece at the hearings for its legal positions and issues.during four days of testimony,resulting in a page transcript,the record reflects that the city counsel spoke no more than eleven times,and each time for the sole purpose of scheduling access of the city hearing room.
plaintiffs counsel further stated anaheim auditor manager,susan grabemeyer grande,admits under oath contingency fee counsel retained outside expert,econ one,calculated the estimated assessment for each plaintiff online travel company,and her role as to the estimated assessments was essentially limited to checking econ one math.
plaintiffs also offered the auditor manager declaration from a separate hotel tax class action.transient occupancy tax cases super.county,jccp.she stated that her office would estimate the tax due by the online travel companies by using the best information available to her.based on the plaintiffs tax payments and data obtained by an anaheim consultant,econone,she determined that a valid estimate of the amounts due by each online travel company could be calculated by using a process using this information she allowed econone to perform these calculations,but instructed her senior management auditors to review the calculations of econone to insure that such calculations were accurate and done pursuant to the typical and normal methodology used by her office.
anaheim opposed the petition,offering a new declaration from the auditor manager.she stated,i and my staff directed the methodology and calculations of the assessments on the online travel companies to ensure compliance with chapter of the anaheim municipal code and consistency with anaheim past audit practices.econone provided assistance and their expertise with the online travel companies data file and prepared the initial assessment schedule.i and my staff then recalculated and verified the calculations,ensured compliance with the ordinance and performed sample testing of the data submitted by the online travel companies to hotel records.
anaheim also offered a declaration from assistant city attorney,moses johnson iv.he explained that i n november,employees of the city advised the city to collect the full amount of the transient occupancy tax on rooms rented online.the city made a decision to collect these taxes from the online travel companies well before retaining outside counsel in april.
the assistant city attorney described his role in overseeing the tax assessment proceedings.he stated the city attorney assigned me to be the attorney from the city of anaheim city attorney department to oversee,supervise and control the assessment process,administrative proceedings and any subsequent litigation that the city of anaheim was preparing to commence against the online travel companies.in carrying out the charge to oversee,supervise,and control the assessment,administrative and litigation processes and procedures relative to the city of anaheim claims against the online travel companies for outstanding transient occupancy tax interest and penalties,i have performed the following functions participated in and overseen virtually all substantive discussions by and among city personnel and outside counsel participated in,overseen and approved all substantive decisions concerning the city of anaheim claims against the online travel companies and have overseen and approved the subsequent implementation of those substantive decisions by outside counsel reviewed and approved virtually all written communications and documents submitted to the online travel companies,the online travel companies counsel,the administrative hearing officer and the courts by outside counsel.he continued,to perform these functions,constant communication between me and outside counsel has occurred,usually on a daily basis.there have been dozens of conference calls,which usually occur several times per week outside counsel may not,and have not,engaged in any substantive actions or decisions without my direction,oversight and approval.my direction,oversight,and approval has been present from the beginning and continues on a daily basis.
after a hearing,the court denied the petition.it found,the facts of the instant action are distinctly different from clancy,which must be strictly construed.it entered judgment accordingly.
discussion 
t he courts have authority to disqualify counsel when necessary in the furtherance of justice.clancy,supra,cal d at.contrary to anaheim claim on appeal,the writ petition was an appropriate method to seek the disqualification of outside counsel.an appeal from the hearing officer decision would be an inadequate remedy for violation of the duty of neutrality see clancy,at,issuing writ of mandate disqualifying counsel.we turn now to that duty.
the clancy case 
plaintiffs contend clancy imposes a duty on anaheim to be absolutely neutral in the tax assessment proceedings clancy,supra,cal d at,and that this duty bars anaheim from retaining outside counsel in those proceedings on a contingency fee basis.but clancy grants that there are cases in which a government may hire an attorney on a contingent fee to try a civil case.ibid.thus,there is considerable tension in clancy holding.
this tension requires careful analysis of clancy,not casual citation to its most sweeping rhetoric.the language of an opinion must be construed with reference to the facts presented by the case the positive authority of a decision is coextensive only with such facts.plcm group,drexler cal th,d,limiting factually inapt california supreme court precedent.
in clancy,the city of corona retained a private lawyer,james clancy,to prosecute public nuisance abatement actions against businesses selling obscene publications.clancy,supra,cal d at.the retention agreement provided clancy was an independent contractor to be paid per hour if the city won and recovered attorney fees,or per hour otherwise.id.at.acting as the city special attorney,clancy filed a complaint against a bookstore and its operator.id.at.the trial court denied the defendants request to disqualify clancy.ibid.
on review,the clancy court issued a writ of mandate dismissing clancy as the city attorney in the pending action.clancy,supra,cal d at.its analysis began by review ing the responsibilities associated with the prosecution of a criminal case and the prosecutor considerable discretionary power to decide what crimes are to be charged and how they are to be prosecuted.id.at.from its review,clancy concluded a criminal prosecutor has a duty of neutrality.ibid.it later noted,c ontingent fee contracts for criminal prosecutors have been recognized to be unethical and potentially unconstitutional,but there is virtually no law on the subject.id.at.lacking other authority,the court relied on a textbook citing an unnamed new mexico case and an american bar association standard.ibid.
clancy used the criminal prosecutor duty of neutrality as a starting point.relying on an american bar association code,it stated,these duties are not limited to criminal prosecutors a government lawyer in a civil action or administrative proceeding has the responsibility to seek justice and to develop a full and fair record,and he should not use his position or the economic power of the government to harass parties or to bring about unjust settlements or results.clancy,supra,cal d at.it further stated,when a government attorney has a personal interest in the litigation,the neutrality so essential to the system is violated.for this reason prosecutors and other government attorneys can be disqualified for having an interest in the case extraneous to their official function.ibid.each of the four cases cited in support of this proposition involved judges or criminal prosecutors not other government attorneys.clancy,at.
clancy did cite an eminent domain case for the proposition that government lawyers must be unaffected by personal interests.clancy,supra,cal d at,citing city of los angeles decker cal d,decker.it noted,the duty of a government attorney in an eminent domain action,which has been characterized as a sober inquiry into values,designed to strike a just balance between the economic interests of the public and those of the landowner citation,is of high order.clancy,supra,cal d at.but decker did not involve contingency fee lawyers.in that case,the city attorney committed misconduct by denying that the highest and best use of the condemned parcel would be offsite airport parking even though he knew the city intended to use the parcel to fill just that need.decker,at.decker criticized the city failure to develop a full and fair record and its breach of responsibility to arrive at just compensation.id.at.
clancy likened public nuisance cases to eminent domain cases on the ground that s imilarly,the abatement of a public nuisance involves a balancing of interests.on the one hand is the interest of the people in ridding their city of an obnoxious or dangerous condition on the other hand is the interest of the landowner in using his property as he wishes.and when an establishment such as an adult bookstore is the subject of the abatement action,something more is added to the balance not only does the landowner have a first amendment interest in selling protected material,but the public has a first amendment interest in having such material available for purchase.thus,as with an eminent domain action,the abatement of a public nuisance involves a delicate weighing of values.any financial arrangement that would tempt the government attorney to tip the scale can not be tolerated.clancy,supra,cal d at.
clancy also likened public nuisance cases to criminal prosecutions.public nuisance abatement actions share the public interest aspect of eminent domain and criminal cases,and often coincide with criminal prosecutions.these actions are brought in the name of the people by the district attorney or city attorney.citation.a person who maintains or commits a public nuisance is guilty of a misdemeanor.citation.a public or common nuisance is a species of criminal offense,consisting of an interference with the rights of the community at large as in the case of other crimes,the normal remedy is in the hands of the state.citations.a suit to abate a public nuisance can trigger a criminal prosecution of the owner of the property.this connection between the civil and criminal aspects of public nuisance law further supports the need for a neutral prosecuting attorney.clancy,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.
in a footnote,clancy took pains to distinguish a case that approved the assistance of a private attorney only because he appeared not in place of the state duly authorized counsel.clancy,supra,cal d at,fn,citing sedelbauer state,sedelbauer.in the following footnote,it noted that even if clancy may have had little discretion in the decision whether to bring an action,the prosecutor discretionary functions continue through trial.clancy,at,fn.
finally,clancy reached its holding.thus we hold that the contingent fee arrangement between the city and clancy is antithetical to the standard of neutrality that an attorney representing the government must meet when prosecuting a public nuisance abatement action.clancy,supra,cal d at.
the reach of clancy holding is limited 
clancy does not bar governmental entities from retaining outside counsel on a contingency fee basis in all actions.clancy conceded the government may retain private lawyers to litigate certain civil actions,even on a contingency fee basis.nothing we say herein should be construed as preventing the government,under appropriate circumstances,from engaging private counsel.certainly there are cases in which a government may hire an attorney on a contingent fee to try a civil case.clancy,supra,cal d at.it cited a case involving a contingent fee arrangement whereby the city hired a law firm to represent it in all matters relating to the protection of its oil rights,citing denio city of huntington beach cal d,denio,overruled on a different ground in fracasse brent cal d.
more recent cases have endorsed government retention of outside counsel on a contingency fee basis.one california court affirmed a writ of mandate directing a city to pay its outside counsel contingency fee,holding the arrangement comported with municipal debt limitations.law offices of cary lapidus city of wasco th,d lapidus.another california court affirmed a judgment awarding contingency fees to a city attorney,holding the arrangement complied with statutes barring public officials from having personal financial interests in official decisions or contracts.campagna city of sanger th,d campagna.the duty of neutrality was not addressed in either case.still,it would appear california governments have routinely retained contingency fee counsel for decades,before and after clancy.
we decline to extend clancy reach beyond the two limitations of its holding implied by its facts.t he positive authority of a decision is coextensive only with the facts presented by the case.plcm,supra,cal th at,d.
first,clancy does not bar the use of contingency fee lawyers in all civil litigation.this limitation is shown by clancy concession that c ertainly there are cases in which a government may hire an attorney on a contingent fee to try a civil case clancy,supra,cal d at,its statement that the duty of absolute neutrality applies only to a class of civil actions,not to all civil actions ibid.and its comparison of public nuisance actions with eminent domain actions,which involve a sober inquiry into values,a balancing of interests and a delicate weighing of values id.at.
second,even in that class of actions where clancy otherwise applies,it does not bar contingency fee lawyers from assisting government lawyers as.this limitation is shown by the starting point of clancy analysis the focus on a criminal prosecutor considerable discretionary power to decide what crimes are to be charged and how they are to be prosecuted clancy,supra,cal d at,the reminder that the prosecutor discretionary functions continue past the filing decision and into the trial tactics id.at,fn,and the footnote distinguishing the sedelbauer case on the ground the private attorney appeared not in place of the state duly authorized counsel.clancy,at,fn.when contingency fee lawyers assist government lawyers as,the considerable discretionary power that clancy seeks to protect remains vested in the government lawyers.the government lawyers check the contingency fee lawyer financial interests.
other courts have recognized the same two limitations.
one federal district court in california denied a motion to disqualify contingency fee lawyers from a tort action,finding the case is sufficiently distinguishable from clancy to allow for the government retention of private counsel.city and county of san francisco philip morris.it noted outside counsel is acting here as,with plaintiffs respective government attorneys retaining full control over the course of the litigation.because plaintiffs public counsel are actually directing this litigation,the court finds that the concerns expressed in clancy regarding overzealousness on the part of private counsel have been adequately addressed ibid.it further noted,this lawsuit does not raise concerns analogous to those in the public nuisance or eminent domain contexts discussed in clancy and the case as it stands now will not require the private attorneys to argue about policy choices or value judgments ibid.
another federal district court in california found clancy did not require disqualification of contingency fee lawyers because defendants have not countered plaintiff showing that the city attorney for the city of grass valley is acting as in this action and the city retains ultimate authority in the case.city of grass valley newmont mining,cv geb dad,wl.
the supreme court of rhode island distinguished clancy and allowed contingency fee lawyers to act as in a public nuisance action.state lead industries.it held,there is nothing unconstitutional or illegal or inappropriate in a contractual relationship whereby the attorney general hires outside attorneys on a contingent fee basis to assist in the litigation of certain matters.indeed,it is our view that the ability of the attorney general to enter into such contractual relationships may well,in some circumstances,lead to results that will be beneficial to society results which otherwise might not have been attainable.however,due to the special duty of attorneys general to seek justice and their wide discretion with respect to same,such contractual relationships must be accompanied by exacting limitations.in short,it is our view that the attorney general is not precluded from engaging private counsel pursuant to a contingent fee agreement in order to assist in certain civil litigation,so long as the office of attorney general retains absolute and total control over all critical in any case in which such agreements have been entered into.id.at,fns.omitted.
the maryland high court similarly allowed contingency fee lawyers to assist government lawyers in a tort action.philip morris glendening.it distinguished clancy because there are no constitutional or criminal violations directly implicated here,and,hence,there is no potential conflict of interest.phillip morris,at.it noted the clancy arrangement did not provide for the oversight of an elected state official.philip morris,at.in contrast,the retention agreement there entrusted to the attorney general the authority to control all aspects of outside counsel handling of the litigation,whose authority shall be final,sole and unreviewable.ibid.
these cases bolster our confidence we have read clancy carefully and faithfully,as we must see auto equity sales,superior court cal d.clancy bars governments from granting sole litigation discretion to contingency fee lawyers in public nuisance actions and perhaps to other actions requiring delicate balancing and weighing of interests and values.only those cases fall within the class of civil actions wherein the duty of absolute neutrality bars contingency fees.
clancy allows the city attorney to receive assistance from contingency fee in the tax assessment proceedings 
clancy twin limitations render it inapplicable here.
first,outside counsel do not act as anaheim sole representatives in the tax assessment proceedings.both contingency fee retention agreements designate the city attorney to direct special counsel and establish a clear line of authority and to minimize potential uncertainty the second agreement clarifies,t he city attorney,as the chief legal officer for the city,is charged with representing the city in legal proceedings with respect to which it has an interest.under both agreements,the city attorney must give prior approval to the law firms,after consult ing in good faith,for all substantive matters related to the litigation 
in practice,the city attorney actively exercises his supervisory authority over the tax assessment proceedings.the city attorney designated an assistant city attorney to oversee,supervise and control the assessment process,administrative proceedings and any subsequent litigation that the city of anaheim was preparing to commence against the online travel companies.the assistant city attorney stated he had participated in and overseen virtually all substantive discussions by and among city personnel and outside counsel participated in,overseen and approved all substantive decisions concerning the city of anaheim claims against the online travel companies and have overseen and approved the subsequent implementation of those substantive decisions by outside counsel and reviewed and approved virtually all written communications and documents submitted to the online travel companies,the online travel companies counsel,the administrative hearing officer and the courts by outside counsel.he has constant communication with the law firms,usually on a daily basis,and has engaged in dozens of conference calls with them,which usually occur several times per week.he stated the law firms may not,and have not,engaged in any substantive actions or decisions without my direction,oversight and approval.this constant,direct oversight by the city attorney office distinguishes this case from clancy,in which a single contingency fee lawyer served as the sole special attorney for the city in the public nuisance action.clancy,supra,cal d at.
plaintiffs do not offer evidence contradicting the assistant city attorney attestation to his active,constant supervision of this litigation.the declaration from their counsel addresses outside counsel litigation conduct,before and during the hearing,but it does not speak to the city attorney oversight and approval of those actions.the declarations from the auditor manager do not support plaintiffs characterization that the city role in issuing the estimated assessments was essentially limited to checking econ one math.read fairly,the declarations show the auditor manager determined that a valid estimate of the amounts due by each online travel company could be calculated by using a process and directed the methodology and calculations of the assessments before turning to econone to perform the initial calculations using its data and expertise.in any event,econone is not a contingency fee law firm.clancy is silent on the retention of experts.
second,this is a civil,administrative proceeding.it is not a criminal prosecution,for which c ontingent fee contracts have been recognized to be unethical and potentially unconstitutional.clancy,supra,cal d at.nor does a tax assessment proceeding fall within the class of civil actions that demands the representative of the government to be absolutely neutral.ibid.that class included public nuisance actions because they require a balancing of interests,and a delicate weighing of values.id.at.
this civil tax assessment proceeding requires no notable balancing or weighing of interests or values.unlike a public nuisance case,it does not require anaheim to balance a party use of its property against anaheim competing interests in abating dangerous or obnoxious conditions.unlike an eminent domain case,it does not require anaheim to balance a party ownership of property against anaheim interest in taking the property for public use.
all that this action requires is a determination that the transient occupancy tax is due.to be sure,anaheim must construe its municipal code to determine whether the tax is due,and decide whether to pursue its collection.but these are the unremarkable precursors to any civil litigation brought by a government entity not the balancing of interests and weighing of values contemplated by clancy.for anaheim to sue for breach of contract,for example,it would go through substantially the same process construe the contract to determine whether it has a claim,and decide whether to pursue that claim in every civil action,the government makes a discretionary determination that it should assert a valid claim.daily journal county of los angeles th,d governmental entities discretion whether to pursue claims can not be enjoined by mandate.extending clancy to this tax assessment proceeding simply because it requires some exercise of legal analysis is the tax owed and discretion should suit be filed would logically entail clancy expansion into breach of contract actions and any civil action requiring these same decisions actions in which government entities appear to employ contingency fee counsel routinely.see denio,supra,cal d,lapidus,supra,th at,d campagna,supra,th at,d.
in years,no california appellate court has extended clancy reach to civil actions generally or to any action other than one for public nuisance no sound reason exists why clancy would bar government lawyers from receiving assistance from contingency fee lawyers as in this case.
cases involving prosecutors and judges do not warrant disqualification here 
plaintiffs contend clancy should be extended to this case,even if not to all civil actions,because a tax assessment proceeding is analogous to a criminal prosecution.plaintiffs rely heavily on language from california cases addressing the potential conflicts of interests of criminal prosecutors see people eubanks cal th,d,eubanks conner,supra,cal d,greer,supra,cal d,people rhodes cal d.clancy,too,drew some of its broadest language from cases involving criminal prosecutors.clancy,supra,cal d at,citing conner,supra,cal d,greer,supra,cal d.
if anything,california law governing prosecutor recusal suggests outside counsel should not be disqualified here.penal code section supersedes cases like greer,supra,cal d at page,which required recusal for the mere appearance of impropriety.see conner,supra,cal d at.the statute sets forth a test i is there a conflict of interest and ii is the conflict so severe as to disqualify the district attorney from acting thus,while a conflict exists whenever there is a reasonable possibility that the da office may not exercise its discretionary function in an evenhanded manner,the conflict is disabling only if it is so grave as to render it unlikely that defendant will receive fair treatment.eubanks,supra,cal th at,d.t he potential for prejudice to the defendant the likelihood that the defendant will not receive a fair trial must be real,not merely apparent,and must rise to the level of a likelihood of unfairness.id.at,d.
thus,plaintiffs concern that the contingency fee arrangement creates the appearance of impropriety would be unavailing to recuse a criminal prosecutor.plaintiffs would have to show both a conflict and a likelihood of unfair treatment at the hands of outside counsel which they have not done.and the trial court decision not to disqualify outside counsel would be reviewed for an abuse of discretion.eubanks,supra,cal th at,d.on this record we would find none.it would be anomalous for us to disqualify outside counsel from a civil tax assessment proceeding when,on the same record,we would not recuse them from a criminal prosecution.
plaintiffs also rely upon a case that disqualified an attorney from a criminal prosecution.young ex rel.vuitton et fils,d young.using its supervisory power the court disqualified lawyers whose client had obtained an injunction barring certain defendants from engaging in trademark infringement from accepting a court appointment to prosecute criminal contempt charges against those defendants for violating the injunction.id.at.it held,counsel for a party that is the beneficiary of a court order
