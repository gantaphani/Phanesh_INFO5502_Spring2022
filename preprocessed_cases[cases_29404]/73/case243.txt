this appeal was brought by a lawyer and his law firm seeking access under the freedom of information act foia,b,to a memorandum the neiman memorandum or memorandum prepared by an assistant united states attorney in the southern district of new york southern district and sent to a public commission.the neiman memorandum outlines the southern district opinions and recommendations as to how the internal revenue service irs should conduct criminal tax investigations.the memorandum was written for,and forwarded to,the criminal investigation division review task force headed by judge william webster the webster commission,which was established by the irs to gather information and make suggestions on how to reform its criminal investigations department cid.the district court held that the government did not have to produce the neiman memorandum because it was shielded by the foia exemption for documents reflecting an agency deliberative processes,relying on b.
on appeal,plaintiffs claim that the neiman memorandum was not an intra or document as required for exemption under b because it was provided to the webster commission,an independent task force that intended to issue a public report of its findings,and that it is not privileged as material of an agency consultant.plaintiffs also contend that the neiman memorandum is not predecisional because it was prepared to assist the webster commission rather than the irs and does not relate to a sufficiently specific agency decision.they further argue that even if the deliberative process exemption applies,the government waived that protection by reproducing a quotation from the memorandum in the report published by the webster commission webster report or report.finally,they argue that if the document is protected,any purely factual sections should be made available.we disagree.we hold that the webster commission was a consultant to the irs that was charged with assisting the agency in developingits policy,rendering a memorandum sent from the southern district to the webster commission an document because the irs created the webster commission in order to help it decide whether and how to reform the cid,the document is predecisional because the webster commission report was not a final decision,the government did not waive executive privilege and after in camera review,the district court properly found that there were no reasonably segregable parts of the neiman memorandum subject to disclosure.
background 
during his confirmation hearings before the senate in the fall of,irs commissioner charles rossotti made a commitment to improving the quality of service provided by each of the major components of the agency.to that end,in july,rossotti asked judge william webster,former director of both the fbi and the cia,to establish a task force to conduct an independent review of the irs cid to determine cid effectiveness in accomplishing its mission,and make recommendations for improvement.judge webster recruited a number of experts with extensive experience in criminal investigations,law enforcement and federal prosecution to serve on the webster commission.
the webster commission spent nine months reviewing countless documents and interviewing over people,including a number of law enforcement officials.the webster commission specifically requested the opinions of the southern district because it handled more tax investigations than any other district.attorney shirah neiman wrote a memorandum expressing the views of the southern district on the various agency components involved in criminal tax enforcement the then existing focus of tax investigations and prosecutions and the deployment of irs resources the difference s between the southern district position on various issues and that of other agency components and the southern district recommendations to ensure the continuation of vigorous criminal tax enforcement.according to neiman,the neiman memorandum expressed the views of the southern district and not those of the department of justice as a whole or neiman as an individual,and her expectation that the memorandum would remain confidential contributed to her willingness to express the southern district opinions and policies about tax investigations.
the webster commission released its report on april,to significant media attention.the report includes both a factual inquiry into the practices of the cid and a set of recommendations about how the cid should be improved.included in the report is a letter from commissioner rossotti stating that the report will guide us to improve the work of this critically important component of tax administration for many years to come and that the irs concurred with the specific recommendations in the report,although noting that some of the recommendations,particularly those concerning organization structure,need further analysis and design work in coordination with our other organizational changes.
the neiman memorandum is mentioned twice in the report.first,the neiman memorandum is referenced in a footnote as representing an opposing view to the position held by the leadership of the department of justice criminal division,most united states attorneys,and other important figures in criminal enforcement,all of whom apparently believe that the cid should continue to investigate money laundering and narcotics cases.later in the report,it is quoted as criticizing the use of administrative investigations and irs summons because they are slower than grand jury subpoenas s ervice of an administrative summons simply does not convey the urgency of a grand jury subpoena,and is not as readily enforceable as a subpoena,and represented subjects of administrative investigations often succeed in dragging out these investigations for unimaginably long periods.
plaintiff john tigue,an attorney whose law firm,morvillo,abramowitz,grand,iason silberberg,often represents individuals in connection with federal grand jury tax investigations and irs administrative investigations,enforcement actions,and prosecutions,obtained a copy of the report and noticed the references to the neiman memorandum.believing that review of the neiman memorandum would improve his understanding of southern district policy and thus allow him to represent his clients better,tigue and his law firm plaintiffs submitted a foia request for the neiman memorandum on august.following a period of delay in which the department of justice doj and the irs attempted to discern which agency should respond to the foia request,the doj denied the application on april,and,on september,denied the appeal,citing b,which protects the deliberative process privilege.
on february,plaintiffs filed suit against the irs and the doj in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.the parties for summary judgment.following oral argument on october,judge hellerstein ruled that the neiman memorandum met the requirements of b and was therefore exempt from production under the foia,and that the government had not waived the privilege by citing to and quoting from the neiman memorandum in the published report.at that time the court also requested that the government review the neiman memorandum to determine whether any sections of the document could be produced as purely factual.on october,after in camera review of a marked copy of the neiman memorandum,the district court issued an order finding that the memorandum was predominantly evaluative,evaluating both policies and procedures of the united states attorney for the southern district of new york in criminal investigations involving tax matters and those of the internal revenue service,and recommending procedures for the internal revenue service.the district court also found that t here is no factual material in the report that is not inextricably intertwined with evaluations and recommendations of policy and thus denied plaintiffs alternative request for partial production of the neiman memorandum.
plaintiffs appeal both the october,and october,rulings.
discussion 
this court reviews de novo a district court grant of summary judgment in foia litigation.halpern fbi,cir.this court also reviews de novo a district court decisions whether to require partial production of documents following in camera review,in keeping with the spirit and the text of the foia and its presumption in favor of disclosure.grand cent,cuomo,cir.
the foia,was enacted to ensure public access to information created by the government in order to hold the governors accountable to the governed.nlrb robbins tire rubber,d.thus,u pon request,foia mandates disclosure of records held by a federal agency unless the documents fall within enumerated exemptions.dep t of the interior klamath water users protective ass n,d internal citations omitted.the supreme court has counseled that these exceptions are to be interpreted narrowly in the face of the overriding legislative intention to make records public.see id.at.
at issue here is foia exemption,which protects from disclosure or memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.b.stated simply,agency documents which would not be obtainable by a private litigant in an action against the agency under normal discovery rules,executive privilege are protected from disclosure under exemption.grand cent,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
specifically,the government claims that the deliberative process privilege,a of privilege that covers documents reflecting advisory opinions,recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated,klamath,at.quoting nlrb sears,roebuck,d,permits withholding of the neiman memorandum.the rationale behind this privilege is the obvious realization that officials will not communicate candidly among themselves if each remark is a potential item of discovery and front page news,and its object is to enhance the quality of agency decisions,by protecting open and frank discussion among those who make them within the government.id.at.quoting sears,at.accord coastal states,at the deliberative process privilege has a number of purposes it serves to assure that subordinates within an agency will feel free to provide the decisionmaker with their uninhibited opinions and recommendations without fear of later being subject to public ridicule or criticism to protect against premature disclosure of proposed policies before they have been finally formulated or adopted and to protect against confusing the issues and misleading the public by dissemination of documents suggesting reasons and rationales for a course of action which were not in fact the ultimate reasons for the agency action.
in order for a document to be protected by deliberative process privilege,it must be an or document predecisional and deliberative.see klamath,at.discussing the requirement local,int l of workers nlrb,cir enumerating the predecisional and deliberative requirements lead indus.ass n,osha,cir same.plaintiffs concede that the neiman memorandum is,at least in part,deliberative,but challenge the government right to withhold the memorandum on the other two grounds.
intra and communications 
as noted above,exemption protects only or communications.while documents are those that remain inside a single agency,and documents are those that go from one governmental agency to another,they are treated identically by courts interpreting foia.renegotiation bd.grumman aircraft eng g,d exemption does not distinguish between and memoranda.the question at issue regarding the intra or requirement is whether the document either originated from or was provided to an entity that is not a federal government agency,in which case the document is not protected by the exemption.
the supreme court has cautioned that the term is not just a label to be placed on any document the government would find it valuable to keep confidential.klamath,at.by statutory definition,agency means each authority of the government of the united states,with certain exemptions not relevant here.it is undisputed that the webster commission was not an agency.see meyer bush,holding that a task force created by the president to study regulatory relief is not an agency under the foia.from this uncontested point,plaintiffs reason that exemption can not apply.the government,in turn,contends that because the webster commission acted as a consultant to the irs,an agency,in soliciting the neiman memorandum,and relied on the neiman memorandum in preparing the webster report for the irs,the district court properly concluded that the neiman memorandum was an communication.the government also argues that the neiman memorandum could be deemed an communication because it was provided by the southern district for use in the irs process.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that because the webster commission was acting as a consultant to the irs when it solicited the neiman memorandum,and the neiman memorandum was prepared by the southern district,an agency,to assist the irs with determining how best to reform the cid,the neiman memorandum is an communication.
in considering the scope of exemption,this circuit has recognized that agencies may require assistance from outside consultants in formulating policy,and has held that nothing turns on the point that reports were prepared by outside consultants rather than agency staff.lead,at citing soucie david,accord ryan dep t of justice,when an agency record is submitted by outside consultants as part of the deliberative process,and it was solicited by the agency,we find it entirely reasonable to deem the resulting document to be an memorandum for purposes of determining the applicability of exemption.instead,w hether a particular document is exempt under b depends not only on the intrinsic character of the document itself,but also on the role it played in the administrative process.lead,at.
plaintiffs acknowledge that this court has held that communications with consultants may be considered,but argue,relying heavily on the circuit opinion in dow jones dep t of justice,that because the memorandum was prepared to assist the webster commission with its decisionmaking and was never reviewed by any irs decisionmaker,the consultant principle is inapposite.in dow jones,the government had argued that documents provided by the department of justice to congress were protected as documents.the circuit rejected that position on the grounds that documents prepared to assist with congress deliberative process could not be entitled to exemption privilege because congress was not an agency for foia purposes.id.here,in contrast,the webster commission was not acting on its own behalf in requesting the neiman memorandum from the southern,it was acting as a consultant to the irs,an agency,to assist that agency with developing policy recommendations regarding the cid.plaintiffs recognize,as they must,that the privilege would have been maintained had neiman given her memorandum directly to the irs.renegotiation,at.by including memoranda in exemption,congress plainly intended to permit one agency possessing decisional authority to obtain written recommendations and advice from a separate agency not possessing such decisional authority without requiring that the advice be any more disclosable than similar advice received from within the agency.the fact that neiman transmitted it to the webster commission for use in the commission recommendations on irs policy does not alter our view of the matter.
plaintiffs also contend that an agency consultant source material can not be withheld under exemption where the author had no reasonable expectation that her material would be kept confidential.according to plaintiffs,w here there is no fear of publicity,there is no basis in policy for extending exemption to consultants work,especially where the statutory language does not provide for such a result.the issue here,however,is not whether the webster commission public report is exempt,but rather,whether the commission may be considered a part of the irs for purposes of determining whether the neiman memorandum falls within the scope of exemption as an communication.although the webster commission may have
