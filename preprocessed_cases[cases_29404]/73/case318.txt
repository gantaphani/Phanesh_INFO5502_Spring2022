lottery winners,after receiving several annual installments of their lottery prize,sold for a lump sum the right to their remaining payments.they reported their sale proceeds as capital gains on their tax return,but the internal revenue service irs classified those proceeds as ordinary income.the doctrine holds that consideration substituting for something that would otherwise be received at a future time as ordinary income should be taxed the same way.we agree with the commissioner of the irs that the consideration paid for the right to lottery payments is ordinary income.
factual background and procedural history 
in june george and angeline lattera turned a lottery ticket into in the pennsylvania lottery.they did not then have the option to take the prize in a single payment,so they were entitled to annual installments of.
in september the latteras sold their rights to the remaining lottery payments to singer asset finance,llc for.under pennsylvania law,the latteras had to obtain court approval before they could transfer their rights to future lottery payments,and they did so in august.
on their joint tax return,the latteras reported this sale as the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year.they reported a sale price of,a cost or other basis of zero,and a capital gain of the full sale price.the commissioner determined that this sale price was ordinary income.in december the latteras were sent a notice of deficiency of 
in march the latteras petitioned the tax court for a redetermination of the deficiency.the court held in favor of the commissioner.the latteras now appeal to our court.

iii.discussion 
the lottery payments the latteras had a right to receive were gambling winnings,and the parties agree that the annual payments were ordinary income.comm r groetzinger,d calling a state lottery public gambling in a case treating gambling winnings as ordinary income.but the latteras argue that,when they sold the right to their remaining lottery payments,the sale gave rise to a capital gain.
whether the sale of a right to lottery payments by a lottery winner can be treated as a capital gain under the internal revenue code is one of first impression in our circuit.but it is not a new question.both the tax court and the ninth circuit court of appeals have held that such sales deserve treatment.united states maginnis,cir fundamental principles of tax law lead us to conclude that the assignment of a lottery right produced ordinary income.davis comm r,wl see also watkins comm r,cch,clopton comm r,cch,boehme comm r,cch.
the ninth circuit reasoning has drawn significant criticism,however.see matthew levine,case comment,lottery winnings as capital gains,yale,thomas sinclair,comment,limiting the income doctrine an analysis through its most recent application involving the sale of future lottery rights.in this context,we propose a different approach.we begin with a discussion of basic concepts that underlie our reasoning.
definition of a capital asset 
a capital gain or loss is created by the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than year.section of the internal revenue code defines a capital asset as property held by the taxpayer whether or not connected with his trade or business.this provision excludes from the definition certain property categories,none of which is applicable here 
a supreme court decision suggested that this definition can be construed too broadly,stating that it is evident that not everything which can be called property in the ordinary sense and which is outside the statutory exclusions qualifies as a capital asset.comm r gillette motor,d.the court noted that it had long held that the term capital asset is to be construed narrowly in accordance with the purpose of congress to afford treatment only in situations typically involving the realization of appreciation in value accrued over a substantial period of time,and thus to ameliorate the hardship of taxation of the entire gain in one year.id.but the supreme court decision in arkansas best commissioner,d,at least at first blush,seems to have reversed that narrow reading.arkansas best suggests instead that the definition is to be broadly construed.see id.at.the body of establishes a general definition of the term capital asset,and the phrase does not include takes out of that broad definition only the classes of property that are specifically mentioned.
b.the doctrine 
the problem with an overly broad definition for capital assets is that it could encompass some things congress did not intend to be taxed as capital gains.maginnis,at.an overly broad definition,linked with favorable tax treatment,would encourage transactions designed to convert ordinary income into capital gains.see id.at.for example,a salary is taxed as ordinary income,and the right to be paid for work is a person property.but it is hard to conceive that congress intends for taxpayers to get treatment if they were to sell their rights,property held by the taxpayer to their future paychecks.see boris bittker lawrence lokken,federal taxation of income,estates and gifts ed.
to get around this problem,courts have created the doctrine.this doctrine says,in effect,that lump sum consideration that seems essentially a substitute for what would otherwise be received at a future time as ordinary income may not be taxed as a capital gain.maginnis,at quoting comm r lake,d alteration in original.
the seminal case is the supreme court decision in hort commissioner.hort had inherited a building from his father,and one of the building tenants canceled its lease,paying hort a cancellation fee of.id.at.hort argued that the cancellation fee was capital gain,but the court disagreed,holding that the cancellation fee was ordinary income because the cancellation of the lease involved nothing more than relinquishment of the right to future rental payments in return for a present substitute payment and possession of the leased premises.id.at.
the supreme court bolstered the doctrine in lake.lake,was an oil and company with a working interest in two oil and gas leases.at.it assigned an oil payment right payable out of percent of the oil attributable to lake working interest in the two leases.id.at.lake reported this assignment as a sale of property taxable as capital gain.id.but the court disagreed,holding that the consideration received was taxable as ordinary income.id.at.the court reasoning gave full voice to the doctrine the lump sum consideration seems essentially a substitute for what would otherwise be received at a future time as ordinary income.id.at.
our court has rarely dealt with this doctrine.we have only cited lake in,tunnell united states,cir,and once in,hempt,united states,cir citing lake with approval,but deciding the case under a of transfers of property for corporate.
the latteras argue that the doctrine,which takes property held by the taxpayer outside the statutory definition,did not survive arkansas best.but although arkansas best ostensibly cabined the exceptions to the statutory definition,it made clear that the line of cases,based on the premise that property does not include claims or rights to ordinary income,ha d no application in the present context.arkansas best,at.the tax court has several times confirmed that arkansas best in no way affected the viability of the principle established in the line of cases.davis,at citing cases.and the ninth circuit agrees.maginnis,at.we follow suit,holding that the doctrine remains viable in the wake of arkansas best.
but there is a tension in the doctrine in theory,all capital assets are substitutes for ordinary income.see,william klein et,federal income taxation ed.a fundamental principle of economics is that the value of an asset is equal to the present discounted value of all the expected net receipts from that asset over its life.see also lake,at.noting that the to be ordinary for an asset was the present value of income which the recipient would otherwise obtain in the future.for example,a stock value is the present discounted value of the company future profits.see,maginnis,at united states dresser,cir applying this concept to the value of land.r ead literally,the doctrine would completely swallow the concept of capital gains.levine,supra,at accord bittker lokken,supra,at unless restrained,the theory thus threatens even the most familiar capital gain transactions.also,an overbroad substitute for ordinary income doctrine,besides being analytically unsatisfactory,would create the potential for the abuse of treating capital losses as ordinary.levine,supra,at.the doctrine must therefore be limited so as not to err on either side.
c.the lottery cases 
even before the ninth circuit decided maginnis,the tax court had correctly answered the question of whether sales of lottery winnings were capital gains.in davis commissioner,lottery winners had sold their rights to of their total future lottery payments for a lump sum.at.the tax court found that the payment to the lottery winners was the discounted value of certain ordinary income which they otherwise would have received during the years through.id.at.the court held,therefore,that the purchaser of the lottery payment rights paid money for the right to receive future ordinary income,and not for an increase in the value of property the lottery winners right to their future lottery payments was not a capital asset and the payment was to be taxed as ordinary income.see also watkins,cch at following davis,in a decision clopton,cch at citing tax court cases following davis.
in the ninth circuit decided maginnis,the first and so far only appellate opinion to deal with this question.maginnis won million in a lottery and,after receiving five of his lottery payments,assigned all of his remaining future lottery payments to a third party for a payment of.maginnis,at.the ninth circuit held that maginnis right to future lottery payments was not a capital asset and that the payment was to be taxed as ordinary income.id.at.
the court relied on the doctrine,but it was concerned about taking an approach that could potentially convert all capital gains into ordinary income or one that could convert all ordinary income into capital gains.id.the court opted instead for judgments as to whether the conversion of income rights into payments reflects the sale of a capital asset that produces a capital gain,or whether it produces ordinary income.id.it set out two factors,which it characterized as crucial to its conclusion,but not dispositive in all cases maginnis did not make any underlying investment of capital in return for the receipt of his lottery right,and the sale of his right did not reflect an accretion in value over cost to any underlying asset maginnis held.id.at.
but two commentators have criticized the analysis in maginnis,especially the two factors.see levine,supra,at sinclair,supra,at.the first investment of theoretically subject all inherited and gifted property which involves no investment at all to treatment.see levine,supra,at.it also does not explain the result in lake,where the company presumably made an investment in its working interest in oil and gas leases,yet the supreme court applied treatment.id.
the second factor also presents analytical problems.not all capital assets experience an accretion in value over cost.for example,cars typically depreciate,but they are often capital assets.see sinclair,supra,at.levine criticizes the second factor for attempt ing to determine the character of a gain from its amount.levine,supra,at.the maginnis court held that there was no accretion of value over cost in lottery winnings because there was no cost,as maginnis did not make any capital investment in exchange for his lottery right.at.but if maginnis purchase of a lottery ticket had been a capital investment,would the second factor automatically have been satisfied that is,the cost in that scenario would have been,and the increase would have been.our first instinct is no.moreover,the second factor does not seem to predict correctly the result in both hort where a building was inherited for no cost and lake where the working interest in the oil lease presumably had a cost,in both of which the taxpayer got treatment.
thus,while we agree with maginnis s result,we do not simply adopt its reasoning.and it is both unsatisfying and unhelpful to future litigants to declare that we know this to be ordinary income when we see it.the problem is that,u nless and until congress establishes an arbitrary line on the otherwise seamless spectrum between transactions and conventional capital gain transactions,the courts must locate the boundary case by case,a process that can yield few useful generalizations because there are so many relevant but imponderable criteria.bittker lokken,supra,at footnote omitted.
we therefore proceed to our analysis,but in doing so we set out a method for analysis that guides our result.at the same time,however,we recognize that any rule we create could not account for every contemplated transactional variation.
in our attempt to craft a rubric,we find helpful a second circuit securities case and a recent student comment.the second circuit dealt with a similarly seamless spectrum in when it needed to decide whether a note was a security for purposes of section b of the securities and exchange act.see exch.bank of chi.touche ross,cir.the court created a family resemblance test,presuming that notes of more than nine months maturity were securities,listing various types of those notes that it did not consider securities,and declaring that a note with maturity exceeding nine months that does not bear a strong family resemblance to these examples was a security.id.at.the supreme court,adopting this test in,added four factors to guide the resemblance analysis the motivations of the buyers and sellers,the plan of distribution,the public reasonable expectations,and applicable regulatory schemes.reves ernst young,d.
we adopt an analogous analysis.several types of assets we know to be capital stocks,bonds,options,and currency contracts,for example.see,arkansas best,at.though,as noted above,the value of a stock is really the present discounted value of the company future stock is most naturally viewed as a capital asset see also id.at.distinguishing capital stock from a claim to ordinary income simpson comm r,cch,distinguishing currency contracts,stocks,bonds,and options from a right to receive lottery payments.we could also include in this category physical assets like land and automobiles.
similarly,there are several types of rights that we know to be ordinary income,rental income and interest income.in gillette motor,the supreme court held that treatment was indicated for the right to use another,in other words.see at.similarly,in,the supreme court held that earned original issue discount should be taxed as ordinary income.see united states,d.there,the taxpayer purchased notes at a discount from the face amount and sold them for more than their issue price but still less than the face amount.id.at.this gain was conceded to be equivalent to interest,and the court held it taxable as ordinary income.id.at.
for the family resemblance test,we can set those two categories at the opposite poles of our analysis.for example,we presume that stock,and things that look and act like stock,will receive treatment.for the transactions that do not bear a family resemblance to the items in either category,like contracts and payment rights,we use two factors to assist in our analysis type of and character of asset 
the notion of the,or partial sale,has significant explanatory power in the context of the line of cases.as marvin chirelstein writes,the substitute language,in the view of most commentators,was merely a way of asserting that interests do not qualify as capital assets.marvin chirelstein,federal income taxation,at ed.
there are two ways of carving out interests from property horizontally and vertically.a horizontal is one in which temporal divisions are made in a property interest in which the person owning the interest disposes of part of his interest but also retains a portion of it.sinclair,supra,at.in lottery terms,this is what happened in davis,boehme,and lottery winners sold some of their future lottery payment rights,their and payments but retained the rights to payments further in the future,their and payments.see clopton,cch at finding that the lottery winner sold only some of his remaining lottery payments boehme,cch at same davis,at same.this is also what happened in hort and lake portions of the total interest a term of years carved out from a fee simple and a payment right from a working interest in a oil lease,respectively were carved out from the whole.
a vertical is one in which a complete disposition of a person interest in property is made.sinclair,supra,at.in lottery terms,this is what happened in watkins and lottery winners sold the rights to all their remaining lottery payments.see maginnis,at noting that the lottery winner assigned his right to receive all his remaining lottery payments watkins,cch at same.
horizontal typically lead to treatment.see,maginnis,at maginnis is correct that transactions in which a transfers an income right without transferring his entire interest in an underlying asset will often be occasions for applying the substitute for ordinary income doctrine.this was also the result reached in hort and lake.lake,at.hort,at.
vertical are different.in dresser industries,for example,the fifth circuit distinguished lake because the taxpayer in dresser had cut off a vertical slice of its rights,rather than carv ed out an interest from the totality of its rights.dresser,at.but as the results in maginnis and watkins demonstrate,a vertical does not necessarily mean that the transaction receives treatment.see,maginnis,at holding that a transaction in which a taxpayer sells his entire interest in an underlying asset without retaining any property right does not automatically prevent application of the substitute for ordinary income doctrine emphasis in original see also id.at.
because a vertical could signal either or treatment,we must make another determination to conclude with certainty which treatment should apply.therefore,when we see a vertical,we proceed to the second of the determine whether the sale proceeds should be taxed as ordinary income or capital gain.
character of the asset 
the fifth circuit in dresser industries noted that t here is,in law and fact,a vast difference between the present sale of the future right to earn income and the present sale of the future right to earned income.dresser,at emphasis in original.the taxpayer in dresser industries had assigned its right to an exclusive patent license back to the patent holder in exchange for a share of the licensing fees from licensees.id.at.the court used this right to earn income right to earned income distinction to hold that treatment was applicable.it noted that the asset sold was not a right to earned income,to be paid in the future,but was a property which would produce income.id.at.further,it disregarded the ordinary nature of the income generated by the asset because all property produces ordinary income,the sale of such property does not result in treatment.id.this can be seen in the sale of bonds,which produce ordinary income,but the sale of which is treated as capital gain.
sinclair explains the distinction in this way earned income conveys the concept that the income has already been earned and the holder of the right to this income only has to collect it.in other words,the owner of the right to earned income is entitled to the income merely by virtue of owning the property.sinclair,supra,at.he gives as examples of this concept rental income,stock dividends,and rights to future lottery payments.id.of course,in the wake of dividend tax reform,stock dividends are now taxed as capital gains.h.for the right to earn income,on the other hand,the holder of such right must do something further to earn the income because mere ownership of the right to earn income does not entitle the owner to income.sinclair,supra,at.following dresser industries,sinclair gives a patent as an example of this concept.id.
assets that constitute a right to earn income merit treatment,while those that are a right to earned income merit treatment.our court implicitly made this distinction in tunnell united states,cir.tunnell withdrew from a law partnership,and he assigned his rights in the law firm in exchange for.id.at.when he withdrew,the partnership had over in uncollected accounts receivable from work that had already been done.id.we agreed with the district court that the sale of a partnership is treated as the sale of a capital asset.id.the sale of a partnership does not,in and of itself,confer income on the buyer the buyer must continue to provide legal services,so it is a sale of the right to earn income.consequently,as we held,the sale of a partnership receives treatment.the accounts receivable,on the other hand,had already been earned the buyer of the partnership only had to remain a partner to collect that income,so the sale of accounts receivable is the sale of the right to earned income.thus,we held that the portion of the purchase price that reflected the sale of the accounts receivable was taxable as ordinary income.id.at.
similarly,when an erstwhile employee is paid a termination fee for a contract,that employee still possesses the asset the right to provide certain personal services and the money the termination fee has already been earned and will simply be paid.the employee no longer has to perform any more services in exchange for the fee,so this is not like dresser industries s right to earn income.these termination fees are therefore rights to earned income and should be treated as ordinary income.see,elliott united states,cir holt comm r,cir see also chirelstein,supra,at noting that courts have held consistently that payments made to an employee for the surrender of his employment contract are ordinary.
the factor also explains,for example,the second circuit complex decision in commissioner ferrer,cir.the actor josé ferrer had contracted for the rights to mount a stage production based on the novel moulin rouge.id.at.in the contract,ferrer obtained two rights relevant here the exclusive right to produce and present a stage production of the book and,if the play was produced,a share in the proceeds from any rights that stemmed from the book.id.at.after a movie studio planned to make moulin rouge into a agreed that it would feature sold these,along with other,rights.id.at.right would have required ferrer to have produced and presented the play to get income,so it was a right to earn,treatment was indicated.right,once it matured,once ferrer had produced the play,would have continued to pay income simply by virtue of ferrer holding the right,so it would have become a right to earned,treatment was indicated.the second circuit held as such,dictating treatment for right and treatment for right.id.at,
application of the family resemblance test 
applied to this case,the family resemblance test draws out as follows.first,we try to determine whether an asset is like either the capital asset category of assets,stocks,bonds,or land or like the income items category,rental income or interest income.if the asset does not bear a family resemblance to items in either of those categories,we move to the following factors.
we look at the nature of the sale.if the sale or assignment constitutes a horizontal,then treatment presumably applies.if,on the other hand,it constitutes a vertical,then we look to the factor.there,if the sale is a payment for a future right to earned income,we apply treatment,but if it is a payment for a future right to earn income,we apply treatment.
turning back to the latteras,the right to receive annual lottery payments does not bear a strong family resemblance to either the capital assets or the income items listed at the polar ends of the analytical spectrum.the latteras sold their right to
