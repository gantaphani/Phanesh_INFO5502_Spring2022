this appeal involves two sales.first,slone broadcasting sold essentially all of its assets to citadel broadcasting for million.the shareholders of slone broadcasting then sold all their shares to berlinetta,for million.the substance of the stock sale,according to the commissioner of the internal revenue service irs,is that the shareholders received a liquidating distribution from the corporation.the commissioner contends that the form of this transaction should be disregarded for federal tax law purposes.the shareholders,in turn,claim that the transaction was a legitimate stock sale transaction and its form must be respected.the tax court agreed with the shareholders.on appeal,we conclude that the tax court applied an incorrect test in holding that it would respect the form of the stock sale.
slone broadcasting,a radio broadcasting business,had two shareholders the slone revocable trust,for which james slone and his wife norma slone were trustees,and the slone family gst trust,for which john barkley was the sole trustee.on december,slone broadcasting entered into an asset purchase agreement with citadel broadcasting,in which citadel agreed to pay million for all assets of the radio stations owned and operated by slone broadcasting.the transaction closed in july.because slone broadcasting basis in these assets was million,slone broadcasting realized a capital gain of approximately million and incurred an estimated federal and state income tax liability of million.the corporation did not make any distributions to the shareholders.in october,slone broadcasting made its first federal income tax payment of million to the irs for the tax year ended june.
before the transaction with citadel closed,fortrend international,llc expressed an interest in a merger deal with slone broadcasting.fortrend proposed purchasing all of slone broadcasting shares for million,and then restructuring the company to engage in the asset recovery business.slone broadcasting shareholders investigated whether fortrend and its offer were legitimate.a tax attorney hired by the shareholders confirmed that fortrend business plan projections were reasonable,and he consulted with an industry expert to confirm that fortrend and its service provider were reputable and were represented by accounting and law firms.when the shareholders asked for information regarding the methods it would use to reduce the shareholders tax liability,fortrend would not respond,claiming its methods were proprietary.nevertheless,fortrend assured slone broadcasting that the transaction would not be a listed transaction pursuant to irs notice,c,which specifies tax avoidance transactions that must be disclosed or registered.on december,the slone broadcasting shareholders agreed to sell all the shares of slone broadcasting to berlinetta,a fortrend affiliate,for million.berlinetta agreed to assume slone broadcasting income tax liability.the shareholders,slone revocable trust and the slone family gst trust,received cash payments of million and million,respectively,from the sale.
after closing,slone broadcasting merged with berlinetta.the new company changed its name to arizona media holdings.on december,a shareholder of arizona media contributed treasury bills with a basis of million to the new company.arizona media then sold the bills for.arizona media filed its tax return for the tax year ended june,reporting a million gain from the asset sale and an offsetting loss of million from the treasury bill sale.arizona media claimed it had no income tax liability,and requested a refund for the million tax payment made by slone broadcasting.the irs granted this refund.
the irs began investigating arizona media in march.the irs assessed a tax deficiency for taxes due on slone broadcasting december sale of assets to citadel in the amount of million in,along with a penalty of million and interest of million arizona media failed to pay any of the assessed tax,penalty,or interest.in august,the state of arizona administratively dissolved arizona media for failure to file an annual report.
after failing to collect the tax deficiency from arizona media,the irs sent notices of liability to the former shareholders of slone broadcasting.the notices claimed that the shareholders were liable for the taxes owed on slone broadcasting sale of assets to citadel because the shareholders were transferees of slone broadcasting for purposes of.section authorizes the irs to require a transferee of assets to pay the unpaid taxes owed by the transferor under certain circumstances.the irs took the position that it could disregard the form of the shareholders sale of slone broadcasting stock to berlinetta.instead,according to the irs,the substance of the transaction was that slone broadcasting dissolved upon selling its assets to citadel,and then distributed those assets to its shareholders through the fortrend transaction.
the shareholders filed petitions for review of this determination in tax court,arguing that the form of the stock sale transaction to berlinetta should be respected,and therefore the shareholders were not transferees of slone broadcasting assets under.
the tax court agreed,holding that w e will respect the form of the transactions in this case.it first found that the asset sale between slone broadcasting and citadel was genuinely independent from the stock sale between slone broadcasting and berlinetta,and that there was no evidence that the slone broadcasting shareholders conducted the asset sale as the first step in a tax scheme to offset the potential capital gains from the sale.second,the court found that the slone broadcasting shareholders neither knew,nor should have known,that fortrend and berlinetta were involved in an illegitimate tax evasion scheme.the court noted that when the shareholders asked for more information about fortrend methods for offsetting gains from the asset sale,they were told that the methods were proprietary.the court concluded that the shareholders had no duty to conduct further investigation,and no responsibility for any tax strategies adopted by berlinetta after the transaction closed.
based on these findings and conclusions,the tax court held that neither the substance over form doctrine,nor any related doctrine,required the tax court to recast the stock sale as a liquidating distribution.the tax court concluded that the form of the stock sale between the shareholders and berlinetta should be respected,and therefore rejected the irs theory that the shareholders were liable for taxes,interest,and penalties arising from slone broadcasting sale of its assets.the commissioner timely appealed.
we have jurisdiction over this appeal under a.we review a tax court factual determinations for clear error and its application of legal standards de novo.see sacks comm r,cir.because a tax court must apply the correct legal standards when it characterizes a transaction for tax purposes,see,we reject the shareholders argument that such a characterization raises only questions of fact.
the question before us is whether the slone broadcasting shareholders can be held liable for taxes on slone broadcasting sale of assets to citadel because the shareholders were transferees of the proceeds of that sale.
under,the commissioner can assess tax liability against a taxpayer who is the transferee of assets of a taxpayer who owes income tax.salus mundi found.comm r,cir.tax liabilities on transferred assets shall,with certain exceptions,be assessed,paid,and collected in the same manner and subject to the same provisions and limitations as in the cases of taxes with respect to which the liabilities were incurred.
while federal law provides the procedure for collecting tax liabilities from a transferee,state law answers the question whether the alleged transferee is substantively liable for the tax.comm r stern.therefore,in order to impose tax liability on a transferee,a court must engage in a inquiry,see salus mundi,at citing stern,at,which is sometimes called the stern test.the first prong asks is the party a transferee under and federal tax law id.under federal law,a transferee is defined as including a donee,heir,legatee,devisee,or distributee.h.treasury regulations further define the term transferee to include the shareholder of a dissolved corporation.b.
the second prong of the stern test asks is the party substantively liable for the transferor unpaid taxes under state law salus mundi,at.the test for this second prong depends on the law of the state where the transfer occurred,but typically requires a showing that the transferee had actual or constructive knowledge of the entire scheme that renders its exchange with the debtor fraudulent,which allows the transaction to be recharacterized under state law.id.applying the new york uniform fraudulent conveyance act internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
the commissioner has the burden of proving that the taxpayer is a transferee under federal law,and must make out a prima facie case that the transferee would be liable for the debt under state law,edelson comm r,cir.the two stern test prongs are separate and independent inquiries.salus mundi,at.
the commissioner argues that the tax court erred in analyzing the first prong of the stern test whether the shareholders are transferees as shareholder s of a dissolved corporation.b.the parties do not dispute that if the form of the stock sale transaction between the shareholders and berlinetta is respected,the shareholders did not receive a liquidating distribution from a dissolved corporation,and therefore were not transferees of slone broadcasting assets or liable for slone broadcasting taxes.therefore,the crucial question is whether the tax court erred in respecting the form of the shareholders stock sale to berlinetta for federal tax purposes under the first prong of the stern test,leaving it unnecessary for the tax court to analyze the shareholders substantive liability under state law under the second prong of the stern test.
although we have not previously considered how a court should analyze a transaction for purposes of transferee liability under,both the supreme court cases,and our own precedent,require us to look through the form of a transaction to consider its substance.the supreme court has long recognized the importance of regarding matters of substance and disregarding forms,united states phellis,because t he incidence of taxation depends upon the substance of a transaction,comm r court holding.in explaining the factors that should guide a court analysis regarding when it is appropriate to disregard the form of a transaction,the supreme court framed the inquiry as whether there is a genuine transaction with economic substance which is compelled or encouraged by business or regulatory realities,is imbued with considerations,and is not shaped solely by features that have meaningless labels attached.frank lyon united states.
we have interpreted frank lyon as requiring courts to consider both subjective and objective factors in characterizing a transaction for tax purposes.see casebeer comm r,cir.we have used different terminology from time to time,but consistently apply the same approach.in casebeer,we applied a test for determining whether a transaction is a sham has the taxpayer shown that it had a business purpose for engaging in the transaction other than tax avoidance has the taxpayer shown that the transaction had economic substance beyond the creation of tax benefits id.at citing bail bonds by marvin nelson,comm r,cir see also sacks,at considering subjective and objective factors in analyzing whether a transaction was a sham.similarly,in reddam commissioner,we applied the economic substance doctrine,which likewise focused on two prongs the subjective aspect of whether the taxpayer intended to do anything other than acquire tax deductions,and the objective aspect of whether the transaction had any economic substance other than creation of tax benefits.f d,cir quoting sacks,at.finally in stewart commissioner,we referred to the doctrine as part of a body of common law that included consideration of a transaction business purpose and economic reality,cir.
in determining whether to disregard the form of a transaction,we do not conduct a rigid analysis applying the subjective and objective factors,but rather focus holistically on whether the transaction had any practical economic effects other than the creation of income tax losses.reddam,at internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted see also sacks,at looking at a transaction as a whole to determine whether it was a sham.if a common sense review of the transaction leads to the conclusion that a particular transaction does not have a business purpose or any economic substance other than creation of tax benefits,reddam,at internal quotation mark omitted,the form of that transaction may be disregarded,and the commissioner may rely on its underlying economic substance for tax purposes.
this approach to characterizing a transaction for tax purposes,considering both subjective and objective factors,is also used by other circuits,although they too describe in it varying ways.see,feldman comm r,cir noting that the animating principle of each of several related,overlapping doctrines used in tax cases,including the substance over form doctrine,the business purpose doctrine,and the economic substance doctrine,is that the law looks beyond the form of a transaction to discern its substance.as feldman noted,t he distinctions between these doctrines are subtle,if they exist at all.id.at see also bittker and lokken,federal taxation of income,estates and gifts a ed.supp noting that the substance over form doctrine,the business purpose doctrine,the economic substance doctrine,and the sham transaction doctrine have tended to coalesce in the case law congress has codified a similar approach considering subjective and objective factors 
we conclude that this approach is applicable for determining whether a taxpayer is a transferee for purposes of.accordingly,when the commissioner claims a taxpayer was the shareholder of a dissolved corporation for purposes of b,but the taxpayer did not receive a liquidating distribution if the form of the transaction is respected,a court must consider the relevant subjective and objective factors to determine whether the formal transaction had any practical economic effects other than the creation of income tax losses.reddam,at internal quotation mark omitted.
we now apply these principles to the question whether the tax court erred in holding that the commissioner could not impose the tax liability of slone media on the slone broadcasting shareholders.according to the commissioner,the tax court should have found that the objective economic realities establish that the stock sale between the shareholders and berlinetta was in substance a liquidating transaction.further,the commissioner asserts that the tax court should have found that slone broadcasting was a shell with nothing but cash and significant tax liabilities when the shareholders sold the stock,because it had no ongoing business activities,no contractual obligations,and no debts aside from its tax liability.the commissioner concludes that the stock sale was effectively a liquidation of the company,terminating its business operations and leaving the shareholders with cash.
not surprisingly,the slone broadcasting shareholders disagree.they claim that after its asset sale to citadel,slone broadcasting retained the human capital and resources to acquire another radio station,and therefore was not a lifeless shell at the time of its stock sale to berlinetta.the shareholders also argue that they had no improper tax avoidance purposes for entering into the sale.further,the shareholders assert that the stock sale had economic substance because actively engaged in debt recovery after the sale.
we can not resolve this dispute because the tax court failed to apply the correct legal standard for characterizing the stock sale transaction for the purposes of federal transferee liability.the court did not address either the subjective or objective factors we apply in characterizing a transaction for tax purposes,as it failed to make any finding on whether the shareholders had a business purpose for entering into
