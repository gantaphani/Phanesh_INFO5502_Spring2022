sideman refused to produce these documents which measure inches if stacked on top of one another,according to sideman because,sideman alleges,production would violate nolan fifth amendment rights.in response,the irs filed a petition in the northern district of california seeking enforcement of the summons.
in support of its petition to enforce the summons,the irs offered a declaration from fouts regarding her work on behalf of nolan.in her declaration,fouts stated that she took possession of nolan and tax records on september.guadagni delivered additional records to her a few days later.fouts began reviewing nolan and tax records on october.on october,fouts spent additional time reviewing the tax records.from october to october,fouts completed her review of nolan tax records and finished the return for that same year.in finalizing nolan return,fouts also reviewed nolan tax records to make sure that certain information from was carried over properly to,and she also reviewed the records for consistency.
through this review process,fouts became very familiar with nolan tax documents.in her declaration submitted to the district court,fouts stated that nolan tax records were distinct for a number of reasons.first,the records reflected that nolan did not operate her law practice as a corporation,which was unusual to fouts because most practitioners with a similar level of income operate their practices that way.second,fouts identified the amount of monthly income for nolan law practice during the years to,observing that it was fairly consistent month to month.fouts also recalled and stated the law practice income for the year.third,fouts stated that nolan paid all of her individual and business expenses with checks that she wrote and signed by hand.fouts also explained that nolan maintained handwritten check registers and checkbooks that produced carbon copies.fourth,fouts reported that nolan treated her workers as independent contractors rather than employees.fifth,fouts stated that nolan and her paralegals kept track of their billable time via handwritten notations in appointment books.nolan staff would then convert the handwritten notes to client bills using a quickbooks software program.a paper copy of each bill would be placed in a folder kept for each client.lastly,fouts reported that nolan had numerous residential properties,including rentals,and a vacation home.
fouts also confirmed in her declaration that she had given nolan tax records to guadagni after becoming concerned that they were covered by the irs summons,which nolan had told her about.she further declared that she learned that guadagni did not give the documents to the irs as she had thought he would but instead gave them to sideman.fouts also described how she gave a detailed description of the and documents to special agent pahnke.she also confirmed that the summons,reproduced above,conforms to the description she gave to special agent pahnke and accurately summarizes the documents she reviewed in the course of her work for nolan,down to the type of boxes and folders the documents were contained in on october,when she saw them last.fouts explained that she is confident that if she saw nolan documents again,she could identify and authenticate them,based on the personal knowledge she gained from reviewing and working with them and based on their distinctive characteristics and contents.
the district court granted the irs petition to enforce,finding that the summonsed documents fell within the foregone conclusion exception to the fifth amendment.the district court limited the scope of the summons,however,by striking the language including but not limited to the following from the summons and replacing it with specifically the following.sideman now appeals.
we review de novo a district court application of the fifth amendment privilege against.united states bright,cir.whether the existence of documents is a foregone conclusion is a question of fact,which we review for clear error.id.we also review for clear error a finding as to whether the authenticity of documents is a foregone conclusion.united states doe,d.
the fifth amendment grants persons the privilege not to provide the state with evidence of a testimonial or communicative nature.id.at alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.this protection extends not only to oral questioning but also applies to prevent an individual from having to produce documents for investigative bodies if the act of production itself would be testimonial.id.at.this protection also extends to prevent an individual attorney from being compelled to produce documents if that production would violate the individual fifth amendment rights.in fisher united states,d,the supreme court explained that where an individual transfers documents to his or her attorneys to obtain legal assistance in tax investigations,those documents,if unobtainable by summons from the client,are unobtainable by summons directed to the attorney by reason of the privilege.id.at.accordingly,sideman does not have to produce the tax records if doing so violates nolan fifth amendment rights.
sideman contends that,here,the act of producing nolan and tax documents would be testimonial in violation of nolan fifth amendment rights.production of documents may be testimonial because 
t he act of producing evidence in response to a subpoena has communicative aspects of its own,wholly aside from the contents of the papers produced.compliance with the subpoena tacitly concedes the existence of the papers demanded and their possession or control by the taxpayer.it also would indicate the taxpayer belief that the papers are those described in the subpoena.
id.at.nevertheless,where t he exist
