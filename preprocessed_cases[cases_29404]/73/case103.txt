in these,we consider john mikutowicz challenge to his convictions for tax offenses and the government challenge to the term of incarceration.we affirm the convictions but vacate the judgment and remand for resentencing.
we set forth the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.see united states diaz,cir.mikutowicz is the sole shareholder of agm marine contractors agm,a s corporation located in mashpee,massachusetts agm is involved in marine construction projects,including dredging and building bridges.in addition,mikutowicz is also the sole shareholder of felix management,felix,another s corporation,which manages mikutowicz various real estate investments.
in,mikutowicz sought the assistance of psychologist neil carter for a combination of business and personal problems.after mikutowicz described his financial difficulties,carter suggested that he contact an individual in colorado named paul harris who could help him establish an asset protection program.
mikutowicz followed carter advice and contacted harris.harris was one of the operators of tower executive resources tower,a company that,inter alia,assisted its members in shielding income from taxation.after meeting with mikutowicz,harris proposed moving some of agm and felix profits to offshore bank accounts in order to defer taxation on mikutowicz income.mikutowicz agreed.
tower thereafter created ellis engineering ellis,a turks caicos corporation.mikutowicz was ellis sole employee,and ellis shared a business address with agm.it did not outwardly appear that ellis actually operated a separate business from this address,although ellis,acting through mikutowicz,purportedly provided agm with consulting services and equipment rentals and materials from to.
during this period,agm paid ellis million for these services.this money was deposited into ellis massachusetts bank accounts.mikutowicz deducted these payments from agm taxes as ordinary and necessary business expenses.see.these deductions reduced agm profits and therefore reduced mikutowicz personal taxable income.see supra.
the money agm paid to ellis was eventually transferred to a bank account in the turks caicos islands established by tower for mikutowicz benefit.this account was in the name of another tower created company,harborsober.from the harborsober account,mikutowicz eventually transferred most of the money into a personal account in the cayman islands.
mikutowicz similarly diverted profits from felix to his offshore account.in,felix paid tower for franchise and professional fees,although there was no evidence that tower actually gave or did anything of value for felix.mikutowicz deducted these fees from felix taxes,and this money was also transferred,through the harborsober account,to mikutowicz cayman island account mikutowicz and his companies never declared any of the money deposited in the harborsober account as taxable income.
the government calculated that,through these machinations,mikutowicz reduced his tax burden by.on september,a grand jury indicted mikutowicz on ten tax offenses one count of conspiring to commit tax fraud,see five counts of filing materially false tax returns for the years,see and four counts of tax evasion for the years,see.on june,after a trial,a jury convicted him on all counts.
on september,the district court sentenced mikutowicz to one year and one day of imprisonment and two years of supervised release it also ordered him to pay a fine,a special assessment,and restitution.the district court arrived at mikutowicz sentence by granting him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility and a downward departure because his criminal conduct constituted aberrant behavior.
mikutowicz challenges his convictions on a number of grounds,focused primarily on the jury consideration of whether the claimed deductions were ordinary and necessary business expenses.he argues first that the district court should not have instructed the jury on the internal revenue code definition of ordinary and necessary business expenses and even if such an instruction was appropriate,the district court erroneously declined to provide a supplemental instruction on this issue.second,he argues that the district court should have excluded testimony by the government tax computation expert that the deductions agm claimed for making payments to ellis were not ordinary and necessary business expenses and the district court improperly limited of this expert.finally,he claims that the district court abused its discretion by declining to investigate his allegation of juror misconduct.
instruction on ordinary and necessary business expenses 
mikutowicz first argues that the district court erred by instructing the jury on the definition of ordinary and necessary business expenses under the internal revenue code.see.he contends that the court instruction was unnecessary because the government was required to prove only that the deductions he claimed were false not that they failed to qualify as ordinary and necessary business expenses.this unnecessary instruction was also prejudicial,he asserts,because it introduced an extraneous issue that might well have confused the jury and diverted its attention from his primary defense that he claimed the deductions in good faith.
the purpose of jury instructions is to inform the jury of its function,which is the independent determination of the facts,and the application of the law,as given by the court,to the facts found by the jury.charles wright,federal practice and procedure criminal,ed.the instructions should fairly and impartially state the issues and applicable law in logical sequence so that the jury can understand the issues and intelligently apply the law.id.quoting elbel united states,cir.it is common in tax crime prosecutions for the court to instruct the jury on the meaning of tax law terms implicated by the particular facts of a case.see,united states wapnick,cir in tax evasion case,jury instruction on definition of sham corporation was proper united states curtis,cir in tax evasion case,jury instruction on definition of income was proper united states sorrentino,cir in tax evasion case,jury instruction on definition of taxable income was proper.
here,knowing the definition of ordinary and necessary business expenses was helpful to the jury in applying the law to the evidence.the parties agree that conviction on each count required the government to prove that the deductions claimed by mikutowicz on behalf of agm and felix were false.see filing false corporate tax return requires government to prove that return was false as to material matter tax evasion requires government to prove that defendant owed substantially more federal income tax than declared conspiracy charge required government to prove that defendant agreed with another to file false return and to evade taxes.based on the evidence presented,whether the deductions claimed by agm and felix were false depended on whether they were properly claimed as ordinary and necessary business expenses.thus,the jury ultimate conclusion that the deductions were false was inexorably linked to whether they were ordinary and necessary business expenses.therefore,a definition of ordinary and necessary business expenses was useful information for the jury to evaluate the evidence.
mikutowicz suggestion that the ordinary and necessary business expense instruction shifted the jury focus away from his good faith defense is not persuasive.the district court instructions explained to the jury the separate requirement that the government prove that mikutowicz did not act in good faith.indeed,the court was quite explicit in this regard.it instructed 
i t is enough for the government to show that the deductions were improper.the government also has to prove that the defendant knew that they were improper,or,rather that the defendant did not believe that the statements he made about the deductions in these returns were true and correct.
rather than confuse the jury,the instructions highlighted for the jury that the government had to prove,inter alia,that the claimed deductions were false and that mikutowicz did not claim the deductions in good faith.
as a fallback,mikutowicz contends that,even if the district court permissibly instructed the jury on the definition of ordinary and necessary business expenses,the court should have included a supplemental instruction which we shall describe momentarily.the trial court refusal to give a particular instruction constitutes reversible error only if the requested instruction was correct as a matter of substantive law,not substantially incorporated into the charge as rendered,and integral to an important point in the case.sheek asia badger,cir quoting elliott warren,cir.
the district court instructed the jury 
o rdinary and necessary business expenses are such expenses as are directly connected to the operation of the business.and the government claims here that these deductions were not ordinary and necessary because they did not reflect any economic reality,were not related to the operations and business of either agm or felix,but were designed merely to funnel funds into the defendant personal bank account offshore.
mikutowicz sought to augment this instruction with language focusing the jury attention on whether ellis was a legitimate corporation.the district court told the jury that there is no question that ellis was a legitimately and validly constituted corporation.the question here has only to do with the payments made to it by agm,and the purpose and treatment of those payments by agm and ultimately ellis as well.
had the court provided the requested language,which comprised a detailed and confusing list of factors used to determine whether ellis was a legitimate corporation,the jury could have been erroneously induced to conclude that its task was to determine ellis legitimacy instead of whether agm made the payments to ellis for legitimate business purposes.the district court instruction kept the jury attention focused on whether the deductions were properly claimed by mikutowicz companies.there was no error.
expert testimony on ordinary and necessary business expenses 
mikutowicz next challenges the testimony of the government tax computation expert,michael pleshaw.pleshaw,an internal revenue service irs agent,explained to the jury the basis for the irs conclusion that deductions claimed by mikutowicz and his companies were improper.mikutowicz challenges the admission of pleshaw testimony concerning the of agm payments to ellis engineering.we review the admission of pleshaw testimony for an abuse of discretion.see united states santana,cir,cert.denied,d,wl.
pleshaw provided the jury with a summary of why the irs determined that the deductions claimed by mikutowicz and his companies were improper.it is well established in several circuits that e xpert testimony by an irs agent which expresses an opinion as to the proper tax consequences of a transaction is admissible evidence.united states windfelder,cir see united states sabino,cir,amended on other grounds,united states monus,cir united states townsend,cir united states toushin,cir united states gold,cir united states fogg,cir.the primary limitation on this type of evidence is that the agent may not testify about the defendant state of mind when the challenged deductions were claimed.see.b expert may not testify to mental state of defendant where mental state is element of charged offense sabino,at i n a tax case,the summary witness is allowed to summarize and analyze the facts indicating willful tax evasion so long as the witness does not directly embrace the ultimate question of whether the defendant did in fact intend to evade income taxes.internal quotations and citations omitted windfelder,at stating that it was error,in tax fraud case,to admit irs agent testimony that defendant intentionally understated his income because this testimony impermissibly state d an opinion as to the defendant knowledge or willfulness,a mental state which constitutes an element of the crimes charged see also united states valle,cir rule b prohibits all direct expert testimony concerning a criminal defendant intent,regardless of the witness field of expertise,so long as intent is an element of the crime charged.
pleshaw testimony adhered to these standards.he described the irs audit of mikutowicz and his businesses and the results of the audit.in addition,he testified to the rationale which led the irs to reach its conclusions.pleshaw offered no testimony concerning mikutowicz state of mind when claiming the challenged deductions.there was no abuse of discretion in the admission of pleshaw testimony.
mikutowicz also asserts that the district court violated his rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment by limiting his of pleshaw.the court refused to let mikutowicz question pleshaw about various judicial opinions,which mikutowicz claims would have established that the deductions were properly taken.
a defendant is entitled to a government witness to test the truth of his testimony.see united states,cir.but the court retains wide latitude to impose reasonable limits on in order to avoid confusion of the issues or extended discussion of marginally relevant material.id.internal quotations and citations omitted.defendants can not run roughshod,doing precisely as they please simply because is underway.united states boylan,cir.we review this challenge de novo to determine whether defense counsel was afforded a reasonable opportunity to impeach adverse witnesses.see united states balsam,cir.should that threshold be reached,any restrictions that were placed on the extent and manner of the will be reviewed for abuse of discretion.id.
pleshaw was not qualified as an expert on tax law.as the irs agent who audited mikutowicz and his businesses,pleshaw provided detailed testimony on the process used to conduct the audit,the conclusions reached,and the computations made to arrive at mikutowicz tax deficiency.the government attempted to elicit from pleshaw neither an opinion on the precise meaning of terms used in the internal revenue code nor a discussion of legal sources that could bear on such an interpretation,as well it should not have.e xpert testimony proffered solely to establish the meaning of a law is presumptively improper.united states prigmore,cir see,cir ruling that it was error to admit expert testimony explaining the holdings of various puerto rico supreme court opinions.
yet,this is precisely what mikutowicz sought to do.even though pleshaw is not a lawyer and did not mention the united states tax court on direct examination,defense counsel attempted to question pleshaw about three tax court opinions from the early even a tax lawyer would have found it difficult to respond intelligently to questions about the precise facts and holdings of several old tax court cases and then apply those holdings to the facts of the instant case,without having had a prior opportunity to prepare.had the proceeded as mikutowicz proposed,it would have involved defense counsel reading excerpts of the cases to the jury,without the jury having a context for evaluating the import of the information that it was receiving.see curtis,at the jury is not comprised of lawyers to attempt to explain the myriad rules of judicial construction,the complexity of legal principles,or the function of precedent would hopelessly divert the jury from their preeminent duty of assessing guilt.the district court was well within its discretion in concluding that such an examination would have exceeded the scope of the direct examination and confused the jury.see united states ingredient technology,cir benjamin vernia,annotation,admissibility of expert testimony regarding questions of domestic law,noting that the bases for the rule against an expert explaining the law to the jury relate to jury confusion 
juror misconduct 
mikutowicz final argument concerns the district court refusal to investigate his allegation that the jurors had engaged in premature deliberations.the relevant facts are as follows.
on the thirteenth day of trial the jury began its deliberations.on the third day of deliberations the jury forewoman sent a note to the court asking that one of the jurors be excused.as a result,the court met with the forewoman.during the meeting,the forewoman explained the problem 
there a young woman,the first,the second day she was talking about her religious beliefs and that it was not her job to judge her fellow human beings.that was for god in the next life.that was the second day.we told her,you know we tried to buck her up and say,okay god put you here on this jury for a reason,and you will be able to make a decision.but it has gotten worse.she up there reading her bible right now.she has just kind of closed down,and she been the major impasse in getting any work done.
the court proceeded to discuss the situation with the distressed juror.the juror told the court that she was upset by the intense nature of the deliberations.as she described it 
t here a lot of evidence up there,and you trying to prove your case referring to counsel for each party.well i need to know by looking at these documents what right and we sat in there,and we heard your side,and we heard your side,but i need to look at them for myself and see nobody has their own there just certain things that we arguing about.
at the conclusion of this discussion,defense counsel advised the court that the forewoman earlier reference to the second day appeared to indicate that some of the jurors had expressed their opinions about the case since the second day of trial.defense counsel asked for a further inquiry as to whether in fact the jurors discussed the merits of the case during the trial.the court declined the request,noting that it did not recall the forewoman saying anything about the matter before deliberations.
we review the district court response to an allegation of juror misconduct for an abuse of discretion.see united states connolly,cir.we have recognized that the district court maintains significant discretion in determining the type of investigation required by a juror misconduct claim.see,united states,cir boylan,at.moreover,the court discretion is at its broadest when determining how to deal with an allegation of premature jury deliberations.see united states dominguez,cir a trial judge is vested with broad discretion in responding to an allegation of jury misconduct,and that discretion is at its broadest when the allegation involves internal misconduct such as premature deliberations,instead of external misconduct such as exposure to media publicity.
where a claim of juror misconduct is raised,the court first task is to ascertain whether the allegation is colorable.see boylan,at.if the claim meets this threshold,the court must then conduct a further investigation to discern the extent of the jury taint and the possible prejudice.see united states cruz,cir.however,misconduct allegations that are frivolous do not trigger any duty of inquiry and do not require that a hearing be held.neron tierney,cir.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that mikutowicz claim of premature jury deliberations was so weak that it did not require further action.even assuming that by the second day the forewoman meant the second day of the trial as opposed to the second day of deliberations,the forewoman did not state that any of the jurors had engaged in premature deliberations.she stated only that one juror had expressed doubt about her ability to participate in the task of determining whether another individual is guilty of a crime.a conversation between jurors concerning the general anxiety associated with serving on a criminal jury is a far cry from a conversation in which the jurors discussed the merits of the parties positions.
our conclusion that no duty to investigate was triggered is supported by the district court conversation with the distressed juror.in that conversation,the juror indicated that the jurors had sat through both parties cases and were then wading through the evidence and arguing about the proper result.this summary of the jury actions strongly suggests that the jurors were involved in active deliberations at the appropriate time and had not prejudged the case.
the only evidence that mikutowicz presented of juror misconduct is his allegation that the forewoman disclosed to the court that deliberations took place on the second day of trial as discussed above,the forewoman made no such disclosure.the burden of showing a colorable claim rests with the party raising the issue.see united states nazzaro,cir.as mikutowicz has not met this burden,the district court acted within its considerable discretion by declining to investigate the matter.see id.t he law wisely affords the trier substantial discretion in determining whether to interrogate jurors.
in its,the government raises two challenges to the sentence imposed on mikutowicz.first,it challenges the district court grant of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.second,it challenges the district court grant of a downward departure because mikutowicz criminal conduct constituted aberrant behavior.
acceptance of responsibility 
pursuant to,the district court granted mikutowicz a reduction for acceptance of responsibility because even though he went to trial,he admitted,pretrial,the conduct underlying the charges,and prior to trial,he repaid the irs approximately in back taxes we review deferentially the district court conclusion that the defendant has accepted responsibility,see united states capelton,cir,and will reverse only on a showing of clear error,see united states walker,cir.clear error exists where there is no articulable grounds or foundation for the court conclusion.see united states bennett,cir.
the first ground for the reduction is that,prior to trial,mikutowicz admitted his unlawful conduct.see comment a.in this regard,the district court stated it is true that he went to trial,but going to trial should not be penalized he admitted his conduct,and it seems to me under these circumstances he is entitled to go down by two levels.
while there is no question that a defendant should not be punished for exercising his right to trial,the choices exercised can affect sentencing exposure.the sentencing guidelines state that,as a general matter,an acceptance of responsibility reduction is not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt,is convicted,and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse,comment see also united states baltas,cir.the guidelines recognize,however,that in some rare situations a defendant may stand trial and still receive an acceptance of responsibility reduction,comment see united states ellis,cir.application note gives as examples a defendant who admits factual guilt but goes to trial to raise a constitutional challenge to the prosecution and a defendant who goes to trial to assert that the statute under which he is charged does not apply to his conduct,comment.we have recognized that additional rare situations could exist that would permit a defendant to receive an acceptance of responsibility reduction after electing to go to trial.see ellis,at.however,where a district court grants an acceptance of responsibility reduction to a defendant,post trial,the acceptance of responsibility determination must be based solely on statements and conduct.id.at emphasis in original.
the district court ruled that mikutowicz admitted the essential factual elements of guilt before trial,even though he went to trial to claim that his conduct was not willful and therefore not criminal.this determination was clearly erroneous.by contesting willfulness,mikutowicz did not admit the essential factual elements of guilt.comment bennett,at.
it is true that mikutowicz admitted the actus reus of his crimes prior to trial.he admitted establishing offshore bank accounts,taking deductions from agm for services provided by ellis,diverting the deducted monies to the offshore accounts,and not paying taxes on the diverted funds.however,mikutowicz remained steadfast that his conduct was not willful,in violation of a known legal duty.see cheek united states,d.thus,mikutowicz denied the mens rea of the crimes.that the defendant possesses the requisite mens rea is one of the essential factual elements
