background 
factual background 
middleton and his,june middleton,worked as real estate agents for rockport real estate investments,rri,a company owned by regan lutsko,and in which middleton held no ownership interest.in or,middleton terminated his employment with rri,but nevertheless held himself out as a principal of rri,opening several bank accounts as an authorized accountholder and owner of rri.
sometime prior to,the middletons formed middleton associates,which provided services to commercial property owners.the middletons would identify commercial properties that appeared to be overvalued for property tax purposes,request a reassessment by the county often without the owners knowledge or consent,and then seek fees from the owners of to of the tax savings for successful appeals.middleton also worked during this period as a consultant with pro tax,a service operated by his sons.in,pro tax began to send checks to middleton,payable to rri,for consulting fees.from through,middleton pro tax receipts grew progressively larger.although he received only in consulting fees in,that amount had increased to by.inclusive of real estate sales and property tax consulting with both middleton associates and pro tax,middleton received more than million in gross receipts over this period in in in in and in.
middleton would deposit these receipts into various business accounts that he had established at banks in california and ohio under various business names,such as rockport realty associates,middleton associates,and rockport realty investments.according to the government,middleton preferred such accounts because they neither generate irs forms that record earned interest nor carry employer identification numbers.middleton was the only authorized signer on these accounts.once middleton made a deposit,the government alleges that he would write several checks and then travel to a rotating schedule of branches to cash them by making a series of structured withdrawals for less than,a process that sometimes took days to complete.withdrawals of less than do not generate currency transaction reports ctrs from the bank to the united states treasury department.from to,middleton made withdrawals of the that he deposited in his accounts,only three of which were for more than.middleton never reported his gross receipts to the irs as compensation received from any of the business entities listed on his bank accounts.
in,after noticing middleton pattern of repeated withdrawals of less than,a lorain national bank employee filed a suspicious activity report sar,which prompted an investigation of middleton by irs special agent edward james.james investigation revealed that middleton lived what the government has referred to as a cash lifestyle.he never used personal or business checks to pay bills,relying instead on cash,money orders,bank checks,and endorsed business receipt checks.james also determined that middleton had earned in income during the tax years through,and that he had filed no income tax returns since.
procedural history 
on april,a grand jury of the united states district court for the northern district of ohio returned a indictment against middleton,charging him with attempting to evade or defeat income tax due and owing for the tax years through,in violation of relying upon cheek.united states,d,middleton admitted that he had not filed a tax return since,but argued at trial that he had a basis to believe that he was under no legal obligation to do so.a jury rejected his argument and returned a guilty verdict as to all counts on september.the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment.before this court is middleton timely appeal from the judgment and sentence.
ii.discussion 
voir.standard of review 
in reviewing the district court voir dire in this case,we must determine whether the court abused the broad discretion vested in it by the rulings of the supreme court of the united states in its impaneling of the jury,united states phibbs,cir quoting united states blanton,cir,remaining mindful of the fact that a district court retains great latitude in deciding what questions should be asked on voir dire.virginia,d.we ascertain only whether the district court ensured that middleton had a fair trial by a panel of impartial,indifferent jurors.irvin dowd,d.only in the absence of a fair trial is reversal warranted.see id.
prior to jury selection,middleton submitted a list of proposed voir dire questions that were crafted to elicit answers from the venire which would reveal the presence of any bias against individuals who do not pay income taxes,or any tax protestor activities.the court refused to ask middleton proposed questions,opting instead to ask more general questions on the subject of bias.middleton contends that the district court abused its discretion by refusing his requests to inquire into bias on the part of the venire,while permitting the government an opportunity to ask the venire questions concerning bias.
middleton argument is without merit.while it is true that the district court refused to ask the venire specific questions on the subject of bias,it did inquire into their ability both to presume middleton innocent and to render a judgment in accordance with the relevant law 
are you in sympathy with the rule of law that clothes the defendant with the presumption of innocence 
are you in sympathy with the rule of law that would require you,as a juror,to give the defendant the benefit of reasonable doubt 
are you in sympathy with the rule of law that does not require a defendant to prove his innocence 
are you willing to confine your deliberations to the evidence in this case as presented in the courtroom 
we are not persuaded that the jury empaneled consisted of anyone but impartial and indifferent jurors.thus,we can not conclude that the district court abused its discretion in conducting voir dire.
middleton tax return 
standard of review 
we review a district court admission of evidence pursuant to.b for an abuse of discretion.see trepel roadway express,cir noting that all evidentiary rulings are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.we are similarly limited in our review of a district court admission pursuant to.of relevant,although potentially prejudicial,evidence we must look at the evidence in the light most favorable to its proponent,maximizing its probative value and minimizing its prejudicial effect.united states zipkin,cir.we will disturb a district court determination in this regard only for an abuse of discretion.see doe claiborne county,cir.
at trial,the district court permitted the admission into evidence of middleton income tax return.special agent james testified that middleton had not filed any tax returns since.he also testified that the return sought a full refund of all taxes withheld and that attached to the return was a statement by middleton outlining his membership in the life science church,his vow of poverty,and his intent to donate all of his possessions to the life science church.middleton counsel never objected to this testimony,but stated at sidebar,without elaboration,that he thought that specifics of middleton failure to file tax returns since should be kept out.
middleton concedes that admission of his tax return may have been permissible as evidence of his knowledge of the code,but argues both that the district court erred when it admitted the contents of the return,and that it compounded this error when it prohibited him from explain ing the significance of those tax returns and his change in beliefs since.he suggests that the return,while arguably probative of his uneducated beliefs that he was required to pay income tax,was not relevant to the instant charges or to his defense to those charges,and was unfairly prejudicial,in violation of.
we find neither argument persuasive.it is that previously filed tax returns or other proof of prior taxpayer history is admissible,pursuant to.b,to establish a defendant knowledge of a legal duty to pay taxes.see united states heise,cir.we believe that middleton tax return was probative of middleton awareness of the contents of the personal income tax return forms and accompanying instructions that made plain his legal obligation to file returns in the instant case,cheek,at,and was central to the jury determination of whether middleton belief claim excused his nonpayment,see id.at.the jury was entitled to infer that if middleton recognized that he had a legal obligation to file a tax return more than twenty years prior to trial,then he might reasonably have known of his obligation to file returns during the years at issue in this case.it was precisely the jury responsibility to consider such information in evaluating his defense.see cheek,at.i f the government proves actual knowledge of the pertinent legal duty,the prosecution,without more,has satisfied the knowledge component of the willfulness requirement.thus,we do not believe that any prejudice suffered by middleton rose to the level of unfair prejudice for which reversal is appropriate.
the only remaining question before us is whether the district court erred by refusing to let middleton testify about how his alleged change of beliefs since informed his decision not to file income tax returns for the tax years through.our review of the record does not support middleton claim that the district court prohibited him from so testifying rather,it was middleton own narrative and unresponsive answers to the questions of his attorney that prevented the jury from hearing such testimony.moreover,it appears,based on our reading of the transcript,that middleton himself,unprompted by the district court,switched to an altogether different subject.middleton missed opportunity to explain his basis for failing to file returns subsequent to,therefore,was his responsibility and his alone.

standard of review 
we review a district court evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion.see united states foster,cir.
middleton argues that the district court permitted admission of unfairly prejudicial evidence concerning his and gross receipts,which totaled almost million.according to middleton,this evidence,which was used by the government to impeach him,had no bearing upon his belief during the period of charged crimes and was not relevant to tax returns or taxes owed during the period of charged conduct,and its use by the government was motivated by a desire to prejudice the jury against a rich person who does not pay taxes.the government argues that the district court properly admitted the evidence as relevant impeachment material on the questions of whether middleton belief that he had no legal duty to pay taxes was reasonable in light of the significant amounts of income he received over that period whether middleton,as he testified at trial,had only in cash in his apartment and an additional to in his son california apartment,despite the significant amount of money he received during this period and,relatedly,whether middleton,as alleged at trial,had spent of his business income receipts from through totaling more than million,yet had no record,receipt,or other document to verify even one business expense.
we find middleton argument unpersuasive.the supreme court in cheek emphasized that the more unreasonable the asserted beliefs or misunderstandings are,the more likely the jury will consider them to be nothing more than simple disagreement with known legal duties imposed by the tax laws and will find that the government has carried its burden of proving knowledge.at.indeed,middleton reliance on cheek defense opened the door to scrutiny of both his credibility and the reasonableness of his belief that despite his continued receipt of substantial income,he had no legal duty to pay income tax.accordingly,we can not conclude that the district court abused its discretion when it permitted admission of middleton and gross income receipts.

we review a district court limits on a defendant right to witnesses for an abuse of discretion.see joiner,d.
middleton asserts that the district court improperly limited his of special agent edward james,who testified,over middleton objection,that middleton bank deposits constituted gross receipts of income for which tax was due and owing.middleton seems to suggest that james testimony on this point was improper,because he,as a fact witness,disposed of an essential legal element that the government was required to establish.middleton points to the following exchange between the district court christian stickan,the government counsel and harvey bruner,middleton counsel,as evidence of the district court refusal to permit middleton an opportunity to explore the basis of james conclusion that middleton earned taxable income 
by bruner can you,what is your definition of income

stickan objection.
the court sustained.this is a fact witness,counselor,not a witness on matters of law.
bruner i understand.
the court well,try to show that in your questions.
the government responds that middleton questions were merely an attempt to use james to confuse the jury about what the relevant law actually is,and that the district court therefore properly cut short questions concerning james knowledge of the state of the law and what middleton intent or beliefs actually were.
a district court is permitted to prohibit questioning that it believes to be unnecessarily confusing of the issues.see norris schotten,cir noting that t rial judges retain great discretion to impose reasonable limits on the of witnesses based on concerns such as harassment,prejudice,confusion of the issues,the witness safety,and marginal relevancy.moreover,inasmuch as a fact witness testimony intrudes upon questions of law,a district court,as the final arbiter of legal questions,has an obligation to limit,if not terminate altogether,such testimony.accordingly,we are not persuaded that the district court abused its discretion by limiting middleton of james.furthermore,based on the record before us,we find that middleton suffered no prejudice as a result of the district court ruling,particularly in light of the fact that special agent kenneth liuzzo,an expert witness for the government,testified to exactly what middleton sought to discredit in his of james,that the funds deposited by middleton in various bank accounts constituted taxable income.thus,when the trial is viewed as a whole,we are not convinced that the district court ruling on this point was an abuse of discretion.
trial exhibits 
standard of review 
decisions regarding the admission and exclusion of evidence are within the peculiar province of the district court and are not to be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.see united states tocco,cir.
at the close of his testimony,middleton sought to admit into evidence several exhibits on which he had relied to establish his defense.the district court refused to admit most of middleton trial exhibits,in many cases without explanation,and granted middleton request only with respect to exhibit irs mission statement,exhibit privacy act notice appended to irs form,and exhibit k videotape of irwin schiff outlining his views on the nonpayment of income tax.middleton argues that the district court erred by limiting his absolute right to present evidence underlying his belief.he further suggests that the district court admission of the majority of the government exhibits and its exclusion of the majority of middleton exhibits improperly implied to the jury that it approved of the government case,thus calling into question whether the jury was unbiased at the time it rendered judgment.the government contends that middleton claim should fail for three reasons middleton was put on notice before the trial began by the government september,motion in limine that it would seek to prevent admission of certain trial exhibits middleton read for the jury numerous excerpts of materials on which he relied,thus rendering unnecessary their outright admission and when informed at trial by the district court that it might not permit admission of all of the excerpts that had been read into the record by middleton,middleton counsel responded,i understand that.
while a party must be afforded an opportunity to read for the jury relevant excerpts of the materials on which he relied in forming his belief that he was not obligated to pay taxes,we have declined to set forth a blanket rule requiring district courts to admit those excerpts into evidence.see united states gaumer,cir.the gaumer panel observed 
this does not mean that the trial court was required to permit the physical introduction of exhibits comprising hundreds of pages.at a minimum,however,defendant gaumer should have been allowed to read relevant excerpts to the jury.and if the physical exhibits were to be kept out,the defendant should have been so advised before it was too late for him to introduce excerpts orally.
id.likewise,in the instant case,the district court allowed middleton the opportunity to read into the record numerous excerpts,and to use them and a videotaped presentation outlining his views to bolster his defense,but refused to permit their admission into evidence.such a decision was neither unfair to district court went so far as to put middleton on notice before trial that it might not permit the admission of his improper in light of the potential for jury confusion that the admission of such exhibits would have created.where a district court believes that the probative value of proffered exhibits used to support a defense would be outweighed by possible confusion of the issues,it may properly refuse to admit such exhibits into evidence.see united states nash,cir noting that district court properly excluded exhibits where such exhibits held the danger of confusing the jury by introducing purported legal analysis that was at odds with the district court instructions.certainly,the district court was well within its discretion to refuse admission of those excerpts it found to be hopelessly confusing to the jury.
impeachment evidence 
standard of review 
we review a district court evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion.see united states foster,cir.
middleton basis not to pay taxes was allegedly predicated in part on the teachings of irwin schiff,a tax guru who has written numerous books and lectured extensively on the reasons why citizens have no legal obligation to pay income tax.middleton testified that,before deciding not to file a tax return,he independently verified the validity of schiff teachings and concluded that he was under no legal obligation to pay income tax 
essentially,i do believe that you should rely just on something that somebody says.i checked everything out.i reviewed every statute,every regulation,every court case,and until i was thoroughly convinced that what he was saying was reliable,i would rely on it.
middleton also conceded that he continued to follow schiff materials even though he knew that schiff had previously been convicted of felony income tax evasion.at trial,the government middleton and sought to draw into question the reasonableness of his reliance on schiff teachings by citing lower court cases in which schiff had been a party and in which his views on the nonpayment of taxes had been criticized as blatant nonsense.
middleton contends that the district court improperly allowed the government to use these court opinions,which he alleges were inflammatory and irrelevant,and that the government failure to disclose prior to trial its intent to use these cases violated.the government responds that it was appropriate for it to test the reasonableness of middleton beliefs,particularly in light of statements made by middleton on direct examination that his belief was.see,ja at so being the type of individual who likes to research and understand things,i went to the law library and i looked up all the cases schiff cited,and i confirmed that the conclusion that the statements that he said were in there were in there.ja at middleton testimony that he told special agent james that middleton study of the tax law showed that the codes do all mean what people think they mean and that there was no section of the internal revenue code which made me liable for taxes.thus,the government asserts that the lower court opinions relied upon were neither inflammatory nor irrelevant,but an appropriate means for it to challenge the reasonableness of middleton beliefs.we agree.
the government was under no obligation to disclose to middleton prior to trial its intent to rely upon these opinions,as they were not material to the preparation of the defendant defense,or intended for use by the government as evidence in chief at the trial,or obtained from or belong ing to the defendant.a c.more importantly,as the cheek court made plain 
the jury would be free to consider any admissible evidence from any source showing that the taxpayer was aware of his duty to file a return and to treat wages as income,including evidence showing his awareness of the relevant provisions of the code or regulations,of court decisions rejecting his interpretation of the tax law,of authoritative rulings of the internal revenue service,or of any contents of the personal income tax return forms and accompanying instructions that made it plain that wages should be returned as income.
cheek,at.thus,upon finding that the lower court opinions involving schiff were admissible,the district court properly permitted the government to use them to impeach middleton on the question of how thoroughly he researched the defense on which he was relying to excuse his nonpayment of income tax.we find no abuse of discretion.
jury instruction defining voluntary 
standard of review 
in reviewing a properly preserved jury instruction,we must determine whether the charge,taken as a whole,fairly and adequately submits the issues and applicable law to the jury.united states martin,cir.we will reverse a district court for its refusal to deliver a requested instruction only if that instruction is a correct statement of the law,not substantially covered by the charge actually delivered to the jury,and concerns a point so important in the trial that the failure to give it substantially impairs the defendant defense.united states williams,cir.
at the close of the evidence,the district court gave the following jury instruction 
the word voluntary is not the equivalent of optional.to the extent that income taxes are said to be voluntary,they are only voluntary in that one files the returns and pays the taxes without the irs first telling each individual the amount due and then forcing payment of that amount.the payment of income taxes is not optional.
middleton makes the novel argument that the district court erred by instructing the jury that voluntary is not the equivalent of optional.noting that the instruction provided by the district court was lifted almost verbatim from united states schiff,cir,the government contends that the instruction was both appropriate and necessary to prevent juror confusion,particularly in light of middleton repeated narratives during the trial that often blurred the line between his testifying to his beliefs and stating for the jury his view of the relevant law.
we believe that middleton argument lacks merit.the district court responsibility,one that we believe it met,was to provide the jury with a correct statement of the law.middleton has not demonstrated that his requested instruction equating voluntary with optional was a correct statement of the law that the district court was required to provide the jury.in fact,the contrary is true.see united states gerads,cir wilcox comm r,cir see also treglowne united states,wl,the assertion that the filing of an income tax return is voluntary is,likewise,frivolous because a a requires that every individual who earns a threshold level of income must file a tax return.citations omitted.we are not convinced that middleton erroneous understanding of the meaning of voluntary in this context was objectively reasonable.
middleton argument that the district court failure to use his requested instruction substantially impaired his defense is likewise without merit.simply because the district court stated the relevant law did not remove from the jury its obligation under cheek to determine whether middleton had a misunderstanding and belief whether or not the claimed belief or misunderstanding was objectively reasonable.cheek,at.middleton makes no argument that the district court provided the jury with an erroneous instruction.rather,he suggests that the district court statement distinguishing voluntary from optional was an improper substitution of its view of the validity of middleton defense.we disagree.the district court did not steer the jury decisionmaking in one direction or another,but merely stated the law that the jury was obligated to consider when evaluating the credibility of middleton belief.in sum,we believe that the district court fairly and adequately submit ted the issues and applicable law to the jury.martin,at.reversal on any of the aforementioned bases is not warranted.
motion to dismiss 
standard of review 
mindful that a defendant wishing to challenge an indictment valid on its face bears a heavy burden,united states lamoureux,cir,we review a district court refusal to dismiss an indictment for an abuse of discretion,see united states powell,cir.an indictment is generally deemed sufficient if it states the offense using the words of the statute itself,as long as the statute fully and unambiguously states all the elements of the offense.united states monus,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in making this determination,we are guided by two factors first,whether the indictment contains the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the charges against which he must defend,and second,whether it enables him to plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.id.citation omitted.
middleton argues that the district court erred by refusing to dismiss the indictment against him after the government failed to identify which section of the code his nonpayment of taxes violated.he concedes that to prove income tax evasion under,the government must establish willfulness,the existence of a tax deficiency,and an affirmative act by the defendant constituting evasion.see united states reed,cir.citing no authority,he urges two additional requirements an identification of the statute that makes an individual liable for an income tax and an identification of the statute that requires an individual to pay the income tax for which he is liable.in support of this argument,he asserts 
is included in subtitle f entitled procedure and administration and contains penalty provisions for attempts to evade or defeat any taxes that are imposed under title.however,section of the code does not impose an income tax or any tax at all.furthermore,it does not make the defendant liable for income taxes,nor does it require the defendant to pay income taxes.in order for the defendant to know whether or not he has violated any provisions of the code he must be informed not only of the code section that contains the penalty provisions under subtitle f,but also of the code sections that make him liable for the tax he is accused of attempting to evade.
the government failure to identify the relevant code sections,middleton asserts,rendered the indictment fatally flawed.we disagree.the indictment enumerated each element of tax evasion and clearly provided middleton with notice of the statute under which he was being prosecuted.the government had no obligation to set forth anything more than it did in the indictment.see united states waldeck,cir indictment substantially similar to the instant one found to be sufficient hayes united states,cir same himmelfarb united states,cir same.that the government cited only did not limit middleton ability to know the nature of the accusation against him and to plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecution for the same offense.see hamling united states,d.middleton argument,therefore,must fail.
jury instruction defining affirmative act 
standard of review 
when reviewing a jury instruction to which a defendant failed to object at trial,such as the one at issue here,we review only for plain error,which requires us to determine whether the instructions,when taken as a whole,were so clearly wrong as to produce a grave miscarriage of justice.united states sanderson,cir citation omitted.
the indictment charged middleton with concealing income and avoiding payment of income tax through the following affirmative conduct 
transacting business in the name of unincorporated business entities,so that payments received represented business receipts,not personal income,from a business which did not file tax returns,
concealing his receipt of business income by depositing the checks his business received into bearing bank accounts so there would be no reporting of earned income to the irs,
concealing his withdrawal of funds from said accounts for personal use by 
writing numerous checks on the accounts payable to cash,in amounts less than,
negotiating these checks for currency,and not reporting his receipt of those funds to the irs as compensation on irs forms or otherwise,and 
concealing his disposition of income by making personal expenditures using currency,money orders,and endorsed third party checks rather than using a personal checking account.
middleton contends that the district court,contrary to spies united states,erred by failing to define for the jury exactly what constitutes an affirmative act,which left the jury with the presumption that the acts alleged by the government and included in the charge automatically met the definition of affirmative acts of evasion.the district court,middleton suggests,provided an incomplete instruction by failing to direct the jury that it was not obligated to conclude that the acts alleged in the indictment were in fact affirmative acts,but that it was permitted to infer on the basis of the evidence that middleton did or did not affirmatively act to evade or defeat income tax.finally,in what is less a challenge of the actual jury instruction than an attack on the sufficiency of the indictment,middleton asserts that none of the affirmative acts charged by the government were listed by the spies court as behavior that constitutes an affirmative act,and thus,on that basis alone,his indictment should have been dismissed.
we reject each of middleton arguments.as a threshold matter,middleton cites no authority,and we have found none,that requires a trial court to define for a jury what constitutes an affirmative act.that the district court failed to instruct the jury that it could draw a permissive inference on whether middleton took affirmative steps to avoid payment of income tax can not be said to have been plain error.finally,we are not persuaded by middleton argument that the indictment was defective on its face for its failure to allege an affirmative act recognized by the spies court.in making such an argument,middleton apparently misapprehends the plain language of the opinion 
by way of illustration,and not by way of limitation,we would think affirmative willful attempt may be inferred from conduct such as keeping a double set of books,making false entries or alterations,or false invoices or documents,destruction of books or records,concealment of assets or covering up sources of income,handling of one affairs to avoid making the records usual in transactions of the kind,and any conduct,the likely effect of which would be to mislead or to conceal.
at.even if the spies court had intended to outline an exhaustive list of affirmative,by its very language,it did effort to manage his affairs in a manner so as to avoid generating the records that usually attend earning and spending income would certainly qualify as an affirmative act under spies.see united states daniel,cir noting that extensive use of cash may be sufficient evidence of affirmative conduct to sustain a conviction for willful income tax evasion.middleton failure to demonstrate that the district court plainly erred precludes us from granting him relief on this basis.
of expert witness special agent kenneth liuzzo 
standard of review 
we review a district court limits on a defendant right to witnesses for an abuse of discretion.see dorsey parke,cir.
middleton argues that the district court improperly limited his of irs special agent kenneth liuzzo by preventing middleton from exploring the irs role in assessing taxes of an individual if that individual fails to file returns voluntarily.by way of example,middleton points to the court statement after a series of questions by middleton 
the issue is not tax liability here.let move on.the issue is whether there was a tax due and owing.he opined that there is.now,you can question him about that opinion and the jury can reflect on whether or not this testimony is credible,as to whether there was a tax due and owing based upon the information that the government has developed,and the records that have be sic presented to the jury.
in evaluating this claim,we find our task made more difficult by the failure of middleton trial counsel to proffer to the court,during the pendency of his of liuzzo,what he was attempting to elicit.thus,we are left only with middleton explanation 
that the irs had not followed its own procedures and prepared a return for middleton and that irs agents are without statutory authority to determine whether taxes are due and owing and that agent liuzzo interpretation of the code were sic consistent with middleton and supported his belief that the tax system was voluntary.
our reading of the trial transcript suggests that the district court was concerned both that middleton was attempting to use liuzzo to usurp its role in instructing the jury on questions of law,and that he was introducing ancillary issues that had no bearing on the conduct charged in this case.consequently,the district court thought it best to limit the scope of middleton.we are not convinced that the district court behavior prevented middleton from plac ing before the jury facts from which bias,prejudice or lack of credibility of a prosecution witness might be inferred,and thus,we can not conclude that the district court abused its discretion.dorsey,at citation omitted.

a district court application of the facts to the sentencing guidelines is a mixed question of law and fact that we review de novo.see razavi comm r,cir mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed de novo.we will disturb a sentencing court findings of fact,however,only for clear error.see united states mcdonald,cir.a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with a firm and definite conviction that a mistake has been committed.pennington atlas,cir citation and quotation marks omitted.a defendant seeking an reduction must prove facts entitling her to such a reduction by a preponderance of the evidence.see united states tucker,cir.
middleton argues that he was entitled to a reduction,even though he put the government to its proof and proceeded to trial.application note to,he suggests,expressly contemplates that such a reduction may be appropriate even when a defendant exercises his constitutional right to a trial,where,for example,a defendant goes to trial to assert and preserve issues that do not relate to factual guilt,to make a constitutional challenge to a statute or a challenge to the applicability of a statute to his conduct.sentencing guidelines manual hereinafter guidelines or,cmt.middleton also suggests that such a reduction was appropriate because,from the beginning of this case,he has admitted to not filing income tax returns for the tax years through.he even agreed to enter a plea of guilty and thus avoid trial altogether if the government identified the precise code section that requires him to file a tax return and to pay income taxes.it was only the government refusal of middleton offer,he contends,that forced the parties to proceed to trial.indeed,middleton asserts that even at trial,his factual guilt was never at issue rather,the jury was faced only with determining whether applies to him.
the government rejects middleton premise that he has always freely admitted his factual guilt.at no time,suggests the government,has middleton ever acknowledged his intent to violate the law or that the law even applies to him,and absent such an admission,middleton can not be said to have clearly demonstrate d acceptance of responsibility for his offense such that he may be entitled to an reduction.we agree.
in united states tucker,cir,we declared that a defendant who submits a plea in accordance with north carolina alford,d,conceding the facts underlying an indictment without actually admitting guilt,is not categorically barred from receiving an reduction.see at.at no point,however,did we suggest that such a defendant is entitled to a reduction as a matter of right,as middleton maintains.we could not have so held,because the guidelines make clear that even a defendant who enters a guilty plea and avoids a trial is not entitled to an adjustment under this section as a matter of right,cmt.emphasis added.thus,although the district court may not have been barred from giving middleton a reduction,under the facts of this case,middleton clearly is not entitled to a reduction.accordingly,we find that the district court did not clearly err in declining to grant middleton an reduction.
