this case is about two taxpayers offer in compromise oic,which is a contract between a taxpayer and the internal revenue service in which the irs agrees to accept an amount different from what the taxpayer owes in taxes.specifically,the case is about whether the oic permits the taxpayers to deduct amounts that they paid under a separate agreement that they had with the irs.the taxpayers deducted the amount.the irs objected,on the grounds that the deduction violated the terms of the oic.the district court agreed with the irs and granted the irs motion for summary judgment.we also agree with the irs,and thus affirm.
to explain our reasoning,we divide this opinion in three parts.in part i,we detail the facts.in part ii,we apply the jurisdictional and contract these facts.in part iii,we briefly conclude.
the taxpayers are alan begner and his wife,cory begner.they owed three types of back taxes employment taxes from unemployment taxes from and income taxes from.
the begners could not pay these back taxes and did not want to file for bankruptcy,so they each sought an oic by submitting form to the irs under alan sought a release from liability by offering to pay cory.item on form was for the begners social security numbers.item was for the amounts the begners offered to pay.a prior version of form,however,required the begners to list the amounts that they were offering to pay in item.this lurking version of form requiring social security numbers in item,another requiring the amount the dispute between the begners and the irs.
to release the begners from their tax liability,the irs wanted more than just the oic as a form of additional consideration,the irs required the begners to sign a collateral agreements the agreement required that in addition to the and,the begners would pay out of annual income for the years to in the following amounts 
a nothing on the first of annual income 
b of annual income more than and not more than 
c of annual income more than and not more than and 
d of annual income more than.
the begners agreed.the lurking discrepancy in the begners oic resulted from the collateral agreement definition of annual income 
t he term annual income means adjusted gross income as defined in section of the internal revenue code except losses from sales or exchanges of property shall not be allowed,plus all nontaxable income and profits or gains from any source whatsoever including the fair market value of gifts,bequests,devises and inheritances,minus a the federal income tax paid for the year for which annual income is being computed,and b any payment made under the terms of the offer in compromise form,as shown in item,for the year in which such payment is made.
emphasis added.to put it simply,the collateral agreement referred to any payment made under the oic as shown in item,but the begners item was their social security numbers.this was a mistake,but one that no one noticed at the time the begners signed the collateral agreement.
for the next few years,the begners paid amounts that they thought were required by their collateral agreement.the district court described these years 
in tax year,plaintiffs reported on their income tax return an adjusted gross income agi of,and paid income tax of.under the collateral agreement,plaintiffs reported their annual income as adjusted gross income minus income tax paid.this calculation resulted in a collateral agreement payment of.
for tax year,plaintiffs reported on their income tax return an agi of,and paid income tax of.under the collateral agreement,plaintiffs reported their annual income as.plaintiffs reached this amount by deducting from their agi income tax paid and the collateral agreement payment made the previous year.this calculation led to a collateral agreement payment of.
for tax year,plaintiff computed their annual income in a similar fashion.on their income tax return,plaintiffs reported an agi of,and paid tax of.plaintiffs calculated their annual income of by subtracting from their agi both the amount of income tax paid and the collateral agreement payment from the previous year,resulting in a collateral agreement payment of.
begner united states,no,wl,at.during these years,neither the begners nor the irs noticed the discrepancy.the begners also did not seem to notice form,which they signed for the years.form explicitly stated that collateral agreement payments can not be deducted.
after cory sent the irs a letter requesting hardship relief for an illness from which she suffered,the irs discovered the discrepancy concerning item.in a letter to the begners,the irs wrote,you can not deduct payments made,in prior years,according to the future income collateral agreement,against adjusted gross income.the irs recomputed the begners liability to determine that they should have paid an additional.the irs then wrote that the begners were in default,and thus needed to pay the if they wanted to keep their offers in force.the begners acquiesced,paying the irs.
the begners then filed an action to recover the plus interest under and the begners and the irs filed for summary judgment.the district court rejected the irs argument that the court did not have jurisdiction.but it then granted the irs motion for summary judgment,holding that the begners incorrectly deducted their past collateral agreement payments from their agi when computing their annual income under the term of their compromise with the irs.begner,wl at.the begners appealed.
w e review a district court grant of a motion of summary judgment de novo.cuvillier rockdale county,cir.all issues of material fact are resolved in favor of the party.id.
there are two issues on appeal whether the district court had jurisdiction to hear the case,and whether the terms of the begners oic and collateral agreement permit them to deduct their previous year collateral agreement payments.like the district court,we answer the first question in the affirmative and the second question in the negative.
there are two statutory players in determining jurisdiction in the instant case the tucker act,a,and the statute,a.
the irs bases its argument on the tucker act,which provides that t he united states court of federal claims shall have jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the united states founded upon any express or implied contract with the united states.a.under the tucker act,the court of federal claims has exclusive jurisdiction for contracts in excess of.friedman united states,cir citing mark dunning,cheney,cir the irs argues that,under the tucker act,the district court lacked jurisdiction because this case involves a claim for more than that is founded on a contract with the united states and therefore is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of federal claims.the irs requests that we remand this case to the district court for transfer under to the court of federal claims.
unlike the irs focus on the tucker act,the begners focus on section a,the statute.the begners rely on section a because without it,the united states,as a sovereign,could not be sued.meyer,d absent a waiver,sovereign immunity shields the federal government and its agencies from suit.under section a,however,the united states explicitly waives sovereign immunity for cases falling within the statute reach.mutual assurance,united states,cir citing section a and stating that t he united states has waived its sovereign immunity in order to allow taxpayers to file actions seeking tax refunds.
the jurisdiction issue is thus simple are the begners and the district court correct that this is a case under section a,or is it a contract case under the tucker act if it the former,we have jurisdiction if it is the latter,we do not.
in addressing this issue,courts look past the form of the action and determine whether the claim is,at its essence,a contract or a case.megapulse,lewis,the classification of a particular action as one which is or is not at its essence a contract action depends both on the source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims,and upon the type of relief sought or appropriate.see also friedman,at citing megapulse for the rule that a plaintiff can not avoid the jurisdictional limitations of the tucker act by artful pleading up state fed.credit union walker,cir t he formation of megapulse,which examines both the source of the rights at issue and the nature of the remedy sought,builds logically on the analysis this circuit has developed to assess jurisdiction in the related context of the government contracts process.north star alaska united states,cir quoting megapulse.
we must determine whether the begners claim is at its essence a contract or a case.to do this,we need to define exactly what constitutes a case.the statute language is broad,using the word any five times 
any civil action against the united states for recovery of any tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected,or any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority or any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected under the laws 
a see also united states williams,d stating that section a contains broad language,which the court then applied to a person who paid a tax even though the tax she paid was assessed against a third party.under the terms of this statute,if the begners paid the irs any sum alleged to have been in any manner wrongfully collected under the laws,then their case is a case.
if we rely on the plain language of section a,this case is easy.the begners deducted their collateral agreement payments from the previous year when computing their current collateral agreement liability.the irs said that this violated the terms of its agreement with the begners,and it determined the full amount that the begners should have paid.the irs said that if the begners did not pay this full amount,the,they would default on their oic.the begners paid,and then filed an action seeking to recover the plus interest.reducing the above facts to their essence,here is what happened the begners deducted amounts from their payments to the irs that the irs thought the begners could not deduct,the irs collected those amounts from the begners,and the begners consequently sued the irs for a refund.the broad,plain language of section a encompasses this scenario.
no case is directly on point,but there are several cases that are sufficiently similar to be useful.the most important case,and the one on which the district court relied,is roberts united states.in roberts,the irs and a taxpayer entered into an oic resolving liability for back taxes.id.at.the irs accused the taxpayer of violating the terms of the oic,so it terminated the oic,making the taxpayer liable for his unpaid federal tax liability.id.at.the taxpayer paid all of his back taxes and filed a case.id.the federal circuit stated that t ax cases heard in the district courts often involve offers in compromise.id.at.it then emphasized that t he fact that the alleged collection error stems from the cancellation of taxpayer oic contract with the irs does not negate the fact that the monies were paid pursuant to the laws.id.the federal circuit then the broad language of section a that this situation is at its essence at case and not a contract action.id.while similar,our case is not because in roberts the irs terminated the oic,whereas here the oic was still in effect.but roberts is still important,however,for its reminder that even though the issues in a case may focus on the contractual terms of an oic,such a focus does not remove that case from section a.
another useful case is wilkens united states,wl,dist.lexis.in wilkens,two taxpayers entered into offers in compromise to settle tax liability,and u nder the terms of the offers in compromise,the taxpayers agreed to make certain payments and to enter into a future income collateral agreement.id.at,dist.lexis,at.the taxpayers abided by their oic for a few years,but they and the irs soon disputed the meaning of a term in their oic.id.at,dist.lexis,at.to resolve that dispute,the taxpayers filed a action.id.at,dist.lexis,at.while the district court focused on different rules than those at issue here,the court also focused on roberts,reaching a similar conclusion 
in this case,as in roberts,the true nature of the suit is not contractual.while taxpayers dispute the amount owed under the offers in compromise,the offers in compromise reflect an agreement concerning monies ultimately due and owing as a result of the internal revenue laws.
id.at,dist.lexis,at robinette commissioner,wl citing roberts and focusing on the source of the underlying dispute,the commissioner abuse of discretion,and not on the mere existence of an oic.
these same principles apply here.true,the dispute is about how the oic defines annual income.in computing their collateral agreement payments for and,the begners deducted the collateral agreement payments they made in the previous years.that this case is a dispute about contract interpretation,however,does not negate the fact that the monies at issues were paid pursuant to the laws.roberts,at.as we stated before,this case is easy when based on a plain reading the irs collected sums from the begners that they thought were wrongfully collected.these facts satisfy what section a demands to constitute a case.
the irs can not rebut this plain reading.it tries by making several iterations of the same argument because the begners claims are based on the terms of their oic and collateral agreement with the irs,and because contract law governs,this case is at its essence a contract case.as stated above,however,that the case turns on an interpretation of a contract does not take it out of the reach of section a.as such,we have jurisdiction to hear this case.
an oic is a contract between a taxpayer and the irs in which the irs agrees to accept a payment different from what the taxpayer owes.traditional rules of contract law apply to an oic.united states lane,cir it has long been settled that an agreement compromising unpaid taxes is a contract and,consequently,that it is governed by the rules applicable to contracts generally.the commissioner of the irs has the authority to reach an oic or other compromise agreement in any case arising under the laws.a.a collateral agreement often adds further consideration for an oic,finen commissioner,wl.together,the oic form and the collateral agreement form comprise the contract at issue in this case.
federal courts use federal common law to evaluate government contracts.falls riverway realty city of niagara falls,cir citing priebe sons united states.see also sec.derwinski,cir suits to enforce contracts with federal agencies are governed by federal common law.when determining what particular doctrine to apply in a particular suit,however,the court will often select a rule of state law.derwinski,at citing united states yazell,d see also united states pappas,cir stating that applicable general principles of state law can inform federal common law.here,we rely in part on georgia contract law because most of the events occurred in georgia.
under georgia law,courts examine a contract in its entirety in order to interpret any part there of.ann.specifically,courts follow a process in examining contracts 
at least initially,construction is a matter of law for the court.first,the trial court must decide whether the language is clear and unambiguous.if it is,the court simply enforces the contract according to its clear terms the contract alone is looked to for its meaning.next,if the contract is ambiguous in some respect,the court must apply the rules of contract construction to resolve the ambiguity.finally,if the ambiguity remains after applying the rules of construction,the issue of what the ambiguous language means and what the parties intended must be resolved by the trier of fact.

to move beyond the first step,we must decide that the contract is ambiguous.whether or not a contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court.ann.techwerks retail tech.a contract is ambiguous if it contains a duplicity,indistinctness,an uncertainty of meaning or expression that makes it susceptible to several reasonable interpretations.holcim us,amdg,quoting earl
