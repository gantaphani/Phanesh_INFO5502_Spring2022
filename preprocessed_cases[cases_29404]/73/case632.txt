gary pansier,a tax protester,did not pay his taxes for many years.when federal,state,and local revenue agents attempted to collect his delinquent taxes,pansier responded by requesting personal information from the individual agents and filing false forms with the internal revenue service irs,claiming that the individual revenue agents had been involved in large cash transactions on his behalf.he also attempted to satisfy his various tax debts with phony sight drafts,a type of financial instrument,which appeared to be drawn on a treasury direct account and issued under the authority of united states department of treasury.for his behavior,pansier was convicted of obstructing the administration of the irs,filing false irs forms,and passing phony financial instruments with the intent to defraud.
on appeal,pansier raises a number of challenges to his convictions,but we are not persuaded by any of them.because we conclude that the district court was permitted to exclude at least thirty days to resolve multiple pretrial motions,the delays in pansier trial did not violate the speedy trial act.the language of count one of the indictment reveals that the count was not duplicitous and charged pansier only with obstructing the due administration of the irs under the omnibus clause of a.we further conclude that it is not an element of,a perjury statute,that the false document passed was required to be filed by statute or regulation.therefore,counts two through nine of the indictment alleged all the necessary elements of the offense.and finally,the district court properly considered both the qualifications and the reliability of the government expert witness and did not err in the admission of his testimony.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
pansier and his wife refused to pay income and property taxes for many years.as a result,the irs,the wisconsin department of revenue,and the treasurer office of marinette county each sent the pansiers notice of their tax delinquencies.pansier responded to these notices by returning them to the relevant taxing authority stamped with the words accepted for value and exempt from levy.he also attached an irs form,requesting personal information,including social security numbers and dates of birth,from the individual employees and state officials attempting collections.in each instance,when he received no response from the individual employee,pansier filed a form,an irs form used to report cash payments over received in one transaction or two or more related transactions,see.on each form,he falsely reported that the individual employee had made a cash payment on his behalf and had refused to provide a social security number or date of birth.pansier also checked the amends prior report box as well as the suspicious transaction box,which is used to note that the individual is withholding information or attempting to prevent the form from being filed.see irs form.
among those individuals named by pansier in the false form were two employees of the wisconsin department of revenue the treasurer of marinette county,wisconsin the secretary of revenue for the state of wisconsin judge william atkinson of the brown county,wisconsin circuit court and an irs revenue officer assigned to pansier case.after receiving the false forms,the irs entered each one into its database and sent notices to the individuals,requesting that they provide the missing information and informing them of potential penalties if they failed to respond.once the irs investigated further,it discovered that the forms were false and removed all the entries from its database.
next,in an attempt to dodge his tax bills,pansier submitted as payment for taxes he owed to the irs,the wisconsin department of revenue,and marinette county,phony financial instruments,which appeared to be sight drafts issued under the authority of the united states department of treasury.sight drafts are financial instruments that are payable at the bearer demand or on presentment to the drawer.black law dictionary ed.the sight drafts included a purported treasury direct routing number,listed pansier social security number as the treasury direct account number,and directed the recipient to seek payment from pansier treasury direct account.but pansier did not have a treasury direct account,which is only an investment account that is administered by the united states treasury department bureau of public debt and can not be used to pay third parties.see treasury direct,htt p www.treasurydirect.gov indiv myaccount treasurydirect.when the irs received these phony sight drafts,it initially credited pansier account and attempted to present them for payment at several banks where they were dishonored.
in november,a grand jury returned a indictment against pansier,charging him with one count of obstructing the due administration of the irs,see a eight counts of filing under penalty of perjury false irs form,see and counts of fraudulently passing fictitious financial instruments,appearing to be issued under the authority of the united states,see a.pansier made his initial appearance at an arraignment on january.because pansier argues that his trial was impermissibly delayed in violation of the speedy trial act,we provide a detailed description of the procedural history of the case and the relevant dates following his initial appearance.
pansier initially opted to proceed pro se and filed numerous pretrial motions,some of which were incomprehensible or irrelevant,while others,including multiple motions to dismiss the indictment,discovery motions,and a motion for a bill of particulars,arguably presented substantive issues.the government filed a motion for handwriting exemplars and one motion in limine.judge william griesbach ruled on many of these motions and denied pansier various motions to dismiss.
at the final pretrial conference,judge griesbach disclosed that one of the government witnesses,wisconsin circuit court judge william atkinson,is his former colleague and a friend.nevertheless,at that time,judge griesbach concluded that he could remain impartial,and neither party objected.pansier waived his right to a jury,and the case proceeded to trial.
in august,judge griesbach found pansier guilty of counts one through nine but reserved his ruling on the remaining counts pending the parties briefs.several weeks later,however,judge griesbach issued an order in which he again informed the parties of his relationship with judge atkinson,and this time he invited them to move for his disqualification based on the possibility of an appearance of impropriety.pansier accepted this invitation,and,consequently,in an order dated october,judge griesbach recused himself and vacated all his previous orders and findings in the case.
the case was reassigned to judge charles clevert.neither party filed anything until two months later when,on december,pansier sought a clarification and modification of his conditions of release.on december,the government moved to revoke pansier bond.the district court set a hearing date for the motion.in the meantime,pansier moved to dismiss the charges based on an alleged violation of the speedy trial act.on january,the court revoked pansier bond and denied his speedy trial act motion,finding that the numerous pretrial motions that had been filed before judge griesbach recusal had been revived and were still pending.as a result,the court determined that the speedy trial clock was tolled.on february pansier filed the first in another series of pro se motions,and on february,the district court ruled on nine motions that had been filed before judge griesbach recusal,as well as three motions that had been filed after the recusal,and ordered briefing on four outstanding motions,two of which had been filed before judge griesbach.
in march,pansier retained an attorney and,through counsel,filed four motions a motion to dismiss count one of the indictment as duplicitous a motion to dismiss counts two through nine of the indictment for failure to allege all the necessary elements of the crime a motion to dismiss the indictment based on delay and a renewed motion to dismiss for violation of the speedy trial act.the court denied each of these motions.
the case again proceeded to trial,this time before a jury.the government argued that pansier had obstructed the due administration of the irs by submitting the false form,knowing that by checking the amends prior report and suspicious transaction boxes,the irs would be sent on a wild goose chase,investigating the fictional transactions and,after discovering that no transactions had occurred,would be required to remove the false information in the irs database.he further obstructed the administration of the irs,the government argued,by submitting the fictitious sight drafts as payment for his federal taxes,knowing that,even if the drafts were not accepted as legitimate,the irs would expend resources in attempting to process the drafts for payment.counts two through nine reflected eight individual form filed with the irs,which,the government contended,pansier signed under penalty of perjury,despite his knowledge that they were false as to a material matter,the very transaction reported.finally,the government dismissed counts ten and but proceeded on the remaining counts,which all related to individual sight drafts that pansier submitted,as the government contended,knowing them to be fictitious and appearing to be drawn under the authority of the united states,with intent to defraud the various taxing authorities.
in support of these counts,the government presented the testimony of fourteen witnesses,including a number of individuals whom pansier had named in the form,several individuals who had received and attempted to process the fictitious sight drafts,and william kerr,a bank examiner with the office of the comptroller of the currency whom the court qualified as an expert witness over pansier objection.kerr testified that the sight drafts submitted by pansier were worthless financial instruments purportedly drawn upon a treasury direct account at the treasury department.
the jury found pansier guilty of counts one through nine,eighteen through,and through thirty,but acquitted him of counts eleven through seventeen.the jury was hung on count,and,as a result,the government dismissed the count.the district court sentenced pansier to months imprisonment for each count,with the terms to run concurrently.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
a.there was no speedy trial act violation.
pansier first argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the case under the speedy trial act.the speedy trial act provides that no more than seventy days may pass between a defendant initial appearance in court and the commencement of trial.c united states harris,cir.the act further provides,as relevant here,that i f the defendant is to be tried again following an order of a trial judge for a new trial,the speedy trial clock is reset and the new trial must begin within seventy days from the date the action occasioning the retrial becomes final.e.
indeed,pansier second trial commenced more than seventy days after judge griesbach recusal order.in calculating the speedy trial clock,however,the act specifically excludes the time from the filing of any pretrial motion until the hearing on that motion,h d henderson united states,d,as well as the time after the hearing until the district court receives the last filing it expects to receive on the motion,henderson,at.united states pedroza,cir the act further excludes a maximum of thirty days after that last filing,during which a motion is actually under advisement by the court,h h see henderson,at.pedroza,at.when a court is called upon to decide multiple motions,however,that period of advisement may be extended beyond thirty days as long as the court resolves the pending motions with reasonable promptness.pedroza,at united states salerno,cir united states tibboel,cir.
the district court concluded that the speedy trial act had not been violated because judge griesbach recusal order,vacating all of his previous orders,including the convictions on counts one through nine,reset the speedy trial clock under e.the recusal order also revived all pretrial motions on which judge griesbach had ruled,and,the court explained,approximately thirteen motions were revived at the time of his recusal.so,additional time was excluded until the resolution of those motions,and,the court calculated,no more than days elapsed from the speedy trial clock before the case went to trial.
we review the district court denial of pansier speedy trial motion de novo.united states farmer,cir.pansier raises two challenges to the court speedy trial clock calculation.first,he argues that the speedy trial clock was not reset under e because when judge griesbach recused himself,he did not also order a new trial.pansier relies on united states crooks,cir,for the proposition that only an order setting the case for retrial triggers e and resets the clock with a fresh seventy days.
pansier reads crooks too broadly.in that case,the ninth circuit stated that the district court order setting the case for retrial,and not the dismissal of the jury,constituted the action occasioning the new trial.crooks,at.but the ninth circuit later revised its holding in that case,refusing to apply e in such a narrow fashion.rather,the court explained that the act reference to trial following an order for new trial refers to the granting of a motion for new trial or its equivalent,which would upset a verdict of conviction and occasion a new trial.united states pitner,cir emphasis added.similarly,in this case,judge griesbach order granting pansier motion for recusal and vacating the convictions on counts one through nine is the equivalent of a motion for new trial.that order upset the verdict of conviction and was the action occasioning the retrial within the meaning of the act.see e.moreover,judge griesbach recusal order vacated his prior rulings on the numerous pretrial motions,thereby reviving those motions,and nothing in the language of e requires otherwise.
pansier also takes issue with the district court exclusion of thirty days under h h because,he contends,there is no evidence that the various pro se motions that were revived following recusal were actually under advisement in the two months following judge griesbach recusal.he further argues that those motions were simply nonsensical discovery motions that were obviously meritless.therefore,pansier asserts that no time should be excluded for the multiple pretrial motions that were pending immediately after the order of recusal.
although pansier is correct that the docket reveals no activity immediately following judge griesbach recusal,we are not persuaded that h h requires the close factual inquiry that pansier suggests to determine whether a motion was under advisement.pansier relies on language in united states johnson,cir,which states that a court must look more closely into the particular circumstances of that motion,whether there was a hearing on the motion,or whether the motion was taken under advisement,to determine whether certain days are excludable.but in making that statement,the fifth circuit was simply distinguishing between the number of days that may be excluded in the case of a motion requiring a hearing and the number of excludable days for a motion that does not require a hearing and is simply taken under advisement.see johnson,at.and when no hearing is required,a motion is considered to be actually under advisement when the trial court receives all the papers it expects to receive regarding that motion.henderson,at.united states hemmings,cir johnson,at.here,the parties had already fully briefed many of the pending motions and the court expected no further filings on those motions immediately following recusal.judge clevert was therefore entitled to a new period of advisement in which to review those motions under h h.the question we must answer then,is whether the district court resolved those motions with reasonable promptness.see,pedroza,at united states cheek,cir.
in calculating the speedy trial clock,starting on october,until trial,the periods of time from december through january and february until the trial began on june,were properly excluded under the act,as pansier concedes.that leaves days in dispute,from october through december,and january through february,during which the parties multiple pretrial motions remained pending.
we do not measure reasonable promptness by a mathematically precise standard,pedroza,at,but we have previously held that the standard was met when a trial court decided four motions in days,seven motions in days,tibboel,at,eight motions in days,united states latham,cir and motions in fifty days,cheek,at.at least thirteen motions were revived and pending after the recusal order,including a motion in limine and a motion for handwriting exemplars filed by the government.and although several of pansier pro se filings may not have required any action by the district court,see united states williams,cir refusing to exclude any time for a pro forma discovery motion that required no action by the court,pansier filed four motions to dismiss the indictment,a motion for a bill of particulars,and multiple discovery motions.we need not decide,however,what amount of time constitutes reasonable promptness in deciding thirteen motions of this varied nature because,even excluding a mere thirty days,which would be reasonable for just one motion,only days elapsed from the speedy trial clock.therefore,we find that the district court satisfied the speedy trial act deadline.
count one is not duplicitous.
next pansier challenges his conviction for obstructing the due administration of the irs,contending that count one of the indictment is duplicitous.an indictment is duplicitous if it charges two or more offenses in a single count.united states starks,cir.duplicity creates a risk that the jury might return a less than unanimous guilty verdict,potentially exposes the defendant to prejudice at trial and sentencing,and in some cases subjects the defendant to double jeopardy.united states davis,cir.the district court denied pansier motion to dismiss count one as duplicitous,a ruling that we review de novo.starks,at.
the statute at issue in count one,a,states that an individual may be prosecuted if he or she 
c orruptly or by force or threats of force including any threatening letter or communication endeavors to intimidate or impede any officer or employee of the united states acting in an official capacity under this title,or in any other way corruptly or by force or threats of force including any threatening letter or communication obstructs or impedes,or endeavors to obstruct or impede,the due administration of this title.
this provision contains two distinct clauses,which each describe a separate offense.united states lovern,cir united states kassouf,cir.the first clause prohibits specific threats against an officer or employee of the united states designed to intimidate or impede that officer administration of the tax code,while the second clause,the omnibus clause,is aimed at all other activities which may obstruct or impede the administration of the code.lovern,at united states bowman,cir united states kelly,cir.
here,count one of the indictment returned by the grand jury alleges that pansier corruptly endeavored to obstruct and impede the due administration of irs laws by filing with the irs false forms,and fictitious financial instruments referred to as sight drafts.the defendant thereby used the irs as a tool of retaliation against public employees for the lawful performance of their official duties.he filed the fictitious financial instruments in order to satisfy federal tax,interest and penalties due and owing as assessed against either himself his wife.the count consists of six paragraphs,three of which describe the false form that pansier filed and state that i n retaliation,pansier reported on the forms that federal and state employees had made payments on his behalf,causing the irs to process the forms and send notices to the employees.in the final paragraph the count alleges that i n a further effort to obstruct and impede the due administration of the internal revenue laws pansier filed with the irs sight drafts as purported payment.before trial,however,the district court struck from count one all allegations of retaliation as a motive for the false forms,and the jury received the revised indictment absent any references to retaliation.
pansier argues that the references in the original indictment to retaliation against public officials charge him with violating the first clause of a,while the references to the fictitious sight drafts charge him with violating the omnibus clause of that statute.and alternatively,pansier argues,the indictment was constructively amended when the district court struck the references to retaliation from count one but later permitted the government to present evidence that he retaliated against various public employees.
pansier reliance on the indictment references to retaliation is misplaced.the language of count one tracks the statutory language of the omnibus clause of a and states that his actions in filing the form and the fictitious sight drafts were intended to obstruct the due administration of the code.there is no allegation that the form were intended to intimidate or impede individual federal tax officers,a required element of the statute first clause,see kassouf,at,and the relevant paragraphs explain that the form named both federal and state latter of which are relevant only for the omnibus clause of a.we conclude then that the indictment charges only a violation of the omnibus clause of a and is not duplicitous.
moreover,even if we were to assume that the indictment is duplicitous,pansier fails to identify any prejudice that this may have caused him.see starks,at.there was no risk of a verdict because the jury received the revised indictment absent any reference to retaliation,and,accordingly,as instructed,the jury could only find pansier guilty of count one by finding that he corruptly endeavored to obstruct or impede the due administration of the internal revenue laws,and that he did so knowingly and intentionally.
nor was there a constructive amendment of the indictment.constructive amendment of an indictment occurs where the permissible bases for conviction are broadened beyond those presented to the grand jury.united states blanchard,cir.pansier argues that the government presented evidence of retaliation against public employees and that the court erred in striking all references to retaliation from the indictment.but the government simply presented evidence relevant to the form and did not pursue a theory of intimidation at trial.and,rather than adding additional bases for conviction,the court removed only language from the indictment,properly ensuring that there could be no confusion as to the factual basis for the charge.see united states alhalabi,cir finding no error where court struck from the indictment only information that was immaterial to the crime charged.
counts two through nine were sufficiently charged.
an indictment must state all the elements of the crime charged.united states moore,cir.in his next attack on the indictment,pansier argues that counts two through nine,which alleged that he willfully made and subscribed false statements on the form in violation of,were defectively charged.section is violated when a person w illfully makes and subscribes any return,statement,or other document,which contains or is verified by a written declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury,and which he does not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter.pansier argues that the government failed to allege in the indictment or prove at trial what he contends is an element of the crime that irs code or regulation requires the form to be filed.without this element,pansier argues,the government can not show that the information contained in the form was false as to a material matter.in support of this contention,he relies on united states levy,cir,for the proposition that a form not required by statute or regulation can not be the basis of an offense under.
we are not persuaded by this argument.section is a perjury statute,unit
