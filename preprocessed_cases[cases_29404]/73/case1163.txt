robert bedford appeals his conviction for conspiracy under the government filed a superseding indictment charging three individuals with various crimes.defendant was named in count one of the indictment,which charged him with conspiracy to commit two underlying crimes defrauding the united states of america by impeding the internal revenue service in its lawful efforts to collect income taxes,and assisting individual taxpayers in filing fraudulent tax returns in violation of the jury in defendant original trial could not reach a verdict,but after a retrial,a second jury convicted him of conspiracy.
the genesis of this case involved a business called tower executive resources that billed itself as an executive recruitment business.in fact,tower promoted to its members the opportunity to protect assets and to enjoy tax deferral through an offshore venture.tower marketed its asset protection services to select clients through seminars at which defendant and others spoke.
essentially,clients learned at these seminars how to create bogus corporate entities called international business corporations,referred to as and.were domestic corporations that would hire and pay,foreign corporations,to perform services for the.those services did not actually occur.
tower clients,as owners of the,could then repatriate the untaxed funds the had paid to the,purportedly as business expenses.however,some tower members repatriated the funds for personal use.tower members also used the ibcs to engage in financial shenanigans such as bogus loans,fraudulent option agreements,and purported scholarships for their children.
defendant had a tax preparation business which prepared tax returns for some tower clients.defendant claims it was his understanding that tower system was not a tax fraud scheme,and he asserts he regularly told tower clients they could only access the funds in their for regular business expenses,not personal expenses.
discussion 
on appeal,defendant argues his conviction occurred because of erroneous jury instructions,error in the superceding indictment,and error in allowing an irs agent to testify in the form of legal conclusions applied to the facts of the case.we address each of defendant contentions in turn.
jury instructions 
as to jury instructions,defendant raises three points of error that the district court erred in including an agency instruction,that he was entitled to his entire proposed theory of defense instruction,and that elements of the underlying substantive crimes were missing from the instructions.
we review de novo the jury instructions as a whole and view them in the context of the entire trial to determine if they accurately state the governing law and provide the jury with an accurate understanding of the relevant legal standards and factual issues in the case.united states crockett,cir see also united states park,d.we review the district court decision to give or to refuse a particular jury instruction for abuse of discretion.see united states nacchio,cir stating we review for abuse of discretion a district court decision whether to refuse a particular jury instruction united states mcclatchey,cir stating we review for abuse of discretion a district court decision whether to give a particular jury instruction.we also review for abuse of discretion a district court shaping or phrasing of a particular jury instruction.
when a defendant objects to the omission of an element from a jury instruction,we review the omission for harmless error.united states robertson,cir.however,w e review a jury instruction for plain error when a party fails to object to the instruction at trial.united states willis,cir.plain error exists only where there was error,that is plain,that affects substantial rights,and that seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.robertson,at see also.b.
instruction 
defendant appeals the district court giving of an agency instruction based on b this instruction stated 
in order to sustain its burden of proof,it is not necessary for the government to prove that the defendant personally did every act constituting the offense charged.as a general rule,whatever a person is legally capable of doing himself he can do through another acting as his agent.so if the acts or conduct of another are deliberately ordered or directed by the defendant or deliberately authorized or consented to by the defendant,then the law holds the defendant responsible for such acts or conduct just the same as if personally done by him.
on appeal,defendant makes three specific objections to this instruction.first,defendant asserts the instruction misled the jury as to the mental state required for conviction because it instructed the jury that defendant was legally responsible for acts he deliberately consented to or authorized rather than those in which he willfully participated.second,defendant argues that giving the instruction was improper because the instruction underlying law did not apply to a conspiracy charge.third,defendant argues that this instruction was not warranted by the facts in evidence.
defendant did not specifically raise his first objection to this instruction before the district court.we therefore review only for plain error.see united states,cir noting that only specific grounds for an objection that are raised before the trial court are properly preserved for appeal see also.d noting that party objecting to instruction must inform court of the grounds for the objection comcoa,nec,cir when considering a party challenge to jury instructions,our initial inquiry is whether the party properly preserved that issue for appeal by objecting at the district court level to the instruction on the same grounds raised on appeal.
after reviewing the instructions as a whole,we conclude the district court did not err when it used the word deliberately instead of willfully in this instruction.the court instructed the jury on the elements of the crime,including the requirement that defendant be shown beyond a reasonable doubt to have known the essential objective of the conspiracy and to have willfully joined it.at.at least six separate instructions informed the jury as to the level of knowledge,intent,deliberateness,and willfullness required to convict defendant.because we review the instructions as a whole,we therefore conclude the district court did not mislead the jury as to the state of mind necessary to convict defendant of conspiracy.
as to defendant second objection,which was argued before the district court,that the law did not adequately support the instruction,we review for abuse of discretion.mcclatchey,at.we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in instructing the jury that defendant could be held responsible for acts he deliberately ordered,directed,consented to,or authorized.see united states giese,cir holding that defendant can be found guilty of conspiring to cause to be committed an illegal act by combining other statutes with b.
we also reject defendant contention that there was no factual basis for this instruction.the evidence in the record shows,among other things,that defendant signed a tax return including materially false information or had an employee sign such a return,and advised tower clients to create and backdate invoices supporting fraudulent tax returns.we thus conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion by giving this instruction.
theory of defense instruction 
a defendant is entitled to a theory of defense instruction if it is a correct statement of the law,and if he has offered sufficient evidence for the jury to find in his favor.crockett,at.however,a theory of defense is not required if offered only to clarify the issues.united states alcorn,cir.it is only required if,without the instruction,the other instructions are erroneous or inadequate.id.
we review the theory of defense instruction for plain error because defendant did not preserve this issue for appeal willis,at.on appeal,defendant argues the instruction should have included that he was unaware that certain members of tower and a friend of one tower member were abusing
