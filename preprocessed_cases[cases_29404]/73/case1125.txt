suzy zoo appeals from the tax court,challenging a deficiency finding for its tax year ending june.the tax court held that suzy zoo exercised such degree of control over the manufacturing of its products by third party contractors that it was a producer under internal revenue code and that it did not qualify for the small reseller exception of b b and could not deduct its production costs.the tax court also held that the year of change under a was the first taxable year in which suzy zoo changed its method of accounting to conform to.we have jurisdiction under a,and we affirm.
background 
suzy zoo is a california corporation,owned by its founder suzy spafford.suzy zoo is in the business of social expression,creating cartoon characters that are imprinted on its greeting cards,stationery,and various other products.its principal customers are card and gift shops,and its most popular product is greeting cards.its revenues largely derive from sales of its products to retail stores through independent sales agents who receive a commission.the remainder of its revenues consists of royalties from licensees who pay suzy zoo a fee for the use of its cartoon images.suzy zoo does not sell any products other than those bearing its cartoon images.nor does it sell any of its original cartoon characters.however,it sells licensee products at its own store.
suzy zoo uses several independent contractors to manufacture its products.the process in which its products are manufactured is central to determination of whether suzy zoo is a producer under.this process is explained here using the example of a greeting card manufactured by a printer and bindery.however,it is substantially the same for manufacturing of all other products made by suzy zoo.
in manufacturing a greeting card,suzy zoo creates cartoon characters and sends the original drawing as flat art to an independent printer.the printer photographs the cartoon drawing,performs color separations,and creates a proof of a particular card model,which is shipped to suzy zoo for approval.the printer provides its own stock of paper and ink and bears the risk of loss of the supplies and printed goods until they are shipped to suzy zoo.the printer also modifies the proof if suzy zoo is not satisfied.once suzy zoo approves the proof,it sends a purchase order to the printer who prints the sheets of greeting cards ordered and ships them to a cut and fold bindery the printer is not permitted to sell the greeting cards to anyone and does not have a proprietary interest in the cartoon characters created by suzy zoo.
the printed sheets are transported to the bindery by trucking companies that have a contract with suzy zoo.the bindery transforms the printed sheets to finished cards pursuant to the specifications of suzy zoo and bears the risk of loss if it damages the cards during the cutting and folding process.once the bindery sends the finished products to suzy zoo,the latter employees package the cards in boxes for sale to retailers.
on february,the commissioner of internal revenue cir informed suzy zoo of a income tax deficiency for the tax year ending june.on may,suzy zoo filed a petition for redetermination on the ground that it should be allowed to deduct its production costs.the cir denied the petition and found that suzy zoo was required to capitalize these costs in accordance with.the tax court agreed.
the tax court held that suzy zoo was a producer under the meaning of and that it qualified for neither the small reseller exception of b b nor the artistic business exception of h.consequently,the tax court held that suzy zoo could not deduct its production costs even though its products are manufactured by third parties.the tax court further held that the year of change under was the first taxable year in which suzy zoo computed its income tax under a different method of accounting than the preceding taxable year to conform to.suzy zoo appealed.
standard of review 
factual findings of a tax court are reviewed for clear error.see baizer,cir.conclusions of law are reviewed de novo,as are the tax court construction of the tax code and interpretation of a statute.see id.at leslie,cir.the tax court finding that the year of change is is a conclusion of law reviewed de novo.
the court of appeals reviews de novo the tax court findings of mixed questions of law and fact.see hypotheek land,cir.a mixed question of law and fact exists when primary facts are undisputed and ultimate inferences and legal consequences are in dispute.see kivel united states,cir.here,the parties have stipulated to all facts.the tax court finding that appellant is a producer under is an ultimate inference from undisputed facts and is thus a mixed question of law and fact reviewed de novo.
discussion 
the issue presented is whether suzy zoo is a producer subject to the uniform capitalization rules of and unable to deduct from its income tax the costs of production of its products,even though third party contractors manufacture its products,supply the labor and materials,and bear the risk of loss.
section a requires capitalization of certain direct costs and the allocable share of indirect costs of property produced by the taxpayer or acquired for resale the term produce is defined by g as construct,build,install,manufacture,develop,or improve and further defined by treasury regulation a i to include create,raise or grow.in addition,g provides that t he taxpayer shall be treated as producing any property produced for the taxpayer under a contract with the taxpayer 
section and the corresponding treasury regulations provide several exceptions to the capitalization requirement,three of which are pertinent to this appeal.the first two are found under the small reseller exception of b b,which provides an exception for two categories of resellers small resellers with de minimis production activities under treasury regulation a ii,and small resellers with personal property produced under contract under treasury regulation a.the third exception is the routine purchase order exception of regulation a ii b ii.none of these exceptions is applicable to suzy zoo,who is a producer,and not a reseller,under.
construction of the term produce under 
i legislative history 
the legislative history of indicates that congress intended a single comprehensive set of rules to govern determination of whether costs should be capitalized,from the moment of acquisition through production and disposition of property.see,wl.a broad construction of the term produce is necessary to attain this purpose.this is evident from the senate finance committee comment pertaining to enactment of the committee believes that,in order to more accurately reflect income and make the income tax system more neutral,a single,comprehensive set of rules should govern the capitalization of costs of producing,acquiring,and holding property,including interest expense,subject to appropriate exceptions,at the broad definition of produce in g and treasury regulation a i is consistent with this congressional intent.further support for this position is found in treasury regulation a,which provides that costs associated with production include purchasing,storage,and handling costs of property held for future production,along with costs,thereby expanding the horizon of produce from the present to the future.
we hold that the term produce is to be broadly construed under.see,at costs of meeting with governmental officials,obtaining building permits and drafting architectural plans were development costs amounting to production under reichel,wl real estate taxes had to be capitalized under as indirect costs of producing property even though property was not developed carpenter,memo,wl construction costs incurred by building contractor for an unsold home had to be capitalized under because the home was produced by the contractor.
ii a producer need not manufacture its own products 
the issue of whether a company that contracts with third parties to manufacture its products is a producer under is novel.however,several cases dealing with the excise tax statute hold that a company can be a manufacturer of propert
