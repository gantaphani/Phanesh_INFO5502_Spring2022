appellants irwin schiff,lawrence cohen,and cynthia nuen contest the constitutionality of a preliminary injunction entered by the district of nevada enjoining them from promoting their tax theories.specifically they argue that the injunction is overbroad as it relates to a book they sell,the federal mafia,that the requirement that they give the government their customer list violates both their own and their customers first amendment and fourteenth amendment associational rights,and that the order that they place a copy of the injunction on their websites constitutes illegal compelled speech in violation of the first amendment.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.because we agree that the government has shown a likelihood of success on the merits and that the provisions of the injunction do not violate the appellant rights,we affirm.
background 
irwin schiff has a long history of opposition to the federal income tax laws for over thirty years he has maintained that the federal income tax is voluntary,although he has never been successful with that theory in court.with cynthia nuen,he now operates freedom books in las vegas,nevada.lawrence cohen is an employee at freedom books.both through the bookstore and through three internet websites the defendants sell various tax packages that purport to teach the buyer how to legally stop paying federal income taxes.the book at issue in this injunction,the federal mafia how the government illegally imposes and unlawfully collects income taxes,is sold individually and as part of packages.
the united states brought this civil action against the defendants in march pursuant to,which authorizes a district court to enjoin any person from conducting activities that are subject to penalty under and.these sections penalize individuals who organize,market,or promote tax evasion schemes.the district court granted a temporary restraining order,prohibiting the defendants from continuing with their business,and then,after a hearing,issued a preliminary injunction against the defendants on june.the defendants timely appealed the order.on september,a motions panel from this court stayed the order pending the outcome of this appeal.
the preliminary injunction provides in relevant part that the defendants may not engage in any of the following activities 
organizing,promoting,marketing or selling,or assisting in organizing,promoting,marketing or selling,any plan or arrangement which advises or encourages taxpayers to attempt to violate internal revenue laws or unlawfully evade the assessment or collection of their federal tax liabilities,including those that promote,sell,or advocate the use of the zero income tax return,and the use of false forms

advertising,marketing or promoting any false,misleading,or deceptive tax position in any media for the purpose of advising or encouraging taxpayers to unlawfully evade the assessment or payment of federal income taxes,including the positions that persons can legally stop paying taxes or become tax free by using the plan or arrangement federal income tax is voluntary there is no law requiring anyone to pay income tax there is no income tax,only a profits tax it is legal to report zero income regardless of what you may have earned,or to use false withholding forms schiff personal services as witness or brief writer will be materially helpful in defending criminal prosecution or any other false,misleading,or deceptive tax position 
assisting others to violate the tax laws,including the evasion of assessment or payment of taxes 
inciting others to violate the tax laws,including evasion of assessment and payment of taxes 
instructing or assisting others to hinder or disrupt the enforcement of internal revenue laws by filing frivolous lawsuits,taking frivolous positions in an effort to impede irs audits and collection due process hearings,or engaging in other conduct intended to interfere with the administration and enforcement of the internal revenue laws

engaging in any conduct subject to penalty under failing to sign and furnish the correct identifying number on tax returns they prepare or 
engaging in any other activity subject to injunction or penalty under,or,including fraudulent or deceptive conduct that substantially interferes with the proper administration of the internal revenue laws.
the preliminary injunction also requires the defendants to submit to the government a list of their customers from january,through the present,including names,addresses,phone numbers,email addresses,and social security or employee identification numbers.finally,the defendants are required to post a copy of the preliminary injunction order on the home pages of the websites through which they conducted their business.
on appeal the defendants argue that the preliminary injunction violates their first amendment rights because it is overbroad as it relates to the federal mafia,the forced disclosure of the customer list violates their own and their customers associational rights,and the placement of the order on their websites constitutes unconstitutional compelled speech.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.united states estate preservation,cir.the scope of a preliminary injunction is also reviewed for abuse of discretion.see idaho watersheds project hahn,cir.a trial court abuses its discretion if it bases its decision on an erroneous legal standard or on clearly erroneous factual findings.estate preservation services,at.
granting the preliminary injunction 
a preliminary injunction may be granted when the plaintiffs demonstrate either a likelihood of success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury or that serious questions going to the merits were raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in their favor.southwest voter registration education project shelley,cir en banc quoting clear channel outdoor,city of los angeles,cir.
courts use a specialized standard when reviewing preliminary injunctions issued pursuant to.see estate preservation,at united states kaun,cir united states buttorff,cir sec holschuh,cir.the district court must evaluate the likelihood of future violations,and thereby determine whether an injunction is needed.estate preservation,at.factors that the court may consider when making this determination include the following the gravity of the harm caused by the offense the extent of the defendant participation,the defendant degree of scienter the isolated or recurrent nature of the infraction the defendant recognition or of his own culpability and the likelihood that the defendant occupation would place him in a position where future violations could be anticipated.id.
given schiff extensive history of tax avoidance and the fact that the defendants operate a bookstore devoted to introducing others to his tax avoidance schemes,there is a strong likelihood that the defendants would violate in the future.therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it granted the preliminary injunction.
c.the scope of the preliminary injunction 
the defendants argue that the injunction,even if appropriately granted,should be struck down because it violates their constitutional rights.they argue that the scope of the preliminary injunction is unconstitutionally broad as it relates to the federal mafia.they also argue that the injunction unconstitutionally compels them to speak and infringes on their rights to expressive association.
the federal mafia 
the law on prior restraints is.there are three theories by which the sale and publication of the federal mafia can be enjoined.first,pure commercial speech can be enjoined to the extent that it is fraudulent.central hudson gas electric public serv.comm n,d.second,speech that will incite imminent lawlessness may be barred.brandenburg ohio,d.finally,speech that aids or abets criminal activity can be prohibited.illinois ex rel.madigan telemarketing,d.
commercial speech 
commercial speech traditionally has been granted less protection than political speech and expressive speech.central hudson,at.that much of first amendment law is relatively settled.what is less clear is what type of speech qualifies as commercial speech.the definition of commercial speech,however,is critical to this case.if the disputed portions of the federal mafia are considered commercial speech,then the central hudson analysis would apply.under the first prong of central hudson,if commercial speech is misleading or related to unlawful activity,the government may regulate it or ban it entirely.id.at.schiff would lose on this prong of the central hudson test because his extensive history of litigation with the irs leaves little doubt,not only that his theories are wrong,but that he knows they are wrong.because the government has the right to regulate false,misleading or deceptive commercial speech,thompson western states medical center,d,the injunction on these materials would be appropriate.on the other hand,if the disputed portions of the book are considered political speech they would be entitled to a much higher standard of protection.
a discussion of the two definitions of commercial speech offered by the parties will be helpful here.schiff maintains that commercial speech is limited to advertising pure and simple.appellant brief at see also central hudson,at.under this narrow definition,only the back cover,pages,and the inserts,which all advertise other products available from schiff,would qualify as commercial speech that can be regulated by the government.the government agrees that commercial speech includes advertising pure and simple but argues that the supreme court has defined it more broadly as expression related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience.central hudson,at.although neither the government nor the district court,which adopted the government definition of commercial speech,specifically states which pages would meet this broad definition of commercial speech,it can be assumed the government believes that,at least,chapter eight how to stop paying income taxes and the epilogue and addendum to the second edition which give instructions on how to file the returns and samples of such returns would qualify as commercial speech under this definition.
to resolve the difference of opinion between schiff and the government,it is necessary to interpret what the supreme court meant in central hudson when it offered both of these phrases as definitions of commercial speech.much thought has gone into the question of what the supreme court really meant by the second category of commercial speech,upon which the government relies in this court most recent commercial speech cases we have been forced to examine speech that blurs the line between commercial and expressive.see mattel,mca records,cir.hoffman capital,cir.the case before us is not so close.in both mattel and hoffman the speaker used images and ideas to create a new expressive work that had commercial aspects in the ensuing intellectual property challenges,we held that the new works were primarily expressive,and,to the extent they included commercial aspects,the commercial speech was inextricably entwined with the expressive speech and could not be enjoined.hoffman,at.
the case at hand is markedly different.instead of using an iconic figure of americana to lampoon american culture,schiff has created an entire line of tax avoidance products and services,of which the federal mafia is the linchpin.compare mattel.the extravagant claims made in the federal mafia are designed to convince readers that they can lawfully avoid paying their income taxes so that the readers will buy other products in schiff line.the insert from the desk of irwin schiff makes it plain that this book is the legal foundation upon which taxpayers can rely in following the various suggestions that he makes both in the book and elsewhere in his tapes and seminars.for example,at the bottom of that page in the last paragraph he states prior editions contain no information that suggested that persons filing zero income tax returns should get a refund of all the income taxes they paid that year.the return shown on page has been changed to reflect this information.on the inside of the fly leaf of the book it says,
did you know,for example,that income taxes have to be assessed just like property taxes and,if you do not file an income tax return,there is no lawful way the government can assess you did you know that no law says you have to pay income taxes or that you can be liable for such tax are you aware that there are no criminal statutes that apply to income taxes 
emphasis in the original.
all of these things under discussion within the book are made to assure the taxpayer that the taxpayer can legitimately follow these suggestions and forms.the other insert in the book entitled,irwin schiff freedom books,also makes it plain that this is intended to help sell his other products.for example,on the back of the second page he shows the price for all of the various tapes and books and so forth,the videos that he is selling,and shows the entire freedom package at.then he shows on the next page the schiff specials where you can get the freedom package for less and various other books and tapes for better prices.the government argues,and we are persuaded,that the federal mafia is an integral part of schiff whole program to market his various products for taxpayers to utilize his forms and techniques to avoid paying income tax.
