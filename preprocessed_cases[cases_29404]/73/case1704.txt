the franchise tax board board appeals a judgment requiring it to refund the sum of plus interest to thomas paine and teresa norton plaintiffs for the,and income years.the refund is for taxes paid on amounts plaintiffs received after they retired or withdrew from hewitt associates,a business consulting partnership,and became california residents.the court granted the refund based upon its application of former revenue and taxation code section we shall find that the court incorrectly applied former section,and reverse the judgment.
thomas paine was a partner in hewitt associates for years.he retired on december.teresa norton was a partner in hewitt associates for approximately eight years before she withdrew from the partnership on december.under the terms of the hewitt associates partnership agreement,both plaintiffs earned vested deferred compensation paid over a period beginning on retirement or withdrawal from the partnership.
the deferred compensation payable to paine was based upon partnership earnings in years prior to retirement,his capital account and the difference between his capital account on an accrual basis and on a cash basis,and interest on the unpaid capital account.the compensation payable to norton consisted of repayment of percent of her capital account and the difference between her capital account on an accrual basis and on a cash basis.
plaintiffs became california residents in.hewitt associates filed tax returns based on a fiscal year ending on september,on a cash accounting basis,for the years,and,accounting for the deferred compensation as paid in each of these years the deferred compensation hewitt associates reported as paid in the years does not include any california source income.
plaintiffs also filed timely joint california tax returns for those same years.they paid all tax due,including taxes on installments of the deferred compensation from hewitt associates,as received.they then filed amended personal income tax forms for each of these years,claiming a refund based upon exclusion of the deferred compensation.
after their administrative claim for a refund was denied,plaintiffs filed their complaint for a refund of personal income tax.the trial was based on stipulated facts and admission of documents.on january,the trial court issued its tentative decision,which became its statement of decision.the court held that former section prevented cash and taxpayers who change residency from being taxed differently.as applied to the facts,the court reasoned that if hewitt associates had accounted on an accrual basis,instead of accounting for the deferred compensation in each of the years paid,its liability for the entire amount of deferred compensation would have accrued and been deducted in and,the years in which plaintiffs retired or withdrew from the partnership,before plaintiffs became california residents.in that event,plaintiffs would have had to include the entire amount as income in those respective years,instead of in the years hewitt associates actually accounted for it as paid,and plaintiffs would not have had to pay any california taxes in the years they received these payments after becoming california residents.the court concluded that former section therefore precluded the state of california from taxing the deferred compensation payments plaintiffs received after they became california residents,and entered judgment for a refund of the taxes paid.the board filed a timely notice of appeal.
plaintiffs claim for a refund turns on the application and effect of section,a statute concerning the treatment of a taxpayer who changes residency that was repealed effective october.stats,ch.before addressing whether,and how,section should be applied to the facts of this case,we review the applicable principles of taxation concerning partners and partnerships,which will demonstrate that the payments plaintiffs received from hewitt associates were otherwise taxable by the state of california for the years in question 
california personal income tax is imposed upon the entire taxable income of a resident of california,regardless of its source,subds.a and i a.the policy behind this provision is to ensure that individuals who are present in the state,and receiving the benefits and protections of its laws,contribute to it by paying taxes on all income regardless of its source.it was undisputed that plaintiffs became residents of california in,and were residents of california when they received payments from hewitt associates in the,and income years.this income is taxable despite its source,because plaintiffs were residents of this state in each of these years.
setting aside the question of the effect of the change in their residency in,under both california and federal tax laws,plaintiffs were required to include the payments they received from hewitt as income for the taxable years,and.the deferred compensation payments at issue are payments made by a partnership to a retired or withdrawing partner.section specifies that,with exceptions not relevant here,the provisions of internal revenue code section et,applicable to partners and partnerships,shall also apply to california taxation of partnerships and partners.the taxation of partners and partnerships involves a blend of an aggregate and an entity approach to accounting.a partnership,for most purposes,is not treated as a separate entity and is not subject to income tax.instead,in determining personal income tax,a partner reports his or her distributive share of partnership income,gain,loss,deduction,and credit in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement,a.
under the applicable federal tax law,incorporated into state law by section,payments made to a retired partner are either distributive shares or guaranteed payments,a.the parties agree that the payments made to plaintiffs by hewitt associates were guaranteed payments.a partner,retired or not,must include a guaranteed payment as ordinary income for his taxable year within or with which ends the partnership taxable year in which the partnership deducted such payments as paid or accrued under its method of accounting.c see also a,a,c.hewitt associates reported on a cash method of accounting under which a deduction is allowed when an item is paid.a.with respect to the timing of reporting income derived from the partnership,the partnership elects the method of accounting,and regardless of the accounting method a partner has chosen for nonpartnership income tax purposes,all partners are bound by that election.b.therefore,plaintiffs were required to,and did,report as income the guaranteed payments that hewitt associates accounted for as paid in each of the taxable years that is the subject of their claim for a refund.
the basis for the claimed refund is the application of the recently repealed section to the guaranteed payments plaintiffs received from hewitt associates after they changed their residency to the state of california.section provided when the status of a taxpayer changes from resident to nonresident,or from nonresident to resident,there shall be included in determining income from sources within or without this state income and deductions accrued prior to the change of status even though not otherwise includable in respect of the period prior to that change,but the taxation or deduction of items accrued prior to the change of status shall not be affected by the change.in appeal of money,transfer binder rptr.cch the board of equalization stated that this section was never intended to override fundamental tax principles regarding the taxation of residents,who enjoy the benefits and protections afforded by this state,and considerations of fairness,treating similarly situated taxpayers the same.the board of equalization explained that it had attempted to limit the application of this section to prevent contravention of the aforementioned principles,but that its efforts were complicated by the statute obscure language,and lack of a purpose.the board reconsidered its prior interpretation that the primary purpose was to prevent double taxation.instead,it found the purpose of this section was limit
