anderson makes two challenges to his sentence to wit the district court violated the ex post facto clause by using the guidelines and the sentence of months imprisonment is unreasonable the government the district court failure to order restitution on the two federal counts.
ex post facto clause 
anderson first contends that the district court violated the ex post facto clause when it used the guidelines in determining his sentence on the two federal counts.our review of this question of law is de novo.united states dorcely,united states alexander.
anderson was sentenced on march,and,at that time,the version of the guidelines was in effect.it directed the court to use the guidelines manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced.sentencing guidelines manual a.it also directed the court to apply the guidelines manual in effect when the offense of conviction was committed if applying a later version would violate the ex post facto clause.id.at b see also united states bolla,c ourts must apply the guidelines in effect on the date the offense was committed if using the guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing would yield a longer sentence.
anderson plea agreement recited that the district court is obligated to calculate and consider,but is not bound by,the united states sentencing guidelines.plea agreement at.in his reply to the government memorandum in aid of sentencing filed before sentencing,however,anderson asked the district court to consider the guidelines because he committed the offenses in and.at the sentencing hearing,the district court concluded that anderson had waived any objection to its use of the guidelines by entering into the plea agreement,which specified the version.the district court also indicated at the hearing that a sentence,the top of the sentencing range suggested under the guidelines,would be insufficient.as noted earlier,the district court subsequently ruled in the alternative that it would have imposed the same sentence if it had consulted the version of the guidelines.because the district court determined anderson sentence using both the guidelines and,in the alternative,the guidelines,which alternative sentencing we affirm as set forth infra at,we need not reach anderson ex post facto clause challenge.
reasonableness of sentence 
anderson next argues that his imprisonment sentence is unreasonable.in reviewing his sentence,we undertake a inquiry of any legal error and of the overall reasonableness of the sentence in light of statutory sentencing factors.united states olivares,see united states lawson.we review substantive reasonableness under the abuse of discretion standard.gall united states,d.
anderson first argues that the district court did not explain its upward departure from the recommended sentencing range under the guidelines the sentencing court commits procedural error if it fail s to adequately explain the chosen an explanation for any deviation from the guidelines range.gall.at see also in re sealed case,vacating sentence based on failure to explain upward deviation from advisory guidelines range.the district court here held in the alternative that it would have imposed the same sentence,even if the guidelines were applicable,by varying upward under booker and the section a factors.mem.op.at.it further noted after consideration of all factors under section a that the imprisonment sentence is the one that is sufficient but not greater than necessary.id.quoting a.the district court had expressly considered the section a factors during the sentencing hearing and it was therefore unnecessary to re
