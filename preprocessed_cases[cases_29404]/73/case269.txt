opinion of the court 
this is a consolidated criminal appeal,arising out of a large tax fraud conspiracy,that presents us with an opportunity to clarify the mental states required of the payor and payee to uphold a conviction for hobbs act extortion under color of official right.for the reasons set forth below,we will affirm 
background 
between and,appellant patricia fountain,an irs employee,helped orchestrate several schemes to fraudulently obtain cash refunds from the irs.those schemes involved filing false tax returns that claimed refunds pursuant to the telephone excise tax refund tetr,the first time home buyer credit fthbc,or the american opportunity tax credit aotc.fountain employed her knowledge of the irs fraud detection procedures to avoid suspicion,including that tetr claims below would not be flagged for review.over time,fountain and her significant other,appellant larry ishmael,enlisted various people,including appellant calvin johnson,to recruit claimants who would provide their personal information in exchange for a portion of a cash refund.during the same period,johnson became involved in an additional conspiracy with some of his family members and other acquaintances that involved submitting fraudulent fthbc and aotc claims.
after a trial,a jury convicted fountain,ishmael,and johnson on multiple counts of conspiracy and filing false claims to the irs in violation of and.fountain was also convicted on one count of hobbs act extortion and two counts of making or presenting false tax returns,violations of a and,respectively.additionally,johnson was convicted of filing false claims to the irs while on pretrial release in violation of and.
fountain moved for a judgment of acquittal after trial on the hobbs act charge,which the district court denied.following evidentiary hearings on the dollar amounts involved in the defendants schemes,the district court sentenced fountain to months imprisonment and a term of supervised release,and ordered her to pay restitution of.the district court sentenced ishmael to months imprisonment and a term of supervised release,and ordered him to pay restitution of.finally,the district court sentenced johnson to months imprisonment and a term of supervised release,and ordered him to pay restitution of.each of these sentences fell within the applicable guidelines ranges after the district judge imposed various enhancements.
ii.discussion 
fountain hobbs act conviction 
fountain contends that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support a conviction for extortion under color of official right.while sufficiency of the evidence is a question of law subject to plenary review,w e review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,afford deference to a jury findings,and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the jury verdict.united states moyer,cir quoting united states riley,cir.we will overturn the verdict only when the record contains no evidence,regardless of how it is weighted,from which the jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.id.quoting riley,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the extortion count against fountain alleged that she obtained and attempted to obtain money from deborah alexander under color of official right as an irs employee.as the government demonstrated at trial,alexander was a client at natashia witherspoon hair salon.witherspoon,who was also fountain hairstylist,recruited alexander and other clients to provide personal information so that fountain could file fraudulent tax returns in their names.witherspoon had alexander fill out blank irs forms with her personal information and then gave those forms to fountain for her to file.alexander never dealt directly with fountain,but she knew fountain worked for the irs.sometime after her tax return was filed,witherspoon told her that she had to pay fountain a fee.alexander testified that she became suspicious,but paid the fee anyway.witherspoon testified that she told some people that fountain would red flag them if they did not pay her fee,but did not say whether she conveyed that information to alexander in particular.likewise,alexander did not recall witherspoon mentioning any consequences for failing to make the payment.
we hold that the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to support fountain hobbs act conviction.because we have articulated the appropriate standard for an official right extortion conviction in varying ways in past cases,we take this opportunity to synthesize our case law and explain how we come to this result.
elements of hobbs act extortion under color of official right 
the federal statute penalizing extortion,a codification of the hobbs act,provides that 
whoever in any way or degree obstructs,delays,or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce,by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do,or commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years,or both.
a.extortion is defined as the obtaining of property from another,with his consent,induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force,violence,or fear,or under color of official right.id.b.as we explained in united states manzo,cir 
congress sought to proscribe coercive activity through enactment of the hobbs act.under the terms of the hobbs act,a person can only commit extortion in one of two ways through threatened force,violence or fear or under color of official right.see b.both of these types of extortion are inherently coercive.
whereas in a case of extortion by force,violence,or fear,the acts or threats supply the coercion,when proceeding under a color of official right theory,the misuse of public office is said to supply the element of coercion.id.quoting united states hathaway,cir see also evans united states,adopting the majority rule that the coercive element of hobbs act extortion under color of official right is provided by the public office itself.in other words,the importance of a defendant public office or official act to a hobbs act charge is its coercive effect on the payor.accordingly,after reviewing the legislative history and evaluating competing constructions of the statute,the supreme court held in evans that to prove a conviction for extortion under color of official right,the government need only show that a public official has obtained a payment to which he was not entitled,knowing that the payment was made in return for official acts.at.
we interpreted evans in united states antico,cir,and explained that no official act need be proved to convict under the hobbs act.id.at.rather,we focus on the motivation of the payor,that is,whether a payment was made in return for official acts,and whether the defendant knew the payor motivation.id.emphasis added quoting evans,at internal quotation marks omitted.as such,in antico,we approved a district court instruction that the jury had to decide whether the giver gave the payments because he believed the defendant would use his office for acts not properly related to his official duty.id.at underline added.similarly,in united states urban,cir,we upheld a hobbs act conviction where the government adduced substantial evidence that the payors made payments to the defendants knowing they were public officials exercising governmental authority the payors made payments in order to assure advantageous exercise of that government authority and the defendants knew that the payors payments were made for an improper purpose,the influencing of their governmental authority.id.at.
in other decisions,however,we have expressly identified another consideration in our official right extortion inquiry whether the payor belief was reasonable.this line of cases began with our en banc decision in united states mazzei,cir en banc.there,the defendant,a state senator,received payments in exchange for helping a corporation obtain a lease from a state executive agency.id.at.the defendant argued that he could not have been acting under color of official right because he had no official power in that area,and he never pretended to have any official power.id.at.we acknowledged that the defendant had no statutory power as a state senator to control the granting of leases by state executive agencies,but rejected the defendant argument,because in order to find that defendant acted under color of official right,the jury need not have concluded that he had actual de jure power to secure grant of the lease so long as it found that the payor held,and defendant exploited,a reasonable belief that the state system so operated that the power in fact of defendant office included the effective authority to determine recipients of the state leases here involved.id.
we recently extended mazzei in united states bencivengo,cir.there,we upheld a hobbs act conviction of the mayor of hamilton township,new jersey,who accepted payments in exchange for agreeing to influence the awarding of school board insurance contracts.id.at.we noted that the defendant had no actual de jure or de facto power over the award of such contracts,and that unlike in mazzei,there was no evidence that the payor believed he had such power.id.at.nonetheless,we held that mazzei extended to situations where a payor reasonably believed the defendant possessed influence,if not effective power,over an exercise of governmental authority.id.at.thus,we concluded,where a public official has,and agrees to wield,influence over a governmental decision in exchange for financial gain,or where the official position could permit such influence,and the victim of an extortion scheme reasonably believes that the public official wields such influence,that is sufficient to sustain a conviction under the hobbs act,regardless of whether the official holds any de jure or de facto power over the decision.id.
read together,our holdings in mazzei,antico,urban,and bencivengo,while emphasizing different aspects of the payor motivation,are consistent in accounting for the payor reasonable belief as a reflection of the coercive effect of the defendant official acts.the reason we included in our inquiry the reasonableness of the payor belief that the defendant would engage in particular official acts whether by exercising de jure power,de facto power,or influence in mazzei and bencivengo but not antico or urban is simple the defendant authority to engage in the relevant official acts was not contested in antico or urban.both of those cases involved philadelphia licenses and inspections officers who accepted illicit payments in exchange for favorable exercises of their authority,they rewarded people who paid and punished people who did not.see urban,at antico,at those defendants clearly exercised de jure power over governmental decisions.in contrast,in mazzei and bencivengo,the defendants authority was contested,as indicated above but in all of these cases,reasonableness was inherent in our inquiry.
thus,our case law articulates a unified standard for official right extortion cases we will uphold a conviction for hobbs act extortion where the evidence indicates that the payor made a payment to the defendant because the payor held a reasonable belief that the defendant would perform official acts in return,and that the defendant knew the payor made the payment because of that belief.
application 
upon a careful consideration of the record,we agree with the district court that a rational juror could conclude that alexander paid fountain with the understanding that fountain would use her position at the irs to help her obtain a cash refund,and that fountain knew that alexander paid her for that reason.while fountain may not have had any power over the irs decision to grant any of the fraudulent refunds she filed,we need not find that fountain actually used her position or performed an official act in furtherance of the scheme to uphold her conviction the focus of our inquiry is on alexander state of mind.see antico,at in other words,no official act,no quo need be proved to convict under the hobbs act.nonetheless,the official must know that the payment the quid was made in return for official acts.see also urban,at t he government need not prove that the public official acted or refrained from acting as a result of payments made.
fountain contends both that alexander did not subjectively believe and that no reasonable person in alexander position could have believed that fountain,a customer service representative for the irs,could influence whether she received a refund.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,however,the evidence at trial allowed the jury to find that alexander reasonably believed fountain could wield such influence.it is not clear exactly what alexander understood about fountain position,as alexander interacted only with witherspoon,but as alexander testified,once her refund claim was submitted,she was told she had to pay of the refund to fountain and,despite her suspicions,she acquiesced because she was still hoping to get the money.fountain app.this suggests she understood her payment to be compensation for services rendered.indeed,when the irs demanded repayment of the refund,alexander told fountain and witherspoon,i want my back,because if i had to pay the back to the irs,i not going to give her.fountain app.on the basis of this evidence,the jury easily could have found that alexander reasonably believed fountain would help her obtain the refund.
the jury also could have found that alexander reasonably feared reprisal.alexander paid fountain after her claim had been submitted and despite her suspicions about fountain demand for payment.even though neither alexander nor witherspoon testified to any explicit discussion with alexander about the consequences of failing to pay,witherspoon did testify generally that fountain threatened to red flag claimants who did not pay her fee and that she repeated fountain warning to claimants.fountain app.thus,a reasonable inference from the testimony,as well as the timing of the payment,is that alexander paid fountain because she was concerned that fountain,as an irs employee,otherwise would have prevented the refund or flagged it to a superior for suspected fraud 
finally,we reject fountain argument that the evidence in support of the hobbs act charge was insufficient because the government failed to prove that she used the power of her employment at the irs to induce alexander to pay her in exchange for filing a false claim with the irs.inducement is not an element of hobbs act extortion under color of official right.evans,at urban,at antico,at.accordingly,we affirm fountain conviction 
b.the district court guidelines determinations 
fountain,ishmael,and johnson each challenge the district court calculation of the applicable guidelines range for their sentence.where an objection is preserved at sentencing,we exercise plenary review of a district court interpretation of the guidelines but review its factual findings for clear error.united states grier,cir en banc.if the facts underlying a guidelines determination are not in dispute,but the issue is whether the set of facts fit within the enhancement requirements,we review the district court application of the enhancement for clear error.united states fish,cir.finally,where an objection is not preserved at sentencing,we review that challenge for plain error.united states couch,cir united states knight,cir.
sophisticated means enhancements 
fountain and johnson 
fountain and johnson both argue that the district court erred in applying a enhancement for sophisticated means to their sentences under because there was nothing particularly sophisticated about the means employed in their schemes.their arguments are unpersuasive.
while the application notes to suggest that the use of fictitious entities,corporate shells,or offshore financial accounts would constitute sophisticated means an offense can easily warrant the sophisticated means enhancement absent the use of those tactics.see united states jennings,cir upholding a sophisticated means enhancement in the absence of corporate shells or offshore accounts,and explaining that the list contained in the application note
