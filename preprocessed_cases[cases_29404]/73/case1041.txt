conrad janis and his wife maria janis petitioners appeal the tax court holding that they are liable for deficiencies in their joint income tax returns from through.these deficiencies resulted from conrad taking inconsistent positions as to the value of an expensive art collection included in his father estate.on the premise that flooding the market with a large collection of works from significant artists,ranging from piet mondrian to jean arp and grandma moses,would depress the value of the works,conrad and his brother carroll janis,as and the sole beneficiaries of the estate,calculated a discounted value for the collection.conrad and carroll ultimately agreed with the internal revenue service irs on a discounted valuation of the collection.some years later,in valuing the gallery inventory,petitioners claimed a higher,undiscounted market value as the tax basis for the collection in their joint tax returns.the tax court held that petitioners were bound by the duty of consistency and could not report on their individual tax returns a value different than that stipulated to for the estate tax return.we agree and affirm.
background 
sidney janis owned and operated,as a sole proprietorship,the sidney janis art gallery in new york.the gallery owned almost works of art,many of them by artists.in april of,sidney transferred the gallery,including the art collection,into a trust,with himself and his children,conrad and carroll,as trustees.upon his death,the remaining trust assets were to be distributed to conrad and carroll in equal shares.sidney died in november of.conrad and carroll were named and the sole beneficiaries of his estate.
after sidney death,the estate hired sotheby to value the collection.sotheby valued the works on an basis at fair market value.the appraiser did not account for any diminution in value that might occur in the event the entire holdings were placed in the market at one time.however,the estate calculated a as a blockage accounted for the number of pieces in the collection,the nature of the works,and other factors that would affect the actual realized price as a consequence of putting such a large number of works on the market.each year between and,conrad and carroll filed a fiduciary income tax return for the trust that reported the collection at a blockage discounted value of.with this valuation,the gallery reported a net operating loss each year,thereby minimizing the amount of taxes owed.
after the tax return was filed,the irs examined the claimed valuation and agreed that a blockage discount was appropriate.the irs disagreed,however,with the actual value of the collection.the irs determined that the undiscounted value of the collection was and that the appropriate blockage discounted value was,approximately two million dollars higher than the estate estimate.
in january,conrad and carroll consented to the irs adjustments and to its discounted valuation of the estate artwork.memorializing their agreement,conrad and carroll signed form,waiver of restrictions on assessment and collection of deficiency and acceptance of overassessment.the irs examination of the artwork valuation was then concluded.the limitations period for assessment against the estate tax return expired before these proceedings.
in february,despite their earlier agreement with the irs,conrad and carroll filed amended fiduciary income tax returns for,claiming an undiscounted value of for the collection.this valuation,in turn,created an even larger net operating loss for the gallery,increasing the tax benefits for conrad,carroll,and the trust.in the years through,conrad and carroll similarly filed fiduciary income tax returns for the trust,reporting the value of the collection at its undiscounted value.
the trust was terminated in november,and its assets,including the gallery and the collection,were distributed to conrad and carroll in equal shares of ownership.conrad and carroll formed a partnership to hold the assets of the gallery,including its collection.the net operating losses reported for the trust between and were rolled over into the partnership,a maneuver that allowed petitioners as well as carroll and his wife to reduce their joint taxable income for,and.in their tax returns,petitioners continued to report the collection at the full,undiscounted value of.during this entire period,the individual works of art were not divided between conrad and carroll,but instead were kept together in the gallery,with each owning an equal share of the total collection.
eventually the irs reviewed petitioners individual tax returns filed jointly for,as well as the trust tax returns for.the irs concluded that petitioners should have used the collection blockage discounted value of,which had been calculated by the irs and agreed to by conrad and carroll for estate tax purposes.under this valuation,after adjustments were made,the gallery and the trust actual net losses between and were substantially reduced and the partnership realized a profit for and.the result was that with the lower valuation of the collection,petitioners owed more taxes because they were not able to claim the same net operating losses for the gallery and partnership.
the irs filed a notice of deficiency for the individual tax returns.petitioners contested the notice in tax court,which upheld the deficiencies after a trial.janis comm r,cch 
fair market value of the art collection 
to determine whether conrad and carroll reported the correct value of the gallery for estate tax purposes,the irs art advisory panel reviewed a sample of the works.the panel accepted sotheby valuation to determine the undiscounted value of the collection.although the panel did not agree with the specific discounts urged by conrad and carroll,it did agree that a blockage discount was appropriate.
as explained by the panel,
in general,a blockage discount is applied to property in an estate in an attempt to reflect the market response to a large number of items.traditionally a blockage discount is applicable in response to a large number of works by one artist,usually in an artist estate.the estate of sidney janis is not an artist estate,and does not involve a large number of works by one particular artist,but rather works by different artists.however,since it is a valuation problem involving a gallery inventory,some of the general principles are applicable.
a number of factors have been considered in determining whether a blockage discount is appropriate and to what extent it should be applied to the subject properties.consideration was given to the prominence of the artists the types of works in the estate the distribution of the items for example,the number and types,and their quality and saleability the number of similar items available in the the market response to such works around the valuation date the number of sales and the prices at which sales were made during the period immediately preceding and following death the annual sales of the gallery length of time necessary to dispose of the items the works that are saleable within a relatively short period of time the works that can only be marketed over a long period the demonstrated earning capacity of the business the tangible and intangible assets,including goodwill and,the reputation of the gallery and the provenance.
ultimately,conrad and carroll stipulated to the panel recommendation of the value of the collection for estate tax purposes.this valuation flowed through to conrad and carroll as the heirs of the estate.in valuing inherited property for income tax return purposes,a provides that the basis of property in the hands of a person acquiring the property from a decedent shall be the fair market value of the property at the date of the decedent death.under the tax regulations,a,the estate tax valuation of the inherited property upon the decedent death is prima facie evidence of the fair market value of the property.janis,at.consistent with these circumstances,the tax court determined that the estate tax value applied to the collection under and a.id.
petitioners argue that the tax court valuation of the collection was a conclusion of law because the
