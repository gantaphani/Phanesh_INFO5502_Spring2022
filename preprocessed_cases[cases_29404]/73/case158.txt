this appeal from a judgment of conviction entered on february,in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york joseph bianco,judge,raises questions about the proper application of the speedy trial act,et,on retrial,specifically,whether a district court may find factors supporting an extension of the time for retrial only within the initially prescribed day period,see id.e,or whether it may make such findings even after the day period has passed.we confront these questions in the context of a record suggesting both insufficient prosecutorial attention to speedy trial obligations and a lack of candor by prior defense counsel about actual readiness for trial.neither concern,however,determines this appeal.in the end,we conclude that,however preferable it may be for e findings extending the time for retrial to be made within the initial day retrial period,the statute itself does not impose such a requirement.for that reason,and because we identify no error in the district court decision to grant an extension to days or in its determination that defendant was tried within that time,we affirm the challenged judgment.
background 
first trial and appeal 
on july,defendant dov shellef and confederate william rubenstein were found guilty after a jury trial before judge joanna seybert of one count of conspiracy to commit tax fraud,see,and counts of substantive wire fraud,see.these crimes arise out of a complex scheme to buy and sell an chemical,cfc,without paying millions of dollars in required federal excise and income taxes.shellef was also found guilty on counts of money laundering,see id.a a i ii,b i two counts of subscribing to false income tax returns,see and one count of personal income tax evasion,see id.
on appeal,this court ruled that shellef was entitled to have had the tax counts but not the tax count severed from the other charges against him,see united states shellef shellef i,cir,and to have had his trial severed from that of rubenstein,see id.at.the initial judgment of conviction was,therefore,vacated and the case remanded for a new trial.see id.
district court proceedings following mandate 
this court mandate in shellef i issued on march,which all parties agree is the starting date for purposes of calculating time under the speedy trial act provision governing retrials,see e.to facilitate our consideration of shellef speedy trial act challenge to his conviction on remand,we frame our discussion of the events following issuance of the mandate by reference to discrete time periods.
march to april,reassignment of case to judge platt 
ten days after issuance of the mandate,by letter dated march,the government requested that judge seybert schedule a status conference,advising that the shellef i remand would now require three trials for the two defendants.before judge seybert acted on this request,the case was randomly reassigned on march,to judge thomas platt pursuant to eastern district local rule l on march,judge platt ordered the parties to appear for conference on april.
april,discussion of possible need for re indictment and retrial in early 
at the april conference,a question arose as to whether,consistent with this court severance ruling,the government could pursue the necessary retrials on the single existing indictment the government position,or needed to the case to a grand jury to seek three distinct indictments defendants position.with judge platt initially inclined toward the latter view,the government sought leave to brief the issue.although it set no specific briefing schedule,the district court directed the government to include in its brief an assessment of the speedy trial status of the case.
the government advised the court that the parties had been exploring the possibility of retrial in early.when judge platt observed that speedy trial exclusions would be necessary to delay retrial until,the government stated that the case had already been declared a complex matter,presumably a reference to the speedy trial act continuance provision,see h a,b ii shellef,stuart abrams,agreed that the case was complex,but emphasized that shellef was not agreeing to extensions of speedy trial time.april,tr.judge platt observed that he did not understand that to be the government request,which the government confirmed.nevertheless,judge platt agreed that the case was complex,identifying support for that conclusion in the shellef i panel decision.he did not,however,expressly state that he was granting a continuance on april.rather,he instructed the parties to consider the matter further so that they could ask for appropriate speedy trial act exclusions at future court appearances.
may to november,government request for trial date and shellef first speedy trial motion 
approximately five weeks later,on may,the government requested that the district court set new trial dates in the case.in a,letter,the government presented legal argument as to why it could retry the defendants on the original indictment,contrary to reservations noted by judge platt and opposition voiced by defendants at the april conference.on may,judge platt instructed the government,inter alia,to submit copies of the redacted indictments it proposed to use at the three anticipated retrials.for reasons not apparent from the record,the government did not comply until july.
shellef never filed any opposition to the government may argument that retrial could proceed without new indictments.instead,on june,his counsel abrams filed a motion seeking dismissal of the pending indictment on the ground that the day period within which shellef retrial was required by e had expired on may.judge platt denied the motion on july,finding that he had implicitly granted a speedy trial exclusion on april,pursuant to u.h a,b ii,based on the complexity of the case,which was then acknowledged by all parties who were seeking retrial in january 
three months later,by letter dated october,the government again requested a status conference to set trial dates.on november,judge platt scheduled that conference for november,at which time it set shellef case for retrial on november.meanwhile,on november,abrams filed a motion to modify the conditions of shellef bail.
november,to june,shellef requests for trial continuances and reassignment of case to judge bianco 
shellef does not contest that the time between the november,bail motion and the start of trial on december,is properly excluded from speedy trial calculation.thus,we need not discuss the particular exclusions supporting this conclusion in detail.nevertheless,we think it useful to summarize the events giving rise to this month period of further delay to provide context for the speedy trial issues raised on this appeal and to explain the reassignment of this case to judge bianco,whose final speedy trial assessment is here challenged.
at the november conference,abrams renewed his argument that shellef had been denied speedy retrial.judge platt remained unconvinced,reiterating that he had implicitly granted a h continuance based on complexity,running from the april,status conference through january,the month the parties had identified for possible retrial.nevertheless,in light of shellef speedy trial challenge,judge platt proceeded to set november,for rubenstein retrial,to be followed immediately by shellef retrial.rubenstein counsel objected to the trial date,invoking scheduled medical treatments and ongoing plea negotiations.judge platt maintained the date,advising that if the case against rubenstein were resolved by plea before november,the government should be prepared to begin shellef retrial on that date.abrams objected,noting that he was currently engaged in a trial that would not be concluded by late november.following judge platt suggestion that shellef retain other counsel who could try the case as scheduled,abrams advised that a late november trial still might not be realistic because he expected to file additional motions addressed to the government decision not to and to unspecified issues raised by the shellef i ruling.judge platt suggested that shellef efforts to avoid a november trial cast doubt on the sincerity of his earlier speedy trial protest.
on november,abrams advised the district court that his client had been unable to secure new counsel to retry the case on november,and that the trial in which he was engaged would not conclude until.abrams proposed that new pretrial motions be filed by december,and that trial be adjourned until february.in support of this schedule,shellef agreed to a h continuance of speedy trial in the interests of justice.the district court accordingly rescheduled trial for february.
on january,abrams again moved to adjourn trial,as well as for leave to withdraw,for the first time advising judge platt that shellef had not finalized abrams retention for retrial.at the ensuing january conference,abrams stated that if the court would release of the money shellef had posted for bail,shellef would be able to effect abrams retention,allowing retrial to proceed as scheduled without the problem of having to secure new counsel,tr.with the government consent,the district court released the money.the counsel problem,however,was not eliminated.
by letter dated february,attorney henry mazurek sought leave to substitute as shellef counsel and requested a day continuance of the trial date to afford him adequate time for preparation.judge platt denied the application on february,at an apparently untranscribed telephone conference.presumably,he had not yet seen shellef supporting declaration,dated february,which advised that it had been his intention since remand in march to seek new counsel for retrial because of fundamental disagreements and irreconcilable differences with counsel of record about his defense.shellef decl.shellef attributed his failure to do so to financial constraints that persisted until the district court release of bail funds.shellef represented that abrams had agreed to represent him on remand only for purposes of bail and speedy trial and that the two had had no adequate substantive meetings or communications with respect to defense strategy at retrial.id.shellef did not explain why these circumstances presumably making it impossible to proceed to retrial at any time between march and february had not been disclosed earlier to the district court.by written order dated february,judge platt adhered to his original decision denying substitution.
shellef petitioned this court for a writ of mandamus,which was denied on march.see in re dov shellef,mr cir,order denying mandamus.the order nevertheless identified various constitutional concerns arising from shellef claim that the denial of mazurek application was forcing him unwillingly to proceed to trial pro se,which this court assumed judge platt would address before retrial.id.at.
with jury selection scheduled to begin on the afternoon of march,judge platt heard extensively from shellef and abrams on that morning and the day before about shellef professed longstanding intent to secure different representation for retrial,his current dysfunctional relationship with counsel of record,and his unwillingness to represent himself.judge platt remained adamant in refusing to allow a substitution of counsel that would require adjournment of trial.the judge voiced frustration that,at past status conferences,abrams had given the misimpression that,but for scheduling conflicts and lack of funds,he stood ready to retry the case.the judge further characterized as inadequate a proposed stipulation to waive speedy trial challenges that operated only prospectively.abrams construed the latter statement as impermissibly conditioning shellef choice of counsel on the withdrawal of the original speedy trial challenge,prompting a heated exchange that ultimately led abrams to request judge platt recusal,which request was denied.
at the same time that these proceedings were being conducted in the district court,mazurek successfully obtained a temporary stay of trial from this court while he petitioned for a writ of mandamus.see in re dov shellef,op cir,motion for emergency stay of trial and writ of mandamus.on april,this court granted mandamus to the extent of ordering reassignment of the case to a different judge.see in re dov shellef,op cir,order granting mandamus.pursuant to the mandate,which issued on june,the case was reassigned to judge bianco on june.
june,to february,shellef second speedy trial motion and the challenged judgment of conviction 
at a june,status conference,judge bianco set december,for retrial,with shellef agreeing to the exclusion of all intervening time from speedy trial calculation.on september,mazurek moved to dismiss the pending indictment based on speedy trial delays occurring before november.the district court denied the motion orally on november,and on january,after the conclusion of trial and proceedings,filed a detailed memorandum and order explaining its reasoning.see united states shellef,d.
therein,judge bianco construed the record of proceedings on april,to reflect an implicit finding by judge platt that retrial within days of the mandate would have been impractical,and to extend the time for retrial to days pursuant to e.even in the absence of such action by judge platt,however,judge bianco concluded that he had the authority to make the same finding of impracticality and to extend the time for retrial to days,which he did.
in considering whether shellef had been tried within the required days,judge bianco focused on the days between the march,mandate and the november,filing of shellef bail motion after which time shellef concedes the proper exclusion of all time through the start of trial on december.observing that at least of these days had to be excludable under the speedy trial act for shellef retrial to be timely,the district court identified the following periods of excludable delay 
first,the five days spanning march,to april,were automatically excluded while shellef first motion to modify bail was pending.see h d.
second,the days spanning june,to july,were automatically excluded while shellef first speedy trial motion was pending.see id.
third,at least additional days,from may,to june,were automatically excluded while the government motion to set trial dates was pending before shellef first speedy trial motion was filed.see id.
fourth,one day,april,was excluded because of the status conference on that date.see id.h united states lucky,cir.
because these excludable periods totaled days,judge bianco concluded that only days of unexcluded time had elapsed between march and november.accordingly,judge bianco rejected shellef speedy trial challenge as without merit,finding that he was retried within days of unexcluded time from this court mandate.
shellef retrial commenced on december,with former rubenstein among the witnesses testifying against him.on january,a jury found shellef guilty of one count of conspiracy to commit tax fraud,counts of wire fraud,counts of money laundering,and one count of filing a false tax return.
upon review of shellef motions,the district court dismissed of the money laundering counts of conviction as duplicative.on january,it sentenced shellef to a total of five years imprisonment,three years supervised release,and a special assessment of on the remaining counts of conviction.the court also ordered shellef to forfeit about million in money and property.judgment was formally entered on february,and this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
shellef appeals his conviction on a single ground the district court purported failure to afford him a retrial within the time prescribed by the speedy trial act.see e.shellef insists that the prescribed time was days because judge platt actions on april,were inadequate to support a statutory extension of up to days,and judge bianco could not make the requisite findings for extension after the initial day period had elapsed.shellef argues that he was not tried within unexcluded days of this court march,mandate because judge platt actions at the april conference were inadequate to manifest a contemporaneous exclusion for complexity pursuant to u.h a,b ii,which could not,in any event,be open ended,see united states gambino,cir.shellef further argues that,even if the prescribed time for retrial were found to be days,he was not tried within that time because judge bianco erred in treating various time periods as excludable.
insofar as these issues challenge the construction of the speedy trial act,they present questions of law that we review de novo.see united states lucky,at.insofar as they challenge the district court identification of periods of exclusion under the statute,we review the district court findings of relevant facts only for clear error,but we review the application of the speedy trial act to those facts de novo.see united states simmons,cir.applying these principles,we conclude that three rulings suffice to resolve this appeal.first,the findings necessary to extend the prescribed period for retrial from to days under e can be made after the initial day period for retrial has passed.second,the factors relied on by judge bianco in granting an extension to days result ed from passage of time.e,insofar as they reflected changed circumstances between the close of the original trial and the grant of the extension affecting retrial.third,judge bianco correctly identified sufficient excludable delay to support the conclusion that shellef was retried within days of this court mandate.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of conviction without needing to decide whether the april,record is itself sufficient to support either a e extension to days or a continuance pursuant to h that renders timely shellef retrial within unexcluded days of mandate.
a.the speedy trial act does not place a limitation on the time within which a district court may grant a e extension for retrial 
the provision of the speedy trial act relevant to retrial states 
if the defendant is to be tried again following an appeal or a collateral attack,the trial shall commence within seventy days from the date the action occasioning the retrial becomes final,except that the court retrying the case may extend the period for retrial not to exceed one hundred and eighty days from the date the action occasioning the retrial becomes final if unavailability of witnesses or other factors resulting from passage of time shall make trial within seventy days impractical.
e emphasis added.shellef argues that the highlighted language must be construed to require that any extension of time be granted only within the initially prescribed day period for retrial.he submits that after that day period passes,a district court is not empowered to make the impracticality findings necessary to support an extension up to days.the question is one of first impression in this court.moreover,none our sister circuits appears to have answered it directly we here construe e to place no temporal limit on a district court authority to extend the time for retrial up to days.accordingly,we conclude that e extensions may be granted even after the initially specified day period for retrial has passed,provided that the requisite impracticality finding is based on factors arising before or within that initial period.
statutory analysis necessarily begins with the plain meaning of a law text and,absent ambiguity,will generally end there.cruz miguel holder,cir internal quotation marks omitted see robinson shell oil.the language of e plainly authorizes district courts to extend the time for retrial to as much as days in specified circumstances.no language in e,however,states when a district court may grant such extensions or when it must make the necessary supporting findings.nor does any statutory language state that the district court extension authority is limited to the initial day period for retrial.
shellef nevertheless urges us to infer such a limitation from congress use of the future tense in the statutory phrase specifying the circumstances warranting extension if unavailability of witnesses or other factors resulting from passage of time shall make trial within seventy days impractical.e emphasis added.as we understand shellef argument,a court can only find that factors shall make trial within days impractical if it makes the finding before expiration of the days.any finding after days would require a different verb tense a court would then have to find that the specified factors made or have made trial within the initial days impractical.shellef submits that congress failure to use these alternative tenses indicates its intent to cabin the exercise of district courts e extension discretion to the initial day period.we are not persuaded.
while shall make is language that looks to the future rather than the past,the verb subject is not the district court but factors resulting from passage of time.in this context,congress use of the future tense is properly understood to signal that it is not necessary to wait a full days before granting an extension of retrial,until there can be no doubt that factors made or have made retrial within that period impractical.rather,extension may be granted as soon as it is evident that factors shall make trial within seventy days impractical.e.we do not understand a verb choice that permits a district court to grant an extension based on reasonable future certainty to foreclose it from doing so based on past actuality.indeed,in any number of circumstances,the reason a court can conclude early into the initial retrial period that certain factors shall make retrial within days impractical is that the factors already have made it so.in short,use of the future tense for specified factors to render retrial within days impractical indicates that the factors themselves must arise before or within the day period,and not thereafter.but it says nothing about when a district court must find such circumstances.
had congress intended to place such a temporal limitation on the exercise of district court extension authority,one would expect it to have done so not through a tense choice for the verb applicable to factors that can demonstrate impracticality,but through a qualifier on the verb authorizing judicial action,as for example,except that the court retrying the case may,within the initial period for retrial,extend the period for retrial not to exceed one hundred eighty days.see generally a c a temporary restraining order issued under this section shall expire at such time,not to exceed days from issuance,as the court directs the court,for good cause shown before expiration of such order,may extend the expiration date of the order for up to days or for such longer period agreed to by the adverse party.c the district court may,upon motion filed not later than days after the expiration of the time otherwise set for bringing appeal,extend the time for appeal upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause.fed.a the district court may reopen the time to file an appeal for a period of days after the date when its order to reopen is entered.in the absence of any such language temporally limiting the exercise of judicial discretion,we identify no statutory basis for holding that a court may identify the factors resulting from passage of time that shall make trial within seventy days impractical only within the initial day period.e see united states ginyard,d.
shellef maintains that,even if the text of e does not plainly support a temporal limitation on judicial authority to grant extensions of retrial,we should preclude retrospective findings of impracticality to safeguard against the risk,noted in united states tunnesson,cir,that district courts will simply rationalize their action s long after the fact,in order to cure an unwitting violation of the act,id.at.this argument is unpersuasive for several reasons.
first,it rests on the unfounded assumption that district courts will act in bad faith in making impracticality findings after the initial day period.our precedent is to the contrary.we assume that district court judges apply the law faithfully,and we refuse to interpret rules and statutes based on a contrary assumption.transportes navieros y terrestres de fairmount heavy transp,cir see united states ginyard,d at identifying no meaningful reason to distinguish between a finding on the day of the speedy trial clock that trial is impractical and the same finding made on the day.
second,when we noted a rationalization concern in tunnesson,a case holding that continuances in the interests of justice pursuant to h could be granted only prospectively,we did so in dictum,having already concluded that the statutory text and legislative history of h plainly expressed congress intent for such grants to be only prospective.see united states tunnesson,at citing,at.indeed,the language used to signal this intent specifically limits courts authority to act other than prospectively.it states that no period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by the court in accordance with this paragraph shall be excludable under this subsection unless the court sets forth,in the record of the case,either orally or in writing,its reasons for finding that the ends of justice served by the granting of such continuance outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.h a emphasis added see zedner united states,holding statutory text clear that findings must be made,if only in the judge mind,before granting the continuance united states tunnessen,at observing that while district court need not state precise reasons for its decision at time continuance is granted,prospective statement that time will be excluded based on the ends of justice serves to assure the reviewing court that the required balancing was done at the outset.section e contains no limiting language comparable to h a phrase unless the court that signals congress intent to limit the exercise of judicial extension discretion.as already noted,the phrase factors resulting from passage of time shall make trial within seventy days impractical,e,indicates only that the factors must arise within the day period,not that the court must make its findings within that period.nor has shellef pointed us to any support for his urged construction in the legislative history for e.
third,a further reason not to transfer any concern with post hoc rationalizations for h continuances to e extensions is an important distinction between the two provisions.the speedy trial act itself places no time limit on h continuances by contrast,it caps e extensions at days.thus,the possibility that post hoc rationalizations could excuse,or month or longer periods of pretrial delay pursuant to h simply does not arise with respect to e extensions.any delay beyond the day limit of e can be justified only by reference to the precisely defined automatic exclusions of h,or by procurement of a prospective exclusion pursuant to h.united states tunnessen,at.further,h continuances depend upon a balancing of myriad factors,whereas e extensions turn on the answer to a single question do specified factors arising before or within days of the mandate render retrial during that period impractical while the latter determination requires an exercise of judgment,because it is more narrowly focused,there is less risk that an answer given on the st day or even the st day will differ from an answer given on the day.see united states ginyard,d at.
thus,we conclude that neither the statutory text nor unwarranted concerns about the conduct of district courts support construing e to limit the exercise of a district court extension discretion under that provision to the initial day period for retrial.what the statute requires is that the statutorily specified factors supporting extension arise within the day period and make trial within that period impractical.accordingly,shellef argument that judge bianco was precluded by e from extending the time for his retrial to days after passage of the initially prescribed day period fails on the merits.
that being said,no one is well served by delaying e determinations until long after the initial day period for retrial has passed.the parties and the court have a strong interest in knowing sooner rather than later whether speedy trial calculations are controlled by a day limit or some longer period up to days.thus,where factors make it impractical to retry a case within the originally prescribed day period,the best practice is for district courts to make that finding and to grant any appropriate extension within,or soon after,the initial day period for retrial.see generally zedner united states,at observing,with respect to continuances in interests of justice,that although speedy trial act is ambiguous as to when district court must put supporting findings on record,best practice is for court to do so at or near the time when it grants the continuance.
b.the district court grant of a e extension was supported by factors resulting from the passage of time 
shellef argues that even if judge bianco was authorized to extend the time for retrial after the initial day retrial period had passed,the judge erred in relying on factors that did not result from the passage of time to support the conclusion that trial within days was impractical.e.we identify no such error.
the speedy trial act does not itself provide standards for determining when a factor results from the passage of time or even when such a factor renders trial impractical.this suggests that congress intended to afford experienced trial judges considerable discretion in making such determinations.consistent with this view,our sister circuits,when confronted with challenges to whether factors supporting a e extension resulted from the passage of time,have been inclined to conduct review rather than to make categorical pronouncements.thus,in united states holley,the fifth circuit upheld a e extension based on factors resulting from passage of time that limited the availability of a judge to retry the case within the initial day period.see at noting that district judge to whom case was assigned was in midst of trial at time of remand,resident judge in courthouse where case was to have been tried had recused himself,and district was short four of ten authorized judgeships.the eleventh circuit concluded in united states goetz that the government need to investigate defendant further tax violations since the original indictment was a factor supporting a e extension.see at.in unpublished decisions,the fourth circuit identified as factors resulting from the passage of time making trial within days impractical counsel need to review extensive materials from the first trial of a complex case,both defense counsels scheduling conflicts,and the government need to locate witnesses who had been released from custody since the first trial,see united states aboh,wl,at cir,unpublished while the ninth circuit cited the unavailability of the original prosecutor,the unknown whereabouts of the original case agent and confidential informant,and missing case files,as factors resulting from the passage of time that made retrial within days impractical,see united states hernandez urena,wl,at cir,unpublished.
at the same time,the ninth circuit,in dictum,indicated that routine scheduling conflicts and plea negotiations can not,by themselves,be viewed as factors resulting from the passage of time making retrial within days impractical.see united states pitner,cir.and the tenth circuit,in united states scalf,cir,ruled that e does not apply so broadly as to warrant treating time spent by the government deciding whether to petition for a writ of certiorari from the original remand decision as a factor resulting from the passage of time that makes speedy trial impractical,see id.at.
we need not and,in the absence of full record review of each case,could not here decide whether we agree with each of these rulings.like our sister circuits,however,we can conclude that identifying factors resulting from the passage of time and determining whether they render trial within days impractical is generally a inquiry,on which,to the extent it turns on findings of fact,we will defer to the district court absent clear error.
here,judge bianco found that retrial within days of remand was impractical for several reasons,including the original complexity of the case had been aggravated on remand by the need to sever charges and defendants into three separate trials following remand,but before expiration of the initial day period for retrial,an intervening supreme court decision,see cuellar united states,altered proof requirements with respect to money laundering charges against shellef and the case had been twice reassigned to different judges on remand,requiring each to become familiar with the record from the previous trial and the legal issues involved.
shellef argues that,even if there is factual support in the record for these factors,the district court erred as a matter of law in concluding that they were attributable to the passage of time.he submits that the factors were attributable to court rulings or local rules,which do not derive from the passage of time as required to support a e extension.this construes e requirement too narrowly.
to begin,the requirement must be viewed in the context of e as a whole.see robinson shell oil,at.section e manifests congress intent to afford more,rather than less,flexibility in the time afforded to retry a case.see united states holley,at section e gives the trial court greater flexibility in setting cases for trial following appeal than is provided in the initial cases.thus,at the same time that e states that all periods of delay enumerated in section h for exclusion in computing time limitations for trial shall also be excluded in computing the time limitations specified for retrial,the provision affords district courts added discretion with respect to retrials that does not pertain to initial trial the ability to extend the period of unexcluded time for retrial from to days if unavailability of witnesses or other factors resulting from passage of time shall make trial within seventy days impractical.e.to be sure,the qualifying language indicates that judicial extension authority is not unbounded.moreover,congress use of the word resulting in the qualifying passage signals the need for a causal link between the factor identified and the passage of time.we do not,however,understand congress to be requiring but for causation.rather,the statutory nexus requirement is satisfied if a factor rendering retrial within days impractical results from a change in circumstances occurring some time between conclusion of the original trial and expiration of the initial day retrial period 
here,each of the three factors relied on by judge bianco reflects changes in circumstances between the original trial and the expiration of the day retrial period that specifically related to the practicality of retrying shellef within days of remand.in urging otherwise,shellef particularly challenges judge bianco reliance on the complexity of the case on remand.he submits that once a complex case has been tried,a remand order for retrial presents no reason for an extension of time from to days.assuming that such a conclusion is warranted in some cases,it is not warranted here.the shellef i remand order did not simply direct the government to retry its original complex case rather,it required the government to deconstruct that complex case and reassemble it into three distinct trial presentations.no one suggests that,in these circumstances,it would have been practical to try all three cases within days of our mandate.nor do we identify any error in the district court determination that it would have been impractical to try even shellef case within that time.in addition to having to restructure its original case into new trial presentations,the government confronted a new legal challenge the disputed question of whether another grand jury presentation was required before any trial could be pursued.the district court correctly recognized that these circumstances injected new complexities into the case that arose only after the original trial.as such,they reasonably qualify as factors resulting from passage of time,and thus properly informed the district court impracticality determination and supported its grant of an extension of time beyond the prescribed days.furthermore,that added complexity resulting from the passage of time might also support a continuance under h does not compel a narrower construction of e given congress intent to afford more flexibility on retrial than on the initial trial.we leave it in the first instance to the good sense of district judges to ensure that factors that might support both a e extension and a continuance under h do not result in duplicative exclusions of time from speedy trial calculations.
insofar as cuellar united states,at,altered the government burden of proof on the money laundering charges pending against shellef,the district court was entitled to view that decision,issued on the day following the mandate,as another new factor resulting from the passage of time that made it impractical to commence trial without affording the parties and the court some additional time to familiarize themselves with the ruling and its effect on retrial 
finally,the district court correctly recognized that reassignments of this case after issuance of the mandate,first pursuant to local rule and thereafter by order of this court,to two different judges made it impractical to retry the case without affording each judge some additional time to familiarize himself with the complex factual scenario and the various legal questions that could arise.
shellef suggests that,even if these factors support some e extension,they do not support an extension to days,the maximum allowed by law.this is a curious argument to advance on a record that so strongly indicates that shellef himself would not have been able to proceed to trial within any shorter time given his professed dissatisfaction with counsel of record and his delay in securing new counsel.no matter.in the absence of legal error in the recognition of factors warranting a e extension,we will not readily a district judge assessment of the proper duration of the extension that should be granted.given the record support for judge bianco identification of at least three factors supporting extension,we identify no abuse of discretion in his determination that,together,these factors warranted an extension of the time for retrial to days.
shellef was tried within unexcluded days of this court mandate 
shellef submits that various errors in the district court calculation of excludable time infect its conclusion that his retrial commenced within the extended day period.specifically,he contends that judge bianco erred in deeming automatically excluded pursuant to h d the days from june,through july,when shellef first speedy trial motion was pending before judge platt,as well as the preceding days,from may,through june,when the government motion to set trial dates was pending.he further challenges judge platt conclusion that his april,actions satisfied the requirements of h a,b ii for granting a continuance in the interests of justice based on the complexity of the case.we need only explain why we reject the first two arguments to affirm the challenged judgment.
shellef speedy trial motion 
the speedy trial act states that certain periods of delay shall be excluded in computing the time within which trial or retrial must be commenced.h.among these automatic exclusions is any period of delay resulting from any pretrial motion,from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on,or other prompt disposition of,such motion.h d see id.e specifying that h periods of delay apply in computing time limitations for retrial.despite the text employment of language that is both mandatory shall be excluded and expansive any pretrial motion shellef maintains that h d does not apply to motions seeking dismissal based on a violation of the speedy trial act.in support,he cites united states new buffalo amusement.cir,a case arising under an interim court plan for speedy trial that,by reference,adopted the automatic exclusions of the speedy trial act,see dist,plan for prompt disposition of criminal cases in that context,new buffalo concluded,without reference to the express language of either the plan in question or the speedy trial act,that d elay occasioned by the pendency sub judice of appellants speedy trial motion is not chargeable against appellants because to do so would improperly penalize defendants for their invocation of speedy trial rules and run counter to the purposes of those rules.united states new buffalo amusement,at quoting united states didier,cir.
as shellef acknowledges,in united states bolden,cir,a subsequent case construing the speedy trial act itself,this court specifically rejected the argument that a motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds should be treated differently from other pretrial motions for purposes of applying the act automatic exclusion for pretrial motion delay,id.at.bolden concluded that such an exception would run against the statutory language,which establishes a period of excludable time for any pretrial motion.id.at emphasis in original.although bolden did not reference new buffalo,it effectively rejected its premise,that it was anomalous to have a speedy trial motion delay the time when a trial must commence,as a basis for departing from the plain language of the speedy trial act pretrial motion exclusion.id.bolden explained 
calculations under the act are not necessarily related to the actual commencement of the trial,but only to the final date by which the trial must commence moreover,the delay resulting from a speedy trial motion is no different from that resulting from any other pretrial motion.finally,by establishing in the speedy trial act automatically excludable periods for pretrial motions,congress assured reasonable opportunities to the government for response,as well as to the court for serious consideration of every claim that a defendant might assert by motion.an opportunity to be heard and due deliberation are as necessary for a speedy trial motion as for any other motion.
with no discussion,shellef conclusively asserts that bolden was wrongly decided.we disagree.bolden holding is dictated by the plain language of the speedy trial act,which mandates the automatic exclusion without limitation of delay resulting from any pretrial motion.h d emphasis added see connecticut bank germain,when the words of a statute are unambiguous judicial inquiry is complete.further,bolden explanation for the application of this exclusion to speedy trial motions is only reinforced by the fact that a defendant who makes a meritorious speedy trial motion will,in fact,suffer no delay in trial attributable to the exclusion because he will secure dismissal.see.such a complaint can be voiced only by a defendant who has made a speedy trial motion.a defendant can hardly be heard to complain when the delay necessary to demonstrate that his speedy trial motion lacked merit is subjected to the same exclusion as every other pretrial motion,including meritorious defense filings.finally,every one of our sister circuits to have considered the question has construed the speedy trial act automatic exclusion for pretrial motion delay to apply to speedy trial motions.indeed,several have done so by citing approvingly to bolden.see united states brown,cir citing bolden united states parker,cir united states tedesco,cir recognizing conflict between new buffalo and bolden and agreeing with bolden united states thompson,cir citing bolden furlow united states,cir united states rogers,cir united states stafford,cir united states wilson,citing bolden,overruled on other grounds by bloate united states.
shellef nevertheless submits that we are here obliged to follow new buffalo rather than bolden because the earlier of two conflicting panel decisions must control until the former is overruled by this court en banc or by the supreme court.see jones coughlin,cir accord shipping of india jaldhi overseas pte,cir noting that panel generally may not reverse an existing circuit precedent.the principle does not apply here because,as we have already observed,new buffalo ruling was pronounced in a case involving a court speedy trial plan.although that plan incorporates,by reference,the speedy trial act automatic exclusion provisions,it does so in language that places more emphasis on the fact that no exclusions beyond those in h will be considered than on the automatic application of such exclusions.compare plan rule exclusion of time from computation in computing any time limit under section,or,only the periods of delay set forth in h shall be excluded.with h the following periods of delay shall be excluded in computing the time within which an information or an indictment must be filed,or in computing the time within which the trial of any such offense must commence.in any event,new buffalo did not purport to construe the speedy trial act itself,much less the specific language here at issue.see at resolving defendants claim that they were denied their rights to a speedy trial under the various speedy trial plans of the western district of new york see also united states mcgrath,cir noting that defendant contentions exclusively involve the period before july,and thus are not at all covered by the speedy trial act.by contrast,bolden did just that,ruling that the plain text of h admitted no exception to the mandated exclusion for delay attributable to any pretrial motion,at.accordingly,bolden,and not new buffalo,controls this appeal.
we therefore reject as without merit shellef argument that no delay attributable to his first speedy trial motion was excludable under h d 
government motion to set trial date 
shellef contends that the government may,motion for the court to set trial dates was not really a pretrial motion for purposes of automatic exclusion under h d,but only a request for the court to perform an obligatory,ministerial task.in support,he cites united states brown,cir,in which the eleventh circuit declined to treat a document labeled motion for determination of speedy trial status trial setting as a motion triggering automatic exclusion under h d.in so holding,brown explained that the purported motion presented no dispute for the court to resolve rather,the motion only reminded the court of the need to set a trial date to comply with the speedy trial act.id.at.
assuming we were to agree with brown reasoning as it might apply to routine scheduling requests,that is not a fair characterization of the government may,submission.that filing can reasonably be construed to seek court resolution of a legal point in dispute between the parties,the need to obtain new indictments before proceeding to retrial.at the april,conference,defendants maintained that new indictments were a necessary prerequisite to retrial,and the district court seemed inclined to agree.in almost four typed pages supporting its request for setting trial dates without any further grand jury presentation,the government argued that neither the ruling in shellef i nor law established in this and other circuits supported the defense position.on this record,the letter is properly construed as more than a routine request for scheduling.it is effectively a motion seeking a legal determination,that the government had the right to proceed to retrial on the original indictment.as such,it was properly deemed to trigger the automatic exclusion for pretrial motions under h d.
the government maintains that its motion was pending until at least october,when it filed another request to set trial dates.we identify no clear error,however,in judge bianco finding that judge platt implicitly denied the government motion on july,when he observed that speedy trial challenges were premature before new indictments were returned accordingly,like the district court,we deem only that period automatically excludable.
speedy trial calculation 
in deciding whether shellef was brought to trial within days of this court march,mandate,we need focus only on the days between the issuance of the shellef i mandate on march,and the november,bail motion because shellef concedes the proper exclusion of all time between november and the december,start of retrial.within the relevant day time frame,we conclude,for the reasons just stated,that days from may,to july,were automatically excluded pursuant to u.h d due to a combination of the pendency of the government may motion to set trial dates and shellef june motion to dismiss the indictment for violation of speedy trial.because shellef does
