the commissioner of internal revenue determined deficiencies in sheldon and phyllis milenbach federal income taxes for the years through.the commissioner also issued notices of final partnership administrative adjustments determining adjustments to the income of the los angeles raiders,a california limited partnership,for the years through.petitioners collectively the raiders appeal from the tax court decisions affirming the contested determinations.see milenbach comm r,wl.
the raiders own a professional football team and belong to the national football league the nfl.prior to,the raiders played their home games at the county coliseum the oakland coliseum.the raiders lease of the oakland coliseum expired at the end of the nfl season.during,the raiders negotiated with the los angeles memorial coliseum commission the lamcc to allow the raiders to begin playing their home games in the los angeles memorial coliseum the la coliseum.in,the raiders announced that they intended to leave oakland and play their home games at the la coliseum.this announcement set in motion a series of events that resulted in enormous controversy for the team,including several lawsuits,and a number of business transactions whose tax consequences are at issue here.specifically,the raiders challenge the tax court decisions regarding three discrete transactions related to the raiders relocation of their team.we analyze each in turn.
i.the lamcc payments 
background 
on march,the raiders entered into a memorandum of agreement moa with the lamcc providing for the relocation of the raiders to los angeles beginning with the nfl season.the parties never implemented this moa,however,because the city of oakland oakland filed an action in eminent domain against the raiders,seeking to condemn for public use the raiders nfl franchise,business,and physical assets.both oakland and the nfl obtained preliminary injunctions preventing the raiders from relocating.
as a result,the raiders played their and home games at the oakland coliseum.when the nfl injunction was lifted in,the raiders resumed negotiations with the lamcc.on july,these negotiations produced a new memorandum of agreement the moa.pursuant to the moa,in,the parties executed a promissory note the note and a lease agreement for the la coliseum the lease.
the moa,the note,and the lease collectively,the lamcc agreement provided that the lamcc would loan the raiders million at percent interest.the raiders were to repay the loan from percent of the net receipts from the operation of luxury suites to be constructed by the raiders at the la coliseum.the repayment was to begin in the third year of suite rentals.the loan was secured by the to suites,with no recourse to the raiders.the loan consisted of a million cash payment to the raiders in and credits totaling million against rent due from the raiders for the years through.
as to the construction of the suites,the moa provided that the raiders shall construct approximately private suites.the moa went on to state that the construction shall commence as soon as practicable as determined by the raiders in their reasonable discretion,having in mind pending and potential litigation involving the parties hereto,or either of them,financial considerations,and other considerations reasonably deemed important or significant to the raiders.the lease further provided that the raiders shall use their best efforts to begin and complete suite construction as soon as possible.the lamcc agreement was the result of arm length bargaining between the raiders and the lamcc.
the raiders began playing their home games at the la coliseum starting with the season.plans to construct the suites prior to the summer olympics were abandoned after the los angeles olympic committee voiced concerns over the timing of the construction.the raiders worked with architects and contractors on the planning of the suites throughout and.
actual construction began in early,but was halted on february of that year.on that date,the lamcc demanded that suite construction stop because the raiders had not obtained necessary performance bonds.the raiders responded that they were willing and able to provide the required bonds,but stated that construction would cease because of the lamcc failure to make certain improvements to the la coliseum.due to this dispute,construction never resumed and the suites were never completed.
the raiders never made any payments on the lamcc loan.in september,the lamcc filed a lawsuit claiming that the raiders had breached the lease by failing to construct the suites as soon as practicable and for failing to repay the million loan.in january,the raiders answered the lamcc complaint,alleging that the lamcc had breached a commitment to modernize and reconfigure the stadium.the lawsuit was settled on september.
in a notice of deficiency for and fpaas for through,the commissioner disallowed the raiders rent deductions because the rent was not currently payable and was part of the loan from the lamcc.in the alternative,if the rent deductions were allowed,the commissioner determined that the amount of the rent credits were includable in gross income as advance payment of income.the commissioner also determined that the million advance paid in was includable in the raiders gross income.
the tax court held that the loan payments from the lamcc were includable in the raiders income in the years in which they were received.milenbach,at.it held that the obligation to construct the suites was illusory and,therefore,the lamcc payments did not qualify as loans for tax purposes because the raiders controlled whether or not repayment of the million would be triggered.id.at.
we review decisions of the tax court under the same standards as civil bench trials in the district court.custom chrome,comm r,cir.therefore,conclusions of law are reviewed de novo,and questions of fact are reviewed for clear error.id.this court owes no special deference to the tax court decisions on issues of state law.harbor bancorp subsidiaries comm r,cir.the interpretation and meaning of contract provisions are questions of law reviewed de novo.kassbaum steppenwolf,cir.
a loan is generally not taxable income because the receipt of the loan is offset by the obligation to repay the loan.comm r tufts,d.for this rule to apply,however,the loan must be an existing,unconditional,and legally enforceable obligation for the payment of a principal sum.noguchi comm r,cir see also geftman comm r,cir requiring an unconditional obligation on the part of the transferee to repay the money,and an unconditional intention on the part of the transferor to secure repayment citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
whether a transaction is a loan for federal income tax purposes is ultimately a question of federal law.see helvering stuart.once rights are obtained by local law,whatever they may be called,these rights are subject to the federal definition of taxability.initially,however,state law determines the rights and obligations of the parties to a transaction.see id.at.but once an obligation is created by local law,it is subject to the federal definition of taxability.id.here,the dispositive question is whether the lamcc agreement was sufficient,under california law,to subject the raiders to a and enforceable obligation to repay the lamcc advances.if the raiders were subject to an existing,unconditional,and legally enforceable obligation to repay the lamcc advances,the advances are properly treated as loans for federal income tax purposes.noguchi,at.
contrary to the tax court conclusion,the raiders broad discretion in the timing of the construction of the suites did not make the contract illusory.under california law,an obligation under a contract is not illusory if the obligated party discretion must be exercised with reasonableness or good faith.see storek storek,citicorp real estate,th,d,holding that a promise to pay only if satisfied is not illusory if the ability to claim dissatisfaction is limited by the standard of reasonableness hour fitness,superior court,th,d,w here the contract specifies performance the fact that one party reserves the power to vary it is not fatal if the exercise of the power is subject to prescribed or implied limitations such as the duty to exercise it in good faith and in accordance with fair dealings.citation and internal quotation marks omitted frankel bd.of dental exam rs,th,d,holding that a contract is not illusory when the power to withdraw from the contract must be exercised in good faith.
here,the raiders were required to exercise their discretion reasonably and nothing in the lamcc agreement indicates that construction of the suites was optional.both the moa and the lease state that the suites shall be constructed and both require the raiders to use their reasonable discretion in deciding the exact timing in the construction of the suites.the lease also required the raiders to use their best efforts both to construct the suites as soon as possible and to operate them in such a way as to maximize the profits to be derived from them.at no point were the raiders free to ignore their obligation to construct the suites.they could only delay the construction for a reasonable time and were required to use their best efforts to complete the suites and begin repayment of the loan.these limitations on the raiders discretion were sufficient to create a obligation both to construct the suites and to repay the loan that would have been enforceable under california law.the fact that the obligations were later extinguished by the settlement of the lawsuit does not indicate that the obligation was illusory at the time the contract was made.accordingly,we conclude that the tax court erred in holding that the lamcc agreement was illusory.
because the raiders had a,unconditional obligation to repay the lamcc loan,the payments were properly treated as loans and were excludable from income in the year in which they were received 
ii.the oakland settlement 
background 
the eminent domain suit filed by oakland in was ultimately decided in favor of the raiders.after it was decided that oakland could not lawfully seize the raiders franchise,the raiders sought damages arising from oakland condemnation action by filing a notice of claim for damages in that proceeding.the raiders sought recovery under the california and united states constitutions,the common law,and california code of civil procedure.section allows the recovery of all damages proximately caused by a failed eminent domain action.b.the raiders claimed that oakland had denied the raiders the free and untrammeled possession and use of the team.the raiders claimed that they suffered damages from oakland failed condemnation action in the following ways they were compelled to maintain a summer training camp in santa rosa,california they were compelled to lease the oakland coliseum they were prevented from constructing the luxury suites in the la coliseum,and were thereby deprived of income from the sale and rental of those suites they suffered reduced attendance for home games played in the la coliseum they were deprived of income from radio contracts and they were forced to pay extra expenses for the relocation of personnel.
oakland objected to the claim for damages on procedural grounds.to avoid these procedural objections,the raiders,at the suggestion of the superior court,filed a complaint of inverse condemnation against oakland for damages arising out of the eminent domain action.the raiders reiterated their claim for damages,and stated that they had suffered damages in excess of million.the superior court consolidated the two actions.
during discovery in the consolidated actions,the raiders proffered a study detailing approximately million in damages they claimed had been caused by oakland eminent domain action.over million of the damages claimed were attributed to lost income from suite rentals.three million dollars were attributed to lost income from a contract with the los angeles olympic committee for use of the luxury suites,which the raiders were prevented from constructing.the raiders also claimed damages resulting from relocation and per diem expenses,lost radio income,lost attendance income,and lost food and beverage income.
in november,the raiders and oakland settled the lawsuit.oakland agreed to pay the raiders million in four yearly installments of million plus interest.the settlement agreement stated that it was entered into for the purpose of settling disputed claims involving the restoration of lost franchise value.
for each of the tax years and,the commissioner determined that settlement proceeds of million less attorney fees received by the raiders constituted taxable income.the tax court found that the oakland settlement represented recovery of lost profits and,therefore,constituted taxable income.milenbach,at.
the raiders argue that no portion of the settlement represented recovery of lost profits.they assert that the settlement represented recovery of lost value to the franchise and therefore should be treated as return of capital.the raiders claim that they never sought to recover lost profits in their action against oakland,only the lost value of their franchise.they argue that their claim for damages can only be read as seeking recovery for lost franchise value because they based their claim on oakland denial of the free use and enjoyment of their franchise.the raiders also point to the fact that the settlement agreement with oakland provided that the payment compensated the raiders for lost franchise value.
the nature of a settlement payment is a question of fact reviewed for clear error.see langer comm r,cir per curiam wolfson comm r,cir spangler comm r,cir pac.magnesium westover,cir per curiam.when a claim is resolved by settlement,the relevant question for determining the tax treatment of a settlement award is in lieu of what were the damages awarded getty comm r,cir raytheon prod.comm r,cir.we take a broad approach in determining the true nature and basis of a party claim.getty,at.if the payments are in lieu of lost profits,then they are taxable income.shakertown comm r,cir raytheon,at.if,however,the payments are for loss of franchise value due to damage to goodwill,then the payments are nontaxable return of capital.raytheon,at.the taxpayer bears the burden of establishing that proceeds of a settlement are what the taxpayer contends them to be.getty,at.
the tax court did not clearly err in finding that some portion of the oakland settlement represented recovery for lost profits.the raiders list of damages included several items that consisted entirely of lost profit.nothing in the language of the claim for damages or the inverse condemnation complaint suggests that the raiders intended to limit their recovery to the reduction in value of their franchise caused by loss of goodwill.in addition,almost every item listed in the damages report would have been taxable had it been received by the raiders.any settlement amount meant to replace this lost income would have been in lieu of taxable income and would itself be taxable.getty,at.
the raiders argue that it is inherent in the nature of an inverse condemnation action that their potential recovery is limited to the damage done to the value of their franchise,and that the lost income was mentioned only as a measure of that damage.we need not decide whether an award in an inverse condemnation action represents recovery only for damage to the property,however,because the raiders attempts to recover damages were not limited to an inverse condemnation action.
the raiders also sought recovery under california code of civil procedure section.although the raiders later filed an inverse condemnation action,the claim for damages under section was not dismissed prior to the settlement.section allows the property owner in an unsuccessful eminent domain action to recover all damages proximately caused by the proceeding and its dismissal as to that property.b.in community development commission shuffler,d,the california court of appeal noted how broadly worded the provision was and stated that the statute allowed recovery of all damages caused by the eminent domain proceeding.the shuffler court went on to note that this statute did not limit any
