defendant raymond young young,who has been convicted of counts of conspiring to impede and impair the irs in the computation and collection of diesel motor fuel excise taxes,subscribing to false quarterly excise tax returns,making false statements to an irs agent and using false documents in connection with the review by an irs agent of a tax free certificate,raises eight challenges to his conviction and subsequent sentencing.included among his various challenges,young contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained by the irs when it conducted a warrantless search of federal express packages addressed to him.we affirm young conviction and sentence in all respects,and specifically find that,when young and his elected to ship the proceeds of their tax fraud scheme through federal express despite explicit warnings on the airbill and envelopes that sending cash was illegal,and federal express retained the right to inspect any package for any reason,defendants had no legitimate expectation of privacy in the contents of the packages.
irs regulations regarding federal excise taxes deem the sale of gasoline and diesel fuel for use to be taxable.sales of these fuels for and marine use are not taxable.businesses that are eligible to buy fuel,such as marinas,wholesale distributors and refineries,must first obtain a certificate from the irs.
in april,young applied for a certificate and indicated on his application that his business,dry tortugas marina dtm,was a marine retailer headquartered in marco island,florida,that would engage in the business of buying and selling fuel.young also stated to an irs agent around this time that he owned an oceangoing vessel that he would use to fuel fishing boats on the high seas.the irs granted dtm a certificate in september.as it turned out,young never planned on using his vessel for the stated purpose.indeed,four months prior to obtaining his certificate,young sold the vessel.
young proceeded to use the certificate to purchase fuel from wholesalers,and resold the in various retailers such as truck stops,grocery stores and service stations and trucking companies.as these sales were all for uses,all were taxable pursuant to irs regulations.not surprisingly,dtm did not provide invoices to its cash sale customers,and all records regarding these sales were destroyed.on dtm form businesses selling fuel are required to submit claimed that dtm owed no federal excise taxes for fuel purchases and sales.
as young scheme involved large and frequent cash transactions,dtm employees in texas would send the cash proceeds to young in florida via federal express two to three times per month.in late,irs agent ruka was alerted to these large cash shipments and began a preliminary investigation to determine if enough information existed to conduct a criminal investigation.suspecting a scheme to launder narcotics proceeds through the sale of diesel fuel,agent ruka brought in irs agent sutherland,who had expertise in this line of business.agent sutherland immediately noticed that dtm was due for its review of its certificate,and began a civil investigation in that regard.in preparation for the review,young employed a customs house broker to prepare invoices and bills of lading for all of the cash sales.dtm employees also contacted its various fuel customers and induced them to sign certificates falsely stating that they were using fuel for tax exempt purposes.
it was during his first review meeting with agent sutherland,on april,that young made overtures to sutherland to lead the agent to believe he was being offered a bribe.as a result,irs inspections service a branch of the irs that conducts internal affairs investigations asked sutherland to wear a wire during the subsequent meeting between the two,on may,which he agreed to do.during the second meeting,young presented sutherland with the invoices,which the agent immediately found to be suspicious as all appeared to be identical despite the fact that they spanned transactions over a period.at the third and final meeting between young and agent sutherland,sutherland informed young that the irs was revoking his registration until his marine fueling business was in operation.
in the meantime,agent ruka continued his investigation of young.as part of this investigation,agent ruka contacted federal express operations manager joseph oldock and asked if federal express would permit irs agents and customs to view packages bearing young and ahmed names.after contacting his local safety and legal departments,oldock agreed to cooperate with the irs.without a search warrant,federal express turned over,and the irs,several of the packages.fourteen packages were by the irs and found to contain large amounts of currency.these results were then used to obtain four search warrants in florida and louisiana,which were used to open two of the packages and to search young place of residence and business in marco island.
during the trial,thomas roettele and mohammed ahmed moved to suppress evidence obtained when the irs intercepted and the federal express packages.the district court denied the motion,finding that the defendants could not have a reasonable expectation of privacy concerning the contents of the packages.recognizing that a container,such as a federal express package,may not normally be searched without a warrant,the court nevertheless held that warnings on federal express packaging that shipping cash was prohibited,together with a notice on the airbill that the company retained the right to inspect packages,rendered unreasonable any expectation of privacy defendants had in the packages.although young raises various issues on appeal,we believe that the denial of this motion to suppress is the only issue that merits discussion.
though defendants ahmed and roettele moved the district court to suppress evidence on the grounds that the search of the federal express packages by irs agents violated their fourth amendment rights,young never asserted this theory in his own motion to suppress.accordingly,we review the district court ruling for plain error.united states sentovich,cir.
the district court found compelling the testimony of federal express employee joseph oldock,in which he explained that the federal express airbill,which was utilized by defendants in shipping each of the fourteen packages,identified in its terms and conditions on the reverse that federal express may open and inspect packages at any time.the court determined that this notice,in conjunction with the warning on the federal express envelopes which read,do not send cash,diminished any reasonable expectation of privacy defendants had in the packages.young now challenges the district court conclusion,and submits that the seizure and subsequent search of the packages violated his rights under the fourth amendment.
the district court relied heavily on united states barry in reaching its decision.cir.in barry,defendant sought to suppress contraband observed by federal express employees in a damaged package turned over to the dea.id.at.the package,which contained a large quantity of prescription pills with the pharmaceutical numbers effaced,was damaged en route,exposing the contraband inside.id.federal express employees searched the package and then contacted the dea,whose agents proceeded to examine its contents without first obtaining a warrant.id.at.the court determined that defendant privacy interest depended on two factors the risk of exposure and the incriminating appearance of the contraband.id.at.with respect to the first factor,the court found that barry should have considered the risk of exposure when he shipped the package with federal is,the possibility that federal express would open the package for security reasons,an accident or choosing to accept this risk reduced his subjective expectation of privacy in the parcel he consigned.id.as to the second factor,the court noted that the incriminating nature of the materials shipped was a factor within barry control,and thus he could have taken greater precautions to disguise the shipment,but instead shipped a large amount of pills
