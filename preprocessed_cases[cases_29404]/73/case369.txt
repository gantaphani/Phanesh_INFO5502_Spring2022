appellant,charles william mchan,participated in the illegal purchase and sale of marijuana from through.he failed to report the income from his illegal activities on his federal income tax returns.this gave rise to two separate proceedings against mchan a criminal prosecution,which included a criminal forfeiture count,and a civil tax collection pursued by the internal revenue service irs.although this appeal arises only from the latter,a discussion of the criminal prosecution is necessary to its analysis.
mchan was indicted in by a federal grand jury on several counts,including a criminal forfeiture count pursuant to,which provides that individuals convicted of certain drug offenses forfeit to the united states any proceeds obtained as a result of such offense.mchan was convicted on all counts.
after a separate hearing on the criminal forfeiture count,the district court entered a forfeiture judgment of against mchan.to calculate this amount,the district court first determined the total proceeds from mchan marijuana sales and then deducted costs and a portion of the proceeds attributed to a partner.on appeal,we rejected the district court calculation of the forfeiture amount and vacated the sentence.united states mchan,cir.we held that the term proceeds in the forfeiture statute did not refer to net profit,as the district court reasoned,but instead referred to gross proceeds.id 
at roughly the same time federal prosecutors were building the criminal case against mchan,the irs began investigating mchan for tax evasion.in,the irs issued mchan a notice of deficiency.in it,the irs determined that mchan and his wife had understated their income in joint federal income tax returns filed in and the mchans returns,which were prepared by a tax professional,reported adjusted gross income of in,in,and a loss of in.those figures did not,however,include profits from mchan drug transactions.nor did the mchans provide any documentation regarding such transactions to their tax return preparer.in issuing mchan notice of deficiency,the irs reconstructed mchan income,calculating that mchan realized unreported profits on marijuana transactions of in,in,and in 
mchan timely challenged the notice of deficiency and the matter came before the tax court.mchan moved for summary judgment arguing,inter alia,that the earlier criminal forfeiture judgment had already established the amount of his illegal profits and that the irs was collaterally estopped from litigating the amount a second time.the tax court rejected that argument,holding that collateral estoppel did not apply because the burden of proof was different in the two proceedings.mchan comm r,wl,at.
in may the case was assigned to a special trial judge,who conducted a trial.see.according to mchan,the irs did not put on evidence that was materially different than that presented in the criminal forfeiture case.appellant br.at that evidence included the grand jury testimony of paul leroy cunningham,who had been a witness in mchan criminal prosecution.because cunningham had died shortly after his grand jury testimony,his testimony was read into the record in mchan criminal trial.
the special trial judge filed his recommendations with the tax court on july.mchan objected to the findings and moved for a new trial,arguing that the irs waited until the third day of the trial to disclose the calculations underlying the notice of deficiency.he also argued that the irs improperly disclosed grand jury materials in violation of federal rule of criminal procedure e.
in april,the tax court issued a memorandum opinion.see mchan comm r,memo,wl.the tax court found that the irs presented substantial evidence of the transactions at issue and that the irs deficiency calculations were entitled to the usual presumption of correctness that applies when the taxpayer fails to maintain adequate records.see cebollero comm r,cir.nevertheless,in response to mchan objections to the special trial judge recommended findings,the tax court did make several adjustments that were favorable to mchan.first,some in gross profit from a transaction was subtracted from that year income based on the irs concession that the disputed transaction did not occur.second,the tax court allowed losses of and in years and,respectively,from unprofitable marijuana transactions in florida.those losses had previously been omitted from the irs calculations.third,the tax court rejected the irs claim of an additional transaction in that was not included in the original notice of deficiency,concluding that the irs had presented insufficient evidence of that transaction.fourth,the tax court rejected the irs attempt to add back certain other costs as improperly deducted.taking account of these adjustments,the tax court determined that the mchans had underreported their income by in and in 
this appeal followed.
we have jurisdiction over appeals from the tax court under.we review decisions of the tax court on the same basis as decisions in civil bench trials in united states district courts.waterman comm r,cir.that is,we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo.id.
mchan makes five arguments on appeal.first,mchan argues that the amount of his illegal income had previously been adjudicated in the criminal forfeiture action and,under the doctrine of collateral estoppel,the tax court was constrained to adopt the findings regarding mchan income in the forfeiture judgment.second,mchan argues that the irs income calculations were not entitled to the usual presumption of correctness because they varied from the findings of the forfeiture judgment.third,mchan argues that the tax court erred in denying him a new trial because the irs failed to disclose the calculations underlying the notice of deficiency until the third day of the trial.fourth,mchan argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the special trial judge who conducted the trial waited over six years before filing his recommendations with the tax court.finally,mchan argues that the tax court erred in admitting grand jury testimony into evidence in violation of federal rule of criminal procedure e.we address each argument in turn.
we first address mchan collateral estoppel argument.mchan argues that the amount of his illegal income had already been adjudicated in the criminal forfeiture action and that,through collateral estoppel,the tax court was constrained to accept those findings.we reject this argument.
the doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes serial litigation of discrete issues of fact in some situations.it is well settled,however,that the doctrine only applies where the identical issue was actually litigated and was critical and necessary to a final and valid judgment resulting from a prior proceeding in which the party against whom the doctrine is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue.collins pond creek mining,cir citation and quotation marks omitted see also bancorporation,comm r,cir.the doctrine does not apply where the party against whom the doctrine is invoked had a heavier burden of persuasion on that issue in the first action than he does in the second,or where his adversary has a heavier burden in the second action than he did in the first.collins,at.nor does the doctrine apply when the party against whom the doctrine is invoked had the burden in the first proceeding,but the party seeking to invoke the doctrine has the burden in the second proceeding.restatement of judgments.
here,it is undisputed that the burdens in the criminal forfeiture proceeding and in the tax court not only were different but also
