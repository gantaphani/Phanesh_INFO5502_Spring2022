in this case,we consider a number of challenges raised by the,james haber,to an administrative summons issued by the internal revenue service irs.the district court laura taylor swain,judge granted the government motion to dismiss haber petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,and denied haber request for jurisdictional discovery.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the decision of the district court.
background 
the irs issued an approximately million penalty against haber and his company,the diversified group incorporated dgi,pursuant to in connection with their alleged failure to register tax shelters in violation of haber and dgi paid and,respectively,toward that assessment,and concurrently filed refund claims with the irs.the irs denied their refund claims and filed a federal tax lien against haber for the unpaid balance of the penalty.in response,haber contested the penalty by requesting a collection due process cdp hearing pursuant to,which has been stayed pending haber ongoing litigation.
haber and dgi then filed suit in the court of federal claims,arguing that the penalty was erroneously assessed,seeking injunctive relief against the irs collection efforts,and requesting a refund of the partial payment.the court dismissed the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because haber and dgi had failed to pay the full penalty before commencing the suit and did not fall into any of the exceptions to the full payment rule.diversified,united states.an appeal of that decision is pending before the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit.diversified,united states.
concurrently with that ongoing litigation,an irs revenue officer began conducting an investigation to locate assets to satisfy the unpaid penalty.according to the revenue officer,her investigation suggest ed that haber may have access to,and use of,a bank account or bank accounts held in the name of jill haber haber wife at signature bank,and that such account or accounts may be held in the name of jill haber to shield them from the irs.she further asserted that assets held by jill haber as the nominee or or transferee of haber may be used to satisfy the penalty liability of haber.the revenue officer confirmed with the irs criminal investigation division that it had closed its investigation of haber and that there were no other pending criminal investigations of haber,and informed haber representative of this information.
the revenue officer then served the administrative summons at issue in this case on signature bank corporation.that summons was captioned i n the matter of james haber,and sought testimony and documents for any and all accounts that jill haber ha d signatory authority for from january,to the date of the summons.no penalties had been assessed against jill haber.the summons stated that the irs sought data relating to the tax liability or the collection of the tax liability or for the purpose of inquiring into any offense connected with the administration or enforcement of the internal revenue laws concerning james haber.
haber petitioned the district court to quash the summons,arguing among other things that the irs was precluded from issuing the summons by an outstanding criminal referral in his case.the government moved to dismiss the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that this summons falls into a category for which the united states has not waived its sovereign immunity,specifically,a summons issued in aid of the collection of an assessment.c d.in a declaration attached to the government motion to dismiss,the revenue officer declared that the summons was to aid in the collection of haber liability for a penalty and that t he irs has already made an assessment against haber for this liability,which currently is approximately.further,the revenue officer attested that t he sole purpose of her investigation is to locate assets to satisfy haber existing assessed federal tax liability,and not to determine additional federal tax liabilities of haber or any other person or entity.
haber sought jurisdictional discovery to establish that the summons did not fall within the exception to the united states waiver of sovereign immunity for proceedings to quash summonses.b,c.haber served the government with a request for production of documents and noticed the deposition of the revenue officer who was conducting the investigation into haber assets and who had served the summons.
in response to haber petition,the government produced three documents regarding the termination of the irs criminal referral of haber to the department of justice doj a supplemental declaration from the revenue officer explaining the steps she took to confirm that there were no pending criminal investigations of haber,a letter from the doj,and a letter from the attorney.the first letter,sent in by the acting assistant attorney general of the tax division of doj to the special agent in charge of the irs criminal investigation division,states that the referral of this matter is terminated as to james haber as to all matters except the form issue,within the meaning of section d of the internal revenue code.the second letter,sent in by the united states attorney for the southern district of new york to haber lawyer,william wachtell,states 
the united states attorney office for the southern district of new york and the internal revenue service new york field office have closed their respective criminal investigations of haber and his companies including the issue in addition,based on my discussions with representatives of the department of justice tax division,there are no other criminal investigations pending with respect to haber.
after providing those documents,the government moved for a protective order with respect to haber discovery requests.
the district court granted the government motions to dismiss haber petition to quash the irs summons for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for a protective order barring jurisdictional discovery.this appeal followed.
discussion 
we agree with the district court that it lacked jurisdiction because the united states has not waived sovereign immunity to allow suits to quash summonses that are issued in aid of the collection of an assessment,c d,and that the challenged summons was issued in aid of collection.moreover,the irs had authority to issue the summons,as there was not an outstanding criminal referral at the time the summons was issued.we also hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying jurisdictional discovery because haber did not meet his burden of showing that the requested discovery is likely to produce the facts needed to establish jurisdiction.
subject matter jurisdiction 
generally a person identified as the target of an irs summons served on a third party,like a bank,is entitled to notice of the summons.the united states has waived its sovereign immunity to allow a person entitled to notice to bring suit against it to quash a summons.id.a,b a.but the right to notice and to bring a proceeding to quash,shall not apply to any summons issued in aid of the collection of an assessment made against the person with respect to whose liability the summons is issued.id.c therefore,if a summons is issued in aid of the collection of a taxpayer liability,the united states has not waived its sovereign immunity.
we review a district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.upton,cir.a plaintiff bears the burden on demonstrating that sovereign immunity has been waived.makarova united states,cir.we conclude that the challenged summons was issued in aid of collection of an assessment.accordingly,the united states has not waived its sovereign immunity,and the district court lacked jurisdiction over the motion to quash.
