this action was brought by the attorney general of canada canada on behalf of the government of canada for damages based on lost tax revenue and additional law enforcement costs.canada alleges that these damages resulted from a scheme facilitated by defendants to avoid various canadian cigarette taxes by smuggling cigarettes across the united states canadian border for sale on the canadian black market.under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,et,canada seeks revenue that it lost from the evasion of tobacco duties and taxes,and from d efendants conduct that compelled canada to rollback duties and taxes,as well as monies spent seeking to stop the smuggling and catch the wrongdoers.
this case involves the construction of rico in light of the common law doctrine known as the revenue rule,a long established feature of the law of the united states and other nations including canada,which holds that the courts of one sovereign will not enforce the tax judgments or claims of another sovereign.rico broadly created a civil treble damages remedy for any person injured in its business or property by reason of a violation of the statute.canada action proceeds on the premise that the taxes it allegedly lost as a result of defendants alleged rico violations fall within rico damages provision.as the relief canada seeks would be foreclosed by the revenue rule in the absence of rico,and as there is no indication that congress intended rico to abrogate the revenue rule with respect to claims brought by foreign sovereigns under the statute,we have no choice but to conclude that rico may not be used by canada to seek recovery of lost tax revenues and tax enforcement costs as rico damages.we therefore affirm.although the judiciary can do no more,we note that canada can seek recourse through the political executive and congress.
background 
unless otherwise noted,the facts that follow are drawn from the complaint and civil rico statement,the latter filed pursuant to local rule of the northern district of new york.on a motion to dismiss,the court must accept as true all of the factual allegations in the complaint,make inferences from those allegations in the light most favorable to plaintiff,and liberally construe the complaint.see,gregory daly,cir.
defendants rjr macdonald,a canadian company,and american companies reynolds tobacco holdings,holdings,northern brands international,nbi,reynolds tobacco company rjr us,reynolds tobacco international,international,and reynolds tobacco company pr rjr pr collectively defendants manufactured and distributed cigarettes during the period relevant to this action.defendant canadian tobacco manufacturers council is a trade association to which belongs.
in,canada doubled its cigarette taxes,raising the average price of a carton of cigarettes from canadian in to canadian in.after this tax increase,sales and market share declined.in order to decrease sales prices and increase consumption,defendants developed a scheme to avoid paying canadian cigarette taxes.they exported cigarettes from canada to the united states,and falsely declared to canadian officials that the cigarettes were not for consumption in canada.defendants then sold the cigarettes to distributors,whom defendants knew were smugglers,who resold the cigarettes to canadian distributors.at least some of the smuggling was conducted by selling the canadian cigarettes to residents of the indian reservation reservation on the new border.the scheme was then refined to take advantage of the foreign trade zones ftzs in upstate new york.defendants exported canadian cigarettes from canada to the ftzs,where they were delivered to distributors who shipped the cigarettes to the reservation.the distributors then smuggled the cigarettes back into canada.
in,canada imposed a tax of canadian on each carton of exported cigarettes.to avoid this tax,defendants shipped raw canadian tobacco to puerto rico,where rjr pr manufactured cigarettes made to look as if they had been made by in canada.these cigarettes were delivered directly or through caribbean intermediaries to ftzs in new york,then brought to the reservation to be smuggled into and sold in canada.in and,rjr pr manufactured approximately one billion cigarettes each year.also employed standard commercial in north carolina to process canadian tobacco and package it as an product.the tobacco was then smuggled into canada for sale on the black market.
in,in an effort to conceal their relationship with smugglers,defendants created nbi and directed their canadian sales through it.defendants canadian sales increased,and defendants made several hundred million dollars in profit.in,canada lowered its cigarette taxes.nbi liquidated its inventory at the ftzs by selling the cigarettes at low prices.defendants continued their smuggling scheme at low levels between and.
in conducting this scheme,defendants used the united states mails and wires to make payments and to place and receive orders.in and,the united states indicted nbi and individuals in connection with these smuggling activities.in,nbi pled guilty to aiding and abetting the introduction of merchandise into the united states by means of false and fraudulent practices.several individuals involved in the scheme pled guilty to crimes such as wire fraud,aiding and abetting smuggling,conspiring to defraud the united states,currency violations,money laundering and criminal rico violations.
in the present action,canada brings claims against defendants under rico civil enforcement provision.rico is a broadly worded statute that has as its purpose the elimination of the infiltration of organized crime and racketeering into legitimate organizations operating in interstate commerce,at see statement of findings and purpose,organized crime control act of,stat.rico provides that a ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a rico violation may bring a civil action to recover treble damages.metromedia fugazy,cir quoting c,cert.denied,d.to establish a rico claim,a plaintiff must show a violation of the rico statute an injury to business or property and that the injury was caused by the violation of rico.de falco bernas,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted,cert.denied.ed d.canada alleges that defendants violated rico by conduct ing or participat ing in the conduct of an enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity,namely repeated instances of mail fraud,and wire fraud,in violation of c.second,canada alleges a conspiracy,in violation of d,to violate subsections a,b and c of section canada explains that these rico violations were the proximate cause of injury to its property because it was deprived of revenue from tobacco duties and taxes and was forced to spend money to stop defendants illegal activity.
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.in a thorough and thoughtful opinion,the district court rejected some of the grounds of defendants motion,finding that canada is a person entitled to bring a rico action and refusing to dismiss the action under the and doctrines.see attorney general of canada rj reynolds tobacco holdings,d.nonetheless,the district court granted the motion to dismiss because it held that canada lost revenue claims were barred by the revenue rule that a government claim for damages based on increased law enforcement and related costs does not satisfy civil rico requirement that the plaintiff suffer an injury to its commercial interests and that rico does not provide for the disgorgement and other equitable relief requested by canada.see id.at.with regard to the revenue rule,the district court explained 
recognizing the existence of the revenue rule only begs the impending the instant civil rico claim commenced by canada is precluded by that rule.
the problem arises when we look back to the standing and recovery requirements of a claim under c and,in particular,the requirement that a civil rico plaintiff allege injury to business or property.
again,to have standing and to recover,canada must allege injury in fact,which ultimately obligates it to prove that some act or acts in furtherance of the scheme caused it to sustain injury.
certain of the types of injuries alleged by canada,namely lost revenues resulting from the evasion of duties and taxes,require it to show that the scheme utilizing the mails and wire communications to defraud it out of tax revenue was successful at least,in part,insofar as it actually evaded canadian tax laws thereby causing canada to lose revenue thus,to pursue its claim for damages relating to lost tax revenue,canada will have to prove,and the court will have to pass on,the validity of the canadian revenue laws and their applicability hereto and the court would be,in essence,enforcing canadian revenue laws.enforcing foreign revenue laws is precisely the type of meddling in foreign affairs the revenue rule forbids.
the fact that the executive branch of the united states government has seen fit to enter into treaties with canada with respect to the recognition and enforcement of certain tax liabilities,to delineate the extent to which one country revenue claims may be enforced in the other,and to limit such enforcement to finally determined revenue claims,strongly suggests that canada rico claim would draw this court inquiry into forbidden waters reserved exclusively to the legislative and executive branches of our government.as long as the revenue rule prevails as evidenced by second circuit precedent and the treaty,this court is precluded from affording the canadian government an alternative mechanism not expressly authorized by the legislative executive branches of branches particularly responsible for establishing and conducting international which it may recoup lost tax revenues in the courts of the united states.
id.at internal citations and footnote omitted.
canada appeals the dismissal,arguing that the revenue rule is inapplicable,that it adequately pled the elements of a civil rico cause of action and is not required to show a commercial injury,and that equitable relief is available,particularly where,as here,the amount of damages may be difficult to prove.defendants oppose the appeal,arguing that the revenue rule precludes an action for the enforcement of foreign tax claims,that the doctrine bars this action,that canada failed to plead the commercial injury required by rico and is not a person under rico entitled to bring the action,and that equitable remedies are unavailable in a civil rico suit such as this.amicus curiae the european community urges reversal of the district court,primarily on the ground that the revenue rule is inapplicable and inconsistent with the goals of rico.amici curiae the national association of manufacturers and the united states chamber of commerce advocate affirmance,arguing that the revenue rule requires the court to limit foreign governments use of united states courts for tax collections,which,if unrestricted,would be harmful to american business interests.
we find that the present case falls within the revenue rule proscriptions.moreover,we have found no evidence that congress intended to limit the revenue rule when it enacted rico.canada requests that a united states court enforce canadian tax laws on its behalf.this we can not do,notwithstanding our deep respect for canada views.accordingly,we hold that the revenue rule bars canada action in its entirety and affirm the judgment of the district court.
discussion 
i.the vitality of the revenue rule 
the revenue rule is a longstanding common law doctrine providing that courts of one sovereign will not enforce final tax judgments or unadjudicated tax claims of other sovereigns.it has been defended on several grounds,including respect for sovereignty,concern for judicial role and competence,and separation of powers.examination of both the policies underlying the revenue rule,and the rule congruence with the international tax policies pursued by the political branches of our government,supports the conclusion that the revenue rule is applicable to the particular facts of the case at hand.
although the united states supreme court and this circuit have not ruled on the precise scope of the rule,they have acknowledged its continuing vitality in the international context.see sun oil wortman,d brennan,concurring noting the rule continued existence in the setting banco nacional de cuba sabbatino,d noting the view that many courts in the united states have adhered to the principle that a court need not give effect to the penal or revenue laws of foreign countries oklahoma gulf,santa fe ry.the rule that the courts of no country execute the penal laws of another applies not only to prosecutions and sentences for crimes and misdemeanors,but to all suits in favor of the state for the recovery of pecuniary penalties for any violation of statutes for the protection of its revenue or other municipal laws,and to all judgments for such penalties.quoting wisconsin pelican ins.of new orleans,overruled in part by milwaukee county white.united states first city bank,cir it has long been a general rule that one sovereignty may not maintain an action in the courts of another state for the collection of a tax claim,rev on other grounds,d united states trapilo,cir appearing to recognize the endurance of the revenue rule in the international context but finding it inapplicable to the instant case,cert.denied,d united states pierce,cir describing this aspect of trapilo.
the rule has its origin in english court decisions seeking to protect british trade from the oppressiveness of foreign customs in boucher lawson,eng.lord hardwicke,the court specifically acknowledged that its concerns with promoting british trade led it to uphold a transaction that violated portuguese export laws.chief justice lord hardwicke stated that to do otherwise would cut off all benefit of such trade from this kingdom,which would be of very bad consequence to the principal and most beneficial branches of our trade.id.at since then,the rule has entered united states common law,international law and the national law of other common law jurisdictions we note that the international acceptance of the revenue rule extends to canada supreme court and provincial courts 
respect for sovereignty 
tax laws embody a sovereign political will.they create property rights and affect each individual relationship to his or her sovereign.they mirror the moral and social sensibilities of a society.sales taxes,for example,may enforce political and moral judgments about certain products.import and export taxes may reflect a country ideological leanings and the political goals of its commercial relationships with other nations.
in defense of the revenue rule,some courts have observed that the rule prevents foreign sovereigns from asserting their sovereignty within the borders of other nations,thereby helping nations maintain their mutual respect and security see sabbatino,at.white,dissenting on other grounds our courts customarily refuse to enforce the revenue and penal laws of a foreign state,since no country has an obligation to further the governmental interests of a foreign sovereign see generally mann,prerogative rights of foreign states the conflict of laws,in studies in international law.
other courts have suggested that it is too sensitive and difficult for courts to determine whether such foreign revenue laws should be enforced by another sovereign.more than seventy years ago,a judge of this court,learned hand,offered a rationale in support of the revenue rule that still has resonance today 
a court will not recognize those liabilities arising in a foreign state,if they run counter to the settled public policy of its own.thus a scrutiny of the liability is necessarily always in reserve,and the possibility that it will be found not to accord with the policy of the domestic state no court ought to undertake an inquiry which it can not prosecute without determining whether those laws are consonant with its own notions of what is proper.
moore mitchell,cir,concurring,aff on other grounds.in part,the reluctance of courts to delve into such matters is based on the desire to avoid embarrassing another state by scrutinizing its penal and revenue laws.sabbatino,at.see united states boots,cir,cert.denied,d.similarly,in peter buchanan mcvey,aff,relied on by the united states supreme court in sabbatino,at,the irish high court noted that courts had traditionally exercised the right to reject foreign law that conflicted with the public policy or morality of the domestic court,and stated 
m odern history is not without examples of revenue laws used for purposes which would not only affront the strongest feelings of neighbouring communities but would run counter to their political aims and vital interests so long as these possibilities exist it would be equally unwise for the courts to permit the enforcement of the revenue claims of foreign states or to attempt to discriminate between those claims which they would and those which they would not enforce.safety lies only in universal rejection.
the case before us illustrates the point.canada asserts that the revenue laws at issue were the product of an assessment of its public health priorities.in its complaint,canada alleged 
to protect its youth from the health hazards of smoking,and to implement programs and other public benefits,canada doubled tobacco duties and taxes in february.tobacco duty and tax increases,and the resulting higher tobacco prices,held the promise of deterring young people from becoming addicted to a harmful drug.tobacco duty and tax increases also held the promise of encouraging established smokers to quit.
the tenor of the times,at least among many people in the states of this judicial circuit,is.it is unlikely that enforcing a foreign tax regime aimed at deterring smoking would offend most citizens of new york,connecticut or vermont,whatever our personal habits or vices.of course,citizens of united states states might vehemently object to canada taxation scheme.but consider,for example,other possibilities involving a foreign sovereign taxes.how would we respond if a foreign sovereign asked us to help enforce a tax designed to render it very expensive to sell united states newspapers in that nation or to make the inclusion of united content in machinery built in that foreign country prohibitively expensive suppose it were a tax that had been raised to deter the sale of united states pharmaceuticals in that country or if a foreign nation imposed an immigration tax on members of a particular religious group or racial minority it is much less likely that united states citizens would be kindly disposed towards tolerating such taxes,let alone providing judicial resources to enforce them.these we do not suggest that they are anything but the sensitive nature of the issues that can be raised through a foreign sovereign exercise of its taxation powers.see stoel,supra note,at t he tax judgments of one nation may be used to attain what other nations consider odious ends.addressing the public policy concerns raised by the imposition of such foreign taxes could embroil united states courts in delicate issues in which they have little expertise or capacity.
we do not suggest that the revenue rule always bars united states courts from furthering the tax policies of foreign sovereigns.this circuit has held the revenue rule inapplicable to a united states criminal action premised on violations of foreign tax laws.united states trapilo,cir,cert.denied,d see also united states pierce,cir.these concerns about sovereignty and extraterritorially are therefore not absolute,and are not implicated in every case involving foreign tax laws.however,as explained below in section,the particular facts of this notably,the fact that a foreign sovereign plaintiff is directly seeking to enforce its tax laws,and that our government has negotiated and signed a treaty with this sovereign providing for limited extraterritorial tax enforcement assistance but stopping well short of the assistance requested us to be wary in this instance of becoming the enforcer of foreign tax policy.
judicial role and competence 
general principles 
concern about institutional role and competence provides particularly compelling support for the application of the revenue rule in this particular case.our constitution provides the framework for interaction and dialogue among the branches of our government the conduct of foreign relations is committed largely to the executive branch,with power in the legislative branch to,inter alia,ratify treaties with foreign sovereigns.the doctrine of separation of powers prohibits the federal courts from excursions into areas committed to the executive branch or the legislative branch.in re austrian and german holocaust,cir per curiam.the legitimacy of our courts depends in no small measure on exercising authority only in those areas entrusted to the courts.the establishment of political or economic policies is not for the courts.such action would be an abuse of judicial power.national city bank republic of china.reed,dissenting 
extraterritorial tax enforcement directly implicates relations between our country and other sovereign nations.when a foreign nation appears as a plaintiff in our courts seeking enforcement of its revenue laws,the judiciary risks being drawn into issues and disputes of foreign relations policy that are assigned better handled political branches of government see ins,d the judiciary is not well positioned to shoulder primary responsibility for assessing the likelihood and importance of diplomatic repercussions caused by the exercise of sensitive political functions that implicate foreign relations.again,judge hand put it well 
to pass judgment upon the provisions for the public order of another state is,or at any rate should be,beyond the powers of a court it involves the relations between the states themselves,with which courts are incompetent to deal,and which are intrusted to other authorities revenue laws fall within the same reasoning they affect a state in matters as vital to its existence as its criminal laws.
moore,at,concurring see also smith,supra note,at t he possibility of a court engendering ill will and hindering the conduct of foreign relations by refusing to enforce a particular tax claim or judgment is very real in the international context.stoel,supra note,at a pplication of forum public policy to revenue laws may be offensive to the plaintiff state and have undesirable foreign relations consequences for the forum state.boots,at dismissing a criminal rico action based on wire and mail fraud in connection with smuggling over the canadian border on the ground that the action was barred by the revenue rule and the rule foreign affairs rationale alan johnson,systems for tax enforcement treaties the choice between administrative assessments court judgments,harv.int l,noting that many commentators dissatisfied with the revenue rule view executive action by treaty as a preferable means of reform because of the supposed foreign relations consequences.
the leading role of the political branches 
indeed,with regard to the domestic collection of foreign taxes and the enforcement of united states taxes abroad,the political branches of our government have consistently acted on behalf of the united states in establishing and managing the nation relationships with other countries.as this court stated in 
the nations of the world have only recently begun to deal with the problem of collection of tax revenues through the medium of negotiated tax treaties providing for mutual cooperation.absent an explicit indication to the contrary,there should not be attributed to congress an intent to give the courts of this nation,in this highly sensitive area of intergovernmental relations,the power to affect rights to property wherever located in the world.the apparent necessity of tax treaties underscores the conclusion that congress has seen fit to handle this problem in another manner.
united states first city bank,cir citation omitted,rev on other grounds,d see her majesty the queen in right of the province of british columbia gilbertson,cir considering united tax treaties,and stating e ven though the political branches of the two countries could have abolished the revenue rule between themselves at the time they entered into the treaties,they did not.the concerns expressed in first national city bank and gilbertson remain relevant today 
we believe that the political branches of our government have clearly expressed their intention to define and limit the parameters of any assistance given with regard to the extraterritorial enforcement of a foreign sovereign tax laws.thus,that version of the revenue rule under which united states courts abstain from assisting foreign sovereign plaintiffs with extraterritorial tax enforcement is fully consistent with our broader legal,political and institutional framework.
the parties have pointed us to,and we have been able to confirm the existence of,only five countries with which the united states has entered into income tax treaties under which the contracting parties have agreed to provide general assistance in collecting tax judgments the treaties with four of these,france,sweden and the extraterritorial tax collection assistance were first signed and ratified in the late and relatively soon thereafter,the united states senate sought to limit the extent to which united states courts and agencies would be obligated to render foreign tax collection assistance.in the words of a member of the senate foreign relations committee,in attention was focused on the mutual collection assistance provisions of the treaty with france,and the committee 
discovered that there had been developed a number of objections as to the way by which,under the convention,our country undertook to collect taxes for the government of france.this matter was of such concern that we held a number of hearings and recommended consultation between individuals,businesses and interest groups concerned about the treaty and state department representatives.we discovered that there had been embodied in the convention certain methods of collection of taxes which we as a subcommittee felt were not desirable,and at our request the whole matter was reviewed again by the state department representatives.
staff of the joint comm.on internal revenue taxation,legislative history of united states tax conventions hereinafter legislative history vol.floor statement of smith on june.a compromise was embodied in a supplementary protocol,ratified by the full senate,which provided that collection assistance under the original treaty with france would not be given with respect to taxpayers of the requested state.see supplementary protocol to the convention about double taxation and fiscal assistance,may,art.i,entered into force,available at legislative history vol,at.
next,in,the senate considered income tax treaties for greece,norway,and south africa which,as originally submitted to the senate,would have obligated the treaty countries to provide broad tax collection assistance to each other.staff of the joint comm.on taxation,explanation of proposed protocol to the income tax treaty between the united states canada joint comm.print hereinafter taxation comm.staff explanation of canada protocol.specifically,the treaties provided that finally determined revenue claims would be accepted for enforcement by the other contracting state and collected as though they were domestic tax claims,but that such assistance would not be accorded with regard to citizens,corporations or other entities of the state to which application for collection assistance was made 
the limitation of collection assistance in these treaties in accordance with the senate policy of the protocol was apparently not sufficient.a report was issued by the senate foreign relations committee concluding that 
t he committee believes that the collection provisions of the south african,greek,and norwegian conventions are too broad,and it repeats that,as a general rule,it is not believed wise to have one government collect the taxes which are due to another government thus,the committee recommends the acceptance of the collection provisions subject to the understanding that each of the governments may collect the other tax solely in order to insure that the exemptions or reduced rates of tax provided under the respective conventions will not be enjoyed by persons not entitled to such benefits.
ex,at,available at legislative history vol,at.a senator who was very involved in the ratification process explained further 
it is the opinion of the subcommittee and of the whole committee that the mutual collection assistance provisions are too broad.as a general rule it is not believed wise to have one government collect the taxes which are due to another government.therefore the committee recommends that these provisions be eliminated from the pending conventions t his was the view taken by the committee with respect to all these assistance provisions.it was simply deemed unwise to obligate our country to undertake the collection in our own courts of taxes due to the foreign countries dealt with in these conventions.it will be recalled that in many instances,or perhaps all,the courts would be called upon to enforce very harsh civil penalties,and it was not deemed wise for our courts to undertake that particular job.
legislative history vol,at floor statement of george on.
in accordance with these views,t he senate gave its advice and consent to those treaties subject to an understanding that the countries would only provide such collection assistance as would be necessary to ensure that the exemption or reduced rate of tax granted by the treaties would not be enjoyed by persons not entitled to those benefits.taxation comm.staff explanation of canada protocol,at discussing,senate vote see generally smith,supra note,at.this senate policy was also implemented through an analogous narrowing of the collection assistance provision when the netherlands tax convention,whose broad collection assistance provisions had been negotiated before the september,senate vote,see legislative history vol,at,was extended to cover the netherlands antilles.see id.at.
in transmitting future tax conventions to the senate,the state department often noted that the mutual collection assistance provisions were narrowed to bring them into harmony with the senate expressed policy.see,letter from secretary of state john foster dulles to the president of,concerning convention,available at legislative history vol,at letter from under secretary of state walter smith to the president of june,concerning convention,available at legislative history vol,at letter from secretary of state dean acheson to the president of,concerning convention,available at legislative history vol,at.
this general policy on extraterritorial collection assistance still prevails.for example,the united states department of treasury has released the united states model income tax convention of september,model convention.the model convention contains no general provision assisting or allowing the enforcement of foreign tax judgments or claims.instead,article of the convention exchange of information and administrative assistance provides that a contracting state will endeavor to collect on behalf of the other state only those amounts necessary to ensure that any exemption or reduced rate of tax at source granted under the convention by that other state is not enjoyed by persons not entitled to those benefits.model convention technical explanation explaining article 
our government continuing policy preference against enforcing foreign tax laws is further revealed by the fact that in negotiating and ratifying the oecd convention on mutual administrative assistance in tax matters,treaty doc,the executive branch recommended and the senate adopted a reservation to the treaty reciprocal collection assistance provisions.see brian arnold,new protocol to tax treaty addresses estate tax issues,limitations on benefits,mutual assistance,tax notes int l,although the united states has ratified the oecd convention it reserved its position with respect to the provisions dealing with collections.cong.rec,detailing the vote on the reservation see also cong.rec.statement of pell,the administration stated,and the committee on foreign relations concurred,that it did not believe it appropriate,at this time,to participate in other aspects of the convention,that is cooperation in tax collection efforts see generally taxation comm.staff explanation of protocol,at discussing the reservation.
consistent with this continuing policy,the united states has over the years entered into a number of tax treaties with foreign sovereigns that provide for information exchange and,sometimes,limited collection assistance,but notably fail to make any provision for general enforcement of foreign tax judgments or claims it seems to us that the usual absence in our negotiated tax conventions of any provision for the extraterritorial enforcement of a sovereign tax judgments or claims can not be not accidental,but instead must reflect the considered policy of the political branches of our government.thus,the political branches of our government have clearly expressed their intention to define and strictly limit the parameters of any assistance given with regard to the extraterritorial enforcement of a foreign sovereign tax laws.in this area of foreign relations policy where the political branches have primacy,courts must be wary of intruding in a way that undermines carefully conceived and negotiated policy choices.accordingly,as a general matter,that version of the revenue rule under which united states courts abstain from assisting foreign sovereign plaintiffs with extraterritorial tax enforcement is fully consistent with our broader legal,diplomatic,and institutional framework.
the united treaty framework 
significantly,we have fairly recently negotiated a tax convention with canada providing for assistance with the enforcement of certain fully adjudicated foreign tax judgments.see protocol,supra note.prior to,the tax convention was similar with respect to collection assistance to the united states model convention and the bilateral income tax treaties negotiated subsequent to the senate action.see taxation comm.staff explanation of protocol,at.the treaty prior to provided for exchange of information between the tax authorities of the contracting states,and also for minimal mutual collection to that assistance necessary to ensure that the exemptions,reduced rates or other benefits provided in the treaty would not be enjoyed by persons not entitled to those benefits.see convention with respect to taxes on income and on capital,arts.xxvi xxvii,entered into force,see also taxation comm.staff explanation of protocol,at.
there are several notable features of the amendments.first,the expanded mutual collection assistance provision appl ies to all categories of taxes collected by or on behalf of the government of a contracting state.protocol,supra note,adding article xxvi a,to the treaty see taxation comm.staff explanation of protocol,at the proposed protocol provides that the countries are to undertake to lend assistance to each other in collecting all categories of taxes collected by or on behalf of the government of each country.thus,this treaty provision is intended by both governments to set the parameters for mutual collection assistance with regard to every kind of tax,including the taxes at issue in this case 
second,the amendments bar assistance with the collection of any revenue claim arising during the time an individual or corporation was a citizen of or incorporated in,respectively,the requested state.protocol,supra note.thus,paragraph bars canada from asking the united states for collection assistance with regard to a canadian revenue claim arising when a person was a united states citizen or corporation which includes many of the defendants and revenue claims in this case.
third,the protocol provides that a finally determined revenue claim may be accepted for collection by the other sovereign,emphasis added.paragraph clarifies that the contracting state from which assistance was requested has discretion as to whether to accept a particular application for collection assistance.treasury dep t technical explanation,protocol released june,discussing of the protocol,available at tax notes int l hereinafter treasury technical explanation.thus,our government has deemed it advisable to allow the executive branch to consider and determine,in each instance,whether a particular canadian tax liability should be enforced by the united states.
fourth,the protocol requires that a state seeking collection assistance certify that the revenue claim has been finally determined.protocol,supra note.a claim has been finally determined when the applicant state has the right under its internal law to collect the revenue claim and all administrative and judicial rights of the taxpayer to restrain collection in the applicant state have lapsed or been exhausted.id.accordingly,the treaty does not abrogate the rule that courts of one nation should not adjudicate the unresolved tax claims of another.that is particularly significant,because in this case canada is not asking for the enforcement of a fully adjudicated canadian tax judgment,but rather for a united states court to assess and adjudicate the application of canadian tax laws to the wrongdoing alleged in its complaint 
we do not believe that the united treaty allowing collection of certain tax judgments should be broadly construed to suggest a change in attitude toward the involvement of united states courts in adjudicating foreign tax claims that have not been first reduced to judgment.in fact,allowing assistance with collecting judgments was a departure from treaty policy of recent years.taxation comm.staff explanation of protocol,at.it seems clear that the extent of such policy change is a sensitive question implicating diverse considerations better handled by the political branches.see id.at noting that in future treaties consideration may need to be given as to whether it is appropriate for the united states to assist in the collection of another government taxes.this analysis may involve an evaluation of both the substantive and procedural elements of the other government taxes,as well as an analysis of broader policy issues,such as the relative compatibility of the other government legal systems and individual protections with those of the united states.before entering the protocol,our government carefully considered whether and to what extent extraterritorial tax enforcement was advisable 
t he ultimate decision of the and canadian negotiators to add the collection assistance article was attributable to the confluence of several unusual factors.of critical importance was the similarity between the laws of the united states and canada.the internal revenue service,the justice department,and other negotiators were reassured by the close similarity of the legal and procedural protections afforded by the contracting states to their citizens and residents and by the fact that these protections apply to the tax collection procedures used by each state.in addition,the negotiators were confident,given their extensive experience in working with their canadian counterparts,that the agreed procedures could be administered appropriately,effectively,and efficiently.finally,given the close cooperation already developed between the united states and canada in the exchange of tax information,the and canadian negotiators concluded that the potential benefits to both countries of obtaining such assistance would be immediate and substantial and would far outweigh any cost involved.
treasury technical explanation discussing.in this area,it is not the courts role to press ahead further and faster than the political branches have deemed it wise to travel after careful deliberation.
a final aspect of the protocol we find noteworthy is the provision that the contracting states shall agree to ensure comparable levels of assistance to each other with regard to extraterritorial tax collection.protocol,supra note,adding article xxvi a,to the treaty.in other words,both governments have expressed a policy preference for reciprocity in the level of enforcement of each other tax judgments and claims see generally arnold,supra,tax notes int l at discussing the reciprocity required by the treaty.in light of this,the fact that canada courts have repeatedly reaffirmed the vitality of the revenue rule,see supra note,becomes significant.declining to apply the revenue rule in this case would arguably undermine the considered policy judgment of our political branches moreover,it would potentially allow canada to obtain assistance it has not negotiated for and that would be greater than the assistance our government would likely receive as a litigant in canada courts.
in sum,the provisions of the protocol indicate that the political branches of the two countries intended that the type of taxes involved in this case would be covered by the treaty collection assistance provisions,yet negotiated for limitations on collection assistance that specifically exclude the type of assistance canada seeks in this case.by permitting such a claim to go forward,we would be ignoring and undermining the treaty negotiation process and the clearly expressed views of the political branches of the united states government and instead engaging in ad hoc judicial policymaking in the delicate realm of foreign affairs 
the significance of the identity of the plaintiff 
in united states boots,cir,cert.denied,d,one of the few recent cases dealing with the revenue rule in a similar context,the first circuit relied in part on similar reasoning to dismiss an indictment for a smuggling scheme designed to avoid canadian taxes.see id.at f or our courts effectively to pass on foreign revenue laws raises issues of foreign relations which are assigned to and better handled by the legislative and executive branches of government,and id.at of particular concern is the principle of noninterference by the federal courts in the legislative and executive branches exercise of their foreign policymaking powers.this circuit has disagreed with boots to the extent it applied the revenue rule in a criminal action,see united states trapilo,cir,cert.denied,d united states pierce,cir,but we find the boots reasoning persuasive with respect to the present civil suit.this approach is consistent with our precedent because,with regard to the revenue rule,there is a critical difference between this civil suit brought by a foreign sovereign and the criminal actions previously considered by panels of this court in trapilo and pierce and in boots,the executive branch of the united states brought the case,while here,canada is the plaintiff.when the united states prosecutes a criminal action,the united states attorney acts in the interest of the united states,and his or her conduct is subject to the oversight of the executive branch.thus,the foreign relations interests of the united states may be accommodated throughout the litigation in contrast,a civil rico case brought to recover tax revenues by a foreign sovereign to further its own interests,may be,but is not necessarily,consistent with the policies and interests of the united states 
trapilo and pierce are not controlling here.the court in trapilo considered whether the prosecution of a money laundering scheme was barred by the revenue rule,and held that it was not because a t the heart of this indictment is the misuse of the wires in furtherance of a scheme to defraud the canadian government of tax revenue,not the validity of a foreign sovereign revenue laws.trapilo,at.in pierce,the court reversed the convictions of two of the trapilo defendants on the ground that the government had failed to establish that the defendants could have deprived anyone of an interest in property when it failed to offer proof of the existence and applicability of canada tax laws that the defendants had intended to circumvent see pierce,at.taken together,these two cases stand for the proposition that a scheme to defraud a foreign nation of its right to impose taxes may be punished under appropriate circumstances by the united states government,in united states courts,using united states penal laws they do not hold that united states courts,in a civil case,may determine the validity of a foreign tax law or the extent of liability thereunder and award that amount to a foreign sovereign.as we have outlined,the political branches have repeatedly expressed their intention to handle the issue of extraterritorial tax enforcement by a foreign sovereign through the treaty process.this case,unlike trapilo and pierce,involves a request for extraterritorial tax enforcement by a foreign sovereign.the treaty between canada and the united states confirms that canada has other,more appropriate,avenues by which to pursue its unadjudicated tax by negotiating for greater assistance with the political branches acting on behalf of the united states.
criticisms of the revenue rule 
before considering the interaction between the revenue rule and rico in this case,we pause to acknowledge the criticism to which the revenue rule has been subject and to consider additional arguments against the rule advanced by canada in this case.
in academic literature,there is a long history of criticism of the revenue rule as creating improper incentives for moral and commercial conduct.see,joseph story,commentaries on the conflict of laws melville bigelow,ed.the revenue rule is inconsistent with good faith and moral duties of nations kent,commentaries on american law holmes,john gould,criticizing the broad application of the revenue rule as laying down an exceedingly lax morality see generally ali,united states income tax treaties,supra note,at criticizing the revenue rule and recommending that united states tax treaties allow the enforcement of foreign tax judgments in united states courts.the most recent restatement of the law of foreign relations states that i n an age when instantaneous transfer of assets can be easily arranged,the rationale for not recognizing or enforcing tax judgments is largely obsolete.restatement third of the law of foreign relations,reporter note cited in trapilo,at,and pierce,at.the analytical underpinnings of the rule have been criticized.see,stoel,supra note,at noting that it is not clear why difficulties in proving or interpreting foreign law would be any greater with revenue laws than in other civil suits involving foreign law and i n any case,the principle of forum non conveniens,normally used to take account of these difficulties would remain applicable.various other criticisms of the revenue rule have been advanced.for example,it has been noted that the early british cases contain scanty reasoning justifying the rule emergence.nor did the revenue rule provide the basis of decision in those early british cases.the analogy of revenue enactments to penal laws has been criticized as inconsistent with the modern recognition that the obligation to pay taxes is not penal while conceding the force of many of these points,we nevertheless decide that,in the specific context of this particular,where the two sovereigns concerned have recognized the vitality of the revenue rule and have a treaty process that has strictly limited the extent to which each government can pursue its tax claims using the other domestic administrative and judicial foreign affairs and separation of powers rationales for the revenue have substantial continuing force.
canada also argues that the revenue rule conflicts with the doctrine and therefore should not be applied.see banco nacional de cuba sabbatino,d white,dissenting on other grounds observing the seeming inconsistency between the doctrine and the revenue rule approach to the validity of foreign laws.under the doctrine,a court presumes the validity of a foreign state laws within that state territory.see galu swissair,cir.in contrast,the revenue rule presumes the extraterritorial unenforceability of a foreign sovereign tax laws.defendants contend that the rules are consistent and represent two different ways in which courts steer clear of foreign affairs in different contexts.
despite the seeming inconsistency,we believe that defendants have the better argument.in sabbatino,the supreme court explained the constitutional underpinnings of the doctrine 
it arises out of the basic relationships between branches of government in a system of separation of powers.it concerns the competency of dissimilar institutions to make and implement particular kinds of decisions in the area of international relations.the doctrine as formulated in past decisions expresses the strong sense of the judicial branch that its engagement in the task of passing on the validity of foreign acts of state may hinder rather than further this country pursuit of goals both for itself and for the community of nations as a whole in the international sphere.
sabbatino,at.the revenue rule appears to share these underpinnings.under the doctrine,the assessment of the validity of a foreign law is limited to its application within the sovereign territory under the revenue rule,united states courts avoid the application of a foreign sovereign tax laws in the united states.both approaches enable courts to avoid entanglement with questions about the underlying validity of a foreign sovereign laws.
in sum,as this case demonstrates,sound policy considerations,including international comity,the proper exercise of sovereign powers,institutional competence and separation of powers,and recognition of the tax treaty relationship,support the continuing viability and application of the revenue rule to this case.
ii.rico and the revenue rule 
canada argues that the revenue rule is not relevant here because it brings this action under a united states than under canadian tax law.canada challenges the district court decision dismissing its complaint,stating that 
the dismissal violates the fundamental principle that a court must carefully examine a statute structure,purpose,and policies before applying common law rules to restrict or modify a congressionally created private remedy at the time congress enacted rico,no court had applied the common law revenue rule to bar a claim of a foreign sovereign to enforce a united states statute congress could not have foreseen that a court later would limit rico by extending the common law revenue rule.
because we find that the revenue rule is a doctrine with continuing force in the particular context of this case,canada can not succeed unless it can show that rico bars the application of the revenue rule.we ultimately conclude that canada arguments,though ably made,are unavailing.
notwithstanding canada assertion that congress was not aware of the broad scope of the revenue rule at the time of rico enactment,it is clear that the revenue rule was well established by that date.therefore,as explained below,congress is presumed to have legislated with knowledge of the rule.approximately years before rico enactment,the united states supreme court acknowledged the broad scope of the revenue rule.see milwaukee county white.in addition to the authorities cited in section i,supra,numerous courts and commentators professed the vitality of the revenue rule in the years leading up to the enactment of rico it was against this understanding of the common law that in congress enacted rico.
we do not simply presume congressional awareness of relevant judicial decisions,although we could do so.the senate itself has,through its actions,shown respect for the revenue rule.see section,supra 
principles of statutory construction require that we construe rico in a manner that preserves the revenue rule absent clear evidence of congressional intent to abrogate it w here a principle is well established the courts may take it as given that congress has legislated with an expectation that the principle will apply except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident.astoria fed.sav.loan ass solimino,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.statutes which invade the common law are to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of and familiar principles,except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident.in re chateaugay,cir quoting isbrandtsen johnson.in such cases,congress does not write upon a clean slate.united states texas,d.as discussed above,there can be no question that the version of the revenue rule under which united states courts abstain from assisting foreign sovereign plaintiffs with extraterritorial tax enforcement is a part of the common law and fully consistent with our broader legal,diplomatic,and institutional framework.
in order to abrogate a principle,the statute must speak directly to the question addressed by the common law.see also id.at.stevens,dissenting disagreeing as to the state of the common law,but stating that w e presume that congress understands the legal terrain in which it operates and we therefore expect congress to state clearly any intent to reshape that terrain goodkin united states,cir applying canon and stating that t he law is a statute in derogation of the common law and,thus,must be strictly construed.when a statute is as expansive as rico,a court must be particularly careful to assure itself that congress intended to abrogate the common law by enacting it.beck prupis,d we presume,therefore,that when congress established in rico a civil cause of action,it meant to adopt civil conspiracy principles.neder united states,d court would interpret federal criminal statutes which are common rico predicate offenses to include common law limitations unless the statute otherwise dictates internal quotation marks omitted 
moreover,when an interpretation of a broad,general statute would implicate foreign relations,the supreme court has proceeded cautiously and looked for a clear expression of congressional intent as to the statute scope.for example,in mcculloch sociedad nacional de marineros de honduras,d,a case about the national labor relations board assertion of jurisdiction over foreign seamen,the court declined to read the national labor relations act in a manner that would raise a serious question of separation of powers,which would in turn implicate sensitive issues of the authority of the executive over relations with foreign nations.it stated that before approving the board exercise of jurisdiction there must be present the affirmative intention of the congress clearly expressed.id.at.citation omitted.adherence to this principle will ensure that the courts interpret rico consistently with international law.united states courts are not to read general words without regard to the limitations customarily observed by nations upon the exercise of their powers.in re maxwell communication,cir quoting united states aluminum of,cir 
applying these rules of construction,canada contention that rico abrogates the revenue rule fails.a party contending that legislative action changed settled law has the burden of showing that the legislature intended such a change.green bock laundry mach,d see tome united states,d plurality opinion quoting green.we respectfully conclude that canada has not carried this burden.the language and structure of rico and its legislative history offer no hint that congress intended the statute to afford a civil remedy to foreign nations for the evasion of foreign taxes moreover,there is no language in rico or in its legislative history that demonstrates any intent by congress to abrogate the revenue rule for the statute to change such a common law prudential rule,it must speak directly to the matter yet it does not.absent such indication,we must presume congress understood the common law against which it legislated and intended that this common law doctrine should with the rico statute.
legislation passed since rico enactment reinforces our conclusion that congress did not intend to reach foreign tax law violations and thereby abrogate the revenue rule through civil rico.in,congress outlawed trafficking in contraband cigarettes with the aim of reducing evasion of state cigarette taxes,and amended rico to include such trafficking as a predicate offense.see b.although congress knew that the purchase of cigarettes through outlets include d cigarettes obtained from three primary sources international points of entry,military post exchanges,and indian reservations,at,reprinted in,and that t here was widespread traffic in cigarettes moving in or otherwise affecting interstate or foreign commerce,conf,at,reprinted in,congress did not prohibit smuggling between countries or in violation of foreign tax laws.see.
we are aware that rico is a broad statute,and that the supreme court has often rejected attempts to limit the reach of its provisions through narrowing constructions.see sedima,imrex,d t he fact that rico has been applied in situations not expressly anticipated by congress does not demonstrate ambiguity.it demonstrates breadth.citation omitted.one key difference in the instant case is that we are emphatically not dealing here with a situation not anticipated by congress.as we have demonstrated,congress was and is aware of the revenue rule,the precise extent of extraterritorial enforcement assistance available under our tax treaties,and the existence of cigarette smuggling in violation of foreign tax laws.in spite of the extensive congressional attention to these areas,we are not cognizant of any manifestation of congressional intent that civil rico and the united states courts should be available to a foreign sovereign seeking to recover lost tax revenues.
iii.direct and indirect enforcement under the revenue rule 
as an initial matter,we note again that canada is not asking for the enforcement of a final,fully adjudicated canadian tax judgment,but rather,for a united states court to assess and adjudicate the application of canadian tax laws to the wrongdoing alleged in its complaint.when presented with such a request which potentially implicates the revenue rule,a court must examine whether the substance of the claim is,either directly or indirectly,one for tax revenues what matters is not the form of the action,but the substance of the claim for example,in united states harden,can,the canadian supreme court rejected the enforcement of a stipulation of settlement of a tax case as barred by the revenue rule,stating that n either the foreign judgment nor the agreement does more than make certain the fact and the amount of the respondent liability to the appellant.the nature of the liability is not altered.it is a liability to pay income tax.the court concluded for the purpose of this case it is sufficient to say that when it appears to the court that the whole object of the suit is to collect tax for a foreign revenue,and that this will be the sole result of a decision in favour of the plaintiff,then a court is entitled to reject the claim by refusing jurisdiction.id.at quoting peter buchanan,at.
canada argues to this court that n othing in the revenue rule,prohibits a foreign nation from bringing a suit in the united states to enforce rights established under united states law.this is not an attempt by canada to assert its sovereignty extraterritorially it is not a claim to enforce canadian tax law or any other canadian law.we are not persuaded by canada arguments that this is an action brought solely under united states law,and not a claim for canadian taxes.on the contrary,canada seeks to use the united states law to enforce,both directly and indirectly,its tax laws 
as to direct enforcement,canada alleges that d efendants evaded the payment of customs and excise tax and duty owed directly to canada.this evasion was a direct cause of lost revenue to canada defendants conduct forced canada to roll back tobacco taxes in,resulting in lost revenue into the future.as the canadian supreme court said in harden,we must look to the object of the claim.when we do so,we see that,at bottom,canada would have a united states court require defendants to reimburse canada for its unpaid taxes,plus a significant penalty due to rico treble damages provision.thus,canada object is clearly to recover allegedly unpaid taxes.
we also conclude that canada claim for damages based on law enforcement costs is in essence an indirect attempt to have a united states court enforce canadian revenue laws,an exercise barred by the revenue rule.see dicey morris,the conflict of laws ed.indirect enforcement occurs where a foreign state or its nominee in form seeks a remedy,not based on the foreign rule in question,but which in substance is designed to give it effect.as to law enforcement costs,canada states 
defendants role in smuggling caused canada to increase enforcement and investigative resources.but for defendants active involvement in smuggling,canada would not have had to dedicate as many resources to combat smuggling.the predictable outcome of defendants evasion of united states and canadian laws,and concealment of such evasion,was to cause canada to spend further resources attempting to discover the culprits of its injury.
canada attempts to analogize its injury of additional law enforcement costs incurred to the harms suffered by private victims of rico schemes canada incurred specific additional law enforcement costs not as part of its normal policing,but in because it was under direct attack by defendants no different result should obtain merely because the rico scheme was more ambitious and the intended victim was a sovereign nation that was forced to combat the illegal conduct with special enforcement resources.
we disagree.the primary purpose identified by canada for using its police forces to stop the smuggling was to enforce its customs and excise taxes.in effect,canada is requesting that defendants pay the salary of the tax enforcers such police costs are thus derivative of the taxes canada sought to enforce.we do not believe that the mechanism for the enforcement of a tax law can be so easily separated from the tax law itself.it would certainly be anomalous for the court to permit the collection of the law enforcement costs while holding that the object of those law enforcement efforts was uncollectable.particularly in light of the separation of powers and foreign relations concerns discussed above,we must decline to allow canada to indirectly enforce its revenue laws simply by pleading tort damages based on the costs of enforcing those laws.
canada argument depends on the contention that the expenditure of resources by a private individual can be equated with the expenditures of a nation by their very nature,sovereigns,unlike individuals,have at their disposal and as the services of the canadian attorney general and the royal canadian mounted combat a rico scheme.the sovereign has a legal monopoly on the use of this type of coercive power.see generally max weber,the theory of social economic organization talcott parsons.law enforcement costs incurred to secure taxes for the sovereign are qualitatively different from the damages suffered by a private individual they fall within the class of acts that are jure imperii,that is,that are expressions of a foreign sovereign will or are carried out by virtue of that sovereign authority.see attorney general of new zealand ortiz.united states courts have traditionally been reluctant to enforce foreign laws that are jure imperii.
additional considerations reinforce our determination that canada claim for law enforcement costs must be dismissed.to proceed with the law enforcement costs claim,we would have to examine the tax laws at issue in order to assess the causation aspect of this claim.for example,we would have to assess whether the law enforcement costs were in fact spent on achieving the cessation of cigarette smuggling.so doing,we would have to examine whether,when and to what extent the smuggling existed,which would require a determination that tax laws were applicable to defendants.these inquiries could draw the courts into troubled waters.
canada emphasizes that recent thinking with regard to the revenue rule has admitted a distinction between the enforcement and the recognition of revenue laws,and argues that it seeks only recognition,not enforcement,of its laws.in particular,canada asserts that the revenue rule may prohibit the enforcement of canadian tax laws,but not their recognition in order to calculate damages.see dicey morris at revenue rule relates only to enforcement,but it does not prevent recognition of a foreign revenue law.emphasis in original.canada relies on two pairs of cases to support this position.first,canada draws a parallel between the present case and those in which united states courts calculating sentences have considered foreign sovereigns lost tax duties as a measure of damages caused by criminal activity.see,united states chmielewski,cir.this argument is unavailing.as explained above,see section,supra,criminal cases do not raise the same issues as those implicated by the instant civil suit by canada.
second,canada cites in in re state of norway application and,in which an english court held that the revenue rule did not bar an application by norway to gather evidence in england for use in tax proceedings in norway,and regazzoni sethia,aff,all,where an english court held that the rule against enforcing foreign political laws did not require it to enforce a contract that violated indian laws against export to south africa in both of these cases,the court permitted recognition but not enforcement of foreign revenue laws.however,in neither norway nor sethia was the british court called upon to allow damages that would serve as a substitute for previously unpaid taxes to be paid in the united kingdom to a foreign sovereign.moreover,in the sethia case,a foreign sovereign did not come to britain for relief rather,private parties sought the court assistance to resolve a commercial dispute,as the house of lords noted when viscount simonds stated that in consideration of this matter i deem it of the utmost importance to bear in mind that we are not here concerned with a suit by a foreign state to enforce its laws.sethia,all at in the present case,the taxes would be enforced by a united states court if canada were successful.similarly,in in re reid,the canadian court relied on the distinction between recognition and enforcement when it allowed the trustee of an estate to be indemnified for having paid a foreign tax claim out of the estate,stating 
in every one of the cases referred to,success would have enriched the treasury of the interested state.in the case at bar,whether or not the trustee is indemnified can not affect to the slightest degree the amount of estate duty collected in england here the united kingdom has nothing whatever to do with the respondent claim to be indemnified.
accordingly,the cases cited by canada are inapposite and do not undermine our conclusion that all of canada claims are barred by the revenue rule.
conclusion 
to the extent that the allegations set forth in canada complaint are correct,we understand canada frustration that it can not recoup its lost revenue and law enforcement costs against defendants that allegedly committed most of their wrongdoing on our side of the common border with canada.no court wishes to find itself in the position of being unable to right an alleged wrong.see loucks standard oil of new york,cardozo.nonetheless,we are without license to abandon unilaterally the,albeit,revenue rule.the hard fact is that sometimes we must make decisions we do not like because the laws compel the result.texas johnson,d kennedy,concurring.when and if the revenue rule is changed,it is a more proper function of the branches of our government to make such a change.her majesty the queen in right of the province of british columbia gilbertson,cir.recourse,to the degree it is warranted and available,lies with the executive and legislature.
because the judgment is affirmed based on the revenue rule,we need not address the other grounds discussed by the district court or raised by the parties on appeal 
on its face,and despite the considerable confusion created by defendants able arguments,the revenue rule has nothing to do with this case.as described by the relevant restatement,the rule provides only that c ourts in the united states are not required to recognize or to enforce judgments for the collection of taxes,fines,or penalties rendered by the courts of other states.restatement third of foreign relations law.the majority describes the rule in a similar fashion the revenue rule is a longstanding common law doctrine providing that courts of one sovereign will not enforce final tax judgments or unadjudicated tax claims of other sovereigns.majority op.at.it is manifest that the suit before us in no way requires our courts to enforce foreign judgments or claims it simply is an action for damages provided for and brought under federal law.nevertheless,the majority invokes the revenue rule to bar the suit.because i do not think the rule applies and because none of the possible rationales for the rule supports its extension to the facts in this case,i respectfully dissent.
the majority description of canada suit makes clear that this action arises from a violation of a united states statute,namely the civil enforcement provision of rico,c,which itself creates the cause of action.canada alleges that defendants violated rico by repeated instances of mail fraud,and wire fraud,c.second,canada alleges a conspiracy,in violation of d,to violate subsections a,b and c of section.majority op.at footnote omitted.the canadian tax laws come into play only indirectly,as a factor to be used in the calculation of damages,and do so entirely because the rico statute itself makes the canadian laws relevant to that calculation.thus rico states that,in the calculation of damages,any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate united states district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit c.it follows that canada,in suing for damages resulting from the violation of a united states statute,neither is seeking to have courts enforce canadian judgments,laws,or policies,nor is basing this action on the violation of the canadian statute.
undaunted by this fact,the majority seeks to justify its position by undertaking an extended examination of the supposed functions served by the revenue rule,with the result that the rule is greatly expanded in its scope,and,indeed,would seemingly be applicable whenever a foreign country seeks to recover government funds but in fact,the functions of the revenue rule either are not served at all by foreclosing this action or are furthered in ways that this circuit has already held do not justify application of the revenue rule.see united states pierce,cir united states trapilo,cir.
the majority cites three major bases for the revenue rule,each of which i shall examine in the context of the case before us.
the first argument has to do with a reluctance to permit,much less promote,extraterritorial effect of foreign laws.in this view,the revenue rule acts as a bar against the assertion of foreign sovereignty within domestic borders.this position probably represents the original basis for the rule it is also the rationale given by justice white dissenting in banco nacional de cuba sabbatino,d,in which he explained that no country has an obligation to further the governmental interests of a foreign sovereign.id.at.
i have no argument with justice white,and agree a that no country has this obligation and b that the determination of such an obligation should this country desire to advance foreign interests is not for the courts but for the legislative and executive branches.this concern for,however,has no meaning whatever when what is enforced by imposing damages or penalties is,in fact,a domestic law,that is,a law enacted by the legislative and executive branches of our country and,what canada alleges in this suit is a violation of the rico statute.
as a court,we have no obligation to further canada sovereign interests.but we do have an obligation to further america sovereign interests.that is,we are bound to entertain suits brought under federal statutes,and to award the damages that such statutes establish.in enacting rico and its civil enforcement provision,congress chose to create this action.it follows that,by enacting rico,our government has determined that this suit advances our own interests,and any collateral effect furthering the governmental interests of a foreign sovereign is,therefore,necessarily incidental.see trapilo,at whether our decision today indirectly assists our canadian neighbors in keeping smugglers at bay or assists them in the collections of taxes,is not our court concern.
the majority second argument supporting the rule relates to separation of powers,foreign policy,and court competency concerns.it focuses on the idea that enforcement of particular foreign laws by american courts may not reflect united states,in any event,does not represent that policy as formulated by an appropriate branch of government.but this concern is once again misplaced whenever the legislative and executive branches have created the cause of action.under the circumstances,the courts can not be said to be formulating foreign policy,they are simply implementing the policy established by the other branches.
an analogy to the enforcement of foreign judgments is apt.generally speaking,foreign judgments are not directly enforceable in united states courts because of foreign policy and separation of powers concerns.see,moore mitchell,cir hand,concurring.but,the moment treaties or laws are enacted that provide for the enforcement of certain foreign judgments,the situation changes.united states courts can thereafter enforce these judgments and must do so regardless of whether our foreign policy favors or disfavors the specific judgment before the court.similarly,though foreign tax laws can not be enforced directly,when american law renders an the violations of foreign tax american tort or crime,the issues of whether our foreign policy favors or disfavors the particular form of taxation involved or the choice of items to be taxed must disappear.as the supreme court has explained,the purpose of civil rico is not merely to compensate victims but to turn them into prosecutors,private attorneys general,dedicated to eliminating racketeering activity.rotella wood,d.the aim is to divest the association of the fruits of its gains.united states turkette,d.to reject the application of civil rico to the case at hand is to hamper this congressional objective.
the third argument relied on by the majority is,to my way of thinking,the only one that is at all germane.it was suggested by judge learned hand in moore,at,and is based on the alleged difficulty involved in figuring out the meaning and significance of some foreign foreign tax laws.as such,it is directly relevant to this suit,given the fact that,in the instant case,the damages to be assessed under rico are to be calculated on the basis of the revenue that canada has lost.
this rationale suggests that we should try to avoid determining the degree to which certain foreign laws have been violated.and,in this view,statutory interpretation of foreign laws is beyond the purview of the courts of this because such interpretation involves extraterritoriality or because it infringes on the domain of other governmental bodies,but for the pragmatic reason that it is very complicated.this concern,in other words,suggests a practical obstacle to the suit before us because the suit,to calculate damages,requires just such an analysis.id.
whatever the possible merits of this argument this circuit has rejected it.at least that is the lesson that i draw from united states trapilo,cir,and united states pierce,cir.trapilo presented the question of whether a scheme essentially identical to the one before us to defraud the canadian government of tax revenue is cognizable under the federal wire fraud statute.trapilo,at.we there held that t he statute neither expressly,nor impliedly,precludes the prosecution of a scheme to defraud a foreign government of tax revenue,and the common law revenue rule,inapplicable to the instant case,provides no justification for departing from the plain meaning of the statute.id.at.but in trapilo,because the statute prohibited schemes to defraud regardless of their success,we assumed that we could find a violation without delving into the intricacies of canadian law.id.at.as a result,we avoided confronting judge hand concerns.
in pierce,however,a case involving essentially the same question,we addressed those concerns and necessarily rejected them.the pierce court held that t o prove the existence of a scheme to defraud the canadian government the prosecution had to prove the existence of the property right.pierce,at.that is,the court held that the prosecution had to prove the existence of a duty imposed by the canadian government so that there would be a property right to which the canadian government could be defrauded.id.at.what is more,if a conviction is pierce clearly sentencing guidelines require that the sentence imposed be based on the amount of tax revenue lost in other words,the guidelines make necessary precisely the same degree of involvement with,and interpretation of,canadian law that the case before us entails.pierce,trapilo,and the guidelines mandate this degree of involvement in order to determine the existence of a rico crime and the proper sentence for that crime,the criminal penalty.the instant case does so in order to determine the existence of a rico civil action and to calculate the proper damages under that action,the civil penalty.
as a result,i must conclude that the rationale for the revenue rule that is based on the desire to avoid analysis of foreign statutes has been effectively rejected by our court.trapilo permitted a criminal charge to be brought for the very same underlying behavior as is involved in the case before us.pierce required that we know in detail the nature of the foreign tax laws to make out that criminal charge.and,the sentencing guidelines make necessary that,after a conviction for actions like those charged here,the amount of revenue lost be calculated.if american courts can look to and examine the foreign statute for criminal rico purposes,there is no reason why the same courts must be deemed incompetent to undertake an identical analysis in civil rico cases.it follows that the majority third rationale for the revenue rule can not,at least in this circuit,provide support for applying the rule to this case.
in light of pierce and trapilo,the majority,understandably,tries to assert differences between civil and criminal rico actions.but this approach founders in the face of the supreme court consistent refusal to treat criminal and civil rico actions differently it also fails because there is no basis in the revenue rule itself for treating criminal and civil cases differently.
surprisingly,in trying to make a distinction between civil and criminal rico cases,for revenue rule purposes,the majority states that it finds the first circuit reasoning in united states boots,persuasive with respect to the present civil suit.majority op.at.but in boots,the first circuit held that the revenue rule barred a criminal action involving deprivation of the tax revenue of a foreign nation.and,in its holding,the boots court derided the distinction purportedly based on the existence of prosecutorial discretion that the majority seeks to use in this case.the boots court noted that p rosecutors,who operate within the executive branch,might of course be expected not to pursue wire fraud prosecutions based on smuggling schemes aimed at blatantly hostile countries,but whether conduct is criminal can not be a determination left solely to prosecutorial discretion.boots,at.no,boots did not,and could not,rest on a distinction based on prosecutorial discretion that the supreme court has uniformly rejected.it relied,instead,for its prohibition of criminal rico actions,on the very same learned hand rationale that we rejected in pierce and trapilo,two cases which,moreover,in rejecting that rationale,declined to follow boots.pierce,at trapilo,at.
in the end,all the arguments based on the revenue rule functions apply,if at all,with equal force in both the criminal and civil context.the first two have no meaning when the cause of criminal or based on american laws.the desire to avoid interpretation of complex foreign little merit in the complex global economy.and it has,in any event,effectively been rejected in this circuit by trapilo and pierce because its rationale would as fully preclude criminal convictions followed by sentences based on canada revenue losses,as it would civil suit damage awards that use those losses as the basis for calculating the civil sanctions 
all that being said,i fully share the majority concerns that applying civil rico to violations of foreign tax laws may be harmful to american trade interests and to american companies doing business abroad.and,i do not deny that the absence in civil cases of prosecutorial discretion removes one possible means by which such american companies can avoid domestic sanctions for some foreign misdeeds that many here might not wish to punish.but,this problem is in no way limited to,or especially severe with respect to,behavior that might be insulated from punishment through a revivification and expansion of the revenue rule.the problem derives,instead,from the extraordinary scope of the rico statute the wisdom of whose breadth one may well doubt and from the supreme court repeated unwillingness to distinguish between civil and criminal rico,thereby declining to make use of prosecutorial discretion as a way of limiting rico breadth.
in this respect,i note my own discomfort with various aspects of rico,and especially of civil rico.i would not be displeased if the supreme court,faced with the possible effects of civil rico in a case like this one,were to retreat from its insistence on an identical scope for civil and criminal rico.similarly,i would welcome a reconsideration by congress of how far civil rico ought to go as a court of appeals judge,i can not,however,join an opinion that applies an old and dubious common law rule,in ways that have nothing to do with its roots or rationales,in order to limit an act of congress that the supreme court has repeatedly applied in the broadest possible ways 
for these reasons,i,regretfully and respectfully,dissent.
