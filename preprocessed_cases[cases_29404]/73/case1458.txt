background 
the pertinent facts are not in dispute.for the tax years at issue,ventas was entitled to a targeted jobs tax credit against its regular income tax liability under section of the internal revenue code irc or code.see a the targeted jobs tax credit was enacted to encourage the hiring of disadvantaged individuals.the credit permits a taxpayer to treat a portion of its payroll costs associated with the employment of such individuals as a credit against its regular income tax.
section a of the irc is a complement to the provision that allows the targeted jobs tax credit.it provides that n o deduction shall be allowed for that portion of the wages or salaries paid or incurred for the taxable year which is equal to the sum of the credits determined for the taxable year under section a a.in other words,section a provides that the ordinary deduction for wages paid be concomitantly reduced by the amount of the targeted jobs tax credit.when calculating its regular tax liability for the tax years at issue,ventas availed itself of the targeted jobs tax credit of section a and complied with the corresponding deduction requirements of section a.
for the,and tax years,ventas was subject to the amt provisions of irc.the purpose of the amt is to ensure that no taxpayer with substantial economic income is able to avoid all tax liability by using exclusions,deductions and credits.ventas.at citing,at,reprinted in,accompanying the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of,stat.according to section a,the amt is a tax equal to the excess if any of the tentative minimum tax for the taxable year,over the regular tax for the taxable year.a.for corporate taxpayers such as ventas,the tentative minimum tax consists of a tax of percent on the alternative minimum taxable income amti.id.b b.thus,amti is the tax base from which a corporation amt liability is calculated.under irc b,amti is defined as the taxable income of the taxpayer for the taxable year a determined with the adjustments provided in section and section and,b increased by the amount of the items of tax preference described in section.id.b.in sum,to calculate one amt liability,it is necessary to first determine the amti.using the amti as the tax base,the tentative minimum tax is determined.the tentative minimum tax is then compared to the regular tax liability.the amt liability is the amount by which the tentative minimum tax exceeds the regular tax liability,and is paid in addition to the taxpayer regular income tax.
it is undisputed that the targeted jobs tax credit of section is not available when calculating amt liability.ventas.at.for this reason,when computing its amti,ventas did not correspondingly reduce its deduction for wages paid as required by section a.in other words,for the purpose of calculating its amti,ventas restored the full deduction for wages paid as if it had not availed itself of the targeted jobs tax credit.as a result,its amti and corresponding tentative minimum tax were lowered,thereby reducing ventas ultimate amt liability.
in october,ventas received notice from the irs of assessed income tax deficiencies for the,and tax years in the amounts of,and,respectively.ventas.at.the irs determined that ventas had miscalculated its amt liability and,as a result,had underpaid its income taxes for those years.specifically,the irs asserted that ventas failure to reduce the deductions for wages paid,in accordance with section a,when calculating its amti was error.ventas paid the assessed deficiencies in may,and thereafter filed amended corporate income tax returns seeking a refund for each of the three tax years at issue.after the irs denied the claims,ventas timely filed suit in the court of federal claims to recover in assessed income taxes,in assessed penalties,and in assessed and statutory interest.id.
in due course,ventas and the government for summary judgment.in its motion,ventas relied on the legislative history of the amt provisions to assert that the regular income tax and the alternative minimum tax are,in essence,two separate tax systems.id.at.thus,according to ventas,because the targeted jobs tax credit is not available under the amt system,neither then should the expense disallowance specified in section a have any application in that system specifically,when computing amti.ventas maintained that i f the purpose of section a,in other words,is to balance a compensating credit it is both illogical and unjust to require that an otherwise allowable deduction be reduced when the benefit of the credit itself is not available.id.
for its part,the government argued that because irc requires that the computation of the alternative minimum income tax base begin with the taxable income of the taxpayer for the taxable year,and since the limitation of section a is part of the calculation of that taxable income,the limitation imposed by section a must by definition be carried through to the calculation of the alternative minimum tax base.id.put differently,the government contended that the same deductions claimed for the regular income tax base must also be used in calculating the amti.thus,the government urged that ventas was not permitted to restore the deductions foregone in its calculation of regular taxable income despite the fact that the reason for relinquishing those deductions in the first targeted jobs tax not applicable in the calculation of the alternative minimum tax.id.
the court of federal claims agreed with the government.it determined that nothing in the amt provisions authorizes the restoration to a taxpayer alternative minimum taxable income of deductions not claimed as part of the regular taxable income base.rather,it is the recapture of tax savings through the disallowance of special treatments that is the organizing principle in the construction of alternative minimum taxable income.id.at.the court thus concluded that a taxpayer that seeks to use the targeted jobs tax credit to reduce its regular tax liability must incorporate the section a limitation into its computation of taxable income for the purpose of both the regular income tax and the alternative minimum tax.id.at.
accordingly,the court of federal claims granted the government summary judgment motion and ruled that ventas was not entitled to its claimed refund.ventas timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
the facts of the case are not in dispute.rather,ventas challenges the court of federal claims interpretation of certain provisions of the internal revenue code.specifically,the case centers on the proper method for calculating amti,which is the tax base for determining amt liability.we review questions of statutory interpretation without deference.am.mut.life ins.united states.
statutory interpretation necessarily begins with the text of the statute.hughes aircraft jacobson,d.under the statute,the starting point for determining amti is taxable income.b.section specifies
