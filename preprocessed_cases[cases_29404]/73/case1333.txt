discussion 
an initial question that we must address is how this appeal comes to us procedurally.the claims court issued its opinion on august and entered judgment pursuant to this opinion on september.however,this opinion cited to the versions of and,instead of the versions which are applicable here.accordingly,the claims court reissued its opinion with corrected citations but no other changes on september and entered judgment the following day.however,just before it did this,on september,plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on the claims court original judgment.appellants argue that this september notice of appeal divested the claims court of its jurisdiction such that it did not have jurisdiction to vacate its original judgment and reissue its opinion.
we disagree with appellants.ordinarily,the act of filing a notice of appeal confers jurisdiction on an appellate court and divests the trial court of jurisdiction over matters related to the appeal.gilda,united states,fed.cir.nevertheless,under rule a of the rules of the court of federal claims,a court may correct a clerical mistake or a mistake arising from oversight or omission whenever one is found in a judgment,order,or other part of the record.a court can make these corrections on its own and without notice,even after a party has appealed.see id.the only constraint is that,after an appeal has been docketed in the appellate court and while it is pending,such a mistake may be corrected only with the appellate court leave.id.
here,appellants are technically correct that their september notice of appeal divested the claims court of its jurisdiction.nevertheless,the claims court still remained able to issue clerical corrections to its opinion,and it did not need to seek our permission to do so until this appeal was docketed,which did not happen until october.the only correction the reissued opinion made was substituting the current versions of and with their versions,and this substitution did not impact the claims court legal analysis.as such,the corrections were sufficiently separated from the claims court substantive analysis to be considered clerical error.pfizer uprichard,cir.t he relevant test for the applicability of rule a is whether the change affects substantive rights of the parties and is therefore beyond the scope of rule a or is instead a clerical error,a copying or computational mistake,which is correctable under the rule.quoting in re,cir.vaughter air lines,cir.as a general proposition,the district court may act under rule a only to correct mistakes or oversights that cause the judgment to fail to reflect what was intended at the time of the trial.corrections or alterations that affect the substantial rights of the parties,however,are beyond the scope of rule a.citations omitted.as such,we have jurisdiction over this case,triggered by appellants september notice of appeal,and we will consider the claims court reissued opinion,which it properly corrected pursuant to fed.civ.a.
we now turn to the claims court dismissal of appellants refund suit under rule b of the rules of the court of federal claims.we review a decision by the claims court to dismiss a case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.bianchi united states,fed.cir.appellants bear the burden of establishing that the court has jurisdiction by a preponderance of evidence.trusted integration,united states,fed.cir.in determining jurisdiction,a court must accept as true all undisputed facts asserted in the plaintiff complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.id.
the sole basis for appellants appeal is that the claims court should have found that their penalties were divisible,such that appellants payments of the dziedzic and kotite portions would have satisfied the full payment rule and allowed the claims court to exercise jurisdiction assuming no other jurisdictional barriers.based on our review of the full payment rule and its divisibility exception,we disagree that the penalties assessed against appellants are divisible.
in general,a person can challenge a penalty assessed by the irs in two ways first,they can appeal to the irs appeals office without paying the penalty b,b,c,e.second,they can pay the penalty,request a refund from the irs,and,if unsuccessful,sue to recover a refund.a a smith united states,fed.cir.although the united states,as a sovereign,is generally immune from suit,a provides the limited waiver of sovereign immunity for refund suits 
a the district courts shall have original jurisdiction,concurrent with the united states court of federal claims,of 
any civil action against the united states for the recovery of any tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected,or any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority or any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected under the laws 
the tucker act,which gives the claims court jurisdiction over suits for which the united states has waived its sovereign immunity,provides the claims court with jurisdiction for refund suits.shore united states,fed.cir.rocovich united states,fed.cir.
in flora,the supreme court determined that a jurisdictional grant includes a full payment requirement,which demands as a jurisdictional prerequisite full payment of the tax or penalty before a party could sue for a refund.at section a,correctly construed,requires full payment of the assessment before an income tax refund suit can be maintained in a federal district court.it did,however,recognize that in cases such as those involving excise taxes where the tax may be divisible into a tax on each transaction or event,satisfaction of the rule would probably require no more than payment of a small amount.id.at.this is because each excise tax is,legally,its own assessment,if a person is taxed per widget for widgets,they receive different assessments,so paying the small amount that is the excise tax for one good would satisfy the full payment rule for that good.see id.
this observation forms the basis for what courts have recognized as the divisibility exception to flora full payment rule.if an assessment or penalty is merely the sum of several independent assessments triggered by separate transactions,korobkin united states,cir,it is considered divisible such that the taxpayer may pay the full amount on one transaction,sue for a refund for that transaction,and have the outcome of this suit determine his liability for all the other,similar transactions.cencast,united states,fed.cir.quoting of chi.united states,cir.in practice,the government will generally counterclaim for the remainder of the tax due and both the paid assessment and the unpaid assessments will be litigated in one action.of chi.at ruth united states,cir.oral argument at,available at.if the government does not counterclaim,the challenger remains free to litigate the paid assessment as a test case 
nevertheless,divisibility remains a narrow exception,korobkin,at,applied when an assessed tax or penalty is the aggregate of independent tax liabilities arising from different transactions.see,cook united states,fed.cl,recognizing that excise tax on sales of diesel fuel and environmental tax on importation of petroleum products are divisible by sale,aff,fed.cir.cencast,at acknowledging that payroll taxes are divisible by employee.where the liability is singular even if the penalty base involves summing multiple figures the assessment is not divisible.see,rocovich,at estate tax not divisible because it arises from a single event korobkin,at penalty for failure to register abusive tax shelter not divisible because it was based on the aggregate of a person abusive tax shelter sales during the year and not assessed on each individual transaction ardalan united states,cir.personal income tax not divisible.
in this case,appellants contend that their penalties are divisible because they were assessed against each of the instances in which they implemented ops or fdis for an individual client.in effect,appellants argue that this case involves different tax shelters which required them to register.in support of their position,appellants emphasize that a separate form the form by which a tax shelter is registered,temp.reg,a,a would need to be filled out for each of the,as it is impossible to know all of the information that this form requires until ops or fdis is implemented for a particular client.appellants also point out that the irs computed the penalty amount under the applicable portion of a,percent of the aggregate amount invested in such tax shelter by computing the aggregate amount invested for each client implementation and summing.accordingly,appellants argue,penalties should be divisible on this basis.
the government takes a different view.in its view,this case involves not tax shelters,but two ops and fdis.the government argues that,with respect to each of these offerings,the penalty is not divisible because liability is triggered by a single event failure to register the tax shelter.the government emphasizes that,under the plain language of a and treasury department regulations,tax shelters must be registered by the first day that interests in the shelter are offered for sale,in this case,ops and fdis had to be registered by the first day appellants offered them to its clients,and failure to do so regardless of how many sales are made with respect to that tax shelter triggers the penalty.the government also counters that neither aggregating transactions to calculate the penalty nor filing separate forms makes the penalty divisible,because the first is only a method of quantifying liability but does not trigger liability itself and the second elevates form over substance.
we agree with the government.section a provides that if a person fails to register such tax shelter such person shall pay a penalty with respect to such registration.this language makes clear that liability for a penalty arises from the single act of failing to register the tax shelter which,under temp.reg,a,a,is failing to file the necessary form s.this omission creates a single source of liability,regardless of how many individuals or transactions are involved in the tax shelter.liability can not be beyond this.
this same principle holds for tax shelters such as the ones at issue that qualify as such because they are substantial investments under c b iii.section c defi
