background 
in,appellant joshua welch,who was then employed as a financial analyst,filed an individual tax return for tax year and paid income taxes in the amount of.welch and appellant alejandra de losada were married in the same year.appellants filed a joint tax return in for tax year and reported ordinary losses in excess of million.appellants also requested a carryback of a portion of these losses to welch tax year.the irs granted the carryback,issuing a refund in the amount of for his tax year.the irs subsequently audited the appellants tax return.during the audit,appellants agreed to extend the statute of limitations with respect to any necessary assessment for the and tax years to december.
in connection with the audit,the irs mailed a letter dated november,letter jointly to welch and de losada informing them that it was denying the ordinary loss claimed in their return.the irs concluded that welch could not support his claim that he was either a or professional gambler and therefore entitled to treat his trading losses as ordinary losses.this denial resulted in a tax deficiency of for.the irs also proposed a twenty percent negligence penalty in the amount of for that tax year.on the same day,the irs mailed a letter to welch individually letter proposing a full disallowance of welch refund of for tax year,which was based on a carryback of the ordinary loss claimed in tax year.
both letters and were mailed to appellants central park west address.although appellants have no recollection of receiving either letter,they do not dispute the mailing or receipt of these letters.at his deposition welch testified that,upon receiving any correspondence from the irs,it was his standard practice to forward such correspondence to their,eric roseman.roseman,in fact,represented welch in an appeal that was ultimately denied to the irs regarding the adjustment proposed in letter and represented both welch and de losada in connection with a similarly unsuccessful appeal relating to letter.in an appeals case memorandum acm dated june,irs personnel made a request to irs counsel for approval to issue a notice of deficiency to welch for tax year and to both appellants for tax year.the acm sets forth a tax deficiency for of,reduced from,and a deficiency of and a penalty of for.a supplemental acm indicating that statutory notice has been approved by district counsel is dated august.both the initial and supplemental acm identify a statute of limitations date of december.tax assessments for the and tax years were subsequently recorded on february.
a tax lien for the tax year was filed against welch on december.in september,the irs issued a final notice of intent to levy for the and tax years appellant,represented by the accounting firm press schonig,requested a collection due process hearing with the irs to protest the filing of the final notice of intent to levy.the irs denied the petition for relief.a tax lien for the tax year was filed against both appellants in june.
on july,appellants filed a petition in the tax court seeking removal of the assessments and cessation of all collection activities.in order to complete an apartment sale while their petition was pending,appellants paid with respect to the lien and with respect to the lien,for a total of,in october.on march,the tax court summarily dismissed the appellants petition as moot since payment on the assessment had been made.
on may,appellants filed two form with the irs,seeking a refund of the in tax deficiencies paid for tax years and.after more than six months elapsed from filing the forms,on december,appellants filed suit in the court of federal claims seeking a refund of the full,alleging overpayment under a on grounds that the deficiencies were both assessed after the expiration of the governing statute of limitations.the court of federal claims had jurisdiction under a and a.
after the close of discovery,the parties filed for summary judgment on whether the irs properly mailed statutory notices of deficiency for the tax years and before december.the parties argued that this issue would be determinative of appellants claims because,if notices of deficiency were mailed before the running of the statute of limitations,those mailings would thereby extend the statute of limitations for assessing appellants income tax.the parties agreed that the assessments were timely even if the statutory notices were never received,as long as they were timely sent.
on may,the court of federal claims granted summary judgment to the government and denied summary judgment to appellants,finding that the irs has demonstrated as a matter of law that it mailed the notices of deficiency for the and tax years.specifically,the court of federal claims determined the irs procedure in manhattan to consist of the following an appeals officer decides to issue a statutory notice of deficiency and personally delivers the case to the appeals processing section the appeals officer enters the preparation of the notice into his or her case activity record the tax examiner then issues the statutory notice of deficiency,date stamping the notice and noting the default date by which the taxpayer must petition the tax court the notice is then sent to the address listed in taxpayer file.the court of federal claims concluded that the existence of the acm indicated compliance with procedural steps and.with regard to steps and,the court noted that appellants file at the irs contains a notice of deficiency for with the correct address and date of default.additional documentation,in the form of mail cards and a control card with tax amounts matching that listed on the certificates of assessments and payment,were also cited by the court of federal claims as additional supporting documentation the court of federal claims found that this evidence collectively raised a presumption that the irs had acted with official regularity and that the appellants did not contradict that presumption.
on these grounds,the court of federal claims found the statute of limitations tolled and collection of deficiencies for both tax years valid.citing united states zolla,cir,the court noted that t he irs is entitled to a presumption of official regularity if it can produce a form and a copy of the notice of deficiency.welch united states.the court went on to find that,even w here the irs is unable to produce these two documents it can raise the same presumption by establishing that it followed a set procedure with respect to the taxpayers and providing corroborating documentation.id.citing united states ahrens,cir.finding that the manhattan irs office both established its own procedure and provided corroborating documentation showing this procedure was followed,the court of federal claims determined that the irs had established,as a matter of law,that it mailed the statutory notices of deficiency for and on september.
appellants timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
we review the court of federal claims grant of summary judgment de novo,with justifiable inferences drawn in favor of the party opposing the judgment.adams united states.we address the relevant legal framework,and then turn to the evidence presented by the government in support of its contention that notices of deficiency were timely mailed.
section of the provides that a tax assessment shall be made by recording the liability of the taxpayer in the office of the secretary in accordance with rules or regulations prescribed by the secretary.under a,the irs is generally required to assess a tax within three years after a tax return is filed.this limitations period may be extended by mutual agreement of the taxpayer and irs,as was done by the parties here to december.c a.the assessment limitations period is also tolled when the irs mails a statutory notice of deficiency to the taxpayer under a.id.a.the assessment limitations period is tolled for ninety days once the notice has been sent to allow the taxpayer to petition the tax court,and then for an additional sixty days if the taxpayer has failed to make such a petition.see id.a,a.once an assessment has been made within the limitations period,the assessed tax may be collected by levy or by court proceeding.id.a.if the irs fails to properly assess the tax,the taxpayer is relieved of the obligation to pay the tax.see id.a,a.
section a provides that the irs may send notice of such deficiency to the taxpayer by certified mail or registered mail.to be effective,actual receipt of the notice of deficiency by the taxpayer is not required.see,keado united states,cir cohen united states,cir we think it clear that the congress,when it authorized service by registered mail,did not intend to require actual receipt by the addressee of the letter.rather,it permitted the use of a method of giving notice that would ordinarily result in such receipt.see also tadros comm r,cir zolla,at.but the government must present competent and persuasive evidence that the statutory notice of deficiency was actually mailed to the taxpayer on a particular date before it can rely on a mailing to toll the statute of limitations.epstein comm r,cch see also keado,at failure to comply precisely with each aspect of each procedure is irrelevant if the evidence adduced is sufficient to prove mailing.
furthermore,while a mentions use of certified or registered mail for sending notice,courts have held that other methods,such as regular mail or hand delivery,may be used.munz comm r,cch,aff,munz comm r,cir.such methods,however,must provide the taxpayer with actual notice of the commissioner determination to be sufficient under section.id.
the government has the burden of proving that notice was sent to the taxpayer.see,united states,cir pietanza comm r,wl aff,cir acq.in part and nonacq.in part recommended by wl may.to facilitate compliance with this burden,the internal revenue service manual section,records of mailing,provides that the record of certified and registered mailing should be kept on ps form together with the mail numbers,which are supplied by the united states postal service.specifically,the manual states that each ps form is to be labeled with,notices of deficiency,for the years indicated,have been sent to the following taxpayers.mail numbers of each individually mailed notice are recorded on the form,along with the name and address of each addressee.multiple addresses are separately entered.in the remarks column of ps form,the tax years to which the notice is applicable is entered.at the post office,the postal employee will compare the mail number of each notice against the number recorded in ps form,and subsequently sign and date ps form.
on appeal,appellants contend that the irs failed to present evidence that it timely mailed notices of deficiency for tax years and,and that therefore,the irs failed to establish that assessment of those deficiencies fell within the statute of limitations.in particular,appellants argue that the failure of the irs to produce a ps form,or the information contained on ps form in a different format,for either notice of deficiency is dispositive.the government does not contend that ps form was properly completed here indeed,it concedes that there is no evidence that,despite recommendation by the internal revenue manual,that the manhattan appeals office even used ps form during the relevant timeframe.instead,the irs argues that a ps form is not necessary in all circumstances and that its production of a notice of deficiency,certified mail cards,and a computer generated control card matching the amounts listed on the certificates of assessment and payment is otherwise sufficient to support its contention that notices of deficiency had been mailed to the appellants.we focus our analysis,accordingly,on whether the evidence presented by the government which did not include use of a ps form or its equivalent is sufficient to demonstrate timely mailing of a notice of deficiency.
while adherence to manual procedures in mailing statutory notices is presumptive proof of mailing,strict compliance has not been legally required by other circuits.see,keado,at.other courts addressing the issue have used a inquiry when examining the irs claims that a notice of deficiency has been sent.see,at coleman comm r,wl see also keado,at zolla,at ahrens,at.first,where the irs has established the existence of a notice of deficiency and produced a properly completed ps form certified mail log,it is entitled to a presumption of mailing,and the burden shifts to the taxpayer to rebut that presumption by clear and convincing evidence.see,at coleman comm r,wl.second,in the absence of proof of a notice of deficiency and a properly completed postal form certified mail log,the irs may meet its burden with evidence that is otherwise sufficient.see,at coleman comm r,wl.while we believe this framework is sound generally,it still begs the question of what evidence is otherwise sufficient for these purposes.
a review of other courts analyses of the sufficiency of the evidence presented to establish timely mailing of a notice of deficiency provides a helpful background to the standard we apply here.in,the government possessed an incomplete copy of the notice of deficiency,as well as an improperly ps form.at.although the defects in each piece of evidence did not entitle the government to a presumption of mailing under the first part of the inquiry,the second circuit held that the incomplete notice and ps form were otherwise sufficient under the second part of the inquiry to establish proof of mailing.id.at.
the eighth circuit in ahrens conducted a similar analysis,also finding in favor of the government.in contrast to,all copies of the notice of deficiency in ahrens had been lost.ahrens,at.the government did,however,produce a properly form,which the court considered highly probative evidence that a notice of deficiency was mailed to the taxpayer.id.at.additionally,the government showed the existence of a deficiency notice through deposition testimony of the taxpayer attorney,who recalled receiving a copy of the notice,as well as through correspondence between the taxpayer and his attorney.id.at.only the validity of the notice contents was therefore in question.in the absence of evidence to the contrary,the court concluded that the contents of the notice could be presumed via the presumption of official regularity that attached upon mailing of the notice.id.at.
in keado,the fifth circuit found proof of mailing of the notice based upon an undated copy of the actual notice an affidavit regarding irs mailing procedures in dallas a receipt for certified mail ps form indicating that a certified letter with the number was sent to the taxpayers home address a deficient ps form a also indicating that certified letter was sent to the taxpayers home address and an affidavit explaining that ps forms and a were used exclusively for mailing notices of deficiency.at.
in zolla,the irs destroyed all copies of the deficiency notices per established routine.the government did,however,offer a completed form certifying th
