the county appeala.the trial court ruling 
the trial court concluded the county is not authorized to impose solid waste collection fees on nonresident property owners who have not contracted for such services.in reaching this decision,the court relied on a recent opinion of this court,california apartment city of stockton th,d caa.plaintiff argues this result is also mandated by isaac city of los angeles th,d isaac.
in caa,property and apartment owners associations sought a writ of mandate to compel the city of stockton and others to comply with public utilities code section,which prohibits municipal corporations that own or operate public utilities from recovering from property owners or subsequent tenants the overdue utility assessments for which a prior tenant had contracted.the trial court denied relief,concluding public utilities code section does not apply to charter cities such as stockton and,in any event,the subject matter of the law is a municipal affair for which state law is not controlling.caa,supra,th at,d.
this court reversed.first,we concluded a charter city is a municipal corporation within the meaning of public utilities code section.caa,supra,th at,d.next,we concluded the state powers over the regulation of utilities is not limited by the city power over municipal affairs.tracing the legislative history of the various constitutional provisions relating to public utilities,we concluded that,while the city has authority to bill and collect for utility services,this authority does not extend to the imposition of an obligation on persons to whom those services were not provided.id.at,d.we explained the authority to bill and collect fees is dependant upon and presupposes the existing law of contractual obligations,to bill and collect from those who are obligated to pay because they have contracted for the utility service.the power to create a civil obligation,by enacting a law imposing an obligation independent of contract citation,is of a different order of authority.ibid.
in isaac,owners and lenders of residential rental properties brought an action seeking a refund of special assessments levied against the properties for delinquent water and electric power bills.the trial court concluded,among other things,the ordinance authorizing the assessments was unlawful,because it created liens not authorized by statute.isaac,supra,th at,d.
the court of appeal affirmed.the court of appeal concluded the utility lien created by the local ordinance did not create a special tax or special assessment and,therefore,could be enforced only
