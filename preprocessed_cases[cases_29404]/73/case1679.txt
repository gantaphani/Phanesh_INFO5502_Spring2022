revenue and taxation code section provides that a real estate property tax refund action may be brought by the person who paid the tax no other person may bring such an action but if another should do so,judgment shall not be rendered for the plaintiff.in this matter,the ibm personal pension plan plan filed suit to recover property taxes and fraud penalties paid on its behalf by the plan trustee,the chase manhattan bank,chase.because we believe that the standing requirement in section means what it says,we conclude that the plan,though the real party in interest,lacks standing to sue.therefore we reverse that part of the judgment awarding the plan in excess of million and otherwise affirm.
the subject property,one market plaza,consists of a commercial office building parcel and a nearby parking garage parcel located in san francisco.in,the one market plaza joint venture joint venture was formed as a general partnership between the equitable life assurance society of the united states equitable,a new york corporation,and southern pacific land company southern pacific,a california corporation.subsequently,the joint venture built two large office towers on one parcel and a parking garage on a second parcel.
in,the plan,an employee benefit plan established by international business machines corporation ibm for the benefit of ibm former employees,asked its investment advisor,equitable,to develop proposals for the plan to invest in a portfolio of office buildings.at the time,the subject property was owned by the joint venture equitable held a percent interest and the remainder was held by southern pacific.in december,equitable and the plan entered into a complex transaction characterized as a group annuity contract by which the plan acquired percent of equitable percent interest in the joint venture thus percent of the whole that was placed into separate account,established and maintained by equitable exclusively on behalf of the plan.in exchange,the plan deposited million,representing percent of the subject property fair market value,into separate account.such separate accounts are highly regulated transactions authorized by the insurance laws of california and new york,through which insurance companies sell annuities backed by assets placed into separate accounts,segregated from the insurance company general assets and,therefore,beyond the reach of the company general creditors.it is undisputed that the insurance laws of california and new york treat assets placed in the separate account of an insurance company as legally remaining the property of the insurer here,equitable,not the beneficiary here,the plan.see,subd.a ins.law,subd.a.
the transfer of ownership of california real estate triggers a reassessment of the property under article xiii a of the california constitution proposition and a recalculation of the property taxes due.as a result of the transaction and subsequent transactions,equitable retained legal title to the subject property and remained a general partner in the joint venture,but the transactions in substance transferred beneficial ownership to the plan.following the transaction,the plan bore the risks and benefits of ownership of percent of the property.income from rents on the plan share of the property were paid to the plan through the separate account.in addition,pursuant to the transaction,the plan had the power to hire the manager for the property and demand that equitable transfer its remaining interest in the property to the plan.as a result of subsequent transactions,equitable held a nominal percent interest in the joint venture,with percent of that interest allocated to separate account on the plan behalf.none of these transactions was ever reported to the assessor for the city and county of san francisco assessor.
in march,equitable and the plan entered into a second group annuity contract and created separate account,into which equitable reallocated all of its interest in the joint venture from separate account at this point,the subject property was still owned by the joint venture,which,itself,was percent owned by equitable on the plan behalf.also in march,equitable notified its property insurer to terminate coverage of the subject property effective march,because as of that date equitable would no longer have an ownership interest in the subject property.
in june,the remaining percent interest in the joint venture was sold by equitable variable life insurance company,equitable wholly owned subsidiary,to the plan wholly owned subsidiary,one market plaza.in november,the plan,identifying itself as the owner of the subject property,replaced equitable management company as the manager of the subject property with the plan own manager,the yarmouth group.thereafter,equitable had no management responsibility for the subject property.
in june,the plan terminated the second annuity contract and special account in order to transfer the subject property to a third party purchaser,and directed equitable to transfer the proceeds from the sale to the plan.in,the subject property was sold to the unrelated third party.in november,ibm,chase,as trustee for the plan,and equitable executed a release and indemnification agreement providing that upon completion of the sale of the subject property,the separate account and the joint venture were dissolved and the plan was given all rights and liabilities arising from any reassessments and all rights to recover any overpayment of taxes and penalties.the plan remained the sole remaining partner of the joint venture for purposes of the ensuing appeals before the aab.
following an investigation of the ownership of the subject property begun in or around january,the assessor concluded that the transaction constituted a change of ownership under the revenue and taxation code in particular,the assessor determined that the transaction represented a transfer of percent of the beneficial ownership in the subject property from equitable to the plan in exchange for the plan payment to equitable of percent of the subject property fair market value.the assessor concluded that,as a result of the transaction,equitable transferred to the plan all rights of ownership,including the right to manage,receive rent from and sell the subject property thereafter,the assessor gave equitable,as the owner of record of the subject property,notice that the property had been reassessed through a series of supplemental and escape assessments for the through tax roll years.
in november,the assessor notified equitable that a percent fraud penalty was being imposed pursuant to section for the years through based on the failure to report the transaction as a change of ownership in,following authorization by ibm,chase wired approximately million to the city and county of san francisco city as payment of these fraud penalties 
in,chase,as trustee for the plan,filed an action in federal district court seeking a declaratory judgment that the assessor determination that the creation of the separate account constituted a change of ownership under california law was preempted by erisa.see chase manhattan bank,city and county of san francisco cir.after the district court dismissed the case,the ninth circuit upheld the district court determination that the erisa issue could be raised in state court.id.at.
aab proceedings 
the aab received applications from equitable and the joint venture for a reduction in and a refund of the penalty and nonpenalty assessments imposed for the tax years to through to.the applications challenged three determinations by the assessor the conclusion that a change of ownership of the subject property occurred in the valuation of the subject property for the years triggered by the change in ownership and the imposition of a fraud penalty for the tax years.in august,following a hearing,the aab issued its written findings of fact,conclusions of law,and decision,which upheld the assessor.thereafter,the city and the assessor notified the aab that the taxpayer was due a partial refund as a result of the aab decision that the property should in part be valued at a lower rate than the assessor originally used to calculate the escape and supplemental assessments on march,in response to requests by the parties,the aab issued a clarification of its prior order stating that the assessor could properly apply the fraud penalty only to the office complex parcel and could not apply the penalty to the parking garage parcel.as a result,the subject property was entitled to an additional refund of approximately million.
the instant action 
in february,the plan filed the instant verified complaint in san francisco superior court against the city and the aab,challenging the conclusion that the transaction constituted a change of ownership and seeking a refund of approximately million plus interest imposed as a result of the reassessed valuation of the subject property,and almost million in taxes and interest imposed as a fraud penalty.alternatively,it sought a writ of administrative mandate compelling the aab to conduct a new hearing on the grounds that the aab abused its discretion by applying incorrect legal principles,considering evidence outside the administrative record and denying the plan its right to due process.the complaint also sought a declaration that the fraud penalty assessment was preempted by erisa.during the trial court proceedings,the plan narrowed the relief sought to a full refund of the fraud penalties imposed,or in the alternative,to a partial refund of the fraud penalties imposed on the garage site based on the clarification order.
in may,the assessor filed a petition for writ of administrative mandamus code civ,against the aab and the city seeking to set aside the march clarification order on the ground that the aab lacked jurisdiction to modify the substance of its august decision.the actions of the plan and the assessor were consolidated.
the trial court upheld the aab tax fraud ruling,determining,among other issues,that the plan had standing to bring its refund action and that the aab had jurisdiction to issue its clarification order,eliminating the fraud penalty assessments for tax years through for the garage parcel of the subject property.thereafter,a judgment of plus interest issued in favor of the plan as a refund of fraud penalties paid in regard to the garage parcel,but against the plan on its claim for a refund of the other fraud penalties paid.
discussion 
the city and the aab contend that the plan lacked standing to bring the instant action for a refund of fraud penalties paid because it did not pay the challenged penalties.standing is a question of law that we review de novo.mckee orange unified school dist.th,d.in addition,the interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions to stipulated and unstipulated facts present questions of law.chen franchise tax board th,d.

section applies to actions seeking the refund of fraud penalties 
we first address the plan contention that section does not apply to an action for refund of fraud penalties,but only applies to an action for refund of taxes.in support of the contention,the plan notes section refers to taxes,not penalties.it also notes that article refunds generally referred to in section,is contained within chapter refunds of part corrections,cancellations,and refunds of the property taxation division of the revenue and taxation code,while sections and pertaining to fraud penalties are contained in article arbitrary and penal assessments of chapter assessment generally of part assessment of the property taxation division of the revenue and taxation code.the plan argues that because sections and are included within a different part of the property taxation division,section does not apply to actions seeking the refund of fraud penalties.we disagree.
article,referred to in section,includes section,which provides,as used in this article refunds generally,tax or taxes includes penalties,interest,and costs.section is a general definitional section which defines the scope of tax refunds to include penalties and interest paid by a taxpayer in connection with tax payments.ball county of los angeles d.it reflects the notion that a penalty which is created by statute for failure to pay a tax assessment becomes part of the tax.citations.sonleitner superior court d.
