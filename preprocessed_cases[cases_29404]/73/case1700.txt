introduction 
in this appeal we deal with a technical question within the overall framework of proposition proposition inflation cap should be calculated based on the original purchase price of the property,or whether it always applies against any intervening previous year reassessed value.we conclude that the intent of the drafters of proposition,as it was amended in within six months of its passage by proposition,a measure for which paul gann himself the ballot argument,is that the inflation factor is calculated against the original purchase price.indeed,as our supreme court pointed out in upholding proposition in amador valley joint union high sch.dist.state bd.of equalization cal d,one of the major planks of proposition was the transition from a fair market value system in which your property taxes were pegged,if your property was reassessed,to the fair market value of your property to an original purchase price system.calculating the inflation cap based on a previous year reassessed value is fundamentally inconsistent with the system that proposition put in place.
renee bezaire and robert pool own a home in seal beach which they bought for in november.accordingly,in the orange county assessor enrolled the value of the property at that sum.
like many other properties in california in the,the property did gain any value in,and was enrolled the next year at the same value 
property values did better in,so the assessor increased the value to,which is two percent for each year for the two years,compounded,based on the original purchase price.but is four percent more than the previous year assessment of,with a resulting increase of four percent over the previous year tax bill.
bezaire and pool then applied to the county assessment appeals board for a reduction in the assessment,which would result in a tax refund for them.the board decided in their favor.that is,it reduced the assessment to an amount that was two percent over the previous year,or.
the county then filed a petition for a writ of mandate against the assessment appeals board.hence,unlike most property tax cases,the title of this case is the county versus the taxpayer,not the taxpayer versus the county.in answering the petition,bezaire and pool filed a as a class action on behalf of similarly situated taxpayers.because we ultimately decide this case on the merits against bezaire and pool,we do not address the propriety of the as a class action.
the case came to trial on a set of stipulated facts.the court ruled in favor of bezaire and pool.the trial judge delivered his ruling in a written statement of decision.there,he reasoned that under proposition in no event may a property tax increase ever exceed two percent over the previous year.elaborating,he wrote that the promise of proposition is not just a limit,but a one as well.that is,the adjusted tax base will also not exceed more than the year before.otherwise,there could be huge increases from one year to the next in some circumstances as long as the per year maximum times the number of years limit is exceeded.the court later entered a judgment denying the county petition for a writ of mandate and declaring the recapture method of assessments,the inflation clause in proposition applies only long term,figured on the initial base purchase price to be unconstitutional.the county appealed.
iii.discussion 
in determining this appeal,we look at three things.first is the actual text of proposition as it now stands that is,as modified by proposition in.second is the technical structure of proposition the various clauses fit together and what that fit can tell us about the way proposition is supposed to work.the third is what we can glean historically from the intent of the drafters of proposition and proposition,which modified it early on.
a.the bare text of proposition 
we start,as innumerable cases instruct us to do,with the exact constitutional text at issue,edelstein city and county of san francisco cal th,d,first,we turn to the text of the free speech clause thompson department of corrections cal th,d,in interpreting a constitution provision,our paramount task is to ascertain the intent of those who enacted it to determine that intent,we look first to the language of the constitutional text,giving the words their ordinary meaning leone medical board cal th,d,source of previous quote see also armstrong county of san mateo d.in a case construing the inflation clause of proposition,beginning with the question of whether the meaning of the constitutional language was clear or uncertain.
here is the subject text as it currently reads the full cash value base may reflect from year to year the inflationary rate not to exceed percent for any given year or reduction as shown in the consumer price index or comparable data for the area under taxing jurisdiction,or may be reduced to reflect substantial damage,destruction or other factors causing a decline in value.
let us begin by acknowledging that this language is capable of more than one meaning and therefore ambiguous.that not surprising in the case where the california supreme court originally upheld proposition against a constitutional attack,amador valley joint union high sch.dist.state bd.of equalization,supra,cal d,our high court specifically noted that some provisions of proposition were,in fact,ambiguous.see amador valley,at,acknowledging as we must that article xiii a in a number of particulars is imprecise and ambiguous.indeed,in another context the time when proposition inflation factor was to commence,either or,a court has already held this specific clause to be ambiguous 
there are two ways that this language can be read.if you read may for shall not under any circumstances and sometimes,particularly in colloquial usage may does mean that,parent to child no,you may not go to the concert,you been grounded for the week and if you assume that not to exceed percent for any given year implies not to exceed percent over the previous year then,yes,you can read the text the way the trial court did,that is,an absolute limit of two percent figured against the previous year.
the second way is to read it to mean that the full cash value base is limited to annual increases of two percent,and look elsewhere for exactly when that base is established,which could have been some years earlier.that elsewhere is in the previous subdivision of the same section of article xiii a,subdivision a of section as distinct from subdivision b.and there you discover that the full cash value base is established by the value on the tax bill,or at the time of purchase,or when there is genuine new construction as distinct from mere reconstruction.but there is no reference in the definition of the base to any declines in value.
there are two serious problems with the first interpretation.let start with the less obvious one.the interpretation necessarily reads the word given as in not to exceed percent for any given year or reduction to include an implied reference to what is not there,a previous year if there was a reassessment.if this interpretation is to hold water,there should be some reference to such a previous reassessed value.there is.
now consider the importance of the interpretation of the question of exactly when the full cash value is established.if the idea were to limit the taxes in any one year to no more than the taxes in the previous year assuming,of course,that there had been a reassessment since the original purchase,there would be a simple way to do it.use the word previous or reassessed in such a way that the reader is clear that,if there ever is reassessment reflecting a reduction in the full cash value base because of a decline in fair market value,the next year base is figured on the previous year base.
the omission of such words is thus itself significant.it leaves a gaping hole pointing in the direction that the drafters of the inflation cap were thinking in terms of limiting base increases to two percent over the previous year,but in terms of the original establishment of the base at time of acquisition.and given the importance of the omission,the presumption is that the omission was deliberate.it would therefore be error for a court to select an interpretation which inserted the words previous or reassessed value of the year before into the text where they had been deliberately omitted.see ross city of long beach cal d,to insert these suggested words into this section of the constitution would give it an added meaning not to be found in the definite language of the section as adopted by the people.people campbell cal,the constitution is to be interpreted by the language in which it is written,and courts are no more at liberty to add provisions to what is therein declared in definite language than they are to disregard any of its express provisions.
the more obvious reason is the little word may in the opening sentence.
may is not at all the word you would use if you were serious about absolutely limiting nominal increases in property taxes to two percent over the previous year,regardless of whether the previous year taxes were the result of some temporary event reflected in a downward reassessment.you say shall.
generally speaking,of course,the word may is can do it if you want,but you are being forced the word shall is way you can do it.see,woodbury th,d ordinarily,the word may connotes a discretionary or permissive act the word shall connotes a mandatory or directory duty.decker registry,th,d generally explaining that may is discretionary,shall is mandatory see also dean kuchel cal d,the word may is at least reasonably susceptible of a permissive meaning rather than mandatory or prohibitory.
while there are times when may has more stick in it than it ordinarily no,you may not do that sorts of it is contrasted in the same usage with shall,it takes its usual,more permissive meaning.and here it is indeed contrasted with shall.in the critical section of proposition that limits property taxes to one percent article xiii a,section,subdivision a,the maximum amount shall not exceed one percent,the word shall is used.and because of that contrast,we must conclude that the drafters of article xiii a,section,subdivision b meant the word may in a permissive sense.see common cause board of supervisors cal d,may is permissive and shall is mandatory particularly when both terms are used in the same statute see also briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,d,where different words or phrases are used in the same connection in different parts of a statute,it is presumed the legislature intended a different meaning.
why use a permissive may instead of a mandatory shall that will become very clear in the section of this opinion where we discuss the intent of the drafters of the inflation cap.for the moment,suppose you want to have a system where taxes can go down or stay the same because of an intervening reassessment in light of something unexpected,like a fire,or perhaps even merely because as in the case before us,fair market values decline or stagnate for a period of time.but suppose also that you want to have a system where if property values recovered,taxes could go up again,all the time subject to the inflation cap without a formal reassessment.if that is what you wanted,you say may,to give assessors flexibility.and that is precisely what we have here.by using may,the drafters of the inflation cap underscored the idea that adjustments in the base for declines in fair market value were temporary.
the temporary nature of any reassessment for a decline in value can not be overstressed.by definition,the problem we deal with in the case before us involves only such temporary declines.
if,for some reason,your house declines in value and,after reassessment,its value stays there,there is no argument.under proposition,assessments can not be any higher than a property fair market value.see metropolitan culinary services,county of los angeles th,d under proposition,taxes are limited to either the lower of fair market value or base year value.
as between two alternative interpretations of language,courts prefer the interpretation which is the more natural and logical.see bay cities paving grading,lawyers mutual ins.cal th,d,manneck lawyers title ins.th,d in re marriage of smith maescher th,d troughton eakle,estate of dubois d,in re navarro d.we therefore conclude that,of the two possible interpretations,reading the inflation cap to apply to the original acquisition cost base or new construction when that really does occur,rather than a base calculated on any intervening downward reassessment,is the more logical and natural,and therefore the one courts must prefer.
our conclusion is reinforced by the way in which our supreme court has had incidental occasion to describe the operation of the inflation cap.while those descriptions are not dispositive they were descriptions in passing of how proposition works,they show that someone just reading the language of the inflation cap would not necessarily come to the conclusion which the trial court did.
in the amador valley decision,the court observed that subdivision b permits a maximum percent annual increase in the fair market value base of real property to reflect the inflationary rate.amador valley,supra,cal d at,emphasis added.those words note the general reference to the inflationary rate as distinct from something like increase over the previous year indicate that the description is of a cap,not of a cap.
the same observation was made later in the opinion.the court had occasion to parenthetically paraphrase the operation of the inflation clause after quoting another part of proposition verbatim article xiii a,section,subdivision a.in those parentheses the court again described the operation of the clause in terms of an overall,cap,not a,cap,subd.b,permits an annual percent maximum increase on the fair market value base of property,to reflect the inflationary rate.amador valley,supra,cal d at.
our high court also read the inflation cap language the same way in city and county of san francisco county of san mateo cal th,d.that case involved the relatively abstruse question of whether proposition applies to property which is itself owned by a city,but outside of the city territorial jurisdiction.think of los angeles owning land near mono lake as part of its water system.first it said,it meaning proposition limits the valuation of real property owned since the assessment date to the full cash value of the property,increased for inflation by a maximum of percent annually.city and county of san francisco county of san mateo,supra,cal th at,d.
five pages later the court was even plainer in reading the inflation factor clause to apply to an original base,and not any intervening previous year under article xiii a,the only time full cash value equals fair market value is in the year when real property subject to appraisal at fair market value is first purchased,newly constructed,or otherwise changes ownership.thereafter,the full cash value of the property increases according to the rate of inflation to a maximum of percent per year,and not according to the increase in fair market value.city and county of san francisco county of san mateo,supra,cal th at,d,emphasis added.
while these comments from the high court cases are not dispositive in themselves,they do conclusively refute bezaire and pool argument that the language of inflation cap requires a interpretation.seven justices of our supreme court,just reading the language for the purpose of a general description of how proposition works,did find the bezaire and pool interpretation so obvious that they could come up with a description incongruous with that interpretation.and in fact,as we have shown,the supreme court merely read the language as it more naturally reads,not requiring a cap or calculating the inflation base from an intervening downward reassessment.
b.the structure of the text 
now we examine the legal framework into which the bare text is placed.it also points in the direction of a inflation cap based on the original purchase price.
when proposition was approved in june,property taxes were governed by article xiii of our state constitution.article xiii provided for a fair market value system of property taxation which basically
