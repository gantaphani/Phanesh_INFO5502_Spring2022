this case concerns the assessment of ad valorem taxes by the county of orange county against the personal property,including manufacturing supplies,expensed equipment and office space partitions,used by hughes aircraft company hughes,a defense contractor,in the performance of government contracts.we are asked to determine whether title to such property passes to the united states government government in accordance with the federal acquisition regulation far,code of federal regulations part,with respect to government contracts with progress payments,and code of federal regulations part with respect to government contracts,such that,when in the possession of hughes,the property is not subject to local taxation.
hughes is a defense contractor,which has performed multiple and various contracts for different government agencies.in connection with its operations,hughes operated facilities within the county for the years through.during that time,hughes maintained more than separate contracts with the government for the design and fabrication of electronic systems for the department of defense.those government contracts were subject to the far and the united states cost accounting standards cas.the contracts at issue in this case were either cost reimbursement c or fixed price d contracts.
contracts are government contracts pursuant to which the government reimburses hughes for all costs necessarily and properly incurred in the performance of the contracts plus a fixed fee.the costs include both direct costs charged to a particular contract and allocated indirect costs.part c provides that title to any property acquired by hughes in the performance of contracts passes to the government at the time it is acquired.such contracts are generally used when costs can not be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use the alternative contract with the contractor.
contracts are government contracts under which the agreed consideration for contract completion is fixed.as stated,the qualifying contracts involved in this case were financed by the government under the progress payments clauses of far,part,pursuant to which the contractor issues periodic invoices based on a percentage of its projected costs incurred to date.under the progress payments clauses,title to property acquired by the contractor for contract performance passes to the government when the property is allocated or charged to the given contract.d.although the amounts of the progress payments are computed based upon a formula which takes into account costs incurred to date,they are not payments.rather,the contractor assumes the risk of completion with no guarantee whatsoever that its actual costs will be recovered from the progress payments received.
in the performance of its government contracts,hughes acquired certain supplies,expensed equipment and office partitions this property was purchased under indirect accounts,it was not charged to a particular hughes contract,and consistent with the prescribed and applicable cas and the far,was allocated among all of hughes government contracts.property purchased on such indirect accounts is often referred to as overhead property.
in the,and tax years tax years,the assessor for the county assessed all of the subject overhead property as hughes property,without regard to allocation between the qualifying contracts and the nonqualifying contracts.hughes paid taxes on the overhead property and then,pursuant to revenue and taxation code sections and,timely filed applications for reduction of assessment and claims for refund for the tax years with the county assessment appeals board.hughes contended that a portion of the taxes paid on the overhead property should be excluded from assessment because title resided with the government.hughes and the county have stipulated to the percentage of hughes costs to purchase the overhead property during the relevant years at each of its facilities,which costs were incurred in performing qualifying government contracts.the amounts of tax in dispute for each tax year are as follows 
after timely exhausting its administrative remedies in this matter,hughes initiated this action on may,seeking a refund of ad valorem taxes paid to the county.specifically,hughes complaint sought a recovery of in taxes together with accrued interest.the matter was submitted on stipulated facts,exhibits,and the arguments of counsel.counsel for hughes cited to the case of aerospace state bd.of equalization d.aerospace,while counsel for the county relied on trw space defense sector county of los angeles th,d trw.
after considering the matter,on december,the trial court issued a minute order wherein it stated this case came to trial at a time when there was no perfect binding precedent.then came the anticipated guidance of the appellate ruling in trw.not surprisingly,a ruling there in favor of the county of los angeles led the county of orange to insist that that decision is decisive on all issues presented by hughes aircraft is sic the case before the court.this court has concluded otherwise,however,for two principal reasons.the first of these is item in these parties stipulation of facts relating to ownership of the subject property.that may be the most important fact in this case,and it is a notable distinction from the trw situation.second,the earlier opinion in aerospace still seems to apply to the present situation and require judgment in favor of the plaintiff.
on february,judgment was entered for refund of taxes overpaid by hughes in the sums of for tax year for for for for,and for,plus interest on such sums.this appeal followed.

discussion 
because this case involves the assessment of ad valorem taxes,resolution of the issues raised by the parties depends on the answer to the question do the title provisions in parts and vest title to hughes overhead property in the government in order to answer this question,we consider the power of a state to tax a federal contractor,the facts of this case,the far,and applicable case law.
a.the state power to tax a federal contractor.
whether a state has the power to tax a federal contractor has been adequately discussed in trw,supra,th,d.citing to general dynamics county of cal d,the trw court concluded that i f the property belongs to the federal government,not to the contractor,and the tax is construed as being an ad valorem property tax,the tax can not be constitutionally imposed i f the property belongs to the federal government and not to the contractor,and the tax is construed as being either a use tax or a tax on beneficial possession,the tax is constitutionally permissible but can only be imposed if state law permits the imposition of such a tax and i f the property belongs to the contractor and not to the federal government,an ad valorem property tax can be imposed trw,supra,th,d.we agree with the trw court conclusion and now turn to the question of who has title to hughes overhead property.
according to the parties stipulation,the overhead property in this case was consumed or used in the performance of qualifying government contracts.the overhead property was described as consisting of supplies,expensed equipment and partitions.supplies includes materials consumed in the production process,such as welding supplies,plating compounds,abrasives,brushes,anodes,acids,sandpaper and emery cloth,as well as artist and drafting supplies,and general office supplies.expensed equipment includes durable low cost items of equipment purchased for general use with a life expectancy of less than months,such as low cost laboratory and test equipment,small tools,jigs,dies,molds,patterns,taps,gauges,and similar manufacturing aids,as well as drafting equipment,lamps,calculators and blackboards.partitions consists of movable office space dividers used at hughes various business locations to establish work areas for performance of hughes contracts.all of the overhead property was accounted for by hughes as indirect cost items allocated among all of hughes contracts,rather than directly to particular contracts.to the extent that hughes used the overhead property in the performance of the government contracts,it was reimbursed by the government.after completion of contract work,any remaining expensed equipment or partitions were sold by hughes at bid sale,and the proceeds credited back to the government.
the contracts at issue were either cost reimbursement c or fixed price d contracts.they specifically and expressly incorporated by reference either the contract title clauses or the progress payment title clauses,dependent upon the type of government contract involved 
there are parts to the far.the first parts constitute substantive regulatory law.part is an appendix with various sample clauses that may be used to implement the regulations.only the segments of part that are incorporated in the contract become the basis of the contract.part is an appendix of sample forms.
the far is organized into parts,subparts,sections,subsections,paragraphs and subparagraphs.the number to the left of the decimal point represents the part number,part c means part.each part begins with a provision,which defines the scope of that part.this is followed by a definitions section,often designated as,that contains important definitions to aid the reader in understanding the subsequent regulations of that part.the first number to the right of the decimal point represents the subpart,part c means subpart.the second and third digits to the right of the decimal identify the section,part c means section.the number to the right of the hyphen is the subsection,part c means subsection.any notations that are in parentheses and follow the section or subsection number represent paragraph and subparagraph numbers.again,for example,a citation to part c refers to far part,subpart,section,subsection,paragraph c,and subparagraph.
according to hughes,its contracts that included part transferred title to the overhead property used in performance of those contracts to the government.
contracts c.
pursuant to part f,part must be incorporated in all contracts.part c contains the title clause,which provides that title to property purchased by the contractor vests in the government if its costs are reimbursable to the contractor.that part states as follows title.the government shall retain title to all property.title to all property purchased by the contractor for which the contractor is entitled to be reimbursed as a direct item of cost under this contract shall pass to and vest in the government upon the vendor delivery of such property.title to all other property,the cost of which is reimbursable to the contractor,shall pass to and vest in the government upon i issuance of the property for use in contract performance ii commencement of processing of the property f or use in contract performance or iii reimbursement of the cost of the property by the government,whichever occurs first.all property and all property acquired by the contractor,title to which vests in the government under this paragraph collectively referred to as government property,are subject to the provisions of this clause.title to government property shall not be affected by its incorporation into or attachment to any property not owned by the government,nor shall government property become a fixture or lose its identity as personal property by being attached to any real property.
to summarize the above,the government has title to three types of property pursuant to part c,namely,property property the contractor purchases for which he is entitled to be reimbursed as a direct item of cost and all other property,the cost of which is reimbursable to the contractor,such as indirect cost items.logically,a contractor will not recover any costs for property for the obvious reason that the contractor did not incur any costs in obtaining the property.equally obvious is the fact that the contractor will be reimbursed for its direct costs,that property which can be traced to having been purchased directly for use in fulfilling the government contract.thus,the third category of property must refer to indirect cost property overhead property for which the contractor is also entitled to be reimbursed.by their nature,indirect costs are incapable of being specifically identified with a particular contract.
hughes was required to disclose to the government all of its anticipated direct and indirect costs for each government contract.cas program requirements.because indirect costs,by definition,can not be identified to each particular contract,hughes was required to agree in advance on the percentages of its indirect costs allocable to each of its government and private contracts.while items of overhead property are not incorporated into identifiable goods sold to the government,they are purchased by the government through its reimbursement of the contractor indirect costs.part b specifically provides that i ndirect costs shall be accumulated by logical cost groupings with due consideration of the reasons for incurring such costs which is further augmented by paragraph d which states that t he contractor method of allocating indirect costs shall be in accordance with standards promulgated by the cas cost accounting standards board 
according to the parties stipulations,hughes calculated the percentage of its indirect costs allocable to each of its government contracts.hughes was then reimbursed by the government for those indirect costs.the allowable costs and payment clause at part establishes the methodology for the submission of the contractor properly allocated indirect costs so as to be allowable,as well as the mechanism for reimbursement of those indirect costs by the government.part a requires the insertion of the allowable costs and payment clause in every contract.such clause was included in hughes government contracts.this clause sets up the submission mechanism procedure for the contractor to invoice its costs incurred so as to receive cost reimbursement payments for its allowable costs.the clause provides the indirect costs linkage to the all other property provision of part c.
part,in relevant part,provides b reimbursing costs.for the purpose of reimbursing allowable costs the term costs includes only i those recorded costs that,at the time of the request for reimbursement,the contractor has paid by cash,check,or other form of actual payment for items or services purchased directly for the contract ii when the contractor is not delinquent in paying costs of contract performance in the ordinary course of business,costs incurred,but not necessarily paid,for f properly allocable and allowable indirect costs,as shown in the records maintained by the contractor for purposes of obtaining reimbursement under government contracts italics added.
clearly,the above paragraph evidences the government obligation to pay for a contractor allocable and allowable indirect costs when submitted in accordance with the clause procedures,the far and the cas.more importantly,it shows that the government has purchased the indirect property used by the contractor by reimbursing it for its properly allowable and allocable indirect costs.by purchasing the indirect cost property,the government receives absolute title through the language of part c which states that t itle to all other property,the cost of which is reimbursable to the contractor,shall pass to and vest in the government italics added.
part h further reinforces the government intent to take title under part c to indirect cost property that it has purchased through reimbursement of indirect costs as follows final payment.the contractor shall pay to the government any refunds,rebates,credits,or other amounts including interest,if any accruing to or received by the contractor or any assignee under this contract,to the extent that those amounts are properly allocable to costs for which the contractor has been reimbursed by the government again,according to the parties stipulation of facts,hughes did in fact,credit to the government the proceeds obtained from the bid sale of any remaining expensed equipment or partitions.
by reading part c together with part b e and h,it is clear that title to hughes overhead property passed to the government by virtue of the government payment to hughes to reimburse it for the monies spent on such property.having paid hughes for the overhead property,the government bought the property and thus acquired title.upon hughes sale of any unused overhead property,the government logically expected,and was given,credit for the proceeds obtained.the easiest way for the government to enforce that expectation is to ensure that it acquires title to the property for which it has reimbursed the contractor.it has done so by virtue of the other property language found in part c.
contracts d.
likewise,hughes contends that title to its overhead property used in fulfilling the government contracts which included was also transferred to the government.
part d provides that title to property described in that paragraph vests in the government upon the date of the contract or when it is allocable or properly charged to the contract.it provides as follows d title.title to the property described in this paragraph d shall vest in the government.vestiture shall be immediately upon the date of this contract,for property acquired or produced before that date.otherwise,vestiture shall occur when the property is or should have been allocable or properly chargeable to this contract.property,as used in this clause,includes all of the items acquired or produced by the contractor that are or should be allocable or properly chargeable to this contract under sound and generally accepted accounting principles and practices.i parts,materials,inventories,and work in process ii special tooling and special test equipment to which the government is to acquire title under any other clause of this contract iii nondurable,noncapital tools,jigs,dies,fixtures,molds,patterns,taps,gauges,test equipment,and other similar manufacturing aids,title to which would not be obtained as special tooling under subparagraph ii above and iv drawings and technical data,to the extent the contractor or subcontractors are required to deliver them to the government by other clauses of this contract.although title to property is in the government under this clause,other applicable clauses of this contract,the termination or special tooling clauses,shall determine the handling and disposition of the property.the contractor may sell any scrap resulting from production under this contract without requesting the contracting officer approval,but the proceeds shall be credited against the costs of performance.
looking at the above language,hughes overhead property clearly falls within the categories of property contemplated.we disagree with the county contention and the trw court finding that the above listing is exclusive and not illustrative.we look to the words used in the clause and note that there are no restrictive words.had the government intended to limit the property affected by part d,it could have stated so by simply using different language.for example,in place of property,as used in this clause,includes all of the items it could have said,property,as used in this clause,includes only the items or it could have said,property,as used in this clause,includes all of the items,except as follows having failed to provide such limiting language,we find the better interpretation of the clause is to say it is illustrative.
nonetheless,county references part highlighted in the brief for amici curiae counties of santa barbara,alameda,butte,el dorado,fresno,glenn,kern,and solano and county assessors of the counties of santa barbara,los angeles,san diego and santa clara and argues that that part serves the same function in fixed price contracts as does in cost reimbursement contracts.county argues that because contains no reference to any indirect cost property,no indirect cost property passes as a result of this clause.
part,in relevant part,provides c title in government property.the government shall retain title to all property.all property and all property acquired by the contractor,title to which vests in the government under this paragraph are subject to the provisions of this clause title to each item of facilities and special test equipment acquired by the contractor for the government under this contract shall pass to and vest in the government when its use in performing this contract commences or when the government has paid for it,whichever is earlier,whether or not title previously vested in the government.if this contract contains a provision directing the contractor to purchase material for which the government will reimburse the contractor as a direct item of cost under this contract i title to material purchased from a vendor shall pass to and vest in the government upon the vendor delivery of such material and ii title to all other material shall pass to and vest in the government upon a issuance of the material for use in contract performance b commencement of processing of the material or its use in contract performance or c reimbursement of the cost of the material by the government,whichever occurs first.
referring to part,amici argue that i t is illogical that if the specific government title clause for the type of contract does not envision any transfer of indirect cost property,that another clause would do so by indirect reference see above discussion.we disagree for two reasons.first,both parts and are contained in hughes contracts.thus,one must not be read to the exclusion of the other.and second,part d notes that title to certain property may be acquired pursuant to other clauses of the contract,part.to the extent that the indirect cost property is not included in part,part provides for its inclusion.
relevant case law.
having stated our interpretation of the far parts applicable to the case before us,we now turn to the relevant case law that has been relied upon by the parties to support their positions.significantly,we note that the trw case stands out as a challenge to the rationale of the cases relied upon by hughes.
in trw,supra,th,d,summary judgment was entered in favor of a government contractor for recovery of property taxes.the trial court found that title to overhead property,consumable supplies and material,and office and plant equipment,vested in the government and was thus immune from taxation.like this case,the trw case involved both fixed price d and cost reimbursement c contracts.also,the cost of the overhead property was reimbursed by the government.on appeal,our colleagues in division four of the second district reversed with directions to enter summary judgment for the county,holding that the overhead property was not property of the government.
in reaching its decision regarding part contracts,trw relied primarily on part.part defines the scope of part as follows this part prescribes policies and procedures for providing government property to contractors,contractors use and management of government property,and reporting,redistributing,and disposing of contractor inventory.it does not apply to property to which the government has acquired a lien or title solely because of partial,advance,or progress payments or to disposal of real property.according to trw,t his means that although the title clause found in far part is the contract,the clause does not apply to certain for which the g overnment has made partial,advance,or progress payments.that is,far part can not be the predicate for a claim of federal ownership of the property if the g overnment was making payments to reimburse the contractor for the property.trw,supra,th,d.
while the clear language of part states that part does not apply to property to which the government has acquired a lien or title solely because of partial,advance,or progress payments,the intent of that provision is to make it clear that part property maintenance and management requirements do not apply to progress payments property.however,the terms partial or progress payments are not synonymous with the interim billing and reimbursement of costs incurred in a cost reimbursement contract.see this subpart prescribes policies,procedures,forms,solicitation provisions,and contract clauses for providing contract financing through progress payments based on costs.this subpart does not apply to a payments under contracts,italics added.
also,as noted by an appellate court in arizona,the trw court interpretation of part unfortunately fails to attend adequately to either the words of the regulation or those of the clause.in a cost type contract,the g overnment reimburses the contractor for every item of property that the contractor procures for the job.this includes not only overhead items allocated to the contract,but also every item used specifically and exclusively for the contract.the inevitable conclusion from the trw court reasoning would be that all such items are outside the scope of part.part would thus apply exclusively to items of property that the g overnment already owns.it makes no sense to conclude that the only property to which title passes to the g overnment is that which it already owns.moreover,the provisions of part repeatedly contradict that proposition.
the trw court also erred in asserting that title passes to the g overnment solely because of partial,advance,or progress payments.th,d,italics added.the court overlooked that title also passes when the property is issued for use in contract performance or when the contractor starts processing the property or using it in performance of the contract.see c i ii.most of the overhead items involved here were as capable of passing to the g overnment under the latter circumstances as under those listed in subsection iii indeed,as the language of the regulation suggests,the events detailed in subsections i through iii control only the timing of the passage of title to the g overnment.in short,title to property does not pass because of the listed events it passes when they occur.
finally,the fact that the overhead items can not be specifically identified to a single g overnment contract does not mean that they are not g overnment property and are not subject to the clause part d,provides in part the government property shall be used only for performing this contract,unless otherwise provided in this contract or approved by the contracting officer.emphasis added.as the italicized portion of subsection d states,i tems need not be identifiable to a single contract to constitute g overnment property.the language in part is broad enough to include overhead items.the provision states in part 
a general.all government material furnished to the contractor,as well as other material to which title has passed to the government by reason of allocation from stores or purchase by the contractor for direct charge to a government contract or otherwise,shall be recorded in accordance with the contractor property control system and the requirements of this section.
b consolidated stock record.when a contractor has more than one government contract under which government material is provided,a consolidated record for materials may be authorized by the property administrator,provided,the total quantity of any item is allocated to each contract by contract number and each requisition of material from stores is charged to the contract on which material is to be used.the supporting document or issue slip shall show the contract number or equivalent code designation to which the issue is charged.
d use of receipt and issue documents the property administrator may authorize the contractor to maintain,in lieu of stock records,a file of appropriately documents evidencing receipt,issue,and use of material that is issued for immediate consumption and is not entered in the inventory record as a matter of sound business practice.this method of control may be authorized for 
material charged through overhead emphasis added.this language confirms our conclusion that the clause at part applies to overhead property.accord aerospace,supra,d,motorola,arizona of revenue app.div,motorola.
in motorola,a government contractor appealed from the arizona department of revenue department assessment for delinquent taxes against property purchased as indirect cost overhead items overhead property allocated to various federal and private contracts.the trial court issued summary judgment in favor of the contractor and the department appealed.motorola,supra.the appellate court affirmed the trial court decision holding that title to the overhead property passed to the government under the clauses of the type contracts and contracts,and thus,resale exceptions to use tax were applicable.motorola,supra.
we agree with the motorola court analysis and thus find the trw court reasoning misplaced.
in reaching its decision regarding part d contracts,the trw court found that the listing of items of property in the four separate categories is exclusive.according to trw n othing in the introductory language suggests that the listing is illustrative.furthermore,the four subparagraphs contain a detailed listing of various categories of property.trw,supra,th,d.as we previously stated,we find the opposite to be the case,we find the list to be illustrative.thus,we disagree with trw on this point.
next,the trw court analyzed whether the overhead property falls within any of the categories listed.in response to the contention that the property fell within the category of materials and inventories,the trw court stated,t aking all of the categories together,it is clear that property embraced within the meaning of this clause and therefore property belonging to the g overnment is that which is used to produce the item contracted for.the listed items are used to manufacture the items,either as parts,instrumentalities or designs and technical drawings pertinent to the production and operation of the product.this is in contrast to the overhead items at issue in this case,property which includes post its,trw stationery,toilet paper,and desks.none of these items is material or inventory used to produce the procured items space and defense equipment.instead,these items are the common staples of any ongoing business.
the apparent purpose of g overnment title clauses is to protect the g overnment interest by giving it title to the asset to be acquired and the means by which the asset will be produced,operated or applied.see far,a.the g overnment drafted the far.presumably if it wanted to ensure that it acquired title to property such as the everyday overhead items at issue in this case,it would have included the category overhead in the categories listed in far part d.it did not do so.instead,it set forth categories of property which have one element in common each is necessary to the production and operation of the subject matter of the contract.we therefore do not construe the phrase materials and inventories to include overhead property.consequently,we conclude,as a matter of law,that the g overnment does not gain title to the overhead property because of the progress payments it makes to trw in the contracts.trw,supra,th,d,fn.omitted.
like the motorola court,we are not persuaded by the trw court interpretation of the terms materials and inventories.motorola,supra.to assume that only materials and supplies that are consumed in doing the physical work necessary to fulfill a government contract constitute materials is inherently counterintuitive and does not reflect practical reality,referencing fn.in trw,supra,th,d.the trw court rejected the argument that it should look to the definition of material found in part which includes supplies that may be consumed in normal use in performing a contract.according to trw reliance upon this definition is unavailing because it takes the definition out of context.trw,supra,th,fn,d.in support of its reasoning,trw reiterated its opinion that part,of which is a subpart,does not apply to property obtained via progress payments.as we previously explained,we find such opinion to be baseless,and thus choose not to follow trw.instead,we agree with the motorola court finding that t he term materials may include items consumed in the mental work that guides and underpins the ph
