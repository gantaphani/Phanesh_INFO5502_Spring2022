at issue in this case is whether the general assembly violated the single subject clause of the illinois constitution of.const,art.iv,d when it enacted public act pub.act,eff.november.the legislation in public act,entitled an act in relation to government regulation,amended,among other statutes,section of the illinois income tax act ilcs west,to state that a first violation of that section is a class felony and each subsequent violation is a class felony.the defendants,valdy and malgorzata olender,had been charged under the amended version of section.defendants moved to dismiss the indictments against them on the ground that section had been unconstitutionally amended by public act in violation of the single subject clause.the circuit court of cook county granted defendants motions to dismiss.the state appealed directly to this court pursuant to supreme court rule a a.for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the circuit court and hold that public act violates the single subject clause.
background 
on march,defendants were charged by indictment with two counts of filing a fraudulent income tax return in violation of section ilcs west.count i charged that defendants had willfully filed a fraudulent illinois income tax return for the year.the indictment alleged that defendants listed on the line for adjusted gross income when they knew that their adjusted gross income for was in excess of that amount.count ii charged that defendants had willfully filed a fraudulent illinois income tax return for the year.count ii charged that defendants listed on the line for adjusted gross income when they knew that their adjusted gross income for was in excess of that amount.
as noted,defendants filed motions to dismiss the indictments on the ground that public act,which amended the version of section at issue,was enacted in violation of the single subject clause of the illinois constitution of.const,art.iv,d.defendants argued that the provisions of public act had no natural and logical connection to a single subject.following argument,the circuit court,without stating the basis for its decision,entered an order granting defendants motions to dismiss,discharging defendants,and releasing defendants from all conditions of their previous bonds.
on appeal,the state first argues that the defendants lack standing to challenge the act based upon the single subject clause given the delay between the passage of public act the act on november,and defendants challenge to the act in october.in support of its argument,the state cites this court decision in meister carbaugh,and the appellate court decision in durjak thompson,d.
in meister,the plaintiff sought a declaration that an act relating to civil service in park systems be declared unconstitutional and void and sought an injunction restraining the civil service board of the south park commissioners from proceeding thereunder.meister,at.the plaintiff challenged the act on the ground that the act was passed in violation of section of article iv of the illinois constitution of.const,art.iv,which required that the bill and all amendments thereto shall be printed before the vote is taken on its final passage.meister,at.the dispute concerned section of the park civil service act,which contained exemptions.meister,at.a senate amendment to section of the bill provided for exemptions including all elective officers,the general superintendent,the attorneys,the chief of police and one confidential clerk or secretary.meister,at.a conference committee report recommended that the words chief of police be stricken from section.meister,at.however,the conference committee report was not printed in either house before the houses voted on the version of the bill that omitted the words chief of police.meister,at.
in addressing the plaintiff argument,this court noted that a material consideration of the two houses in enacting the law was the deletion of the words chief of police.meister,at.thus,if the constitutional objections were properly taken,this court could not hold section constitutional,nor could section of the act be held invalid and the remainder of the act sustained.meister,at.this court noted,however,that the act at issue had been passed by the general assembly years earlier and had been acted upon since that time.meister,at.in addition,the act had been amended by the general assembly at a succeeding session and had constituted a part of the state legislative policy for a number of years.meister,at.this court therefore concluded that the plaintiff lacked standing to contest the validity of the act.meister,at.
in so holding,this court noted that the constitutional provision at issue had been adopted to prevent surprise in the enactment of legislation.meister,at.although there had been no prior decisions upon the constitutionality of the act,the act had gone into operation and had been applied for substantially years without contest.meister,at.this court stated that 
we do not lay down a principle that constitutional provisions of this character regarding legislative procedure must be availed of promptly,but we do regard it as improper for us to upset,on a basis such as this,a law long applied without constitutional question.we are of the opinion that under facts such as these,parties seeking to contest the validity of a law have lost by some eleven or twelve years delay any standing that they might otherwise have in this court.meister,at.
in durjak,the plaintiff sought to challenge the procedure under which the income tax act had been enacted.durjak thompson,d.as in meister,the plaintiff claimed that the income tax act had not been enacted in accordance with section of article iv of the illinois constitution.const,art.iv,which required that a bill be read at large on three different days in each house and that the bill and its amendments be printed before the vote on its final passage.durjak,d at.the circuit court denied plaintiff leave to file a complaint and the appellate court affirmed.durjak,d at.
the appellate court found that the meister decision controlled.durjak,d at.the appellate court noted that the illinois income tax act had been enacted years prior to plaintiff challenge and had been repeatedly amended by the general assembly since its original enactment.durjak,d at.as in meister,the constitutional defect alleged was simply that the bill and the amendments to it were not printed before the vote was taken on its final passage.durjak,d at.moreover,the constitutionality of the income tax act had been passed upon by the courts.durjak,d at.the appellate court therefore concluded that under the circumstances,the plaintiff lacked standing to maintain his constitutional challenge.durjak,d at.
the state argues that the instant case presents the same situation and concerns as those present in meister and durjak.the state notes that public act was enacted nine years prior to defendants challenge to the act.during that time,the provisions of the act have been subsequently amended,and it is reasonable to presume that in the past nine years,the provisions of the act had been relied upon by every branch of the illinois government.the state argues that the constitutional challenge in this case is similar to the challenges in meister and durjak,because the challenge in this case is based upon the constitutional requirement for the passage of legislation rather than a substantive defect in the provisions of the statute.the single subject requirement is contained in the same subsection of the constitution as the printing requirement and is intended to ensure that legislation is not passed without adequate consideration by the legislature and to prevent passage of a bill containing unrelated subjects.the state maintains that meister controls,so that the circuit court order granting defendants motions to dismiss must be reversed.
in response,defendants argue that the state has failed to consider this court precedent concerning the standing of a defendant in a criminal case to challenge the constitutionality of a criminal statute.defendants cite the principle that a court will not consider the validity of a statutory provision unless the person challenging the statutory provision is directly affected by it or the unconstitutional feature is so pervasive as to render the entire statute invalid.see,people palkes.moreover,this court has recognized that a person has standing to challenge the validity of a statute if he has sustained or is in immediate danger of sustaining some direct injury as a result of the enforcement of the statute.people mayberry.defendants note that,under the current version of section,they were charged with two class felonies.however,under the prior version of section,a first violation of section was a class a misdemeanor.because public act significantly increased the penalty for a violation of section from a misdemeanor to a felony,defendants contend that they clearly are within the class of persons directly affected by the unconstitutional enactment of public act.further,because defendants are in immediate danger of sustaining some direct injury as a result of enforcement of the statute,they clearly have standing to challenge the validity of the statute,so that meister does not apply.
we agree with defendants that meister and durjak are distinguishable from the instant case.the acts at issue in meister and durjak were civil,and the facts of those cases suggest that the challenges brought by the plaintiffs in those cases could have been brought at any time after the acts at issue were enacted.given that fact,this court in meister concluded that the plaintiff had lost by some eleven or twelve years delay any standing they might otherwise have in this court.meister,at.this court expressly stated that it was not holding that constitutional challenges to legislative procedure must be availed of promptly,but instead was holding that under the circumstances of the case before it,it would not allow the plaintiff to contest the validity of the statute at such a late date.meister,at.
here,in contrast,defendants challenge is to a criminal statute.consequently,defendants did not have standing to challenge the statute until they were indicted and charged with violating the statute in march.it is well settled that a party who challenges a statute as unconstitutional must bring himself within the class aggrieved by the alleged unconstitutionality.mayberry,at.a party has standing to challenge the validity of a statute if he has sustained or is in immediate danger of sustaining some direct injury as a result of enforcement of the statute.mayberry,at.defendants did not sustain,nor were they in immediate danger of sustaining,some direct injury as a result of enforcement of the statute at issue until they were indicted.see mayberry,at,once defendant was indicted,he was in immediate danger of being convicted of a class felony pursuant to the enforcement of the cannabis control act.this court has recognized that it is our duty to strike down legislation that violates the constitution,especially when the legislation at issue affects an individual liberty or constitutional due process rights.people purcell.for these reasons,we find this case to be distinguishable from our decision in meister,and hold that defendants have standing to challenge the constitutionality of public act.
having found that defendants have standing to challenge public act,we next consider whether public act violated the single subject rule.a circuit court holding that a statute is unconstitutional is reviewed de novo.people sypien.the single subject clause of the illinois constitution of provides,in relevant part bills,except bills for appropriations and for the codification,revision or rearrangement of laws,shall be confined to one subject.const,art.iv,d.the single subject rule regulates the process by which legislation is enacted.people cervantes.as this court has stated 
the history and purpose of this constitutional provision are too well understood to require any elucidation at our hands.the practice of bringing together into one bill subjects diverse in their nature,and having no necessary connection,with a view to combine in their favor the advocates of all,and thus secure the passage of several measures,no one of which could succeed upon its own merits,was one both corruptive of the legislator and dangerous to the state.fuehrmeyer city of chicago,quoting people ex rel.drake mahaney,wl.
the single subject rule is designed to prevent the passage of legislation that,if standing alone,could not muster the necessary votes for enactment.sypien,at.the practice of bundling less popular legislation with more palatable bills so that the bills would carry the unpopular ones to passage is known as logrolling.cervantes,at.in addition to preventing logrolling,the single subject rule also facilitates the enactment of bills through an orderly and informed legislative process.cervantes,at.by limiting a bill to a single subject,legislators can better understand and more intelligently debate the issues presented by a bill.people reedy.the single subject clause thus promotes direct confrontation and informed discussion of legislative issues submitted for enactment.reedy,at.in addition,the single subject rule ensures that the legislature addresses the difficult decisions it faces directly and subject to public scrutiny,rather than passing unpopular measures on the backs of popular ones.johnson edgar.
in determining whether a violation of the single subject clause exists,the term subject generally is construed liberally in favor of the legislature.reedy,at.moreover,legislative acts are afforded a considerable presumption of constitutionality.reedy,at.the presumption of constitutionality,however,is not without limits.reedy,at.the subject of a bill may be as broad as the legislature chooses,as long as the bill provisions have a natural and logical connection.reedy,at.accordingly,the general assembly violates the single subject rule when it includes within one bill unrelated provisions that by no fair interpretation have any legitimate relation to one another.reedy,at.
with the foregoing provisions in mind,we must examine the procedural history and the substance of public act in order to determine whether public act violates the single subject rule.public act began as senate bill.senate bill was introduced on march.in its original form,senate bill amended three statutes.first,the cannabis and controlled substances tax act was amended to allow state attorneys to request authorization from the attorney general to enforce any tax or penalty under the act and to provide that of any tax or penalty collected in an action or proceeding brought by the state attorney would be remitted to the collecting county by the department of revenue ilcs west.second,senate bill amended the criminal code of to provide for the seizure and forfeiture of a vehicle,vessel,or aircraft used with the knowledge and consent of the owner in the commission of,or in the attempted commission of,stalking or aggravated stalking ilcs west.third,senate bill in its original form amended a unified code of corrections provision concerning reimbursement by convicted persons to the department of corrections for expenses incurred due to the convicted person incarceration ilcs,west.

senate bill was introduced in the house of representatives on april,as a bill for an act in relation to criminal law.senate bill experienced considerable growth in the house of representatives through a series of eight amendments.the house passed senate bill with the amendments on july,and the bill was returned to the senate for further approval.the senate concurred in the amendments to senate bill and passed the bill on july.
after senate bill was passed by the house and the senate,it was sent to then governor edgar for signature on july.at this point,senate bill was no longer titled an act in relation to criminal law,but instead had been renamed an act in relation to government regulation.on august,then governor edgar vetoed senate bill.
following governor edgar veto,senate bill returned to the senate,where a motion was made to pass the bill notwithstanding the veto.on november,the senate voted to override the governor veto of senate bill.senate bill next returned to the house of representatives,where the house of representatives also voted to override the governor veto.public act became effective on november.
