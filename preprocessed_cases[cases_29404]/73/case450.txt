background 
factual background 
david miller miller began his employment with creative education,a company affiliated with general consolidated management,general consolidated,in september.general consolidated has a welfare benefit plan governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,which provides medical and other benefits to its employees and their beneficiaries.
on january,miller asked general consolidated to add his son,david miller david,as a covered dependent under general consolidated erisa plan,which at that time was insured through aetna healthcare.david was born on november,with congenital heart defects and other disabilities.
in early,general consolidated decided to no longer fund its erisa plan through aetna healthcare.effective april,general consolidated replaced the aetna plan with a erisa plan,under which new england life insurance company new england provided excess coverage and administrative services for the plan.the open enrollment period for the new plan,the new england ppo medical plan of general consolidated management,plan,began on march,and ended on march.
on march,miller filled out a benefit plan form for the plan and listed david as one of his dependents to be enrolled in the plan.on march,miller removed david from his plan enrollment form by crossing through david name and information.underneath the line crossing through david name and information is a handwritten note on the enrollment form stating t ake off per miller.david is on medicaid.phoned irene.in addition,miller told cathy gunn of general consolidated that david should not be enrolled in the plan as one of his covered dependents.miller took these actions during the open enrollment period and before the plan effective date.pursuant to miller instructions,the plan administrator,deborah hansen plan administrator,did not enroll david in the plan.
miller decision not to enroll david in the plan was based on conversations he and his wife,amy miller miller,had with medicaid and social security administration representatives.these representatives allegedly told the millers that david medical care would be covered by medicaid if miller did not enroll david in the plan.
david was covered by medicaid in april,and his medicaid coverage continued until june.from april,david underwent medical treatment at cook children medical center cook.when david was admitted for treatment,the millers informed cook that david was covered by medicaid.in addition,the millers assigned to cook any benefits to which david was entitled 
cook filed its claim for david hospital bills with medicaid.medicaid paid cook approximately for david medical treatment in april 
in june,the millers were notified that david medicaid coverage would expire on june,because the social security administration had determined that as of june,david would no longer qualify for supplemental security income.because david medicaid coverage was set to expire on june,miller submitted a benefit plan form on june,adding david to the plan effective july.in a letter dated june,miller stated 
i wish to add david to my policy effective.he was not enrolled during open enrollment because he was covered under medicaid.i received a letter of denial from ssi medicaid on june,stating he would no longer be eligible for coverage after.
the plan enrolled david as of july.
after initially accepting payment from medicaid for david april treatment,cook later returned medicaid payment on december,cook sent the plan a demand letter,requesting that the plan pay for david medical services from april,in the amount of.
the plan administrator reviewed cook request for payment.the summary plan description spd provides that 
t he plan administrator has complete authority to control and manage the plan.the plan administrator has full discretion to determine eligibility,to interpret the plan and to determine whether a claim should be paid or denied,according to the provisions of the plan as set forth in this booklet.
the plan administrator determined that david was not eligible for coverage for his treatment at cook in april because miller had not enrolled david in the plan at that time.in making this determination,the plan administrator looked to language in the spd,which provides that a plan participant may elect not to be covered under this plan for any benefits,or may waive coverage for all coverages except life and insurance,or may waive coverage for medical and prescription drug only.based on the administrative record,the plan administrator found that during the open enrollment period,miller had removed david from his benefit plan form by crossing through david name and by telling cathy gunn of general consolidated to remove david from his enrollment form.the plan administrator noted that it was not until july,that miller enrolled david in the plan.accordingly,because david was not enrolled in the plan during his treatment at cook,the plan administrator denied cook request for payment.
procedural history 
on september,cook filed this lawsuit against the plan and the plan administrator.cook alleged that david was a covered dependent under the plan and that as david assignee,it was entitled to recover payment for david treatment in april.the plan and the plan administrator answered cook complaint and filed a complaint against new england for indemnification.the parties conducted discovery and attended mediation which was not successful.
the parties subsequently filed for summary judgment.on september,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the plan,the plan administrator,and new england collectively,defendants,and denied cook motion for summary judgment.the district court relied in part on miller affidavit,in which miller averred in relevant part that 
neither the plan,hansen the plan administrator,general consolidated,new england nor anyone affiliated with them had any input into my wife and my decision not to enroll david in the plan.nothing they said or did caused me to decide not to enroll david in the plan.additionally,i did not look to any of them for advice on whether to enroll david in the plan and never asked them for any advice.this was a decision that my wife and i made by ourselves after discussing the matter with people affiliated with medicaid and the social security administration.
when i instructed general consolidated not to enroll david in general consolidated erisa plan,i knew i had the opportunity to have david as a named dependent under my health plan.however,i intentionally and voluntarily relinquished my right and david right to have him named as a dependent and plan member under my employer erisa health plan.i am college educated and had close to a month to make this decision.i had the opportunity to speak to an attorney or seek other assistance.this decision was made after multiple conversations with representatives of medicaid and the social security administration.from our perspective,this decision was made by my wife and i in the best interests of my family and david i did not intend to mislead anyone by removing my son from the enrollment form.i do not feel that i have been misled by anyone.
the district court reasoned that because miller elected not to have david enrolled in the plan and knowingly and voluntarily waived david coverage under the plan,the plan administrator had a valid basis for denying benefits and such denial was not an abuse of discretion.that same date,the district court entered a final judgment,dismissing all claims with prejudice and taxing all costs under against cook.the bill of costs submitted by defendants included mediation fees in the amount of.
cook now appeals the district court grant of summary judgment and award of mediation costs.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to.
ii.standards of review 
this court reviews de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.see mello sara lee,cir.summary judgment is warranted if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c see also celotex catrett,d.
an award of costs is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see lain unum life ins.of,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if it bases its decision on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.esmark apparel,james,cir citing cooter gell hartmarx,d.
iii.discussion 
denial of benefits 
cook argues that the plan administrator abused her discretion in denying payment to cook for david treatment,and that the district court contrary conclusion was in error.cook contends that david was automatically enrolled in the plan because the spd provides that a member who had similar coverage under the employer prior plan on the date of its termination will be covered under this plan on the plan effective date.cook maintains that any attempts by miller to waive his son coverage were ineffective and against public policy.more specifically,cook submits that because medicaid is the payor of last resort,it was illegal for miller to exclude david from his plan in order to obtain medicaid coverage.cook also claims that the district court should have afforded less deference to the plan administrator because there was an inherent conflict of interest in that defendants benefitted financially from denying cook claim.
we begin with cook argument on the appropriate standard of review and then address the merits of the district court determination that the plan administrator did not abuse her discretion.
standard of review 
whether the district court employed the appropriate standard in reviewing an eligibility determination made by an erisa plan administrator is a question of law,which we review de novo.ellis liberty life assurance of boston,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.when,as here,the language of the plan grants discretion to an administrator to interpret the plan and determine eligibility for benefits,a court will reverse an administrator decision only for abuse of discretion.high,cir.o ur review of the administrator decision need not be particularly complex or technical it need only assure that the administrator decision fall somewhere on a continuum of if on the low end.maclachlan exxonmobil,cir quoting vega life ins,cir en banc.in making this determination,we focus on whether the record adequately supports the administrator decision.vega,at see also high,at stating that the administrator decision must be supported by substantial evidence in the record.
the existence of a conflict of interest,however,is a factor in the abuse of discretion inquiry.chacko sabre,cir.when a conflict of interest is shown to exist,we apply a sliding scale,giving less deference to the administrator decision in proportion to the administrator conflict.id.this approach does not mark a change in the applicable standard,but only requires the court to reduce the amount of deference it provides to an administrator decision.maclachlan,at.the degree to which a court must abrogate its deference to the administrator depends on the extent to which the challenging party has succeeded in substantiating its claim that there is a conflict.id.at.the greater the evidence of conflict on the part of the administrator,the less deferential our abuse of discretion standard will be.vega,at.where,however,only a minimal basis for a conflict is established,we review the decision with only a modicum less deference than we otherwise would.maclachlan,at quoting lain,at.
in an effort to substantiate its claim that there is a conflict,cook points out that general consolidated funds and administers its own medical benefit plan.this evidence,however,demonstrates only a minimal basis for a conflict.see chacko,at finding a minimal basis for a conflict where the plaintiff demonstrated that his former employer funds and administers its own plan,leav ing open the possibility that it would limit claims to reduce its liability.cook has presented no evidence with respect to the degree of the conflict.see see also vega,at.accordingly,under our sliding scale approach,we review the administrator decision with only a modicum less deference than we otherwise would.chacko,at quoting vega,at.
in this circuit,application of the abuse of discretion standard involves a process.see vercher alexander alexander,cir.the court must first determine whether the administrator plan interpretation is legally correct.id.if the administrator interpretation is legally sound,then the inquiry ends because no abuse of discretion could have occurred.chacko,at.on the other hand,if the court concludes that the administrator did not give the plan the legally correct interpretation,the court must then determine whether the administrator decision was an abuse of discretion.id.
this court,however,is not confined to this test we may skip the first step if we can determine the decision was not an abuse of discretion.high,at see maclachlan,at.therefore,in assessing whether the plan administrator abused her discretion in denying cook claim on the basis that david was not enrolled in the plan in april,our analysis bypasses whether the plan administrator interpretation was legally correct,as the record reflects that she did not abuse her discretion.
the plan administrator decision finds ample support in the record.the spd specifically provides that an employee may opt out of any of the offered benefits,and nothing in erisa precludes a plan participant from making a prospective election about his coverage in an erisa health plan.dist,united mine workers of am.new river,cir recognizing that no provision in erisa precludes the knowing and voluntary relinquishment of employee health benefits.the evidence in the record shows that miller chose not to enroll david in the plan during the open enrollment period and before the effective date of the plan,when miller had an existing right to make changes to his coverage because david was not enrolled in the plan in april when he received medical services at cook,the plan administrator did not abuse her discretion in denying cook claim.
cook contention that david was automatically enrolled in the plan,thereby making this an issue of waiver,does not change our conclusion.even if we were to accept cook argument that david was automatically enrolled under the terms of the plan,the plan administrator still did not abuse her discretion in denying cook claim because miller voluntarily waived david coverage.w aiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.heci exploration.employees profit sharing plan holloway in re heci exploration,cir see also high,at.this circuit has stated,in the context of an employee welfare benefit plan governed by erisa,that a waiver is valid if it is explicit,voluntary and made in good faith.guardian life ins.of am.finch,cir quoting manning hayes,cir.the record evidence indicates that miller,who is college educated,knowingly and voluntarily decided not to enroll david in the plan,even though miller knew he had the opportunity to have david as a named dependent under the plan.it therefore was not an abuse of discretion for the plan administrator to deny cook claim.
finally,cook argument that miller prospective election not to cover david is void as a matter of public policy does not affect our analysis regarding whether the plan administrator abused her discretion.this court has never imposed a requirement on a plan administrator to determine whether a plan participant election comports with medicaid law,and we decline to do so today.all that erisa requires is that substantial evidence support the administrator decision to deny a claim,when,as here,the administrator is vested with the discretion to determine eligibility for plan benefits.because the record here adequately supports the plan administrator decision,we find no error in the district court decision to uphold th
