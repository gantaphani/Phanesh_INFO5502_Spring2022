accounting malpractice actions are governed by a statute of limitations under code of civil procedure section,subdivision courts have construed the statute as requiring commencement of the suit no later than two years after the client discovered or reasonably should have discovered the accountant negligence,and has suffered actual injury resulting from that negligence.international engine parts,feddersen cal th,d,feddersen concerned the accrual of the statute of limitations for an accountant negligent preparation of tax returns.the supreme court in feddersen held that where the client,after being audited,is determined by the internal revenue service irs to owe additional taxes,the statute of limitations does not,the does not sustain actual the irs has made a final determination that there is a tax deficiency.the case before us tests the limits of feddersen.we must decide whether the statute of limitations for accounting malpractice negligent preparation of income tax returns commences at the conclusion of the audit,where the irs tentatively concludes that substantial additional taxes,interest,and penalties are owed but later makes a final determination that there is no tax deficiency.
appellants fred sahadi and helen sahadi collectively the sahadis retained respondents raymond scheaffer scheaffer and the accounting firm of abbot,stringham lynch,accounting firm to prepare and file their federal and state income tax returns separate audits of the sahadis tax returns by the state franchise tax board ftb and the irs thereafter commenced in and,respectively.the state tax audit concluded with the ftb issuing a notice of action assessing additional taxes for of.the irs in january notified the sahadis of a proposed deficiency assessment of including taxes,interest,and penalties.the sahadis challenged the proposed tax deficiency assessment in protracted proceedings before the irs.in a remarkable reversal of fortune,occurring after more than five years of negotiation,the irs formally withdrew the proposed deficiency assessment and determined that the sahadis were entitled to a substantial refund.
the sahadis brought a negligence suit against accountants on october,less than two years after the irs formally withdrew its proposed tax deficiency assessment.in bifurcated trial proceedings,the court concluded the action was barred by the applicable statute of limitations and entered judgment in accountants favor.the sahadis appeal from that judgment.they claim that under feddersen,supra,cal th,d,the statute of limitations on their malpractice claim was tolled until the audit process was concluded by the irs formal withdrawal of its proposed tax deficiency assessment.the sahadis contend that the action was timely because their accounting malpractice suit was filed within two years of that formal withdrawal.
we conclude that the court below erred in concluding that the sahadis claims were.under feddersen,supra,cal th,d,the statute of limitations under section,subdivision commenced when the irs administrative appeal process was concluded with the formal withdrawal of the proposed tax deficiency assessment.since the audit process formally concluded when an agreement settling the issues in the audit with no tax deficiency was executed by the sahadis and the irs in august,less than two years prior to the initiation of this action,the statute of limitations had not run.accordingly,we will reverse the judgment.
factual background 
the sahadis retained scheaffer former accounting firm,weber sanford,in april to prepare their federal and state income tax returns.they filed their returns,prepared by scheaffer,on april.the returns reflected federal and state tax liabilities of and,respectively.the sahadis filed amended tax returns,prepared by scheaffer,on may,the federal and state tax liabilities a reduction from the amounts listed on the original and,respectively.on april,the sahadis filed second amended tax returns that had been prepared by scheaffer,then employed by accounting firm.the second amended returns reported federal and state tax liabilities of zero,based upon a reduction in the stated fair market values of certain properties.
a major issue confronting the sahadis and scheaffer in the preparation of the a major subject of the subsequent audits of those the tax treatment of a complicated transaction that had occurred in january in which the sahadis transferred their ownership interest in the pruneyard a complex consisting of a office building,shopping center,and hotels in campbell,california to their lender through a deed in lieu of foreclosure.that issue turned on the sahadis insolvency when the transfer occurred,and,more specifically,the amount of that insolvency as determined largely by the fair market values of their property,including the pruneyard,and the amount of the debt forgiven as a result of the transfer.
on june,the ftb commenced its audit of the sahadis through tax returns.on january,the ftb issued a document entitled notice of action on cancellation,credit,or refund notice of action in which it determined that there was in additional tax due exclusive of interest.the sahadis then retained attorney richard greene,who filed an appeal of the ftb assessment on april.the state board of equalization rejected the sahadis ftb appeal in november because they had not paid the full tax assessment the board advised the sahadis to pay the assessment and then file a claim for refund.the sahadis paid the assessment in installments between and.after commencing payments,the sahadis submitted a claim for refund with the ftb.on april,the ftb notified the sahadis in response to their refund claim that because there was an appeal pending with the irs,and s ince the issue pending resolution is the same,we will suspend our examination pending the outcome of the irs appeal.
on september,the irs announced that it was auditing the sahadis income tax return.the irs agent conducting the audit wrote several letters to scheaffer in april.in an information document request of april,the irs agent stated in december you offered to provide your position on this issue.since you have not provided anything,even after my third request in january,the issue will be audited.on april,the agent confirmed that scheaffer had not submitted appraisals for any of the sahadis property,noting now is the time to submit your appraisals.and on april,the agent wrote that scheaffer had delayed the audit and had not responded to the agent requests for various pieces of information.
on january,the irs completed its examination of the sahadis tax returns,and in two revenue agents reports or letters,the irs indicated proposed deficiencies taxes,penalties,and interest of for tax years through,and of for through.the reports included criticisms of scheaffer for failing to provide information the irs had requested,and offer support for tax positions he had asserted during the audit process 
in february,the sahadis retained the law firm of heller,ehrman,white mcaullife heller ehrman,as well as other tax,appraisal,and accounting professionals,to challenge the tax deficiencies proposed by the irs.on march,heller ehrman filed a protest on behalf of the sahadis to the irs proposed tax deficiency.by march,accountants were no longer providing services to the sahadis,who engaged other tax professionals to prepare their income tax returns.
in may,the irs administrative appeal process concluded with the irs issuing an appeals audit statement and a form an irs document used to settle cases with taxpayers the appeals audit statement reflected that there were no tax deficiencies owed by the sahadis and that there were net operating loss carryovers that would result in the subsequent issuance of substantial tax refunds.the sahadis signed that form on may,and the irs countersigned the document on august.
on december,the ftb advised the sahadis,through heller ehrman,that it was closing the and claims of the sahadis and allowing them in full.the ftb noted in its letter that it had followed all of the adjustments made by the irs during the appeal.
chronology 
to facilitate our discussion below concerning accountants statute of limitations defense,we present a chronology of potentially relevant events here 
procedural history 
the sahadis filed suit against accountants on october.they alleged claims for professional negligence,breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,fraud,and unjust enrichment.
the sahadis averred in the complaint that accountants represented that they were sophisticated professionals with specialized experience dealing with many taxing authorities.the complaint alleged further that scheaffer represented to the sahadis that he was particularly qualified to perform accounting functions for business transactions and tax returns because of his prior employment with the irs,and that he was particularly skilled in representing clients should there be an audit of a client tax returns because of his knowledge,as a former irs agent,about the tax audit process.the sahadis relied on these representations in making the decision to retain accountants.
the sahadis alleged in the complaint that accountants were negligent in that they failed to adequately and professionally document and substantiate the sahadis tax returns maintain files concerning the sahadis tax returns sufficient to respond adequately to an ftb or irs audit and properly represent the sahadis before the tax agencies,and in many instances refused to provide information requested by tax agencies precisely because they knew that,as a result of their own inadequate,negligent performance of services,they could not provide the requested information.as a result of accountants negligence the sahadis alleged,the irs made conclusions adverse to the tax positions taken in the sahadis returns that had been prepared by accountants,and the irs issued proposed deficiency adjustments and penalties totaling more than.the complaint averred that the sahadis retained counsel and other tax and accounting professionals beginning in february and concluding in august to assist them in handling an administrative appeal with the irs brought on by accountants mishandling of the audit.the sahadis claimed that as a result of accountants negligence,they had sustained damages of almost in costs,together with additional emotional distress and economic losses because of the tax liens needlessly filed against them.these economic damages,according to the sahadis trial brief,included over in damages resulting from the fire sale loss through foreclosure of their thoroughbred horse breeding farm,the cardiff stud farm in paso robles this foreclosure allegedly resulted from ftb tax liens having been placed against their property.
accountants filed a motion for summary judgment in which their primary argument was that the action was because the sahadis were aware of the alleged negligence and had sustained damage more than two years before they filed suit.in june,the court judge john herlihy denied accountants motion for summary judgment.in its ruling,the court applied feddersen,supra,cal th,d,with respect to whether claims based on the negligent preparation of tax returns were.
the case proceeded to trial in october.the parties stipulated to bifurcation and to an initial trial of accountants motion in limine that the action was.after receiving voluminous papers and following lengthy oral argument,the court judge leslie nichols issued a notice of intended decision that d efendants have carried their burden of proof on the affirmative defense of the statute of limitations.judgment was thereafter entered on december.the sahadis filed a timely appeal from the judgment.
discussion 
issue on appeal 
the overall issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in granting accountants motion in limine establishing that the sahadis claims were barred by the statute of limitations.we believe the legal question critical to disposition of this case to be as follows 
the supreme court has held that the statute of limitations commences in an accounting malpractice case involving negligently prepared tax returns when the irs assesses a deficiency at the conclusion of the audit process.feddersen,supra,cal th at d.the sahadis contend that the action was timely filed because the statute did not commence until august,when the irs made its final determination that no deficiency was owing this was the finalization of the audit process discussed in feddersen.does the feddersen rule apply in this context,where the initially making a preliminary determination that there was a tax concludes that there is no deficiency 
ii.standard of review 
questions concerning whether an action is barred by the applicable statute of limitations are typically questions of fact.jolly eli lilly cal d.but when the relevant facts are not in dispute,the application of the statute of limitations may be decided as a question of law.citation.feddersen,supra,cal th at,d.thus,for instance,a court recently reversed the trial court exclusion of evidence of instances of domestic violence occurring more than three years before the filing of the complaint on the ground that a suit on them was it is a question of law whether a case or a portion of a case is barred by the statute of limitations,and we are not bound by the trial court determination and instead conduct a de novo review.citation.pugliese superior court th,d see also city of saratoga hinz th,d de novo review after in limine motion granted on basis that the plaintiff challenge to validity of special assessment district was.
here,the facts relevant to accountants statute of limitations defense are not in dispute.the parties are in agreement with the facts presented in the timeline,ante.for example,there can be no question that the sahadis were aware of a significant problem with their tax returns by no later than when the irs proposed a deficiency assessment of and they were informed of various issues that the irs had with obtaining information from scheaffer during the audit process incurred expenses related to accountants alleged negligence by no later than february when they retained counsel to challenge the irs proposed deficiency assessment concluded the administrative appeal process with the irs audit by august,when the irs signed the form agreement and filed suit on october.as we discuss,post,resolution of this case turns on the interpretation of the supreme court decision in feddersen,supra,cal th,d,its conclusion regarding the time that the client suffers actual injury in the context of an accountant negligent preparation of income tax on weighing or drawing any conclusions from material facts in dispute.accordingly,the question is one of law.
iii.applicable law re statute of limitations 
code of civil procedure section,subdivision 
the statute of limitations prescribed by section,subdivision applies to actions for accounting malpractice.curtis kellogg andelson th,d moonie lynch d.and where the gravamen of the case is accounting negligence,the statute is applicable,notwithstanding the existence of other claims against the professionals,such as misrepresentation,for which a different statute of limitations might otherwise apply.ventura county nat.bank macker th,d.
the statute of limitations under section,subdivision commences when the aggrieved party discovers the negligent conduct causing the loss or damage and the aggrieved party has suffered actual injury as a result of the negligent conduct.apple valley unified school dist.vavrinek,trine,day th,d apple valley,citing feddersen,supra,cal th at,d.the first component involves the discovery rule,under which the statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff suspects or should suspect that her injury was caused by wrongdoing,that someone has done something wrong to her citations.a plaintiff need not be aware of specific facts necessary to establish the claim so long as a suspicion exists,it is clear that the plaintiff must go find the facts she can not wait for the facts to find her.jolly eli lilly,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.
the second the client has suffered actual injury as a result of the accountant founded upon the premise that there must be injury as well as actionable conduct to support a claim of negligence.as the supreme court explained in the legal malpractice context,if the allegedly negligent conduct does not cause damage,it generates no cause of action in tort.citation.the mere breach of a professional duty,causing only nominal damages,speculative harm,or the threat of future yet not suffice to create a cause of action for negligence.citations.hence,until the client suffers appreciable harm as a consequence of his attorney negligence,the client can not establish a cause of action for malpractice.budd nixen cal d,fn.omitted.
this second element of actual is the element in controversy the focus of the supreme court in feddersen,supra,cal th,d.as background for understanding the court decision in feddersen,we will take a brief detour to explain the procedures involved in irs audits of tax returns.
irs audit procedure 
the supreme court in feddersen provided an overview of the procedures involved in the irs examination of tax returns.we quote from that opinion here at length 
once a federal tax return is selected for audit,the examination is performed by an irs examiner.at the conclusion of the examination,the taxpayer is sent a report of the examiner findings,indicating any proposed deficiency assessments.if the taxpayer agrees with the findings of the examiner,he or she will sign the appropriate forms form form acknowledging the tax liability.citation.if the taxpayer signs the agreement form,he or she immediately waives the required statutory notice of deficiency pursuant to internal revenue code section the letter,waives the corresponding prohibition on collection for days under internal revenue code section,and is thereafter precluded from litigating the proposed deficiency in tax court.citations see fn,ante.if the taxpayer does not agree with the examiner proposed findings,the findings will be reviewed in the district office,and the taxpayer will be sent a letter instructing that the taxpayer has days to file a protest.citation.if the taxpayer fails to respond within the thirty days,a notice of deficiency will be issued.citation.if the taxpayer timely files a protest,he or she will be accorded an appeals office conference if a settlement is reached,the taxpayer will again be requested to sign the agreement form a determination by the appeals office,however,is final insofar as the taxpayer appeal rights within the irs are concerned,and if the taxpayer continues to disagree,the statutory notice of deficiency will be sent giving the taxpayer ninety days to file a petition in the tax court before collection actions are begun.citation.
thus,the preliminary findings of the tax examiner are proposed findings that are subject to negotiation prior to any determination of tax deficiency.citation.once a deficiency is assessed,however,either by the taxpayer consent to deficiency assessment,or by receipt of a final deficiency notice pursuant to internal revenue code section et,the matter is final as to the irs and subject to legal appeal in federal tax court.citation.feddersen,supra,cal th at,d.
in feddersen,the clients parent and subsidiary corporations sued their accountants for negligence in connection with the preparation of tax returns that were subsequently audited by the irs.the tax issue concerned whether the subsidiary was qualified for certain tax benefits associated with being a domestic international stock corporation disc.feddersen,supra,cal th at,d.the subsidiary president was advised by an irs agent in,two years into the irs audit of the company tax returns,that the company would be disqualified as a disc because the accountants had failed to provide essential documentation.ibid.faced with the prospect of additional tax liability in the range of,in july,the subsidiary withdrew a settlement offer it had made in unrelated litigation.id.at,d.at the same time,the company bank decreased its line of credit because of the potential additional tax liability.id.at,d.the irs issued a preliminary audit report in june in which it stated that it planned to disqualify the subsidiary as a disc and that it intended to impose tax deficiencies,interest,and penalties.ibid.the audit was finalized and the irs assessed the deficiency on may,and the plaintiffs filed suit against their accountants on may.ibid.
the defendants moved for summary judgment on the basis that the case was.feddersen,supra,cal th at,d.they argued that the statute ran in because it commenced in july,when the subsidiary sustained actual injury by being forced to withdraw its settlement offer in the unrelated litigation and by having its line of credit reduced.ibid.the defendants also argued that the plaintiffs payment of attorney fees in connection with the audit constituted actual injury for purposes of commencing the statute of limitations.ibid.the plaintiffs responded that their suit was timely under section,subdivision because it was filed within two years after the irs assessed the deficiency.id.at,d.the trial court granted the defendants motion and the appellate court affirmed.ibid.
the supreme court reversed.it created a special rule for accounting malpractice for the negligent preparation of tax returns that are subsequently audited by taxing authorities.the court held that the date in which the irs makes a final determination of a tax deficiency serves by operation of law as the date of accrual of the statute of limitations in such cases,noting the deficiency assessment serves as a finalization of the audit process and the commencement of actual injury because it is the trigger that allows the irs to collect amounts due and the point at which the accountant alleged negligence has caused harm to the taxpayer.feddersen,supra,cal th at,d.the feddersen court thus held that the action was timely filed i n the present case,actual injury occurred when the irs issued its penalty tax assessment on may,rather than when the subsidiary withdrew its settlement offer in an unrelated lawsuit,or when the company bank reduced its line of credit by in anticipation of the subsidiary potential tax liability.although these two latter events may represent palpable harm caused by the malpractice of the accountant,they are based on a tentative assessment of potential liability only.although the defendants alleged negligence may have been discovered during the audit,such potential liability could not amount to actual harm until the date of the deficiency tax assessment or finality of the audit process.id.at,d.
the supreme court has subsequently in a legal malpractice case stated that feddersen involved very narrowly drawn circumstances and did not articulate a rule for all seasons.adams paul cal th,d,lead opn.of arabian,adams.echoing this view,the court in jordache enterprises,brobeck,phleger harrison cal th,d,jordache another legal malpractice case see pt.of the discussion,post stated that feddersen presented specialized circumstances and did not articulate a rule of broad or general applicability.but it nonetheless did not overrule or question feddersen holding.jordache,supra,at,fn,d,noting that,because feddersen was decided under section,subdivision,and not under section,and because it was not intended to provide rules for legal malpractice actions,we have no occasion in this case to reexamine feddersen rationale or rule.
there have been only three reported california decisions since feddersen was decided that have addressed the feddersen rule in the context of an action for accounting malpractice.see apple valley,supra,th,d accountants misrepresentations in audit report feddersen not applicable,rejecting client municipality contention that statute was tolled until there was final determination by state controller that it was responsible for repaying funds expended in reliance upon accountant misrepresentations curtis kellogg andelson,supra,th,d accounting and legal malpractice action in which client,medical corporation,was advised to and did pay excessive compensation to physician wife van dyke dunker aced th,d van dyke negligent tax advice concerning deductibility of charitable contribution claim accrued when client filed return thereby learning that advice was erroneous.none of those cases involved circumstances similar to those found here.and only one of the cases concerned the accrual of the statute of limitations where allegedly negligent tax advice given by the accountant was followed by an income tax audit scrutinizing the subject of that advice.see curtis kellogg andelson,supra,th,d.
courts in a number of other jurisdictions have held that the statute of limitations for accounting malpractice involving the negligent preparation of tax returns commences when there is a formal assessment of a deficiency by the taxing authority.see,application of statute of limitations to actions for breach of duty in performing services of public accountant,a,and cases cited.these cases include those that preceded feddersen and others that were decided after feddersen and which agreed with the conclusion of the california supreme court.see,thomas cleary alaska reversing damage award where there had been no deficiency assessment no accounting malpractice claim had accrued cdt addison,roberts ludwig.div,adopting feddersen rule in context of sales tax deficiency assessment by california state board of equalization streib veigel idaho,leonhart atkinson,feldman granger,receipt of deficiency notice marked latest date of accrual of statute of limitations snipes jackson,lamure peters,chisholm scott,gray estate of barry ohio app d,sladky lomax ohio app d,wynn estate of holmes murphy campbell holding that date of deficiency assessment was latest date statute of limitations commenced,rejecting taxpayer position that statute did not commence until it concluded tax court litigation challenging irs deficiency assessment atkins crosland mills garlow clark deloitte touche llp utah statute of limitations did not commence until tax court decision upholding irs deficiency assessment became final feddersen holding was sound,but that case did not involve taxpayer continuing to pursue remedies in tax court.
iv.whether the sahadis action was 
no case decided either in california or in any other jurisdiction cited by the parties or known to this court is on all fours with the circumstances of this case.no case of which we are aware has considered the precise question here the date of accrual of the statute of limitations in an action against an accountant for negligent preparation of subsequently audited tax returns,where there is no tax deficiency determined to be owed by the client at the conclusion of the audit.
accountants here argued successfully below that feddersen rule has no application in this instance.they reiterate that position here,making essentially four points because feddersen applies to cases in which the claimed negligence involves the accountant negligent tax return preparation and the sahadis claim that they were damaged because of accountants deficient tax audit representation of them,feddersen is inapplicable because feddersen held that the statute accrues when the irs makes a tax deficiency assessment and no such deficiency was ultimately asserted here,the feddersen rule is inapplicable since the irs did not make a tax deficiency assessment,the statute commenced when the sahadis incurred damages during the audit process,and the statute was not tolled while they were exhausting their administrative appeals and feddersen,even if it applies to the claims,has no application to the sahadis claims related to state income taxes,because the ftb issued its deficiency notice in january,over seven years before the sahadis filed suit.
we address these four contentions below,combining the related contentions and in our discussion.
nature of claimed accountant negligence 
accountants assert that feddersen does not apply because there is no claim that they were negligent in the preparation of client tax returns.rather,they argue that a close analysis shows that the sahadis contend that accountants were negligent in the handling of the audit process.accountants contend further that it was conclusively established that they were not negligent in the preparation of their clients tax returns because the proposed tax deficiency assessments were withdrawn,the sahadis do not seek any damages,taxes,penalties or interest related to negligent tax return preparation,and the sahadis own expert demonstrated that accountants were not negligent in the preparation of the tax returns.
the sahadis respond construing the allegations of their are claiming that accountants were negligent both in the preparation of tax returns and in their representation of their clients in the audit process.they respond further that arguing that there was no negligent tax return preparation as a matter of law to support their view that the only possible negligence claim involves negligent audit arguing the merits of the malpractice claim in violation of principles relating to bifurcated trials.
we conclude that a fair reading of the complaint discloses that the sahadis claims are not limited to accountants alleged negligence in the representation of their clients during the tax audits.see in the construction of a pleading,for the purpose of determining its effect,its allegations must be liberally construed,with a view to substantial justice between the parties.to be certain,the complaint is replete with allegations of acts and omissions by accountants during the audit,including claims that they failed to properly represent the sahadis refused to provide information requested by the taxing authorities responded to irs requests for specific information by dump ing piles of documents on the tax agencies,which not only made it more difficult for the irs to perform the audit but also made the irs suspicious of the sahadis took positions with the irs that were untenable,without advising and consulting with their clients and concealed their lack of cooperation in the audit process from their clients.
but the sahadis also allege that accountants were negligent in the preparation of their clients tax returns.they aver that accountants failed to adequately and professionally document and substantiate the sahadis tax returns,and did not maintain files concerning the sahadis tax returns sufficient to respond adequately to an ftb or irs audit.throughout the complaint,the sahadis allege that their tax problems were due,at least in part,to accountants inadequate documentation or substantiation of tax positions taken in the returns.and included among the theories of their case,as alleged in the complaint,are that the sahadis tax problems arose from accountants failure to document or substantiate the positions taken in the tax returns,and that accountants allegedly deficient audit representation was spawned by their allegedly negligent tax return preparation.therefore,the sahadis claims consist of a blend of allegedly deficient work by preparation and audit representation.
accountants argue that we should disregard the allegations of negligence because there was no such negligence.we reject that position.
there was no evidence presented from the outcomes of the audits negated the sahadis claim that accountants were negligent in the preparation of their clients tax returns.in fact,there was no evidence as expert supported the sahadis claim.this is hardly surprising.the court,based upon the parties stipulation,bifurcated the case for an initial trial on accountants statute of limitations defense.thus,the case was disposed of by a trial on the sole issue of whether the action was,pursuant to section.a separate trial is authorized under that statute when the defendant alleges as an affirmative defense that the action is or alleges another affirmative defense that is potentially dispositive and that is one not involving the merits of the plaintiff cause of action see associates,shapiro th,d see also lackner lacroix cal d,statute of limitations bar does not reflect on the merits of the action and thus is not a favorable termination for purposes of a subsequent malicious prosecution action.
it does not necessarily follow as accountants urge that because the taxing authorities ultimately found that no additional taxes,interest,or penalties were due,any damages that the sahadis incurred were the result of allegedly deficient audit representation,and not because of services performed in preparing the tax returns.the sahadis allege that the audit process was unnecessarily protracted because accountants failed to adequately or properly document the positions taken when they prepared their clients tax returns.indeed,the sahadis counsel argued in the bifurcated trial that had the tax returns been prepared properly in the first instance,there might never have been an irs or ftb audit.therefore,the sahadis may be able to there was inadequate or improper documentation of the returns and that these errors or omissions were chargeable to the audit process would have concluded expeditiously had the original documentation for the tax returns been sufficient and readily available to the taxing authorities.see generally epstein spalding,the accountant guide to legal liability and ethics discussing importance of accountant work papers used in preparation of tax returns.under such a scenario,the sahadis may prove that negligence in the preparation of their tax returns was a substantial factor in causing them to incur costs associated with the well as any ancillary damages allegedly suffered from their protracted nature as a result of the tax liens having been placed against their property.see mattco forge,arthur young th,d.therefore,we can not conclude that the ultimate audit outcomes necessarily defeat the sahadis claims based upon accountants allegedly negligent preparation of their clients income tax returns 
accountants also urge that the deposition testimony of the sahadis expert,accountant phillip arth,demonstrates that the sahadis can not establish their claim of negligence in the preparation of their tax returns.this argument is in part based upon citations to excerpts of arth deposition transcript included in respondents appendix.these excerpts were not authenticated and there is no indication that they were even submitted to the court below.accordingly,since the transcript having been filed or lodged in the superior not proper matters for inclusion in the appendix see cal.rules of court,rules b a,b b,b,we will disregard them.canal ins.tackett th,d appellate court will disregard matters improperly included in appendix.
but even were we to consider this expert was to a certain extent cited in accountants briefs in support of their statute of limitations defense filed would not find that it negated the sahadis claim based upon the negligent preparation of their tax returns.there is no indication that the court specifically relied on this evidence in granting accountants motion in limine.and in any event,as we have noted,the bifurcated trial to determine whether the action was conducted pursuant to section was not a trial on the merits.
the claims against accountants included negligence both in the preparation of the sahadis income tax returns and in representation in the ensuing audits by the taxing authorities.accordingly,we reject accountants contention that feddersen,supra,cal th,d,where the malpractice claim was based upon the accountants negligent tax return preparation,is inapplicable to this case 
absence of tax deficiency assessment 
in feddersen,the corporate subsidiary plaintiff was advised by its accountants approximately two years before the tax audit was completed that it was facing a likely additional tax liability of approximately.feddersen,supra,cal th at,d.ultimately,the irs assessed a tax deficiency of several hundred thousand dollars against the company.international engine parts,feddersen th,d.here,although the irs advised the sahadis of a preliminary assessment of additional taxes,interest,and penalties of,no tax deficiency was ultimately assessed against them.accountants contend that,even if the malpractice claim here could be construed as being based upon the negligent preparation of tax returns,feddersen rule concerning the accrual of the statute of limitations does not apply here because of the absence of a final tax deficiency assessment.
feddersen language 
the sahadis and accountants both point to language in feddersen that they contend supports their respective positions.there are,indeed,numerous places in the decision in which the supreme court refers to the assessment of a tax deficiency as the triggering event for commencing the statute.see,feddersen,supra,cal th at,d,at the time the irs actually assesses the tax deficiency p rior to the penalty assessment,until the tax deficiency was assessed,the date of deficiency assessment determination of tax deficiency,prior to the notice of deficiency,t he deficiency assessment,until the taxing authority assesses a deficiency,until the irs assesses a deficiency and b y using the date of deficiency assessment or notice of deficiency assessment,when the tax deficiency is assessed by the irs.but the sahadis respond that in their reading of feddersen,the court occasionally refers to the completion of the irs audit process as being the moment that the statute commences.for instance,the supreme court noted the deficiency assessment serves as a finalization of the audit process and the commencement of actual injury id.at,d,italics added.and later in the opinion,the court stated that the malpractice tort is not complete until the audit is finalized.once the audit process is finalized,however,the harm caused by the accountant negligence is no longer contingent and the taxpayer cause of action in tort for alleged malpractice against the accountant accrues under section,subdivision.id.at,d,italics added.language that the sahadis argue supports,and accountants contend refutes,application of the feddersen rule to this court noted although feddersen alleged negligence may have been discovered during the audit,such potential liability could not amount to actual harm until the date of the deficiency tax assessment or finality of the audit process,italics added.
we conclude from the above that the question can not be resolved simply from reading the bare language of the court holding in feddersen.although a strict application of feddersen might suggest the outcome urged by accountants,it is fair to surmise that the supreme court never even considered such an unusual set of circumstances as presented here,namely,an instance in which an preliminary tax deficiency asserted by the irs ultimately evaporates at the conclusion of the audit process.we therefore must look more closely at the reasoning for the holding in feddersen,including the policy considerations enunciated by the supreme court in support of its decision.
feddersen objectives and policies 
the court in feddersen stated that its test served three policy objectives the foregoing rule both conserves judicial resources and avoids forcing the client to sue the allegedly negligent accountant for malpractice while the audit is pending.it also avoids requiring the client to allege facts in the negligence action that could be used against him or her in the audit,without first allowing the accountant to correct the error or mitigate the consequences thereof during the audit process.citations.feddersen,supra,cal th at,d.applying feddersen to cases similar to the circumstances presented,where there is a preliminary irs finding of a tax deficiency that is ultimately reversed by the time the audit process is subserve all three goals.
delaying the accrual of the statute under section,subdivision would conserve judicial resources and would obviate the need for the client to sue the accountant during the pendency of the audit it would eliminate the necessity of a taxpayer filing a protective suit against his or her accountant in all cases in which there is a preliminary deficiency finding and the possibility of accountant negligence.delayed accrual would also serve the interests of the taxpayer because it would be expected that in most instances he or she would want to use the services of the accountant to assist during the irs process and would be loath to take a position in a separate negligence suit,that the client had been damaged by the accountant negligent return preparation,thereby possibly admitting the validity of the irs preliminary assessment of a tax deficiency that would be harmful to the client in the audit process.thus,the policies enunciated by the supreme court apply with equal force to a case such as feddersen where a preliminary tax assessment results in a final irs determination of a tax deficiency,and to an instance such as here where a preliminary assessment of a deficiency evolves into an ultimate finding that no additional tax is owed.
delayed accrual here is also consistent with the court intention to establish a bright line that,once crossed,commences the limitations period under section,subdivision,and therefore provides certainty in terms of the statute application.feddersen,supra,cal th at,d.one rule for all actions involving the negligent preparation of subsequently audited tax returns in which the statute commences when the audit process is finalized promotes the court goal that there be uniformity in application with respect to the statute of limitations.ibid.in contrast,there would be no uniformity were the feddersen rule applied when the audit concludes with the issuance of an irs tax deficiency assessment,and a different an accrual date much earlier in the audit if the audit concludes without a tax deficiency assessment.
as an illustration of both the propriety of applying feddersen to the case before us and the anomalies that would be created by a contrary holding,we consider two hypothetical client and client.each client has filed a tax return prepared by its accountant that is subsequently selected by the irs for audit.in each instance,the client has received a preliminary notice of a tax deficiency that it challenges through the irs administrative appeals process.each client has incurred substantial consequential losses,accountant and attorney fees defending its tax position.in each instance,the client can present a colorable argument that its consequential losses were caused by its accountant negligent tax preparation of whether its tax position ultimately prevails in the audit.the irs has issued a tax deficiency assessment to client the tax audit has concluded with no tax deficiency determined owing by client.if we were to conclude that feddersen applies only in cases in which the audit concludes with the assessment of a tax deficiency,client could bring an action within two years after the conclusion of the audit client could not.as these hypothetical scenarios demonstrate,there would be a substantial dimming of feddersen rule if different standards were applied to the two clients.
in the above example,each forgoing suit against the negligent accountant at the time of the preliminary deficiency based upon the assumption that the feddersen rule essentially be betting against itself that it would not win the audit outright.the specter of winning the audit but losing the case against the accountant because of its untimely filing might force clients into filing protective,premature malpractice suits at the time they are notified of the preliminary deficiency,notwithstanding the holding in feddersen that the claim does not accrue until a final assessment of a deficiency.thus,establishing disparate rules of accrual for client and client would,in fact,promote an erosion of feddersen and would thwart the principles upon which it was decided.
in reaching the conclusion that applying feddersen in this instance would subserve the three objectives described in that case,we recognize that there are countervailing policies applicable generally to limitations issues.s tatutes of repose are in fact favored in the law,designed to promote justice by preventing surprises through the revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost,memories have faded,and witnesses have disappeared citation.adams,supra,cal th at,d,lead opn.of arabian,see also jordache,supra,cal th at,d.further,in the context of legal malpractice actions,the supreme court has expressed the concern that d elaying recognition of actual injury until related litigation concludes would give a client who has sustained actionable damages,and who is aware of the attorney error,unilateral control over the limitations period.jordache,supra,cal th at,d,citing laird blacker cal th,d.these countervailing policies notwithstanding,the supreme court has made it clear order to conserve judicial resources,avoid premature negligence suits against accountants,and to eliminate the need for clients to take inconsistent positions during the audit finalization of the audit is the date of accrual of the client cause of action for his or her accountant negligent preparation of tax returns.feddersen,supra,cal th at,d.
date of actual injury 
accountants argue that the sahadis sustained actual injury as early as february,when they began incurring professional fees in connection with the irs audit.this argument is flawed for the simple reason that it is dependent upon the inapplicability of feddersen to this case.in feddersen,the court concluded that the date of the deficiency assessment represented the date of actual injury for purposes of commencing the statute of limitations under section,subdivision.feddersen,supra,cal th at,d.because we have concluded above that the rule in feddersen applies to accounting malpractice actions founded upon allegedly negligent tax return preparation,irrespective of whether the irs ultimately issues a tax deficiency assessment at the conclusion of the audit,the date the sahadis sustained actual injury was the conclusion of the audit process,when the sahadis and the irs signed the form.
contrary to accountants assertions,our holding that the audit conclusion marked the date of accrual,despite the sahadis having incurred damages in the form of professional fees much earlier,is not inconsistent with feddersen.the court majority held the use of the date of deficiency assessment to mark the date of actual injury in accountant malpractice cases provides the parties with a bright line that,once crossed,commences the limitations period under section,subdivision,and therefore provides certainty in terms of the statute application.obviously,in some cases injury will be clear before the notice of deficiency is given to the taxpayer.but uniformity in application serves a more important function when interpreting statutes of limitation than does the identification of the precise point at which some harm might be said to have occurred,even if negative collateral consequences might arise from the tentative assessment of additional tax liability.feddersen,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.justice kennard criticized the majority reasoning,observing p erhaps most importantly,the malpractice of an attorney or accountant may severely damage the client even when the third party litigation terminates in the client favor.as i have stated,it defies common sense to hold,as the majority does,that a client has not sustained actual injury even though the client has paid thousands,perhaps hundreds of thousands,of dollars in litigation costs because the attorney malpractice has compelled the client to prosecute or defend third party litigation.citation.id.at,d,conc.dis.opn.of kennard.
the conclusion we draw from the above,including the majority implicit consideration of justice kennard criticisms,is that feddersen recognized that an accounting client may sustain damage in fact,costs associated with the audit prior to the conclusion of the audit process which,in feddersen,was marked by an irs tax deficiency assessment.the majority of the feddersen court,however,chose for policy reasons to establish a test that actual injury in law occurs for purposes of the accrual of the statute of limitations only at the conclusion of the audit process.see id.at,d,see also apple valley,supra,th at,d feddersen did not say that there could never be actual injury in fact until the irs assessed a deficiency curtis kellogg andelson,supra,th at,fn,d applying feddersen,accounting malpractice statute of limitations did not commence when client incurred attorney fees prior to irs notice of deficiency.
accountants argue that under jordache,supra,cal th,d,the statute commenced when the sahadis sustained any appreciable and actual harm,when they incurred professional fees to defend their position during the tax audit.there,the supreme court held that a ctual injury occurs when the client suffers any loss or injury legally cognizable as damages in a legal malpractice action based on the asserted errors or omissions.citations.id.at,d.accountants position ignores the fact that jordache was decided in the context of a different statute section governing the limitations period for a different form of professional negligence attorney malpractice.
the clients in jordache asserted that attorneys were negligent in defending them by failing to advise them concerning,or to assert on their behalf,an entitlement to liability insurance benefits covering the suit.jordache,supra,cal th at,d.they argued that their malpractice claim did not accrue until their suit against their insurer was settled,allegedly for less than they would have been entitled had their attorneys not been negligent.ibid.the court rejected that argument,concluding that the clients claim accrued much earlier when they incurred substantial in the form of unpaid insurance benefits for defense costs in the third party action and in lost profits from the diversion of investment funds to pay these defense costs t hese damages were sufficiently manifest,nonspeculative,and mature that jordache tried to recover them as damages in its insurance coverage suits.id.at,d.in so concluding,the jordache court reiterated the rule of accrual that a ctual injury occurs when the client suffers any loss or injury legally cognizable as damages in a legal malpractice action based on the asserted errors or omissions.citations.id.at,d,see also id.at,d.
in response to the clients contention that the statute of limitations,under feddersen,supra,cal th,d,did not accrue until the conclusion of their suit with their insurers,the supreme court in jordache clearly explained that the feddersen rule applied to a different form of professional negligence and was formulated within a different statutory context.the court stated that the jordache clients misconceive feddersen by attempting to apply that case to an analysis of section.as adams noted,feddersen presented specialized circumstances and did not articulate a rule of broad or general applicability.adams,supra,cal th at,d,lead opn.of arabian,id.at,d,conc.opn.of kennard.in feddersen,the court considered when an accountant allegedly negligent tax return preparation caused harm that commenced the limitations period provided in section,subdivision.feddersen,supra,cal th at,d.a key distinction between feddersen and jordache case is the particular limitations statute involved.feddersen dealt with section,subdivision,and its limitations period for suits upon a contract,obligation or liability not founded upon an instrument of writing,subd.feddersen,supra,cal th at,d.the standards for beginning that limitations period result from judicial decisions rather than legislative enactment.citations.in section,the legislature established a detailed,explicit,and exclusive scheme for commencing and tolling the legal malpractice limitations periods.the legislature did not establish a comparable scheme for section.therefore,feddersen does not,and was not intended to,provide rules for legal malpractice only subject we address here.jordache,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.
the supreme court in jordache did not announce an abandonment of the feddersen rule for determining the date of accrual of an accounting malpractice claim based upon the negligent preparation of tax returns.jordache,as a legal malpractice case,thus has no application to the issue date of accrual under section,subdivision for the sahadis claim based upon accountants negligent preparation of income tax returns.
apple valley 
accountants also cite apple valley,supra,th,d,in support of their contention that the statute of limitations accrued here when the sahadis incurred professional fees to defend their position during the tax audit.that accounting malpractice nothing to do with the alleged negligent preparation of tax inapposite.there,the client school district alleged that its accountants made misrepresentations in an audit report that induced it to provide funds to a charter school.id.at,d.the audit report was prepared in january,and in august of the same year,the district,after hiring a different accountant to audit the charter school attendance and after receiving documentation from a former school employee indicating wrongdoing by the school,revoked the charter to the school.id.at,d.the state controller conducted an audit of the attendance at the charter school,and the audit report completed in concluded that the school had received over in funding to which it was not entitled.id.at,d.the district appealed that audit,which appeal was pending when the malpractice suit was filed.ibid.after the district filed suit in december,the defendants demurrer was sustained without leave to amend on the basis that the action was.id.at,d.
the appellate court found that more than two years had elapsed as to the first prong of the statute of the plaintiff knew of or reasonably should have suspected the wrongdoing.apple valley,supra,th at,d.as to the second prong,the district argued,relying on feddersen,supra,cal th,d,that it had not suffered actual injury until january when the state controller audit report claimed that the district was liable for overpayments to the charter school.apple valley,supra,at,d.the appellate court disagreed,holding that the district sustained actual injury no later than early,when the d istrict recognized the allegedly improper conduct and incurred expenses,investigative and attorney fees to determine its extent.id.at,d.
in so concluding,the apple valley court held that the feddersen rule of accrual was inapplicable to the case before it.apple valley,supra,th at,d.it cited van dyke,supra,th,d,an accounting malpractice case in which the appellate court also declined to apply the feddersen rule.id.at,d.in van dyke,the accountant was allegedly negligent in advising his clients that they would receive a dollar tax credit for the fair market value of the land they donated.id.at,d.the clients allegedly relied on that advice by donating the real property.id.at,d.after doing so,their accountant informed them in,nearly three years before they filed suit that he had been mistaken,that they would receive a tax deduction rather than a tax credit,and that the deduction would be spread over a number of years.id.at,d.the clients alleged that they would never have donated the property had they known the actual tax treatment applicable to the transaction.ibid.likening the circumstances in van dyke to those before it,the apple valley court found feddersen inapplicable as in van dyke,the alleged malpractice in this case was not negligent preparation of a tax return,but a representation which induced detrimental reliance.apple valley,supra,at,d.it therefore agreed with van dyke determination that the feddersen rule should not apply outside of the factual context in which it was formulated,negligent preparation of a tax return.id.at,d.
after concluding that the feddersen rule was inapplicable,the apple valley court discussed jordache,supra,cal th,d,at length.apple valley,supra,th at,d.although the court acknowledged that jordache was a legal malpractice case involving section,a statute not applicable to accounting malpractice claims apple valley,supra,at,d,it held that n otwithstanding the lack of a statement from the supreme court that jordache reasoning should apply to accounting malpractice cases,we are convinced that it should apply except to cases that fall within feddersen narrow holding governing negligent tax return preparation.id.at,d.it therefore held that jordache analysis of actual injury applied to bar the district claims.apple valley,supra,at,d.
here,we consider the application of feddersen to accounting malpractice that is based upon a claim that the client incurred damages as a result of the negligent preparation of tax returns.the fact that feddersen did not articulate a rule for all seasons adams,supra
