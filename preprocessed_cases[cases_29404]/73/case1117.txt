renovizor was an interior decorating and remodeling company that sold decorating products and provided residential remodeling services.renovizor incorporated in late,commenced business in the second quarter of,and ceased operations in.
in june,the sbe commenced an audit of the sales tax returns filed by renovizor from april,to march.the sbe later expanded the audit to include the period from april,to march.
an audit report admitted into evidence at trial in the bankruptcy court forms the main basis for the sbe tax assessment and its finding that renovizor engaged in civil tax fraud by consistently its income.the sbe auditor,roberta ross ross,testified that her progress was made difficult by lack of documentation and records from renovizor.the audit report states that no work papers were attached to the sales tax returns and that sales invoices that were provided were impossible to reconcile with the returns.according to the audit report,c ompleted sales invoices were filed in customer files,bookcases,vendor files,desks and,from a conversation with store personal sic,the owners employees homes.the audit report finds that renovizor failed to produce any general ledgers,sales journals,or dailies.there was also evidence of very questionable practices the report also discloses the existence of a separate file for cash receipts and payments,which renovizor had not disclosed.the audit report states that renovizor indicated that during the audit period some records had been stolen along with a computer.
the absence of records made it impossible directly to compare the company sales as reported on sales tax returns with the actual sales.thus,the audit used a derived from an analysis of available business records in the third quarter of to estimate actual sales over the period.having estimated actual sales for,the sbe calculated a tax assessment based on the of income.using the assumption that renovizor had income during in the same proportion as it did in,the sbe also calculated an assessment of tax liability for the earlier time period.
in addition to the tax assessment,ross recommended imposing an additional percent fraud penalty.her recommendation was based,in part,on a fax renovizor sent to lane financial lane fax.the cover sheet of the lane fax set forth a gross sales figure of almost million in compared to renovizor reported sales of.attached to the lane fax was an unaudited financial statement dated june,indicating retail taxable sales of for the preceding twelve months compared to renovizor reported taxable sales of for the same period.on july,the sbe assessment became final.
renovizor ceased operations and filed for chapter protection on june.renovizor bankruptcy case was subsequently converted to a chapter proceeding.the sbe filed a proof of claim for,including the sales tax deficiency,fraud penalty,and interest.
renovizor objected to the sbe claim.the bankruptcy court conducted a trial and published an opinion affirming the sbe tax and fraud claims.in re renovizors.the bankruptcy court concluded the sbe assessment for sales taxes was valid the sbe must prove fraud by a preponderance of the evidence,not by clear and convincing evidence and fraud had been proved by a preponderance of the evidence.on october,the bankruptcy court entered its order allowing the sbe claim in full.
on appeal,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court in an unpublished order.renovizor filed a timely notice of appeal to the ninth circuit.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
state law determines the validity of a creditor claim against a bankrupt estate,including the allocation of the appropriate burden of proof in bankruptcy court.grogan garner,d.the sbe must assess a percent penalty on a deficiency that is due to fraud or an intent to evade the payment of taxes.cal.the bankruptcy court ruled,and the district court affirmed,that preponderance of the evidence was the appropriate standard for civil tax fraud in california.applying this evidentiary standard,the bankruptcy court determined that civil tax fraud existed for.renovizor,however,contends that civil tax fraud must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.
the bankruptcy court stated that the determination of the proper standard of proof is important to the result of the case.the court assessed whether the sbe met its evidentiary burden with evidence of badges of fraud as described in alexander shokai,commissioner,cir,which applied a clear and convincing standard.here,the evidence of fraud considered by the bankruptcy court and by the district court is circumstantial there is no direct evidence establishing an intent by renovizor to defraud.the evidence includes reporting of taxable income,the lane fax,implausible and inconsistent stories given during the audit,failure to maintain adequate records,and the existence of a separate,undisclosed drawer for cash sales.some of this evidence,however,is inapplicable to the audit period.
by our order of january,we certified to the california supreme court the issue of whether civil tax fraud required proof by clear and convincing evidence,or instead a preponderance of the evidence.the california supreme court in its court minutes of february,declined to accept the case for certification.it is therefore our duty to decide this issue of california law.
there is significance here to the standard of proof.if the proper standard for civil tax fraud requires proof by clear and convincing evidence,we will reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this legal standard.it is possible that the evidence would not support a finding of fraud for the period under the clear and convincing standard.it is possible that the clear and convincing standard would not permit sustaining the fraud finding for the period,which was calculated by extrapolating evidence relating to the period.sbe tax assessment,including the fraud penalty and interest,might be reduced or even eliminated upon remand if the clear and convincing standard applies.in contrast,if the preponderance of evidence standard is applicable in a civil tax fraud case,we will affirm the decision below,having determined that the other issues raised do not require reversal.the determination of the appropriate standard of proof in california for civil tax fraud is dispositive of this appeal
