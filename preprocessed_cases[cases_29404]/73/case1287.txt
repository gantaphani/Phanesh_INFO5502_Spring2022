in this appeal,the parties dispute whether disclosure of certain internal revenue service irs settlement information could risk circumvention of the law a category exempted from disclosure under the freedom of information act foia.id.b e.on for summary judgment,the district court held the settlement information is covered by foia exemption e.because the disclosure of such information could risk circumvention of the law,we find the information falls within the foia exemption and therefore affirm the ruling of the district court.
background 
the foia request in this case involves lilo arrangements between entities and taxable entities.lilo arrangements occur when a entity owns and uses property but shifts significant tax deductions by signing a lease with a taxable entity,reserving the right to cancel the lease.the owner then subleases the property back from the taxable entity.arguably,the only purpose of the lilo scheme is to reduce the tax burden of the taxable entity,who otherwise has no ownership interest in the property.
in,the irs disallowed deductions based on lilo schemes.in,congress made lilos illegal,but the statute had only prospective effect.see.the irs continues to audit taxpayers engaged in lilo transactions and disallows the reported deductions.many of these cases are settled.
in,mayer brown llp filed a foia request for various information relating to the irs lilo settlement practices.through the course of litigation,the irs turned over numerous documents,and the parties resolved almost all other issues by agreement.the only remaining issue concerns one small class of information,described by the district court as settlement strategies and objectives,assessments of litigating hazards,and acceptable ranges of percentages for settlement.mayer brown irs,slip op.at,order granting motion for clarification.on for summary judgment and after reviewing the information in camera,the district court held that the irs does not have to turn over the remaining settlement information because foia exemption e applies.
ii.discussion 
the sole issue in this case is whether the information requested by mayer brown meets foia exemption e.that exemption states,in relevant part 
b this section,mandatory foia disclosure does not apply to matters that are 
records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes,but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information 
e would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.
b emphasis added.of the several requirements under exemption e,the only one disputed by the parties is whether disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.id.
circumvent is nowhere defined in the statute webster defines the word as t o avoid by or as if by passing around.webster ii new college dictionary.the breadth of the phrase circumvention of the law encompasses more than direct violations.while using information to violate the law is one example of circumvention,it is also circumvention of the law to evade punishment after committing a violation.thus,for instance,circumvention of the law includes both the person who violates the law and the fugitive who escapes the consequences of a previous violation.see united states arias,slip op.at,affirming enhancement of sentence because the defendant was a fugitive for two years after the initial criminal violation.
used in a general way,the law encompasses both prohibitions against certain behaviors as well as the legally prescribed consequences for violations.indeed,many statutes both define a violation and describe the applicable punishment.see,any person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax shall,in addition to other penalties provided by law,be guilty of a felony and,upon conviction thereof,shall be fined not more than or imprisoned not more than years,or both.what constitutes circumvention varies,depending on the kind of prohibition and the enforcement mechanisms involved.
exemption e shields information if disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.b e.if the foia request here sought a checklist used by agents to detect fraudulent tax schemes or the words most likely to trigger increased surveillance during a wiretap,the applicability of the exemption would be obvious.but enforcement of the tax laws,a largely obligation,depends heavily on the personal probity of taxpayers and the deterrent effect of severe and certain sanctions.and,as a slew of high profile cases have recently demonstrated,compliance will often be delayed until enforcement or unfavorable exposure is imminent.
presumably,the importance of deterrence explains why the exemption is written in broad and general terms.it does not simply apply when information will definitely lead to circumvention of the law.the irs does not have to prove that circumvention is a necessary result the statute exempts information that would risk circumvention of the law.b e emphasis added.showing a risk,of course,is a lower standard than showing a certainty.but the statute does not stop there.rather than requiring the irs to prove a risk of circumvention,the statute exempts information that would be expected to risk circumvention of the law.id.emphasis added.risk of circumvention is not an expectation of such a risk.moreover,this expectation of a risk of circumvention need not be undeniable or universal the risk need only be reasonably expected.id.emphasis added.adding a final strike against a rigidly narrow interpretation,the exemption does not force the irs to show this reasonably expected risk with that disclosure could reasonably be expected to create such a risk.id.emphasis added.
in short,the exemption looks not just for circumvention of the law,but for a risk of circumvention not just for an actual or certain risk of circumvention,but for an expected risk not just for an undeniably or universally expected risk,but for a reasonably expected risk and not just for certitude of a reasonably expected risk,but for the chance of a reasonably expected risk.the settlement guidelines requested here certainly meet this threshold as information that could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.id.
although the settlement guidelines requested are not how to manuals for,the exemption is broader than that.exemption e clearly protects information that would train potential violators to evade the law or instruct them how to break the law.but it goes further.it exempts from disclosure information that could increase the risks that a law will be violated or that past violators will escape legal consequences.though the information here does not necessarily provide a blueprint for tax shelter schemes,it could encourage decisions to violate the law or evade punishment.
tax evasion like many crimes,to varying degrees involves a analysis on the part of the.information about acceptable settlement ranges quite clearly affects the analysis of potential evaders because it informs their economic calculus.some potential evaders,upon learning the range of settlement percentages,may decide that the range is low enough to make evasion an appealing gamble.in this way,disclosure of the information can create an incentive for increased evasion.for example,suppose hypothetically the requested information revealed that the irs acceptable settlement range goes as low as of the amount due,and a potential evader expects to gain a greater sum through an illegal tax scheme.equipped with this information,the potential evader might decide the risk of a settlement is low enough to gamble and violate the tax laws.
similar reasoning applies to other categories of information at issue.litigation hazards may include types of illegal tax shelters the irs does not have the resources to pursue,situations which make witnesses unsympathetic or hard to find,or practical complications for investigating certain types of schemes.a potential evader who is made aware of the irs perceived litigation hazards will know how to best st
