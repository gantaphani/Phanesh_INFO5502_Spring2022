code of civil procedure section provides that the general procedure for the presentation of claims for money or damages against a local government entity is prescribed by the government claims act,et.in ardon city of los angeles cal th,ardon,we held that the government claims act permits a class action claim by taxpayers against a local government entity for the refund of an unlawful tax in the absence of a specific tax refund procedure set forth in an applicable governing claims statute.in the case now before us,the defendant local government entity asserts that its municipal code contains an applicable governing claims statute barring class action claims for a tax refund.we find that a local ordinance is not a statute within the meaning of the government claims act and therefore affirm the court of appeal.
background 
the current dispute arises out of a class action lawsuit filed in november by plaintiff john mcwilliams,a resident of defendant city of long beach the city,filed on behalf of himself and similarly situated individuals challenging the city telephone users tax tut and seeking refund of the taxes paid.mcwilliams asserts that long beach municipal code section,subdivision d exempted from the tut all amounts that are exempt from or not subject to the federal excise tax on telephone service and that the city has for some time mischaracterized the charges subject to the federal excise tax.
the particulars of the mischaracterization are not at issue in this proceeding.it is enough for our purposes to relate that the internal revenue service,following several adverse court decisions,announced in that it would cease collecting the federal excise tax on long distance and bundled services and allow federal taxpayers to obtain a refund by checking a box on their federal tax returns.in august,mcwilliams served a demand on the city and its officers to refund the money he asserted that the city had improperly collected on certain telephone services during the prior two years.the city did not respond.instead,in september,the city council amended its tut ordinance to remove any reference to the federal excise tax but did so without seeking the approval of the voters under article xiii c of the california constitution,commonly known as proposition.the complaint alleges that the city unlawfully collected and continues to collect the tut on services that have been conclusively determined to be under the federal excise tax.
the class action complaint asserted six causes of action declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the collection of the tut declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the city council amendment to the tut ordinance money had and received unjust enrichment a violation of due process because of the city failure to provide either a or remedy and a writ of mandate requiring the city to provide a or remedy.the city demurred to the complaint,arguing among other things that long beach municipal code sections and disallow class claims for a refund.the trial court ruled that class claims for a refund were barred under woosley state of california cal th,and sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.when mcwilliams stated he would not be amending his complaint,the trial court entered an order dismissing the case.
the court of appeal stayed the appeal for three years pending this court resolution of ardon.in ardon,we explained that woosley state of california,supra,cal th,had not erected a categorical bar to class claims for a tax refund all that woosley demands is that a court first examine the claims statutes at issue in a claim for a taxpayer refund to determine whether the legislature contemplated a class claim under the applicable california code.ardon,supra,cal th at.woosley did not analyze the applicability of government code section ardon,on the other hand,did address the applicability of section and held that class claims for tax refunds against a local governmental entity are permissible under section in the absence of a specific tax refund procedure set forth in an applicable governing claims statute.ardon,supra,cal th at.
after lifting the stay,the court of appeal held that t he city is not authorized under the government claims act to establish its own claims procedure for tut refunds and that mcwilliams can file a class claim for a tut refund under ardon,supra,cal th.accordingly,the court of appeal reversed the trial court order with respect to the first,second,third,and fourth causes of action.
we granted the city petition for review to decide whether the exception to the government claims act for c laims under a statute prescribing procedures for the refund of any tax in section,subdivision a,excludes local charter provisions and ordinances prescribing procedures for a tax refund if so,whether the application of the government claims act to local tax refund claims violates the home rule taxing power of charter cities and whether article xiii,section of the california constitution requires that a tax refund proceeding be expressly authorized by the legislative body of the local government entity.
discussion 
the government claims act act established a standardized procedure for bringing claims against local governmental entities.ardon,supra,cal th at see stats,ch,enacting former et now et the purpose of the act is to provide the public entity sufficient information to enable it to adequately investigate claims and to settle them,if appropriate,without the expense of litigation.city of san jose superior court cal d.on august,prior to filing this class action,mcwilliams served a demand on the city in the form of a letter on behalf of himself and all similarly situated taxpayers seeking a refund of the tut.the question in this appeal is whether mcwilliams was entitled to present this claim on behalf of the entire class or,instead,whether each member of the putative class must present an individual claim prior to filing suit.
according to the act,all claims for money or damages against local public entities are to be presented in accordance with chapter commencing with section and chapter commencing with section,except as provided in section.one of the exceptions in section is for c laims under the revenue and taxation code or other statute prescribing procedures for the refund of any tax or any portion thereof,subd.a.when a claim is excepted from the act by section and is not governed by any other statutes or regulations expressly relating thereto,the claim shall be governed by the procedure prescribed in any charter,ordinance or regulation adopted by the local public entity,subd.a.
we discussed the operation of these provisions in ardon.the claim in ardon,like the claim here,involved a class action lawsuit for refund of a tut,but unlike the city here the defendant city of los angeles did not identify any municipal ordinance that prescribed procedures for a refund of the tax.ardon,supra,cal th at,fn.ardon held that claims for tax refunds against a local governmental entity,including class claims,are permitted by section in the absence of a specific tax refund procedure set forth in an applicable governing claims statute.ardon,supra,cal th at.because ardon particular claim did not involve any applicable municipal code or statute governing claims for refunds id.at,we did not decide whether a local charter provision or municipal ordinance could qualify as a statute prescribing procedures for the refund of any tax within the meaning of section,subdivision a.see ardon,supra,cal th at,fn.
in this case,the city contends that class actions seeking refunds of its local taxes are excepted from the act by long beach municipal code sections and which assertedly bar class actions for refunds.whether the claim here is excepted from the act thus depends on whether it is a c laim under a statute prescribing procedures for the refund of any tax,subd.a,italics added.the city argues that an ordinance qualifies as a statute within the meaning of section,subdivision a.mcwilliams,on the other hand,contends that the word statute in this provision is limited to laws enacted by the legislature,congress,or the people.
the legislature has provided definitions of many of the terms in the act,including statute.these definitions govern the construction of the act u nless the provision or context otherwise requires.we therefore turn to section,which defines a statute as an act adopted by the legislature of this state or by the congress of the united states,or a statewide initiative act.this definition,as the city concedes,excludes local charters and ordinances.societa per azioni de navigazione italia city of los angeles cal d,provision of the act limiting immunity of a public entity to that provided by statute does not include local ordinances or regulations.the city,though,contends that the context otherwise requires a more expansive definition of the term statute as used in section,subdivision a one that would encompass local legislation.we disagree.
when the legislature intended a broader scope than the statutory definition of statute in section,it used broader language.subdivision b of section,for example,excepts from the act c laims in connection with which the filing of a notice of lien,statement of claim,or stop notice is required under any law relating to liens of mechanics,laborers,or materialmen,and subdivision e excepts claims for any form of public assistance under the welfare and institutions code or other provisions of law relating to public assistance programs.italics added.had the legislature similarly intended to except a broader range of claims in subdivision a,one assumes it would have used one of these formulations.zalkind ceradyne,th,when the legislature intends the word complaint to include,it says so.
moreover,other parts of the act reveal that the legislature understood the terms statute,ordinance,and charter to mean different things.for example,section,subdivision a provides that claims against a local entity for money or damages which are excepted by section and which are not governed by any other statutes or regulations expressly relating thereto,shall be governed by the procedure prescribed in any charter,ordinance,or regulation adopted by the local public entity.having used these terms for their distinct meanings in one part of act,it is unlikely the legislature intended statute to encompass all three meanings in section,subdivision a.
furthermore,interpreting the word statute in accordance with the statutory definition does not render the term meaningless or inoperative in section,nor does it lead to absurd consequences.a number of other statutes,outside the revenue and taxation code,prescribe the procedures for the refund of a local tax,assessment,fee,or charge,subd.a see,bus,subd.c,subds.d,e,health,mil,subd.b.it is therefore reasonable to interpret the exemption for c laims under the revenue and taxation code or other statute prescribing procedures for the refund of any tax,assessment,fee,or charge,subd.a to encompass only those claims that arise under the revenue and taxation code or any other statute providing for a refund.accordingly,neither the provision or context otherwise requires a broader definition of the word statute.see.
the existence of these other statutes distinguishes the word statute in section,subdivision a from the word regulation in section,subdivision a.that section provides that claims for money or damages against a local public entity that are excepted by section,and that are not governed expressly by any other statutes or regulations,shall be governed by the procedure prescribed in any charter,ordinance or regulation adopted by the local public entity,subd.a,italics added even though the act definition of regulation encompasses only regulations promulgated by a state or federal agency.in that circumstance,where the word regulation would otherwise be inoperative but see johnson san diego unified school dist.d,although a school district constitutes a state agency it is a local public entity under the requirements of the act,the context may require a definition other than the statutory definition.hassan mercy american river hospital cal th.but that is not the situation with the word statute in section,subdivision a.
the case law on which the city relies is similarly distinguishable.in those cases,the court of appeal determined that the statutory definition of a given term is superseded when it obviously conflicts with the legislature subsequent use of the term in a different statute.diamond view limited herz d,italics added see also boy scouts of america national foundation superior court th,holding that the word person in code civ,subd.a should not be interpreted to include a corporate entity notwithstanding code civ,subd.a because subdivision a and a refer to liability against any person or entity,reliance on the statutory definition would require us to insert the word entity in section,subdivision a or ignore the word entity in subdivision a and watershed enforcers department of water resources th,in determining whether the department was a person within the meaning of fish,notwithstanding fish,the court relied on the fact that other parts of the state endangered species act emphasize d the act application to public agencies,including a provision exempting public agencies from fish,in certain circumstances it is illogical to expressly exempt an entity from a prohibition that did not apply to it in the first place american liberty bail bonds,garamendi th,provision allowing the insurance commissioner to suspend the license of a subject person from employment or participating in the conduct of the business necessarily applied only to natural persons notwithstanding,otherwise the subdivision does not make sense.interpreting statute in government code section,subdivision a in accordance with the statutory definition,by contrast,does not present an equivalent conundrum.
the absence of ambiguity in the statutory language dispenses with the need to review the legislative history.people albillar cal th.we note,however,that the legislative history does not support the city contention that the legislature intended to preserve plenary control by local governments over the procedures for local tax refunds.see volkswagen pacific.city of los angeles cal d,statute does not refer to ordinance unless the context of section,subdivision a,otherwise requires.there is nothing in the legislative history to suggest that statute within section,subdivision a,is to have a special meaning unique to that section.
as originally proposed,the standardized procedures of the act embodied in government code section would not have applied to c laims under the revenue and taxation code or other provisions of law prescribing procedures for the refund of any tax ardon,supra,cal th at,quoting recommendation and study relating to the presentation of claims against public entities cal.law revision com.a study.the law revision commission reasoned that for tax refund claims,as with claims required by the mechanics and materialmen lien laws and claims for aid under public assistance programs,the basic objectives of early investigation to prevent litigation and discourage false claims which support a uniform procedure for tort and inverse condemnation claims are not applicable and orderly administration of the substantive policies governing the enumerated types of claims strongly suggests that claims procedure should be closely and directly integrated into such substantive policies.obvious and compelling reasons appear for gearing tax refund claims to assessment,levy and collection dates and procedures establishing special modes for protecting mechanics and material suppliers on public projects and providing an uncomplicated routine procedure for processing the tremendous volume of salary,pension,workmen compensation and public assistance claims study,supra,cal.law revision com,at a.
had the legislature actually enacted the version proposed by the law revision commission,we could conclude that charters and ordinances concerning refunds of local taxes clearly fall within the category of c laims under the revenue and taxation code or other provisions of law prescribing procedures for the refund of any tax ardon,supra,cal th at.but as we recently observed in ardon,supra
