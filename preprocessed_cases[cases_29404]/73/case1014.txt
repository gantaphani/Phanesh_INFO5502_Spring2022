we are asked to decide whether the district court properly determined the amount of intended loss for purposes of sentencing,and the amount of actual loss for purposes of restitution,resulting from convictions for bankruptcy fraud.
letantia bussell letantia is a practicing dermatologist her late husband,john bussell,was a practicing cardiac anaesthesiologist until.in,the bussells were experiencing significant financial difficulties.they owed the internal revenue service irs and the california state franchise tax board approximately million in taxes,interests,and penalties assessed for tax years,and.they also owed the bank of beverly hills.
upon the advice of their former lawyers,the bussells organized the dermatology practice into a structure in.the new arrangement separated the business and medical aspects of bussells practice bbl medical management,bbl received the practice gross receipts,paid the expenses and overhead,and retained the profits beverly hills dermatology medical beverly hills medical received to of bbl profits and employed letantia through her professional corporation,bussell,md,bussell,for an artificially reduced salary.bbl and beverly hills medical were held in the names of nominee owners letantia was the sole shareholder and officer of public record of bussell.the bussells further enlisted the help of their former lawyers in to set up various corporations to conceal ownership of a condominium in the lodge in park city,utah the utah condominium,a san diego farm,and receipt of disability insurance income.the bussells also opened an bank account to receive funds from john bussell pension plan.
on march,the bussells,together with their former lawyers,filed a joint bankruptcy petition.the bussells reported total assets of and total debts of on that petition.the amount of debt scheduled for discharge totaled,but the bankruptcy court only discharged debt of because a liability of to provident was at issue in pending litigation.
following the bankruptcy discharge,letantia was charged in a indictment,along with two,with conspiracy,concealment of assets in contemplation of bankruptcy,making false declarations,perjury,and attempted tax evasion.at trial,the bussells argued that they had acted in good faith and relied on the advice of their lawyers.bussell i,at.after jury deliberations had begun,john bussell fell to his death from his hotel room.id.
the jury ultimately convicted letantia of the following counts charged in the indictment conspiracy to conceal assets in contemplation of bankruptcy and to make false statements in the bankruptcy count concealing ownership in bbl,including bbl bank account with a balance of count concealing ownership in beverly hills medical,including beverly hills medical bank account with a balance of count making false statements in the bankruptcy petition counts and and willfully attempting to evade a substantial portion of income tax owed for tax years,and count.the jury,however,acquitted letantia of concealing ownership of the utah condominium count making a false oath and account that she was not actively involved with any corporations other than bussell,except on a passive investment basis count and willfully attempting to evade a substantial portion of income tax owed for count.
their former lawyers,sherman and beaudry,entered into plea agreements with the government,under which sherman pleaded guilty to conspiracy and to attempted tax evasion,and beaudry pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting attempted tax evasion and the filing of false tax returns.id.
applying the sentencing guidelines,the district court sentenced letantia to a sentence of months imprisonment.in determining her offense level for purposes of calculating an appropriate guidelines range,the district court increased the base offense level by levels,finding that the intended loss equaled,the amount of debt scheduled for discharge in bankruptcy.the district court also ordered letantia to pay,in addition to a special assessment and a fine,restitution totaling,for which she was jointly and severally liable with attorneys sherman and beaudry,and prosecution costs totaling.
letantia timely appealed her conviction,her sentence,and the district court orders of restitution and costs.the government timely letantia sentence.in bussell i,we affirmed letantia conviction,but ordered a limited remand pursuant to ameline.bussell i,at.we also vacated the district court orders of restitution and prosecution costs,and remanded for reconsideration.id.
on remand,the district court declined to reopen sentencing proceedings,concluding that letantia sentence would not have materially differed had the guidelines been advisory at the time of the original sentencing.the district court also ordered restitution of,costs of prosecution of,and a criminal fine of.
letantia timely appealed.
we first consider letantia various challenges to her sentence 
the sentencing guidelines assign a base offense level of six,see a and then increase levels according to the amount of loss resulting from the fraud,see b the accompanying application notes define loss as the value of the money,property,or services unlawfully taken.cmt.the application notes further provide that if an intended loss that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined,this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual loss.cmt.in some cases,additional factors are to be considered in determining the loss or intended loss.cmt.the commentary also explains that the loss need not be determined with precision.the court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss,given the available information.cmt.emphasis added.
the thrust of letantia argument is that intended loss should be categorically limited to the value of the concealed assets or the value of her liabilities,whichever is less.she contends that the district court erred by determining her intended loss based on the amount of debt discharged in bankruptcy,rather than by the allegedly much lower net value of the concealed assets,
this argument appears at first glance to find support in eighth circuit precedents.in united states dolan,cir,the defendant committed bankruptcy fraud by concealing assets well in excess of the debt to be discharged.id.at.under those circumstances,the eighth circuit concluded that the intended loss should be calculated by using either the value of the assets concealed or the value of the debtor liabilities,whichever is less.id.at.in contrast to the facts in dolan,in united states wheeldon,cir,the defendant filed for bankruptcy,concealing assets worth much less than the debt scheduled to be discharged.id.at.the eighth circuit stated in wheeldon that i t belies reality to argue that the defendant,or a debtor similarly situated,intended to defraud his creditors of everything he owed them solely because he failed to disclose all of his rather modest assets.id.at.accordingly,the eighth circuit held that intended loss must be limited to the value of the concealed assets that the defendant creditors would have known about if the bankruptcy petition had been truthful.id.
letantia relies on these eighth circuit decisions to argue that we should fashion a categorical rule for purposes of sentencing in bankruptcy fraud cases.we decline such invitation.first,in united states holthaus,cir,an opinion filed after oral argument in this case,the eighth circuit rejected a similar mischaracterization of dolan and wheeldon.id.at.there,the eighth circuit expressly held there is no blanket rule defining intended loss as the lesser of the value of assets concealed or the value of the debtor liabilities.indeed,some factual scenarios may require an intended loss calculation based on the greater of the value of the assets concealed or debt sought to be discharged.id.when determining intended loss,the eighth circuit emphasized,the focus must be on the amount of loss a defendant actually intended to cause his creditors.id.
our decision in united states stoddard,counsels as well against adopting a broad categorical limitation on intended loss.there,we advised sentencing courts against mechanically apply ing the sentencing guidelines in calculating loss in fraud cases.id.at alteration in original.instead,we urged sentencing courts to take a realistic,economic approach to determine what losses the defendant truly caused or intended to cause,rather than the use of some approach which does not reflect the monetary loss.id.internal quotation marks omitted.t he objective under the economic reality approach is to arrive at a fair assessment of the loss the defendant actually inflicted or intended to inflict,as contemplated by the guidelines.united states riley,cir.
in light of our precedent,as well as the eighth circuit recent decision in holthaus,we decline to impose a mechanical limitation on intended loss as letantia urges we will not tie the sentencing court hands with such limitation because we do not believe it would reflect the economic reality in every bankruptcy fraud case.in the cases where the debtor acts alone and his fraudulent activities consist solely of failing to disclose a concealed asset on the bankruptcy petition,limiting intended loss to either the value of the concealed assets or the debt discharged,whichever is less,may well reflect economic realities.but in cases like the one at bar,where a debtor,together with other,engages in a lengthy,orchestrated scheme to defraud creditors by filing a fraudulent bankruptcy petition,limiting the loss to concealed assets or income will not always reflect economic realities.accordingly,declining to adopt a categorical rule,we are unpersuaded that the district court erred by not limiting intended loss in the complex bankruptcy fraud case to the value of the concealed assets.
having concluded that the district court legal interpretation of the sentencing guidelines was correct,we now must consider letantia argument that the district court clearly erred in its factual determination that the intended loss equaled,the amount of debt scheduled to be discharged in the bankruptcy to be clearly erroneous,we have often repeated,a decision must strike us more than just maybe or probably wrong it must strike us as wrong with the force of a,unrefrigerated dead fish.hayes woodford,cir internal quotation marks omitted.no such stench lingers here.
when determining intended loss,we must look to the amount of loss that letantia intended to cause her creditors.among other things,letantia was convicted of conspiring with her husband and former lawyers from about june until february,with the purpose of discharging her outstanding debts including a substantial federal tax debt,through filing bankruptcy while maintaining control over and access to property concealed and transferred in the preceding two years in contemplation of bankruptcy,and property of the bankruptcy estate,by means of fraud,concealment and misrepresentation.the evidence establishes,and letantia admits in her briefs,that she began experiencing significant financial difficulties in,and owed the irs and the california state franchise tax board in excess of million,and the fdic,as the receiver for the bank of beverly hills,as well as other substantial debts.the evidence also establishes that over the next several years letantia engaged her former lawyers to create a number of corporations in the name of nominee owners for the purposes of rerouting the profits from her medical practice,thereby giving the appearance that she owned less assets and earned less income,and moving various real estate holdings and disability payments to other corporations and an bank account in the name of nominee owners.on march,after the required period had elapsed to discharge the debt for tax deficiencies,letantia and john bussell,together with their former lawyers,filed for bankruptcy seeking to discharge debt in the amount of.in light of all the facts and circumstances,it can not be said that the district court clearly erred in finding that letantia engaged in the conspiracy over four years with the intent fraudulently to inflict a loss on her creditors equal to the debts scheduled for discharge in bankruptcy.see holland,at.the strength of this evidence belies letantia claim that she only intended a loss of to her creditors.see saacks,at.
we have one final sentencing matter to address.letantia alternatively argues that,because the government stipulated in a plea agreement with sherman that the highest offense level was determined by using the sentencing guidelines relating to tax offenses,the government now should be judicially estopped from arguing that the same conspiracy involved a much greater loss for purposes of determining her intended loss.we are unpersuaded by this argument.
first,judicial estoppel is most commonly applied to bar a party from making a factual assertion in a legal proceeding which directly contradicts an earlier assertion made in the same proceeding or a prior one.russell rolfs,cir.the government has made no such contradictory factual assertions in this case.the government simply stipulated in sherman plea agreement to apply and,which govern offenses involving taxation,rather than,which governs offenses involving fraud which would otherwise apply in letantia case.the government was free to stipulate with sherman in a separate case involving different charges which sentencing guidelines provisions would apply to sherman.
moreover,we held in united states taylor,cir,that a disparity in sentencing among is not,by itself,a sufficient ground for attacking an otherwise proper sentence under the guidelines.rather,a defendant can only challenge his sentence by showing that it was the result of incorrect or inadmissible information,or an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
we therefore reject as unpersuasive letantia final challenge to the district court determination of intended loss based on principles of judicial estoppel.because the district court determination of intended loss was not erroneous,we affirm letantia sentence.
we next consider letantia argument that the district court restitution order of,the amount of debt actually discharged minus payments by her,was excessive 
in its first restitution order,the district court ordered bussell,jointly and severally with beaudry and sherman,to pay restitution in the amount of,which consisted of the debt actually discharged in the bankruptcy proceedings,plus that john bussell had agreed to pay in the settlement of related litigation in.in bussell i,we held that the amount of restitution under the victim and witness protection act vwpa,a,which applies to this case,is limited by the victim actual loss.bussell i,at internal quotation marks omitted.concluding that the district court ordered restitution in an amount that,but for an adjustment for a settled debt,was equal to the amount of intended losses,we vacate d the order of restitution and remand ed to the district court to determine the actual losses caused by letantia fraudulent is,to compare what actually happened with what would have happened if she had acted lawfully.id.third alteration in original quoting feldman,at.
following remand,the district court ordered letantia to pay restitution in the amount of,which consisted of the debt actually discharged in the bankruptcy proceedings,minus the amount sherman had already paid.
letantia first attacks the restitution order on the ground that the district court failed to apply the proper analysis on remand,as instructed in bussell i.we disagree.
under the vwpa,the district court may order restitution for criminal offenses committed prior to.bussell i,at.in considering restitution,the district court must take into account i the amount of the loss sustained by each victim as a result of the offense and ii the financial resources of the defendant,the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant dependents,and such other factors as the court deems appropriate.a b i.we emphasized in bussell i that the amount of restitution under the vwpa is limited to the victim actual losses.at.
because r estitution can only include losses directly resulting from a defendant offense,a restitution order must be based on losses directly resulting from the defendant criminal conduct.stoddard,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.as we also explained in bussell i,actual loss for restitution purposes is determined by comparing what actually happened with what would have happened if the defendant had acted lawfully.at quoting feldman,at.actual loss in this case equals the excess,if any,of the loss the bankruptcy creditors incurred because of the unlawful conduct,over the loss the creditors would have incurred had letantia acted lawfully.
the district court concluded on remand that had letantia acted lawfully by not engaging in a conspiracy to conceal substantial assets and income leading up to the filing of the bankruptcy petition,and had she made full and complete disclosure of her financial affairs at the time of filing the bankruptcy petition,she would not have had of debt discharged in bankruptcy.accordingly,the district court concluded that the actual loss equaled that amount.this conclusion was obviously grounded in the district court adoption of the presentence report psr factual finding that the value of letantia concealed assets exceeded the debt scheduled to be discharged.
the psr calculated letantia assets and debts as of march,when she filed for bankruptcy.the psr listed concealed assets as 
the bussells interests in bbl and beverly hills medical or the sanwa bank account,the true amount of bussell disability income,consulting fees,and rental income,the true market value of their interest in the stein eriksen condominium,and their interest in uhl and magnum.the bussells did not list any ownership interest in two parcels of farm land in san diego and a palm springs condominium.
the psr then valued the concealed assets at between and in their bankruptcy petition,the bussells reported the total value of their assets to be.combining the concealed and reported assets,the psr concluded,and the district court accepted,that a t the time they filed their bankruptcy petition,the combined value of all of the bussells assets exceeded their total debt.
we are persuaded that the district court adequately stated and explained its resolution of the disputed issue as to the value of the concealed assets pursuant to.and thereby adopted the factual findings provided in the psr.see united states karterman,cir see also united states cannizzaro,cir.in its tentative ruling at the initial sentencing,the district court rejected letantia objections to the psr calculation of her assets,finding that t he psr recites the evidence and other factual matters substantially accurately.in its tentative ruling on proceedings,the district court found that h ere,the government has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant caused actual loss in the amount of as a result of her conspiracy conviction in count one.had the defendant acted lawfully,she would not have conspired in three years of tax planning so that she and her spouse could conceal substantial income and assets to obtain a fraudulent discharge of their debts.moreover,at oral argument on proceedings,the district court declined defense counsel offer to examine the alleged value of the concealed assets,concluding that the papers are clear about what are the fees to account even if you add in the condo in palm springs and farms and all the rest and that the various possible formulae are included in the papers.
in light of the district court adoption of the factual findings in the psr,we are unpersuaded that the district court clearly erred in finding that the value of the assets exceeded the debts to be discharged and therefore the actual loss to the creditors equaled the amount of debt actually discharged in the bankruptcy.letantia arguments to the contrary are without merit.
letantia argues that the district court erred by not limiting the actual loss to the amount concealed in two bank accounts in the name of bbl and beverly hills medical,two companies held in the name of nominee owners.letantia was charged with and convicted for conspiring to conceal three specific assets her beneficial ownership interest in bbl,including bbl bank account with a balance of her beneficial ownership interest in beverly hills medical,including beverly hills medical bank account with a balance of and her equity interest in the utah condominium.she was also charged and convicted of the substantive offense of concealing her beneficial ownership interest in bbl and beverly hills medical,but she was acquitted of the substantive offense of concealing her equity interest in the utah condominium.letantia contends that the district court erred by considering concealed assets beyond the two assets in which she was indicted and convicted of concealing.
letantia relies on hughey united states,d,where the supreme court interpreted the vwpa and reversed an order that required the defendant to pay restitution for counts other than the counts of conviction.the court held that the language and structure of the act make plain congress intent to authorize an award of restitution only for the loss caused by the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense of conviction.id.at.but that decision is of no avail to letantia because,after hughey was decided,congress amended the vwpa by expanding the definition of victim,in part to overrule that decision 
section a of the vwpa now provides that f or purposes of restitution,a victim of an offense that involves as an element a scheme,a conspiracy,or a pattern of criminal activity means any person directly harmed by the defendant criminal conduct in the course of the scheme,conspiracy,or pattern.a emphasis added.as we have explained,u nder the amended statute,when someone is convicted of a crime that includes a scheme,conspiracy,or pattern of criminal activity as an element of the offense,the court can order restitution for losses resulting from any conduct that was part of the scheme,conspiracy,or pattern of criminal activity.for instance,if someone is convicted of a conspiracy,the court can order restitution for damage resulting from any conduct that was part of the conspiracy and not just from specific conduct that met the overt act requirement of the conspiracy conviction.united states reed,cir.
accordingly,because letantia was convicted of a crime that included a conspiracy as an element of the offense,the district court did not err in considering all of the concealed assets for purposes of determining the actual loss to the bankruptcy creditors 
letantia next contends that the district court erred by ordering any restitution because the irs was the only creditor that would have received funds from the two concealed bank accounts with a purported net value of,and the irs had since collected the full amount of the debt it was owed from forfeiture proceedings.we find this argument without merit.for one thing,because this case involved conspiracy,the district court was not limited under the vwpa to considering only the value of the two concealed bank accounts,as discussed above.moreover,the record establishes that at the time of letantia sentencing,she was still contesting the irs right to maintain possession of these collected proceeds in tax court proceedings.because the irs right to these funds was still subject to litigation at the time of sentencing,letantia argument that the district court erred in ordering any restitution fails 
in sum,we are not persuaded that the district court clearly erred in finding that,had letantia acted lawfully,the value of the assets exceeded the debts to be discharged and therefore the actual loss to the creditors equaled the amount of debt actually discharged in the bankruptcy 
we next consider letantia argument that the district court erred by awarding prosecution costs in the amount of.
in count of the indictment,letantia was charged with willfully attempting to evade the payment of income tax for the tax years,and,in violation of initially,the government requested prosecution costs in the amount of,pursuant to.the district court declined to allocate costs among counts,opting instead to assess them in their entirety.in bussell i,we vacated and remanded the order for prosec
