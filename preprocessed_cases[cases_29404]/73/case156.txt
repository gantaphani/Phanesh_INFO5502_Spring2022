this case concerns the timing of two deductions that new york life insurance company new york life or the company,a,taxpayer,claimed on its federal income tax returns for tax years through.in its returns for each of those years,the company deducted the amounts of two types of policyholder dividends that it treated as accrued expenses in the tax years at issue,but which it did not pay until the following years.the internal revenue service irs or the service disallowed the deductions,ruling that the company could not deduct these dividend amounts until the tax year of payment.in the service view,the deductions did not satisfy the test,which governs the deductibility of accrued but unpaid expenses.see reg.a i.
new york life contested the ruling,paid the taxes owed,and challenged the service determination by filing a refund claim for approximately million its calculation of the alleged overpayment plus interest in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.the district court marrero,judge granted the service motion to dismiss the complaint,concluding that new york life failed to and could not allege that for the tax years in which they were deducted,the liabilities satisfied the test.new york life ins.united states,d.
for the reasons more fully discussed below,we agree with the district court that,with respect to the two claimed deductions,all events had not yet occurred to fix the company liability in the tax years in which the company took the deductions.because the company liability for the dividends was contingent,it did not satisfy the regulatory requirements for deduction of an accrued expense.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the following statement of facts is drawn primarily from the allegations of new york life complaint 
the two types of policyholder dividends at issue 
new york life is a mutual life insurance company organized under the laws of the state of new york.like many such entities,the company issues some policies that entitle their holders to receive a policyholder dividend a share of the company annual divisible surplus.compl.see ins.law a.during the period from through,the company distributed such policyholder dividends both at set periods and upon the occurrence of certain events,such as the death of the insured.because the internal revenue code allows life insurance companies to deduct from gross income an amount equal to the policyholder dividends paid or accrued during the taxable year,c,the company deducted the amount of these dividends.
at issue here is the timing of the company deductions related to two categories of policyholder dividends the company annual dividend for january policies and its termination dividend.
a.the annual dividend for january policies 
in compliance with new york law,see ins.law,and the terms of its policies,the company paid certain of its whole life policyholders an annual dividend on the relevant policy anniversary date this annual dividend comprised the policyholder share of the company surplus.
the timing of the company distribution of the annual dividend to eligible policyholders depended on the policy anniversary date and the schedule for the policyholder premium payments.according to the terms of the policies at issue here,new york life paid an annual dividend to a policyholder only if,as of the policy anniversary date,the policy was then in force and all premiums due ha d been paid to that anniversary.compl.for a policyholder paying monthly premiums,for instance,payment of the twelfth premium in any single period would keep the policy in force through its anniversary date.
the company practice in the relevant period was to credit a policyholder account with the amount of the annual dividend on a date the credit date that was before,but not more than thirty days before,the policy anniversary date.the credit would occur if,as of the credit date,the policyholder had paid all premiums necessary to keep the policy in force through its anniversary date.new york life did not actually pay the dividend,however,until the credited policy anniversary date.
for most policies those with anniversary dates falling from february through december the credit date fell within the same calendar year as the anniversary date.for policies with january anniversary dates,however,the credit date and the anniversary date typically fell in different calendar and thus tax years.
the company deducted from its gross income for tax year the cumulative annual dividends on policies that had credit dates in december and anniversary dates in january.it did the same for tax years through.we refer to this deduction as the deduction for the annual dividend for january policies.
b.the termination dividend and the minimum dividend liability deduction 
certain policies eligible for the annual dividend were also eligible,under new york life practices,to receive an amount the company called a termination dividend.this was a share of the company surplus that it paid the policyholder or beneficiary upon the policy termination,whether the termination occurred because the policy matured,the policyholder died,or the policyholder surrendered the policy to obtain its cash value although the termination dividend,like the annual dividend,was drawn from the company surplus,the two dividends were calculated on different bases.
in the complaint,new york life alleged that,in every year from through,it made one of three possible combinations of dividend payments to eligible policyholders an annual dividend,a termination dividend,or both an annual dividend and a termination dividend.it reasoned as follows if the terminating event the policy maturity,or the policyholder surrender of the policy or death occurred before it credited the policy with the annual dividend,the company would pay the termination dividend only.if the terminating event occurred after new york life credited the policy with the annual dividend,the company would pay both the annual and the termination dividends.and,if no terminating event occurred in a given year,the policyholder would receive only the annual dividend.therefore,new york life alleged,under any scenario during these years,it paid at least the lesser of the annual or termination dividend to these policyholders 
new york life accrual and payment methods for the termination dividend were as follows.in each december from through,the company calculated the annual dividends and termination dividends it expected to pay in the following year to eligible policyholders.the company then determined,on a basis,the lesser of the two amounts.it claimed the aggregate of those amounts on its returns for through as a deduction for an accrued dividend under code section.for present purposes,we will refer to this claimed deduction as the company deduction for the minimum liability dividend.
prior proceedings 
new york life timely filed tax returns for the years through,claiming in each year a deduction for the annual dividend for january policies and a deduction for the minimum dividend liability.upon audit,the irs rejected both claimed deductions,ruling that the company was entitled to deduct these policyholder dividends only in the years of actual payment.new york life paid the resulting deficiency and then filed a claim for a refund,which the service denied.the instant action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york ensued.
in its complaint,the company sought principally a refund of million plus interest,claiming that it was entitled to accrue and deduct the two amounts in each of the six tax years at issue the district court granted the service motion to dismiss under.b.the court concluded that the deductions did not satisfy the test,a requirement under treasury regulation a i for deduction of an accrued expense.see new york life,d at.in the court view,new york life failed to allege sufficient facts from which to infer that,in the tax year for which the deduction was claimed,all events had occurred to establish the fact of the liability.as to the annual dividend for january policies,the company claim fell short because it had no obligation to pay the policyholder an annual dividend if he surrendered the policy on the day before the policy anniversary.id.at.as to the minimum dividend liability,the company claim fell short because as of december of each taxable year at issue,new york life did not have an obligation to pay either an annual dividend or a termination dividend in the following taxable year because neither dividend was unconditionally due.id.at.

the all events test 
section c of the internal revenue code permits life insurance companies to deduct from gross income an amount equal to the policyholder dividends paid or accrued during the taxable year.code c emphasis added.to determine whether liability for a policyholder dividend has accrued in a taxable year,we look to irs regulations governing the timing of deductions for accrual basis taxpayers like new york life see ferguson comm r,cir.treasury regulation a i provides that,for such taxpayers,a liability is incurred,and generally is taken into account for federal income tax purposes,in the taxable year in which all the events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability,the amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy,and economic performance has occurred with respect to the liability.
the service and new york life agree that this inquiry governs the timing of a life insurance company deduction of a policyholder dividend under section.they disagree,however,about whether new york life can satisfy the first prong of the inquiry,in which the taxpayer must show,before deducting a dividend,that all the events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability.
together,this prong and the second prong that the amount of the liability be determinable with reasonable accuracy comprise the test.see united states hughes.the test was first articulated in united states anderson,where the supreme court concluded that liability for a munitions tax accrued and became deductible in the taxable year in which all the events occur ed which fix ed the amount of the tax and determine d the liability of the taxpayer to pay it.that general rule appears to have prevailed until,when congress limited its application by imposing an additional economic performance requirement,further defining and restricting the circumstances in which a taxpayer could claim a deduction for an accrued but unpaid expense.see deficit reduction act of,a,stat,codified at h the act united states dynamics.because we find that new york life complaint fails to state a plausible claim that the deductions at issue satisfied the first prong of the test,we consider neither the second prong of the test the fixed amount element,nor the statutory economic performance requirement and its exceptions.
two seminal supreme court cases guide our analysis of the first prong of the test.in united states hughes properties,a nevada casino owner claimed a deduction related to its payout obligations on progressive slot machines machines that,with each play,ratchet up the available jackpot amount,until some patron wins the jackpot.id.at.nevada law prohibited the casino from reducing the amount of the jackpot payable on such a machine until a winner appeared and collected his reward.id.at.accordingly,the casino owner claimed a deduction each year for the marginal amount by which his liability for the jackpot had increased.id.at.in the face of the irs objection to the practice,the court considered whether all events had occurred to establish the fact of the casino owner enhanced liability.
the court determined that all such events had occurred,and permitted the deduction.it reasoned that the effect of the state law forbidding a jackpot reduction until payout to a winner was to fix the casino liability.id.at.although the casino owner did not know when or to whom it would be required to pay the jackpot amount,the casino had a fixed liability for the jackpot which it could not escape,and the liability satisfied the test.id.at.
the following year,in united states general dynamics,the court rejected an employer attempt to deduct a purportedly accrued liability for medical expenses reimbursements.general dynamics,which with respect to its employee medical coverage,required its employees to submit a claim form before it would reimburse an employee medical expenses.id.at.the company sought to deduct the cost of medical services that employees had received in the tax year at issue,but for which they had yet to submit claims forms.id.at.the court refused the deduction,explaining that,because filing the claim form was crucial to establishing the company liability,the employee receipt of medical services did not constitute the last link in the chain of events creating liability for purposes of the all events test.id.at.general dynamics was liable to pay for covered medical services only if properly documented claims forms were filed.id.at.it is fundamental to the all events test,the court instructed,that,although expenses may be deductible before they have become due and payable,liability must first be firmly established a taxpayer may not deduct a liability that is contingent,n or an estimate of an anticipated expense,no matter how statistically certain,if it is based on events that have not occurred by the close of the taxable year.id.at.
these cases highlight that the test is not satisfied,and a liability not established,by a statistical probability however high that the taxpayer will ultimately pay the expense.instead,the test requires that nothing further be needed to create a fixed liability which the taxpayer can not escape.hughes,at see dynamics,at.if the taxpayer obligation remains in some way contingent dependent on some discrete event that has not yet occurred the deduction will not satisfy the test and may be disallowed.dynamics,at hughes,at.
application to the annual dividend for january policies 
applying these principles,we conclude first that the service properly disallowed new york life deduction for the annual dividend for january policies.the company allegations did not support an inference that,as of the credit date,all events had occurred that established the fact of the liability for that dividend.
new york life asserts that the last event for purposes of the test occurred when,in the taxable year,the january policyholders paid the final premium sufficient to keep their policies in force through their anniversary dates in january it is true that the credit date for these january policies fell in the taxable year.further,in the relevant tax years,many perhaps even most of those january policyholders received an annual dividend in january,based on a premium payment in the previous year.
but new york life argument overlooks that the last link in the chain of events creating liability the policyholder decision to keep his or her policy in force through the policy anniversary date did not occur until january of the following year.dynamics,at.according to the complaint and the sample policies,new york life was obligated to pay an annual dividend to a policyholder only if two conditions held the policyholder had paid the last premium necessary to keep the policy in force through its anniversary date,and the policy was in force on the anniversary date.the company has plausibly alleged,and therefore we take as true,that the first condition was satisfied that is,that the company deducted the annual dividend only with respect to those january policyholders who had already paid the premiums necessary to keep the policy in force through the policy anniversary date.
new york life liability also turned,however,on satisfaction of the second condition the company was obligated to pay the annual dividend only if the policyholder also maintained her policy in force through its anniversary date.the sample policies recognize a policyholder right to surrender her policy for its cash value at any time.nowhere do the policies provide that new york life is obligated to pay an annual dividend if a policyholder chooses to cash in her policy before the anniversary date instead,the policies condition payment of an annual dividend on the policy being in force on its anniversary date.see.new york life could not know in december which course of action the policyholder would choose the following month.in economic circumstances favorable to her,a policyholder might decide before the policy anniversary date to forgo the annual dividend and obtain the policy cash value,so as to put the cash to another use or pursue a more remunerative investment option.she was certainly free to do so.
like the district court,we see this dividend liability as most closely analogous to the liability for medical expenses that the taxpayer attempted to deduct as an accrued liability in general dynamics.just as the taxpayer there was liable to pay for covered medical services only if properly documented claims forms were filed,at,so too was new york life liable to pay the annual dividend only if a policyholder kept her policy in force through its anniversary date.that many policyholders may have done so in effect,deciding to maintain the policy in force simply by failing to act does not change our analysis.that policyholders who pay their last premium might even be statistically certain to keep their policies in force through the anniversary date also does not matter the relevant inquiry is whether the liability was based on any events that ha d not occurred by the close of the taxable year.id.at.new york life policies obligated it to pay an annual dividend only if the policy remained in force on the policyholder anniversary date.having adopted this structure,new york life can not at the same time disavow it simply to accelerate its use of the related income tax deduction.
the company responds that code section c provides a deduction for policyholder dividends paid or accrued during the taxable year,and argues that if it must wait until the tax year of payment to deduct the annual dividend for january policies,section c phrase or accrued becomes superfluous.
to see why this argument is unpersuasive,we need look no further than our decision in national life insurance commissioner,cir,a case also addressing a life insurance company deduction of policyholder dividends.there,national life guaranteed dividends on a pro rata,monthly basis.id.at.under this arrangement,a policyholder who terminated her policy before its anniversary date was nonetheless guaranteed and entitled to receive a pro rata monthly share of the annual dividend.id.for example,a policyholder who terminated her policy three months before its anniversary date would receive percent of the year annual dividend,provided that her premium payments were current at the date of termination.id.
in national life,we noted that u nder the accrual method,most insurance companies,because they do not guarantee the payment of policyholder dividends,may not deduct those dividends until the time that such dividends are actually paid.id.national life could deduct its dividends in advance of payment,however,because under its guaranteed dividend policy,it became obligated to pay of the dividend each month.id.emphasis added.
to be sure,our decision in national life ultimately turned on a different section of the code and the language we have quoted is not binding on us here.nonetheless,the case presents a useful factual comparison between liabilities for dividends guaranteed on a pro rata,monthly basis,and liabilities for dividends like those paid by new york life guaranteed only for policies that remained in force for the entire year.national life thus demonstrates how a liability for policyholder dividends may accrue under section c and be deductible in advance of payment,under treasury regulation a i,without running afoul of the test 
new york life also argues that a policyholder decision to keep her policy in force does not constitute an event for purposes of the test.in this regard,the company relies for support on our decision in burnham commissioner,cir,a decision concerning accrual practices but unrelated to the payment of policyholder dividends.in burnham,the taxpayer corporation entered into a settlement agreement on a patent infringement claim.id.at.that agreement required the company to make monthly payments to the individual claimant totalling,whether or not she survived until the end of the period if she did,the payments were to continue until her death.id.using mortality tables to estimate how long the payee was likely to survive and what the amount of its ultimate liability was likely to be,the company,in a single tax year,claimed a deduction for the entire sum it expected to pay over the payee life.the tax court allowed the deduction,and we affirmed.
with respect to the first prong of the test,we reasoned that the event necessary to fix the fact of the company liability to the payee namely,the settlement agreement had occurred by the taxable year in which the company claimed the deduction.id.at emphasis added.and the commissioner d id not dispute that the company liability satisfied the second prong of the all events test,in effect conced ing that the amount of the liability could be determined with reasonable accuracy.id.at.the company was therefore entitled to the deduction.
in addressing the argument that the payee continued survival each year was an event that precluded satisfaction of the test,we also stated that an event is ordinarily something which marks a change in the status quo.id.at.new york life seizes upon this language and argues that,with respect to its dividend accrual for january policyholders,once a policyholder paid her final premium,mere continuation of the status quo would result in the company liability for the annual dividend.therefore,as in burnham,nothing more was required and the deduction should be allowed.
we are not persuaded.first,in burnham,the parties established the fact of the liability when they executed the settlement agreement.id.at.only the ultimate amount of that obligation was uncertain,and the commissioner in effect conceded that the amount of liability could be determined with reasonable accuracy.id.here,the amount was perhaps more certain,but the fact of liability was still tentative.second,we see new york life liability for the annual dividend as depending upon an actual choice by the policyholder her decision not to redeem her policy for cash,for example,and invest her money elsewhere.in burnham,by contrast,no choice was at issue the payee survival was hardly a result of a choice,at least not in any ordinary sense.even acknowledging that many new york life policyholders might not daily or monthly reevaluate whether to surrender their policy,a significant decision is committed to them.thus,the mere continuation of the status quo at issue in burnham is unlike continuation of the status quo for new york life.
finally,a reading of burnham that permits deduction in a taxable year of a liability that is dependent on a third party investment decision in the following year would run afoul of the rule of general dynamics,at,the far closer analogue to the facts presented here.and surely a litigation settlement payment and an insurer annual dividend payment practice offer different contexts for assessing what it means to continue the status quo in the context of applying the test 
accordingly,we conclude that new york life failed to allege facts sufficient to support an inference that its deductions for the annual dividend for january policyholders satisfied the test.
application to the minimum dividend liability 
new york life practice of comparing the size of the annual and termination dividends and then deducting the lesser amount in the tax year before payment also fails to satisfy the requirement that all the events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability.reg.a i.new york life was under no contractual,statutory,or othe
