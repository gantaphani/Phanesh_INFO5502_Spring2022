petitioners ebrima sumbundu and fatoumata yaffa,husband and wife,seek review of an august,decision of the board of immigration appeals bia that affirmed the immigration judge ij november,denial of their applications for cancellation of removal.in re sumbundu,no,aff g nos.and no.immig.city.the ij rejected petitioners applications in part because he found that sumbundu and yaffa failed to demonstrate the good moral character required for obtaining cancellation of removal pursuant to b b.in reaching this conclusion,the ij did not rely on any of the listed f categories that preclude a finding of good moral character instead,as the bia explained,his ruling relied on the catchall provision of f,which provides that although a petitioner conduct may fall outside one of these enumerated categories,that fact does not bar a finding that for other reasons such person is or was not of good moral character.
petitioners contend,inter alia,that the ij and bia erred as a matter of law by applying the wrong standards in evaluating their moral character.in response,the respondent argues that this court has no jurisdiction to review the agency decisions made pursuant to the catchall language of f.this court has not yet decided to what extent we have jurisdiction to examine such decisions,and this case requires us to determine for the first time whether we can review petitions where a question of law is raised challenging the bia moral character determination under the catchall provision of f.we hold least in such limited do have jurisdiction,but find that the petitioners claims fail on their merits.
background 
petitioners sumbundu and yaffa are natives and citizens of the gambia.they came to the united states in may and october,respectively,on tourist visas which have long since expired.they have five children who are united states citizens and are now ages seventeen,fifteen,thirteen,nine,and five.the is their only daughter.
on september,sumbundu filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal,claiming that he was persecuted in the gambia because of his religion.the department of homeland security began removal proceedings against him on february,by issuing a notice to appear nta,which charged him with removability under a b,as an alien who remained in the united states without authorization.at his hearing on march,sumbundu conceded removability as charged,but stated that he was also applying for cancellation of removal and that he wanted his case to be joined with his wife.yaffa filed an asylum application on march,claiming that she underwent female genital mutilation fgm in the gambia as a child,and that she feared that her daughter would suffer the same treatment if the family returned there.after the department of homeland security started removal proceedings against yaffa,she also conceded removability and,like her husband,filed an application for cancellation of removal.
the cases were considered together before ij thomas mulligan who,after a merits hearing on november,ordered both petitioners removed.the ij noted that petitioners initially applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under article of the convention against torture,and that these applications were subsequently withdrawn.as a result,the only matters before the ij were petitioners applications for cancellation of removal.
b provides that 
the attorney general may cancel removal of,and adjust to the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the united states if the alien 
a has been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than years immediately preceding the date of such application b has been a person of good moral character during such period c has not been convicted for an offense under a,a,or a and 
d establishes that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien spouse,parent,or child,who is a citizen of the united states or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
the ij and bia denied petitioner application for cancellation of removal based on two of these elements petitioners failure to establish that their citizen daughter would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship,b d,and petitioners failure to demonstrate that they were persons of good moral character during the ten years immediately preceding their application,id.b b.because we affirm the bia decision based on its moral character finding,and because that finding alone is sufficient to deny petitioners cancellation of removal,we discuss only that element.
the ij had a number of concerns about petitioners good moral character.specifically,the ij noted that petitioners had misreported their income on their tax returns repeatedly between and.while misreporting their income,petitioners were living in taxpayer subsidized housing in new york city,leading the ij to conclude that they were taking advantage of tax payer funded housing and not adequately reporting to the income tax authorities and to the new york city housing authority the extent of their work activity and their income.moreover,the record revealed that sumbundu had first testified that he did not work in,and later admitted that he did work for his own business but did not file tax returns for that year.id.
after considering this evidence and in view of petitioners need to feed,clothe and shelter this many children in the city of new york,the ij found that there had been a grossly inaccurate and probably fraudulent reporting of tax income since probably,while petitioners were living in taxpayer subsidized housing.accordingly,the ij concluded that sumbundu and yaffa failed to establish that they acted as people of good moral character during the requisite time period.petitioners appealed the ruling to the bia.
on april,while petitioners appeal was pending,sumbundu and yaffa moved the bia to remand the matter to the ij so that they could introduce evidence that they claimed was not available during their earlier removal proceedings.petitioners allegedly had corrected the inaccuracies that had been made in their tax returns for through,and wanted to submit those amended returns to the agency.the amended returns reflected additional income that had previously been unreported and,according to petitioners,additional dependents were properly added to the tax return,thereby affording them a deduction that they could have previously taken but had not.
the bia affirmed the ij decision on both the hardship and moral character rationales and refused to remand the case to the ij to consider the amended tax returns.as to the moral character decision,petitioners asserted that because they had not sought to avoid paying a substantial sum in taxes,the ij finding was erroneous in view of the bia holding in in re locicero,i n bia.the bia disagreed,stating that nothing in in re locicero precluded a finding of poor moral character based on ongoing misrepresentation in multiple years income tax returns,irrespective of whether the misrepresentations involved a substantial sum.instead,the bia noted that an ij has latitude in evaluating a petitioner moral character because where specific conduct does not preclude a finding of good moral character under one of the enumerated categories of f,that same conduct may nevertheless be considered in making a determination on good moral character in accordance with the catchall provision of f.
with respect to the amended tax returns,the bia found that the revised forms for years and the purported payment of taxes due for such years,subsequent to the immigration judge issuance of a removal order,did not show that the ij had erred in finding that the earlier longstanding tax misrepresentations demonstrated a lack of good moral character during the statutorily mandated period.the amended forms instead served to confirm that petitioners had initially disclosed only a portion of their actual income in each of the cited tax years,in some cases originally disclosing less than half of their actual income to the internal revenue service.the bia concluded that the petitioners failed to provide any explanation for the original misrepresentations that would undermine the immigration judge finding that they lacked good moral character,nor had they enumerated any countervailing equities that could overcome the ij decision id.petitioners filed a timely petition for review.
discussion 
petitioners contend that the bia erred as a matter of law in finding that they failed to demonstrate good moral character.specifically,they argue that the bia applied the wrong legal standard in determining that they lacked good moral character because it denied their application without finding that they intended to file inaccurate tax returns,or that they failed to pay a substantial sum of taxes.in response,the government argues that this court has no jurisdiction to review the agency decisions made pursuant to the catchall language of f we write to clarify,and to decide in part,the in this whether or to what extent we have jurisdiction to review the bia moral character decisions under the catchall clause.
jurisdiction 
the statutory definition of good moral character enumerates a series of offenses that will automatically preclude a finding of good moral character.these per se categories are followed by a catchall provision.see f 
f for the purposes of this chapter 
no person shall be regarded as,or found to be,a person of good moral character who,during the period for which good moral character is required to be established,is,or was 
a habitual drunkard 
a member of one or more of the classes of persons,whether inadmissible or not,described in paragraphs d,e,and a of section a of this title or subparagraphs a and b of section a of this title and subparagraph c thereof except as such paragraph relates to a single offense of simple possession of grams or less of marihuana,if the offense described therein,for which such person was convicted or of which he admits the commission,was committed during such period 
one whose income is derived principally from illegal gambling activities 
one who has been convicted of two or more gambling offenses committed during such period 
one who has given false testimony for the purpose of obtaining any benefits under this chapter 
one who during such period has been confined,as a result of conviction,to a penal institution for an aggregate period of one hundred and eighty days or more,regardless of whether the offense,or offenses,for which he has been confined were committed within or without such period 
one who at any time has been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in subsection a of this section or 
one who at any time has engaged in conduct described in section a e of this title relating to assistance in nazi persecution,participation in genocide,or commission of acts of torture or extrajudicial killings or a g relating to severe violations of religious freedom.
the fact that any person is not within any of the foregoing classes shall not preclude a finding that for other reasons such person is or was not of good moral character 
emphasis added.see also in re,i n,bia holding that where specific conduct does not preclude a finding of good moral character under one of the enumerated categories of f,that same conduct may nevertheless be considered in making a determination on good moral character in accordance with the catchall provision.
in sepulveda gonzales,cir,we found that we had jurisdiction to review an ij determination that a petitioner had been confined for an aggregate period of more than one hundred and eighty days,and that he,therefore,lacked moral character under subsection f of.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,we held that a b does not strip courts of jurisdiction to review decisions regarding an alien eligibility for the relief specified in a b i.id.being incarcerated for an aggregate period of more than one hundred and eighty days is a per se category,barring an ij from granting cancellation of removal.f.because the ij decision to deny cancellation of removal in sepulveda was based on a ground whose presence did not entail discretionary findings,we concluded that did not bar review.
it is undisputed that petitioners inaccurate tax filings do not fall within any of the per se categories of f.this case,then,presents the question of how to treat an ij finding that a petitioner lacks good moral character based on f catchall provision.we have three potential options.first,it could be considered a decision and under sepulveda we would retain jurisdiction to review the determination broadly,for substantial evidence.second,it could be a discretionary decision,but of the kind as to which we have been given jurisdiction to review plausible questions of law and constitutional claims in the way we now review the agency determination of whether a petitioner has demonstrated exceptional and extremely unusual hardship.see,mendez holder,cir.third,an agency decision under the catchall provision might be considered totally discretionary,one that is so fully committed to the agency choice that we have no jurisdiction to review it at all such as bia rulings on whether to reopen cases sua sponte.see ali gonzales,cir.for clarity,we will refer to the first as decisions,to the second as real id act,partly reviewable,discretionary decisions,and to the third as pure agency judgment decisions.
our jurisdiction to review the agency discretionary determinations regarding cancellation of removal is limited by statute.the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,stat.iirira,codified in relevant part at ina section a b i and ii,amended the immigration and nationality act ina to preclude judicial review of any judgment regarding the granting of relief under,among other sections,and of any other decision or action of the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security.a b i and ii.but,the scope of the iirira provision was subsequently limited by the real id act of,stat.real id act,codified in relevant part at ina section a d,which provides that n othing in subparagraph b or c of which limits or eliminates judicial review,shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals.a d.
it is in this context that we consider the reviewability of agency determinations with respect to moral character.as noted above,where decisions with respect to moral character are deemed to be,they are fully reviewable.see sepulveda,at.the eighth circuit has held that decisions under the catchall provision of f fall within this category.ins,cir moral character determinations,even when not made pursuant to one of the enumerated categories,are and reviewable for substantial evidence.other circuits have disagreed as to catchall determinations.see ins,cir explaining that decisions under the catchall provision are discretionary kalaw ins,cir same.but it is not altogether clear whether these circuits would treat catchall determinations as real id act,partly reviewable,discretionary decisions,or as pure agency judgment ones 
until today,we have not had reason to decide whether catchall moral character decisions are and fully reviewable,or whether our jurisdiction to review them is either more limited or.because we conclude that petitioners in the case before us have raised plausible questions of law,we do not need to consider whether we would have jurisdiction had they not done so.instead,we expressly leave that question and the position we would take on the circuit split open,and assume arguendo that whatever jurisdiction we have is limited to errors of law and to plausible constitutional claims.
the question that we must decide today,therefore,is simply whether decisions under the catchall provision are pure agency judgment ones and totally unreviewable or are real id act,partly reviewable ones.guidance in making this decision is given to us by our handling of findings with respect to exceptional and extremely unusual hardship,another element of cancellation of re
