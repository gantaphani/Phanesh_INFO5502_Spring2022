introduction 
this case involves the validity of a parcel tax approved by alameda unified school district district voters in june as measure h.the issue before us is whether the tax violates government code section,which authorizes school districts to levy qualified special taxes,subd.a.such taxes are statutorily defined as taxes that apply uniformly to all taxpayers or all real property within the school district,except that qualified special taxes may include taxes that provide for an exemption from those taxes for taxpayers years of age or older or for persons receiving supplemental security income for a disability,regardless of age,subd.b.measure h provides exemptions for some senior and disabled taxpayers.it also imposes different tax rates on residential and properties,as well as different rates on different sized properties.
plaintiffs and appellants contend measure h property classifications,differing tax rates and conditional exemptions violate section definitional language that special taxes apply uniformly to all taxpayers or all real property within the district.the district views this statutory language as reflecting equal protection principles which allow a governmental entity to create reasonable tax classifications,so long as all taxpayers within a classification are treated the same.
as we will discuss,section is one of a number of statutes enacted in the wake of proposition,a statewide initiative approved by california voters in and aimed at closing perceived loopholes in proposition.in addition to defining the terms special taxes and general taxes and specifying the voter approval requirements for each,proposition specified that neither proposition nor general enabling legislation passed in response to that initiative,invested local governmental entities with the power to levy taxes.the legislature responded with a host of statutory provisions expressly delegating taxing authority to a panoply of local districts,including school districts.many of these statutes contain the same language appearing in section and at issue here that special taxes are taxes that apply uniformly to all taxpayers or all real property within the particular district.
after examining the language and legislative history of section,and that of the correlative enabling statutes,we conclude the legislature did not include this definitional language in order to acknowledge established equal protection principles.rather,the language at issue was intended to be a constraint on the extent of the taxing authority delegated to the local governmental entities.we therefore conclude measure h property classifications and differential tax burdens exceed the district taxing authority under section and the judgment entered in favor of the district must,in part,be reversed.we also conclude these provisions can be severed from the measure and that measure h exemptions for senior and disabled taxpayers are permissible under the statute.
we are aware that we are being called on to interpret statutory language enacted in a different economic era and in the wake of two of the most tax constraining measures ever passed by the state electorate propositions and,that the state has since faced crippling economic conditions,and that school districts and other local governmental entities are more dependent than ever on the revenues from special taxes.the courts,however,can not recalibrate the taxing power statutorily delegated to local entities any adjustment in that regard must be made by the state legislature.
ii.factual and procedural background 
the essential facts are limited and undisputed.on march,the district board of education adopted resolution.this resolution authorized the alameda county superintendent of schools to call a election on june,on a measure to impose a qualified special tax on taxable residential,commercial and industrial property for a period,commencing july,and ending june.district voters approved the measure measure h by just over a vote 
measure h taxes residential and properties differently.residential parcels are taxed at per year.commercial and industrial parcels less than square feet are also taxed at per year those greater than square feet are taxed at per square foot to a maximum of per year.
measure h includes two exemptions.the first is for owners of single family residential units who live on the property as their principle residence and are years of age or older during the assessment year.the second is for owners of single family residential units who live on the property and receive supplemental security income for a disability,regardless of age.if eligible,property owners must apply for the exemptions.
the measure also has a severability clause providing if any section,subsection,sentence,phrase,part or clause of this measure is,for any reason,held to be unconstitutional,illegal or invalid,such decision shall not affect or impair the validity of the remaining portions of this measure.it is hereby declared that the intention of the board of education of the district and the electorate is that this measure would have been adopted had such unconstitutional,illegal or invalid section,subsection,sentence,phrase,part or clause thereof not been included.
on august,george borikas,trustee of the george borikas revocable trust,filed suit seeking to have the special tax authorized by measure h declared invalid and not a lien on properties he owns.specifically,borikas alleged measure h exceeded the taxing authority given to school districts under section because the tax does not apply uniformly to all parcels in the district.on november,borikas filed a first amended complaint,adding as plaintiffs edward hirshberg,trustee of the hirshberg trust,santa clara investors ii,a general partnership,and nelco.the substance of the complaint remained the same 
after numerous pretrial proceedings,including demurrers,motions to strike,and motions for summary judgment,the case was consolidated with another action challenging the parcel tax.the case was then tried by the court on a stipulated written record consisting of previously submitted separate statements of undisputed facts,responding statements and supporting documentation,exhibits and requests for judicial notice the trial court ruled in favor of the district.
looking to case law involving tax challenges on equal protection grounds,the court concluded section definitional language is satisfied if tax classifications bear a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental objective and all taxpayers within the same classification bear the same tax.the court acknowledged the legislative history of section includes comments to the contrary,but disregarded them as having been made by and viewed the legislative history as primarily concerned with allowing an exemption for seniors.the court similarly rejected the plaintiffs challenge to the restriction of the senior and disabled exemptions to residential property owners following entry of judgment for the district,plaintiffs timely appealed 
iii.discussion 
backdrop propositions and 
in,california voters approved proposition,which added article xiii a to the state constitution and dramatically changed state and local tax structures.howard jarvis taxpayers city of roseville th,d.the general purpose of proposition was to afford tax relief to california real property owners by imposing limitations upon the tax rate applicable to real property,restrictions on the valuation and assessment of real property,stricter voting requirements for any change by the legislature in tax rates or methods of computation and elimination of the right of the state and local entities,cities,counties,and special districts to impose ad valorum taxes on real property or transaction or sales taxes on the sale of real property.california building industry governing board of the newhall school district of los angeles county d.cbia see also weisblat city of san diego th,d weisblat.to prevent local taxing entities from circumventing these tax limitations,proposition further specified any new or increased special tax proposed by a county,city or special district must be approved by a vote of the local electorate.cal.const.art.xiii a,rider county of san diego cal th,d,rider section restriction on local taxes is part of an interlocking package deemed necessary by the initiative framers to assure effective real property tax relief,quoting amador valley joint union high sch.dist.state bd.of equalization cal d.
proposition also prohibited any county,city or special district from imposing any new special tax unless expressly authorized to do so by the state legislature.cbia,supra,d at pp.the legislature promptly responded by enacting general enabling legislation.et weisblat,supra,th at cbia,supra,d at.
numerous legal challenges to proposition and to newly imposed taxes followed.in several decisions the supreme court departed from the liberal approach it initially had taken in construing the proposition,and read its language narrowly.city and county of san francisco farrell cal d,farrell strictly construing section and holding a special tax for purposes of proposition is a tax that both has a specific purpose and the revenues of which are kept separate from and not placed in the taxing authority general fund los angeles county transportation com.richmond cal d,richmond departing from liberal approach it had previously taken and adopting definition of special district for purposes of proposition narrower than is otherwise provided by statute see also santa clara county local transportation authority guardino cal th,fn.d,guardino.
in response to these decisions,the proponents of proposition successfully placed another proposition on the statewide ballot in,proposition.see guardino,supra,cal th at,noting ballot arguments targeting farrell decision and observing evident intent of the drafters of proposition was to close by legislation what they perceived were loopholes in proposition rider,supra,cal th at that after richmond numerous special purpose districts were created and authorized to impose taxes on a simple majority vote strongly indicate d a large hole ha d indeed been created in proposition.
proposition was a statutory,rather than a constitutional,initiative that added a new article to the government code.cbia,supra,d at.these statutory provisions specify there are two kinds of taxes,general and special,and define special taxes as taxes imposed for a specific purpose,and require that all new local taxes imposed by a local government or district be approved by the local electorate,see guardino,supra,cal th at pp.a general tax must be authorized by a vote of the legislative body of the taxing entity,but can be approved by only a majority of local voters,subd.b.a special tax may be authorized by a majority vote of the legislative body of the local taxing entity,but must be approved by a majority of local voters.the manifest purpose of proposition as a whole was to increase the control of the citizenry over local taxation by requiring voter approval of all new local taxes imposed by all local governmental entities.guardino,at.
of particular significance to the issue before us,proposition also specified neither it,nor proposition,nor article of division of title of the government code commencing with section shall be construed to authorize any local government or district to impose any general or special tax which it is not otherwise authorized to impose,subd.a.this provision called into question the taxing power of all local districts that looked to the general enabling legislation enacted after proposition and commencing with section as the source of their authority.see cbia,supra,d at pp.
a flurry of legislative activity ensued,resulting in a host of statutory provisions expressly authorizing local districts,including school districts,to levy special taxes in accordance with the dictates of propositions and.see cbia,supra,d at pp.ops.legis.counsel,april,proposition voter approval of special taxes levied by school districts re assem.bill reg.sess.
in the meantime,challenges were being mounted to ostensible special taxes imposed by some school districts after proposition,but before the effective date of the special enabling legislation the legislature passed for school districts,section.in cbia,the building industry association challenged taxes being imposed by five different school districts on persons receiving new building permits and predicated on taxing authority supposedly provided directly by proposition,section cbia,supra,d at pp.even assuming the revenue measures were special taxes,the court of appeal held they were invalid for lack of any specific enabling legislation.cbia,supra,d at pp.proposition confirms that section of article xiii a was not intended as a grant of a new taxing authority moreover,proposition specifically withdrew the enabling legislation contained in section et.nor,said the court,could then newly enacted section constitute a ratification of the exactions.cbia,at,fn.the court further held the taxes were a transparent attempt by the school districts to circumvent the dollar limitations on development fees imposed by other statutory provisions.id.at pp.properly considered as fees,the court held the exactions exceeded the school districts statutory authority and were invalid.id.at pp.
with this background,we turn to the enabling statute in question,section 
government code section 
statutory language 
the basic rules of statutory construction are well established.when construing a statute,a court seeks to determine and give effect to the intent of the enacting legislative body.citation.we first examine the words themselves because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citation.the words of the statute should be given their ordinary and usual meaning and should be construed in their statutory context.citation.if the plain,commonsense meaning of a statute words is unambiguous,the plain meaning controls.catlin superior court cal th,d.in that case,there is no need for construction and courts should not indulge in it.people palacios cal th,d.thus,if the language is unambiguous,the plain meaning governs and it is unnecessary to resort to extrinsic sources to determine legislative intent.kavanaugh west sonoma county union high school dist.cal th,d.
section is comprised of two subdivisions.the first authorizes school districts to impose qualified special taxes consistent with and pursuant to procedures established in article commencing with section,subd.a.the second subdivision states as used in this section,qualified special taxes means special taxes that apply uniformly to all taxpayers or all real property within the district,except that qualified special taxes may include taxes that provide for an exemption from those taxes for taxpayers years of age or older or for persons receiving supplemental security income for a disability,regardless of age,subd.b.qualified special taxes do not include special taxes imposed on a particular class of property or taxpayers,subd.b.
plaintiffs contend the definitional language set forth in subdivision b and specifically the language that qualified special taxes means special taxes that apply uniformly to all taxpayers or all real property within the district means all taxpayers and all real property must be treated the same,and school districts are not empowered to treat different kinds of taxpayers,and different kinds of real property,differently.they point out the common meaning of the term uniform means o f one form,character,or kind having,maintaining,occurring in or under,the same form always that is or remains the same in different places at different times,or under varying circumstances exhibiting no difference,diversity,or variation.oxford english dict.ed see also webster new collegiate dict.and see wasatch property management degrate cal th,d,when attempting to ascertain the ordinary,usual meaning of a word,courts appropriately refer to the dictionary definition of that word.
plaintiffs also point out the statute provides two exceptions to the requirement that special taxes apply uniformly to all taxpayers or all real property within the district senior citizens and persons receiving permanent disability assistance can be exempted from the tax and thus treated differently than other taxpayers.that the statute expressly allows these two classifications,say plaintiffs,reinforces that classifications are not otherwise permissible and the definitional language,in and of itself,means all taxpayers and all real property must be treated the same.fox bakersfield theatre city of bakersfield cal d,fox bakersfield theatre exemptions are a form of taxpayer classification w hether the tax statute may make a valid exemption and thereby place the tax burden on other taxpayers presents the same problem as that of classification if the exempted persons or businesses may be included in a distinct class then equal protection of the laws is not denied to those taxed.if the definitional language,alone,allowed rationally based classifications and differential tax treatment,there would be no need for the express exemptions for seniors and disabled persons,and these exemptions would be meaningless surplusage.see mccarther pacific telesis group cal th,d,mccarther a construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided.
plaintiffs further point out section is one of a number of tax enabling statutes enacted in the wake of proposition.many include the same language that a special tax must apply uniformly to all taxpayers or real property within the district including section,which immediately follows section and authorizes community college districts to impose special taxes.because section was enacted for the same reason and purpose as section in response to proposition and to expressly provide taxing authority,and because it is part of the same statutory scheme as section,plaintiffs maintain the same language in both statutes reflects the same legislative intent and should be given the same meaning.see people cornett cal th,fn.d,we recognize the rule of statutory construction that identical language appearing in separate statutory provisions should receive the same interpretation when the statutes cover the same or an analogous subject matter.guinn county of san bernardino th,d if the language does not clearly express the legislature intent,we must interpret the statutory language in the context of any statutory scheme of which it is a part.we must also construe similar statutes,those in pari materia,to achieve a uniform and consistent legislative purpose.citations.citation.
thus,it is significant,say plaintiffs,that in section the legislature did not authorize exemptions for seniors or disabled persons.instead,the legislature included additional language expressly authorizing community college districts to classify real property as improved and unimproved and to tax unimproved property at a lower rate.there was no need for this express authorization to classify real property and impose different tax rates if the be applied uniformly to all taxpayers and real property language,itself,allowed any rational classification and differential tax treatment.plaintiffs therefore maintain section express authorization to community college districts to classify and differentially tax real property makes clear that the common language in question that a special tax must apply uniformly to all taxpayers or all real property within the district is language of limitation and does not,itself,authorize local districts to classify and differentially tax taxpayers or property.
the district,in turn,maintains uniformity in the realm of tax law has a well established meaning that allows rational classifications and requires only that all taxpayers or property within a classification be treated the same.the district cites to a long line of cases involving constitutionally based equal protection challenges to a variety of tax laws,fox bakersfield theatre,supra,cal d at pp.upholding city licensing tax imposed on some entertainment businesses n o constitutional rights are violated if the burden of the license tax falls equally upon all members of the class,though other classes have lighter burdens or are wholly exempt,provided that the classification is reasonable mccreery mccolgan cal d,upholding state income tax statute aimed at undistributed profits of personal holding companies statute operated uniformly on all resident shareholders of such corporations,and the fact classification of personal holding companies for income tax purposes resulted in different treatment of the shareholders of such companies,as partners,was not an insuperable obstacle to the constitutionality of the provisions california of retail tobacconists state of california th,d retail tobacconists upholding initiative that imposed higher excise taxes on tobacco products than on cigarettes t he equal protection clause does not prevent the legislature,or the electorate by initiative,from asserting its taxing power or adjusting its taxing legislation to differences in situation and classifying accordingly marsh mclennan of,city of los angeles d.upholding city business tax imposed on insurance brokers,but not insurance agents the essential differences between insurance brokers and agents,and based upon the fundamental legal distinctions in their respective status as independent contractor and agent,classification for tax purposes of the two groups is reasonable and not an invidious discrimination roth drugs johnson d,upholding sales tax on tangible,but not intangible,property,and on retail,but not wholesale,sales equal protection clause does not forbid reasonable discriminations in matters involving taxation and tax classifications are recognized as necessary and valid.
as the district points out,the threshold for tax legislation to pass constitutional muster against an equal protection challenge is very low.the party who challenges the constitutionality of a classification in a tax statute bears a very heavy burden it must negate any conceivable basis that might support the classification.retail tobacconists,supra,th at.if the challenged classification is based on natural,intrinsic or fundamental distinctions that are reasonable in their relation to the object of the legislation,then it will be deemed to be valid and binding.ibid.
the district also cites a series of cases involving national banks and the classification of property as either a fixture,which is a form of real property on which national banks can be taxed,or personal property,as to which they are tax exempt,crocker national bank city and county of san francisco cal d,crocker national bank holding bank electronic data processing equipment was erroneously classified as a fixture,and was,instead,personal property simms county of los angeles cal d,holding bank vault doors and counterlines were properly classified as fixtures,and like property of other businesses,such as jewelers,also should have been classified as fixtures however,bank failed to show resulting economic disparity and therefore failed to establish equal protection claim under the federal constitution or former article,section now cal,art.iv,of the state constitution requiring uniform operation of all general laws trabue pittman county of los angeles cal d,trabue holding vault door and door frame were fixtures,taxable as real property and taxable to the owner of the building leased by the bank to achieve uniformity of taxation,assessors must be allowed to act on the basis of outward appearances and are not bound by private agreements between lessors and lessees,or by who installed the improvement,or by the trade fixture doctrine.
in crocker national bank,the supreme court also addressed the standard of review applicable to a trial court ruling that bank property is a fixture or personal property.although a mixed question of fact and law,the court held the inquiry is predominantly legal subject to de novo review.crocker national bank,supra,cal d at.this standard,observed the court,was also supported by the following consideration.taxation must,of course,be uniform and the tax laws uniformly applied.see trabue pittman county of los angeles,supra,cal d at pp.uniformity depends on proper classification.and proper classification is furthered through the application of independent review.crocker national bank,at pp.as noted,in trabue,the court had addressed the classification of bank property as a fixture or personalty and set forth the proper test for assessors to use in classifying property as such.trabue,supra,cal d at pp.in doing so,the court had rejected the argument that the trade fixture doctrine as applied in the landlord and tenant context should control for tax classification purposes,pointing out use of the doctrine would result in different tax treatment of the same property,depending merely on the ownership arrangement.that,the court had said,would be contrary to the principle of uniformity,the purpose of which is to ensure that all property in the state carry its fair burden and contribute its just amount in taxation.id.at.
as the district points out,the legislature is deemed to be aware of existing law.see city of san jose operating engineers local union cal th,d,noting legal presumption that the legislature is deemed to be aware of existing judicial decisions that have a direct bearing on the particular legislation enacted yu university of la verne th,d we presume that the legislature,when enacting a statute,was aware of existing related laws and intended to maintain a consistent body of rules.the district thus contends the legislature in using the term uniformly in section must have been referring to the constitutionally based equal protection principles reflected in the above cited cases.
therefore,says the district,it may establish rational classifications and impose different tax rates,so long as all taxpayers or property within a classification are treated the same.the district maintains wholesale exemptions for senior and disabled homeowners are not inconsistent with a construction that allows for classification and differential taxation of other taxpayers and property.it also maintains the provisions of other tax enabling statutes,such as section,which was added four years after section,are irrelevant.see wolski fremont investment loan th,d materials that passage of legislation often do not bear on intent of drafters.
we agree with plaintiffs that the plain language of section and attendant rules of statutory construction demonstrate the definitional language at issue is language of limitation and does not empower school districts to classify taxpayers and property,and impose different tax rates.
we begin by observing that if section did not include the language in question,there would be no question that school districts could create rational tax classifications and impose differential tax rates.that is because fundamental equal protection principles apply to every tax statute,regardless of the statutory language.thus,if the legislature had intended to delegate to school districts the broadest taxing authority allowed by law that is,taxing authority bounded only by equal protection principles it needed only to have authorized school districts to impose special taxes,or in other words,it needed only to have enacted subdivision a.that would mean,however,that the entirety of subdivision b is meaningless surplusage,a result that can not reasonably be ascribed to the legislature in any context,and particularly not in legislation specifying the bounds of delegated taxing power see big creek lumber county of santa cruz cal th,d,one effect of plaintiffs reading would be to render the fpa definition of timberland see pub.resource code,partly surplusage.hughes electronics citibank delaware th,fn.d the interpretation urged by directv would render entire portions of code of civil procedure section c meaningless surplusage.
similarly,there was no need for the legislature to have expressly allowed exemptions for senior and disabled taxpayers if the definitional language at issue,in and of itself,allowed school districts to create rational tax classifications and impose different tax burdens on different taxpayers.see fox bakersfield theatre,supra,cal d at pp.we will not ascribe to the core definitional language a meaning that renders the explicit exemptions thereto meaningless see summerfield windsor unified school dist.th,d refusing to adopt definition of term provisional credentials rendering an exception to a statute based on that term meaningless surplusage.
any doubt that the definitional language in question does not,in and of itself,authorize the classification and differential taxation of taxpayers and property,is dispelled by the language of section.this section immediately follows section,authorizes community colleges to impose special taxes,and contains the same language at issue here that special taxes shall be applied uniformly to all taxpayers or real property within the district.section does not include exemptions for senior or disabled taxpayers.it does,however,provide that unimproved property may be taxed at a lower rate than improved property.ibid.the inclusion of this additional language expressly allowing community college districts to classify and differentially tax real property makes manifest that the definitional language,alone,does not allow districts to establish rational classifications and impose different tax rates.
the equal protection cases relied on by the district are inapposite.plaintiffs are not challenging measure h on the ground its classifications and different tax rates are constitutionally infirm accordingly,the district reliance on equal protection analytical tools,tax legislation will be upheld if any rational reason supports it,party challenging constitutionality of a tax classification bears a very heavy burden is misplaced.rather,the instant case is one of statutory construction does measure h exceed the bounds of the taxing power delegated to school districts by the legislature through section.for the reasons we have discussed,we conclude the answer is yes.given the language of section,the comparative language of section,and the basic rules of statutory construction that guide us,it is apparent the legislature,in including the definitional language at issue,was not simply rearticulating fundamental equal protection principles,under which governmental entities have expansive taxing authority.rather,the statutory language and context demonstrate the definitional language is language of limitation to which the legislature made certain,limited exceptions.
legislative history 
because we conclude the meaning of section can be discerned from its language and the statutory context of which it is a part,we need not consider its legislative history.we nevertheless have reviewed the legislative history,supplied by both parties to the trial court,and it confirms what the plain language of section indicates that the definitional language in question is language of limitation.see goodman lozano cal th,d,although statutory language was plain it was helpful to look at the statute legislative history mccarther pacific telesis group cal th,d,although the plain language of the statute is clear,an examination of the statute legislative history confirms that the statute was not intended to broadly apply to all types of sick leave policies.
section was enacted through assembly bill,which was carried by assemblyman tom hannigan at the request of the davis unified school district and supported by a number of other school districts in which voters had recently approved special taxes.see off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem bill reg.sess.as amended june.as introduced,the legislation broadly provided that subject to proposition,any school district may impose qualified special taxes upon the district pursuant to the procedures established in article commencing with section and any other applicable procedures provided by law.legis.counsel,assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced march,italics omitted.
the bill was referred to the assembly revenue and taxation committee where it was amended,at the insistence of assemblyman charles bader,to add the definitional language at issue.see final history calendar on assem.bill reg.sess.robert caine,superintendent of kentfield school,letter to annette porini,chief of staff to assemblyman thomas hannigan,june,referencing bader amendment.in his statement on the assembly floor urging passage of the bill,assemblyman hannigan explained it had been amended in the revenue and taxation committee to make it clear that this special tax must apply uniformly to all taxpayers in the district.assemblyman hannigan,statement to assem.floor on assem.bill reg.sess.may see also assem.off.of research,reading on assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may.
kentfield school district,a supporter of the legislation,then apprised assemblyman hannigan office of several concerns,shared by other school districts,about the amended legislation.see robert caine,superintendent of kentfield school,letter to annette porini,chief of staff to assemblyman thomas hannigan,june.kentfield,along with mill valley,albany and lagunitas school districts,had obtained an opinion letter on the amended legislation,which it provided to assemblyman hannigan office.see thomas steele,letter to robert caine,superintendent of kentfield school,june.the opinion letter concluded the legislature probably had the power to validate the districts newly enacted parcel taxes,particularly if the legislation was enacted prior to the effective date of the tax measures.id.at.
however,the opinion letter also stated the bill as amended would not appear to provide the necessary authority for the districts to impose their special taxes.thomas steele,letter to robert caine,superintendent of kentfield school,june.first,the kentfield,mill valley and lagunitas special tax measures all allowed exemptions for individuals years and older,and the albany tax differentiated between and imposed different tax rates on residential and property.id.at.the opinion letter observed the plain meaning of the language suggests that no exemptions would be tolerated.in addition,the bifurcated rate provided by the albany special tax also appears inconsistent with this phrase,since the tax is apparently not applied uniformly to residential and nonresidential properties.id.at.second,the amended bill did not appear to validate existing special taxes,but only to authorize taxes approved after enactment of the legislation.ibid.counsel provided the districts with proposed amendments to resolve both of the problems with the amended legislation,which were also forwarded to assemblyman hannigan office id.at.
representatives of kentfield then met with assemblyman hannigan staff,but were unable to persuade hannigan to revisit the added language and,in fact,were persuaded to drop any attempt to rewrite section b,the bader amendment.robert caine,superintendent of kentfield school,letter to annette porini,chief of staff to assemblyman thomas hannigan,june.the districts,accordingly,abandoned their proposed amendments and i nstead urge d only that language be added such as we presently propose making it clear that exemptions for senior citizens like those provided by the three marin county school district taxes that were recently passed are not prohibited by ab.ibid.the districts also proposed language expressly validating parcel tax measures approved after proposition to spare school districts the enormous additional expense and effort required to resubmit the tax measure s to the electorate.robert caine,superintendent of kentfield school,letter to annette porini,chief of staff to assemblyman thomas hannigan,june.
kentfield,mill valley,albany and lagunitas school districts also made a direct appeal to senator john garamendi,chairman of the senate committee on revenue and taxation,to address problems facing districts with recently approved special tax measures.james burnder,director of governmental affairs,letter to john garamendi,chairman of the comm.on revenue and taxation,june.the districts urged that their proposed validation language be added,as well as an exemption for seniors.id.at.they explained to senator garamendi ab,as amended in the assembly the bader amendment,requires that the special tax be applied uniformly to all taxpayers or all properties.responding to the concerns of their local communities,three of the four districts provided a limited exemption from the special tax for senior citizens.even such efforts appear to be doomed by the sweeping uniformity provision of ab.our proposed amendment adds language to make it clear that an exemption for senior citizens is not prohibited ibid.

this legislative history confirms that the definitional language at issue is language of limitation.as we have discussed,there was no need to include this language if the legislature intended school districts to have the broadest possible taxing authority bounded only by constitutional equal protection principles and which they would have had under the provisions of the bill as introduced.the vigor of the debate over the bader amendment,which added the definitional language,further reinforces the intent was to constrain the districts taxing power.it is significant that school districts that were in immediate need of the legislation and closely following its course through the legislature,opposed the language and tried on multiple fronts to have it removed from the bill specifically because it appeared to preclude the kind of differential tax treatment required by their special tax measures,including treating seniors differently from other taxpayers and treating residential properties differently from commercial properties.when it became clear the districts could not effect removal of the language,they sought and obtained only an exemption for seniors,which was described in the committee report for the concurring vote as an exception to the uniformity requirement.com.on revenue taxation concurrence in amendments on assem.bill reg.sess.as amended june,italics added.thus,it is apparent the legislature and school districts understood districts otherwise did not have authority to classify taxpayers and property and impose differential tax rates 
the district contends this can not be the case because it assertedly results in manifest unfairness,that all parcels must bear the same tax,regardless of size and character.the legislature was aware,however,that uniform parcel taxes were considered more inequitable than ad valorem property taxes because all parcels,regardless of size,are subject to the same tax.assem.com.on revenue taxation,on assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced march.nevertheless,the legislature made no adjustments or provisions in this regard.nor did the school districts,after being persuaded to drop any attempt to rewrite the bader amendment robert caine,superintendent of kentfield school,letter to annette porini,chief of staff to assemblyman thomas hannigan,june,seek language that would allow for the classification and differential tax treatment of parcels by size or use as they did,successfully,to allow for an exemption for seniors.moreover,as we discuss in the next section,other local districts did seek such authority,and their enabling statutes,while containing the same apply uniformly language as section,also expressly allow limited classification and differential taxation of property.finally,while the district suggests no special tax can be fairly crafted unless it establishes property classifications and imposes different tax rates,we note that of the four school districts that were heavily involved when the legislation was amended,only one had a special tax that classified and differentially taxed local property.the other three did not their special tax measures contained only an exemption for seniors as is now expressly allowed by the statute.
related legislation 
as we have discussed,section was one of the first statutes enacted in the wake of proposition empowering local districts to levy special taxes.many share the definitional language at issue here,and an examination of several of these statutes and their legislative history provides additional illumination as to the legislature intent with respect to this language

local recreation and park districts 
two years later,the legislature authorized recreation and park districts to impose special taxes,subd.a originally codified as pub,stats,ch.as introduced,this legislation also did not include the definitional language at issue.assem.com.on local government,on assem bill reg.sess.as introduced,since the passage of proposition,the legislature has authorized school districts,library districts and county service areas to impose special taxes.the legislation for school and library districts required that the taxes apply uniformly to all taxpayers.this bill does not make that requirement.
in the senate,the bill was amended to add the definitional language.initially,no exemptions were provided.however,upon lobbying by a local park district,the senate further amended the legislation to allow park districts to differentially tax improved and unimproved property.local government,on assem.bill reg.sess.as amended june,while the language of the bill followed precedent authorizing other local entities,including school districts,to levy special taxes,the georgetown park and recreation district wanted to levy a lower tax on unimproved property.
the report prepared for the assembly concurring vote thus explained that the senate amendments c onform the authority granted in this bill to existing provisions governing special taxes,although g enerally,special districts have not been authorized to levy a different tax rate on improved versus unimproved property.concurrence in amendments,on assem.bill reg.sess.as amended june.the assembly approved the bill as amended,and the legislation was signed into law by the governor 
community college and other local districts 
the following year,the legislature passed omnibus legislation adding statutes to a number of codes,all authorizing local districts to impose special taxes.legis.counsel dig.bill reg.sess.stats.ch,summary,pp.the report prepared for the senate committee on local government explained that,having enacted a number of such enabling statutes in prior sessions,including for school districts,local hospital districts,and recreation park districts,the purpose of the comprehensive bill was to complete the job by allowing nearly all special districts to ask their voters if they want to tax themselves.local government,on bill reg.sess.as amended,pp.see also rules,off.of floor analyses,on bill reg.sess.as amended may,listing prior legislation authorizing local districts to levy special taxes,including section,and identifying the local districts for which such authorization would be provided by bill.
the committee report further explained t he language in sb is identical to the language worked out and approved by the legislature for special districts in bills over the last two years.local government,on bill reg.sess.as amended.accordingly,every proposed enabling statute contained the language that first appeared in section that a special tax must apply uniformly to all taxpayers or all real property within the district.every proposed statute also contained the additional language that first appeared in public resources code section,subd.a allowing unimproved and improved property to be taxed at different rates.bill reg.sess.as enacted,stats,ch.
community college districts were among the local districts included in this omnibus legislation.we have already discussed the plain language of section.its legislative history is also of note.as introduced,the legislation,as it pertained to community colleges,proposed amending section to include both school districts and community college districts.bill reg.sess.as introduced.however,objections were raised to community college districts being allowed to exempt senior citizens from their special taxes.see amendments to bill reg.sess.as amended,peter detwiler,letter to office of state marian bergeson bill author,and may.accordingly,the legislation was amended to delete the language adding community college districts to section and to add another new enabling statute specifically pertaining to community college districts,section.the language of this proposed statute was identical to that of every other proposed enabling statute to be added by the omnibus bill,and thus specified that any special taxes shall be applied uniformly to all taxpayers or real property within the district,except that unimproved property may be taxed at a lower rate than improved property.amendments to bill reg.sess.as amended.as amended,the omnibus bill was unanimously approved by both houses and signed into law by the governor.final history calendar,bill reg.sess.
this string of enabling legislation further demonstrates that the definitional language at issue,originating in section,is language of limitation and does not,in and of itself,authorize local districts to establish classifications and impose differential tax rates.in authorizing hospital districts to impose special taxes,for example,the legislature initially added,but ultimately removed,exemptions for seniors and for protected lands.significantly,the contemplated exemptions were viewed as exceptions to the requirement that such taxes apply uniformly,local government,on assem.bill reg.sess.as amended june,the committee may wish to consider whether special taxes should be uniform or should permit local exemptions,italics added assem.com.on revenue taxation,on assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may,this bill follows the ab example in requiring any hospital district special tax to be uniform except that an exemption may apply to senior citizens,italics added.
it is also apparent that when the legislature added the apply uniformly language to these enabling statutes,it also viewed classification and differential tax rates as matters requiring express authorization.thus,the legislature included in most of these statutes not only the core,definitional language that was first added to section,but also included,for recreation and park districts and community college districts,but not for hospital districts additional language authorizing the districts to classify property as improved or unimproved and to tax unimproved property at a lower rate.there was no need to include this additional language if the definitional language,alone,empowered the districts to create classifications and impose different tax rates.
indeed,the report prepared for the assembly concurring vote on the senate amendments to the park district legislation observed that while the amendments adding the apply uniformly language and the language allowing differential taxation of improved and unimproved property c onform the authority granted in this bill to existing provisions governing special taxes generally special districts have not been authorized to levy a different tax rate on improved versus unimproved property.concurrence in amendments,on assem.bill reg.sess.as amended june,italics added.there could hardly be a more clear statement that the core apply uniformly language does not imbue districts with the authority to create classifications and impose differential tax rates,and that the legislature must provide express authority to districts to do so 
in sum,the considerations that guide us in determining legislative intent the plain language and legislative history of the statute in question,and of other statutes enacted for the same reason and having the same purpose and employing the same language compel the conclusion section does not authorize school districts to impose special taxes that classify and differentially tax property within the district 
severability 
having determined measure h imposition of a higher tax on commercial or industrial property over square feet exceeds the district taxing authority under section,we now turn to the question of whether the tax measure must be invalidated in its entirety or whether it can be sustained,as the district suggests,in a form consistent with section.
a statute that is invalid is not ineffective and inoperative to the extent that its invalid parts can be severed from any valid ones.see hotel employees restaurant employees international union davis cal th,d.as we have set forth,measure h contains a severability provision stating if a court invalidates any part of the measure,the remainder stands.the presence of such a clause establishes a presumption in favor of severance.california redevelopment matosantos cal th,d,abbott laboratories franchise tax bd.th,abbott d a severability clause normally calls for sustaining the valid part of the enactment aguiar superior court th,d a declaration of severability,although not conclusive,is persuasive evidence of the enacting body intent.
however,such a clause plus the ability to mechanically sever the invalid part while normally allowing severability,does not conclusively dictate it.the final determination depends on whether the remainder is complete in itself and would have been adopted by the legislative body had the latter foreseen the partial invalidity of the statute or constitutes a completely operative expression of legislative intent and is not so connected with the rest of the statute as to be inseparable.gerken fair political practices com.cal th,d,italics omitted.abbott,supra,th at.condensing these requirements into three components t o be severable the invalid provision must be grammatically,functionally,and volitionally separable.citation.ibid.
starting with the first two of these components,t o be grammatically separable,the valid and invalid parts of the statute can be separated by paragraph,sentence,clause,phrase,or even single words.people advocate,superior court d.abbott,supra,th at.when a defect can be cured by excising any word or group of words,severance may be possible and proper.people advocate,supra,d at,quoting in re blaney cal d.to be functionally separable,the remainder after separation of the invalid part must be complete in itself and capable of independent application.people advocate,superior court,supra,d at pp.abbott,supra,th at.
the language in measure h imposing a different and higher tax rate on non residential property over square feet is easily excised,and its absence leaves a coherent,functioning tax measure.the measure currently levies the qualified special tax as follows a on each taxable,residential parcel at the rate of per year,and b on each taxable,commercial or industrial property at the rate of per square foot per year but commercial or industrial property of square feet or smaller paying per year and commercial or industrial property larger than square feet paying a maximum of per year.the district proposes,essentially,deleting the word residential and deleting subsection b,so the levy reads on each taxable parcel at the rate of per year.this grammatical deletion people advocate,supra,d at abbott,supra,th at would leave a uniform tax of per parcel per year.owners of residential property and non residential property of square feet or less would be completely unaffected,while owners of larger property,the class harmed by the unauthorized classification and differential tax rate,would see a tax reduction to the annual rate paid by others.
that leaves the third component,volitional separateness.to be volitionally separable,t he final determination depends on whether the remainder is complete in itself and would have been adopted by the legislative body had the latter foreseen the partial invalidation of the statute or constitutes a completely operative expression of the legislative intent.santa barbara school dist.superior court cal d.abbott,supra,th at.i f a part to be severed and therefore saved reflects a substantial portion of the electorate purpose,that part can and should be severed and given operative effect.gerken fair political practices,supra,cal th at santa barbara school,supra,cal d at pp.it seems eminently reasonable to suppose that those who favored the proposition would be happy to achieve at least some substantial portion of their purpose.
according to the board of education resolution that put measure h on the ballot,the board believed the measure was necessary to cope with serious budget shortfalls facing the district.the text of measure h declares its purpose is t o offset severe state budget cuts to alameda schools,minimize school closures,and protect the quality of education,student safety,class sizes,excellent teachers and staff,and to restore prioritized cuts to music,athletics,advanced placement courses and other programs.measure h further specifies it would raise the needed funds by levying a tax of at least per parcel on every taxable parcel,more on larger commercial and industrial parcels.
voters,at a minimum,chose to support local schools with a new tax of at least tax per parcel.although voters approved taxing larger,parcels at a higher rate,it seems eminently reasonable to suppose that those who favor ed the proposition would be happy to achieve at least some substantial portion of their purpose santa barbara school,supra,cal d at pp.by imposing the rate on these properties.voiding the entire tax would wholly defeat voter expectations.we therefore conclude measure h is volitionally separable.
severing the higher tax on parcels not only has the benefit of best matching voters intent,it also aligns with one of the remedies for discriminatory taxes,equalizing the tax by assessing all tax payers at the preferred rate.for example,in haman county of humboldt cal d,haman,our supreme court explained the court has the power to eliminate discriminatory treatment by granting those taxpayers,who have been assessed the higher rate,a refund based on the difference between the lower rate and the one under which they were assessed italics omitted.looking at the history of the offending boat tax statute at issue,haman took a path similar to the one we chart here,severing the statute so all subject boats were assessed at the lower percent rate,not the percent rate.id.at pp.see also macy stores,city and county of san francisco th,d citing haman and reversing award of full refund when city argued plaintiff was only entitled to refund of portion of tax that was discriminatory plaintiff not entitled to windfall of no taxation.
having concluded that the unauthorized property classification and differential tax rate provisions of measure h can be severed,we turn to the last issue raised by plaintiffs,the validity of the senior and disabled exemptions.
d.the exemptions for senior and disabled homeowners 
measure h provides exemptions for some senior and disabled taxpayers,specifically those who own and reside in single family units.plaintiffs contend these limited exemptions are odds with section for two reasons.first,they discriminate among senior taxpayers and disabled taxpayers and thus do not apply uniformly to all senior and all disabled taxpayers.second,they are predicated on property classifications and treat residential property differently from property,and further distinguish between residential property and other residential property.the district maintains that because section permits,but does not require,exemptions for senior and disabled taxpayers,it can adopt any kind of exemption complete or limited for these taxpayers.it points out the middle path the district chose in measure h is akin to the provision in article xiii,section,of the california constitution allowing low and seniors and disabled homeowners to postpone payment of ad valorem property taxes.on this issue,we agree with the district,although for a different reason.
the language of the exemptions is silent as to their scope and,thus,does not indicate whether a school district can provide exemptions for some,but not all,senior and disabled taxpayers,based on the type of property the taxpayer owns.plaintiffs assertion that the parameters of the exemptions are fleshed out by the other provisions of the statute which as we have discussed,do not authorize school districts to establish classifications and impose differential tax rates has some logical appeal.in our view,however,the answer is provided by the legislative history of section and subsequent,like enabling statutes.
as we have discussed,the exemptions provided by these statutes were viewed as exceptions to the core definitional language that otherwise requires special taxes to apply uniformly to all taxpayers or all real property within a district,revenue taxation comm.concurrence in amendments on assem.bill reg.sess.as amended june,senate amendments makes sic an exception to the uniformity requirement,which allows special taxes which provide for an exemption for taxpayers age or older,italics added local government,on assem.bill reg.sess.as amended june,the committee may wish to consider whether special taxes should be uniform or should permit local exemptions,italics added.since the exemptions are exceptions to the uniformity requirement,they can not,then,be defined by that requirement.we therefore conclude the limited exemptions provided by measure h for senior and disabled homeowner residents do not exceed the statutory authority provided to school districts by section.
iv.disposition 
the judgment in favor of the district is reversed in part and affirmed in part.the trial court is directed to enter judgment declaring the special tax imposed by measure h invalid to the extent it imposes a tax other than per parcel,unless the parcel is exempt from the special tax under the provisions of the measure,in which case,no tax may be imposed.the trial court shall also determine whether plaintiffs are entitled to any further remedies,as sought in their trial brief.each party to bear its own costs on appeal.

i have read and reread the statute in context as part of title,division,part,chapter of the government code government code section is plain and clear on its face.authorized by article xiii a,section,of the california constitution,section enables school districts to impose qualified special taxes,defined as special taxes that apply uniformly to all taxpayers or all real property within the school district and exempt taxpayers years of age or older and persons receiving supplemental security income for a disability regardless of age.the statute provides no more,no less 
within the statutory framework of article,section is immediately followed by section whereby the legislature specifically authorized community college districts to impose,differentiated nonuniform taxes for unimproved real property as opposed to other property special taxes shall be applied uniformly to all taxpayers or real property within the district,except that unimproved property may be taxed at a lower rate than improved property.by contrast with section,a reader looking for guidance can see section provides more than section does,with a clearly expressed differentiation for improved and unimproved property.
respondent does not seek a construction of section,but an enlargement of it,so that what was omitted intentionally or inadvertently may be included within its scope.we do not have the power to ignore the common sense reading of the words apply uniformly to all taxpayers or all real property to judicially supply a meaning that may seem wiser than what was omitted at the time of enactment.we take the statute as we find it and assume the legislature used common words with a common meaning as used in everyday speech,recognizing that w e must not,however,be slaves to the tyranny of literalness so that we construe a statute in a way that yields a grotesque caricature of the legislature purpose or leads to an absurd result.unzueta ocean view school dist.th,dis.opn.of gilbert.there is nothing in the statute to suggest that we should deviate from the straightforward and literal sense of the words apply uniformly to carve out subclasses or follow a special vernacular used in unrelated tax cases by tax specialists.to go beyond the plain meaning of the words to construe a statute in a way that may seem better policy to us is to usurp a power that our constitution has entrusted to our elected legislature.if the language of the statute is unambiguous,the legislature is presumed to have meant what it said,and the plain meaning governs.hunt superior court cal th.measure h has laudatory goals to provide critically needed additional school financing for the alameda unified school district but we can not rewrite an enabling statute,nor enlarge or contract it,where the words do not allow any other plain meaning.
the majority opinion discussion on legislative history,including later related legislation,is interesting,and arguably supportive of the result,but is unnecessary for contextual construction in this instance and is not controlling where the statute means what it says as justice david sills explained in halbert lumber lucky stores,th,it is the language of the statute itself that has successfully braved the legislative gauntlet.it is that language which has been lobbied for,lobbied against,studied,proposed,drafted,restudied,redrafted,voted on in committee,amended,reamended,analyzed,reanalyzed,voted on by two houses of the legislature,sent to a conference committee,and,after perhaps more lobbying,debate and analysis,finally signed into law by the governor.the same care and scrutiny does not befall the committee reports,caucus analyses,authors statements,legislative counsel digests and other documents which make up a statute legislative history.
measure h attempts to impose taxes which section does not begin to hint at authorizing.i would reverse because the language of the statute compels that result.
all further statutory references are to the government code unless otherwise indicated.
the ballot asked for a yes or no vote in the following language measure h to offset severe state budget cuts to alameda schools,minimize school closures,and protect the quality of education,student safety,class sizes,excellent teachers and staff and to restore prioritized cuts to music,athletics,and advanced placement courses,shall alameda unified school district levy a temporary year emergency tax of per residential parcel and cents per square foot for parcels see voter pamphlet,with exemptions for seniors,and all funds staying local 
the complaint,filed before the first payment of the special tax came due,also sought costs of suit and other and further relief as the court may deem proper,but did not pray for a refund of taxes.plaintiffs first amended complaint similarly prayed for costs of suit and other proper relief,but not a refund.plaintiffs summary judgment motion,however,did request a refund,stating plaintiffs have prayed for further relief as the court may deem proper.if the court determines that measure h is void,it is just and proper for the court to order the district to disgorge all payments it has received,for measure h taxes it has assessed plaintiffs reiterated this request in their trial brief.
in connection with the various pretrial motions,both sides requested,and the trial court granted,judicial notice of the complete legislative history of section.pursuant to the parties stipulation on evidence,the court also had this history before it during trial.
in addition,the court rejected the plaintiffs assertion that the stated uses of the parcel tax are so broad as to render the tax,a general,rather than a special,tax,a claim they have not pursued on appeal.
plaintiffs in the case consolidated for trial did not appeal.
