northwestern mutual life insurance company,northwestern,dfo partnership dfo,and at t credit holdings at t collectively,the appellants or claimants,who are claimants in the bankruptcy proceedings of delta air lines,delta,appeal from a ruling of the united states district court for the southern district of new york berman,affirming final orders of the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york hardin,the bankruptcy court orders.the bankruptcy court upheld delta objections to appellants claims for approximately billion under tax indemnity agreements.for the reasons discussed herein,the judgment is vacated,and the cases are remanded with instructions to reject delta objections.
background 
underlying agreements 
each of these three appeals requires that we construe a set of agreements governing a leveraged lease,a financing structure commonly employed by airlines to fund the acquisition of aircraft.because of its chronic unprofitability,delta was unable to benefit from the right to take accelerated depreciation deductions accorded by the internal revenue code to the owner of equipment used in business.see a.the purpose of the leveraged lease was to place ownership of the aircraft in a profitable owner would put up a portion of the acquisition cost and take accelerated depreciation against its own profits the aircraft would be leased to delta.the owner participant bearing of a portion of the purchase price of the aircraft as an equity investor in order to obtain the benefits of accelerated depreciation reduced the percentage of acquisition cost that needed to be financed by debt,thus reducing the interest cost of the acquisition.
a.the leveraged leases 
in each of these leveraged lease transactions,the parties entered into a master agreement the participation agreement,which specified the roles of the parties and identified the various constituent agreements.an owner trust was established to purchase aircraft with funds provided by i an equity contribution of approximately from the owner trust beneficiary the owner participant and ii borrowings of approximately from lenders the lenders.each claimant was the owner participant and beneficiary of such an owner trust.
in each transaction,the owner trust leased the aircraft to delta pursuant to a net lease the lease that required delta to pay all operating expenses.basic rent payments were calculated to amortize the debt due to the lenders and in some cases to provide a cash return to the owner participant.in each case,in order to provide security for the borrowed funds,the owner trust granted a security interest in the aircraft and assigned its interest in the lease subject to certain exceptions to an indenture trustee acting for the lenders,pursuant to an indenture agreement the indenture.the indenture trustee was charged with making debt payments from the lease rentals and distributing the excess,if any,to the owner trust.as assignee of the lessor interest,the indenture trustee was entitled to control the exercise of remedies if delta defaulted under the lease.
tax indemnity agreements and stipulated loss value 
the primary incentive of the owner participant in advancing of the purchase price of the aircraft was to obtain the benefits of accelerated depreciation.that interest,or in any event its economic value to the owner participant,was protected by two mechanisms against events that would prevent the owner participant from taking full advantage of the deductions,including delta default under the lease which might result in the indenture trustees foreclosing on the aircraft.the first form of protection for the owner participant was a tax indemnity agreement tia,which required delta to compensate the owner participant in the event that,upon a foreclosure on the aircraft,the internal revenue service required the owner participant to recapture deductions it had taken for accelerated depreciation.the second was a provision of each lease that permitted the lessor or the indenture trustee,as assignee to demand that delta pay stipulated loss value slv if delta defaulted under the lease.slv the precise amount of which was fixed by an appendix to the lease and was tied to the date of the default was calculated to provide for i the payment of the remaining debt with all interest due and ii the return to the owner participant through the date of termination,taking into account all adverse tax consequences that would result from the default.
in each case,the rights assigned to the indenture trustee as security for the loan to the owner trust included the right to demand payment of slv.the terms of the indenture provided that,upon the indenture trustee collection of slv,the funds would first be applied to the parties expenses,and then to any outstanding balance on the loan.remaining funds would be paid over to the owner trust,and ultimately to the owner participant.this sequence of payments was known as the indenture waterfall.
because slv was calculated to be sufficient to compensate the owner participant for all adverse tax consequences of a lease default,if delta were to make a full payment of slv and a full payment under the tia,the owner participant would receive double compensation,at least to the extent of the tax losses indemnified by the tia.accordingly,each tia contained an exclusionary provision,which stipulated in some form that,in the event that delta paid slv under the lease,the owner participant was not entitled to collect under the tia.for the same,to protect against the owner participant receipt of double participation agreements contained provisions requiring reduction of the slv to account for any amount paid by delta to the owner participant under a tia.
the precise language employed in the exclusionary provisions of the tias is not standardized,but varies slightly as among the three sets of leveraged lease transactions involved in these appeals.dfo tias provide that no amount is due under the tias where delta is required to pay slv.at t agreements provide that it is not entitled to anything under the tias where delta pays an amount equal to slv.northwestern tias provide that it is not entitled to any payment in respect of any loss arising as a result of a ny event whereby delta pays stipulated loss value or an amount determined by reference thereto.dfo tia at t tia northwestern tia.
ii.procedural history 
bankruptcy filing and exercise of remedies by indenture trustees 
on september,delta filed a voluntary chapter petition.on september,the office of the united states trustee appointed an official committee of unsecured creditors.on april,the bankruptcy court confirmed delta joint plan of reorganization,which became effective on april.delta bankruptcy filing was an event of default under all of the leases and indentures,and entitled the indenture trustees to exercise the remedies provided under the leases.
many of the aircraft at issue were disposed of pursuant to a term sheet the bingham term sheet negotiated among delta and an committee of debtholders and approved by the bankruptcy court on february.the bingham term sheet authorized and directed a series of transactions,consisting of foreclosure upon the collateral,including the aircraft,by the indenture trustees,rejection of the applicable leases,and execution of new,leases.the owner participants did not participate in the new leases.the bingham term sheet set forth a formula to determine the amount of the indenture trustees claims for rejection damages,roughly slv calculated as of the date of delta filing,less the aggregate rent payments to be received under the restructured leases,less the expected residual value of the aircraft at the end of the restructured lease terms.
northwestern was the owner participant in leveraged leases of three aircraft tail numbers,and.early in the bankruptcy,delta rejected its leases with respect to airplanes and,whereupon the indenture trustee repossessed and sold the aircraft.the indenture trustee foreclosed on northwestern remaining plane and it to delta pursuant to the bingham term sheet.the indenture trustee filed three proofs of claim arising from delta default under the northwestern leases.the claims for and were for slv less sale proceeds,and the claim for was for the lease rejection damages stipulated in the bingham term sheet.
dfo was the owner participant in leveraged leases of eight aircraft tail numbers,and.the indenture trustee foreclosed on three of dfo aircraft and them to delta pursuant to the bingham term sheet,and.with respect to the other five aircraft,delta and the indenture trustee entered into restructuring agreements under which dfo interest in the aircraft was foreclosed out.the restructuring agreements as under the bingham term sheet provided for new leases and stipulated lease rejection damages calculated by reducing slv by the present value of the restructured lease and the residual value of the aircraft.
at t was the owner participant in leveraged leases involving seven aircraft tail numbers,and.the indenture trustee foreclosed on all of at t aircraft and them to delta pursuant to the bingham term sheet.
objections to tia claims of owner participants 
appellants filed claims under their tias for tax losses that arose when the indenture trustees foreclosed on the aircraft,forcing appellants to recapture prior accelerated depreciation deductions.see a.delta decided to object to such tax indemnification claims brought by leveraged lease owner participants.because delta faced hundreds of such claims,totaling over billion in aggregate,the bankruptcy court approved procedures permitting delta to designate objections to selected sets of tia claims,which would serve as test cases governing the disposition of similar claims.the bankruptcy court upheld the objections of delta and the official committee to the claims of dfo,northwestern,and at 
the objection to dfo claims,designated objection,addressed tias providing that no payment would be due if a loss arose as a result of any event whereby a party to any of the operative documents is required to pay slv.the objection to northwestern claims,designated objection,addressed tias providing that no payment would be due if a loss arose as a result of any event whereby the lessee pays slv or an amount determined by reference to slv.the objection to at t claims,designated objection,addressed tias providing that no payment would be due if a loss arose as a result of a ny event whereby the lessee pays an amount equal to stipulated loss value.
c.the bankruptcy court ruling 
the bankruptcy court upheld each of the three categories of objections on the following reasoning.first,the court reasoned that discharge of a debt in bankruptcy is effectively payment of the debt.the court reviewed dictionary definitions of pay and paid,which provided that a payment is an event that discharge s a debt.in re delta air lines.the court reasoned that t he only meaning of which can rationally be ascribed to such terminology in the context of an insolvent and bankrupt is the common dictionary meaning of payment in the sense of discharge of the indebtedness.id.at.the court rejected claimants argument that,in light of the purpose of the exclusionary provisions,pays slv could only refer to payment of the full amount of slv,as depending on a narrow and eccentric meaning of pay.id.at.because each indenture trustee claim for slv would be discharged in delta bankruptcy,each slv had been paid within the meaning of the tia,with the consequence that a tia claim could not be asserted.id.at.
the court found additional basis for rejecting dfo claims in the specification of dfo exclusionary language that delta would not be obligated to make a payment under the tia as a result of any event whereby delta was required to pay slv.the court reasoned that,in each case,it was undisputed that such an event has reason of delta default,the indenture trustee has demanded that delta pay,and delta is required to pay,slv under the lease.in re delta air lines.the court thus found that in any case where the indenture trustee had demanded payment of slv,delta had been required to pay slv,with the consequence that the owner participant was barred from asserting a claim under a tia containing such a carveout.
finally,the court focused on the language in northwestern agreements that delta would not be obligated to make a payment under a tia if it paid the indenture trustee an amount determined by reference to slv.it concluded that the distribution to an indenture trustee of a pro rata share of its slv claim was such an amount,as the amount of the distribution would be determined as a percentage of the full slv claim.id.at.the court also concluded that payments to the indenture trustee for stipulated lease rejection damages as described in the bingham term sheet and similar agreements were amount s determined by reference to slv,because the damages were calculated using slv as a starting point.the court thus held that in any case where delta had paid a percentage of slv or the lease rejection damages specified in the bingham term sheet and similar agreements,delta had paid an amount determined by reference to slv,and the owner participant would not be permitted to recover under a tia containing such a carveout.
district court decision and appeals to this court 
each of the claimants appealed to the united states district court for the southern district of new york from the bankruptcy court order disallowing its claims.on september,the district court issued a decision on all appeals affirming the rulings below,and generally adopting verbatim the reasoning of the bankruptcy court orders.in re delta air lines,wl.these related appeals followed.
discussion 
all issues on appeal involve contract interpretation,and are thus subject to de novo review.fin.one pub.lehman.special,cir.under the doctrine of butner united states,principles of state law govern the interpretation of contractual provisions in bankruptcy.under new york law,which governs by reason of the choice of law clauses in the tias,t he fundamental,neutral precept of contract interpretation is that agreements are construed in accord with the parties intent.greenfield philles records.while t he best evidence of what parties to a written agreement intend is what they say in their writing,id.internal quotation marks omitted,e ach word must be considered along with not only all the other words that surround it,but also the history and education of the parties,the nature of the contract,the purposes of the parties,and all other relevant circumstances.corbin on contracts joseph perillo,accord aron gillman.
purpose of tax indemnification agreements and their exclusionary provisions 
to understand the tax indemnification agreements at issue,it is necessary to take into account their purpose in the leveraged leases and the purpose of their exclusionary provisions.the purpose of each tia was to compensate the owner participant in the event it was required to recapture accelerated depreciation it had taken.the owner participant primary motivation in putting up of the purchase price of the aircraft was to obtain the benefits of accelerated depreciation.the circumstance most likely to deprive the owner participant of that benefit was delta falling into insolvency.if delta were forced by insolvency to declare bankruptcy or to default on its rent payments under a leveraged lease,in all likelihood the indenture trustee would foreclose on the aircraft,and the owner participant would be required to recapture accelerated depreciation it had taken.the tia was designed to remedy that loss by obligating delta to compensate the owner participant for it.
the purpose of the exclusionary provisions was simply to ensure that an owner participant not receive double compensation for depreciation recapture.delta default might give rise to two to pay the owner participant as provided in the tia,and a second to pay slv to the indenture trustee.slv was calculated to include an amount to compensate the owner participant for loss of accelerated depreciation.it was therefore theoretically possible,although as a practical matter highly improbable,that an owner participant might recover twice for the loss occasioned by its depreciation recapture.the improbability of such double reco
