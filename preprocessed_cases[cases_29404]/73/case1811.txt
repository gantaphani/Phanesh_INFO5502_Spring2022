kristin terk belt and kimberly terk murphy the terks the joint,independent executors of their father david terk several attorneys and their law firm,oppenheimer,blend,harrison,tate,collectively,the attorneys for legal malpractice.the attorneys moved for summary judgment on the ground that estate planners owe no duty to the personal representatives of a deceased client estate.the trial court granted the motion,and the court of appeals affirmed the judgment.we hold,to the contrary,that there is no legal bar preventing an estate personal representative from maintaining a legal malpractice claim on behalf of the estate against the decedent estate planners.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.
background 
david terk hired the attorneys to prepare his will.after his death,the terks became the joint,independent executors of their father estate.as executors,the terks sued the attorneys for legal malpractice,alleging that the attorneys were negligent in drafting their father will and in advising him on asset management.they claim the estate incurred over in tax liability that could have been avoided by competent estate planning.
in affirming the trial court judgment for the attorneys,the court of appeals cited barcelo elliott,in which we held that beneficiaries can not maintain a malpractice cause of action against a decedent attorney because the attorney lacks privity with beneficiaries and therefore owes them no duty,citing barcelo.the terks argue that the barcelo rule bars only claims by beneficiaries suing for their own injuries and does not preclude suits brought by personal representatives on an estate behalf.we granted the terks petition to consider whether personal representatives may bring legal malpractice claims on behalf of a decedent estate.
discussion 
legal malpractice claims sound in tort.see cosgrove grimes.the plaintiff must demonstrate that the attorney owed the plaintiff a duty,the attorney breached that duty,the breach proximately caused the plaintiff injuries,and damages occurred.peeler hughes luce.
while an attorney always owes a duty of care to a client,no such duty is owed to beneficiaries,even if they are damaged by the attorney malpractice.see barcelo,at.in barcelo,we considered whether beneficiaries dissatisfied with the distribution of estate assets may sue an attorney for legal malpractice after a client death.id.at.in that case,the intended beneficiaries of a trust,which was declared invalid after the client death,sued the attorney who drafted the trust agreement.id.we held that the beneficiaries could not maintain a suit against the decedent estate planner because the greater good is served by preserving a privity rule which denies a cause of action to all beneficiaries whom the attorney did not represent.id.at.
several policy considerations supported our barcelo holding.first,the threat of suits by disappointed heirs after a client death could create conflicts during the process and divide the attorney loyalty between the client and potential beneficiaries,generally compromising the quality of the attorney representation.id.at.we also noted that suits brought by bickering beneficiaries would necessarily require extrinsic evidence to prove how a decedent intended to distribute the estate,creating a host of difficulties.id.we therefore held that barring a cause of action for malpractice by beneficiaries would help ensure that estate planners zealously represent ed their clients.id.at.
thus,in texas,a legal malpractice claim in the context may be maintained only by the estate planner client.this is the minority rule in the united eight other states require strict privity in malpractice suits in the majority of states,a beneficiary harmed by a lawyer negligence in drafting a will or trust may bring a malpractice claim against the attorney,even though the beneficiary was not the attorney client.see,lucas hamm,cal d,cert.denied,d schreiner scoville,iowa.
the question in this case,however,is whether the barcelo rule bars suits brought on behalf of the decedent client by his estate personal representatives.because most states allow beneficiaries to maintain malpractice claims,only a handful of jurisdictions have considered this specific issue.see,beastall madson,d,hosfelt miller,wl,ohio app.lexis,at ohio,sizemore swift,rutter jones,blechman,woltz kelly.we confront this question for the first time today.
generally,in texas an estate personal representative has the capacity to bring a survival action on behalf of a decedent estate.see austin nursing,lovato,see also.prob.code personal representative can institute suit for recovery of estate personal property,debts or damages.therefore,if the terks legal malpractice claim is brought on behalf of the decedent estate and survives the decedent,the terks may maintain a suit against the attorneys.
when no statute addresses the survivability of a cause of action,we apply common law rules.thomes porter,worth,no writ.a t common law all causes of action for damages die with the person of the party injured,or the person inflicting the injury,except such damages as grow out of acts affecting the property rights of the injured party.johnson rolls,see also landers goodrich,refusing to depart from rule that an action for damage to real or personal property survives the death of the owner.thus,absent a statute providing to the contrary,a cause of action that is penal or personal in nature typically does not survive,while claims that are contractual in nature or affect property rights survive the death of either party.see am.jur.abatement,survival and revival.
we have never specifically considered whether a legal malpractice claim in the context survives a deceased client.a claim that an estate planner negligence resulted in the improper depletion of a client estate involves injury to the decedent property.see.prob.code z defining the personal property of an estate to include interests in goods,money,and choses in action see also williams adams,writ ref tort claim alleging fraud,which resulted in financial loss to the plaintiff,survived the death of the defendant because it involved the wrongful acquisition of property cleveland united states,dist.lexis,at,tort claim for financial loss resulting from malpractice deemed an action for damage to personal property.moreover,when an attorney malpractice results in financial loss,the aggrieved client is fully compensated by recovery of that loss the client may not recover damages for mental anguish or other personal injuries.see douglas delp.
thus,malpractice claims seeking recovery for pure economic loss are limited to recovery for property damage.see id.therefore,in accordance with the,principle that actions for damage to property survive the death of the injured party,we hold that legal malpractice claims alleging pure economic loss survive in favor of a deceased client estate,because such claims are necessarily limited to recovery for property damage see galveston,freeman,a cause of action brought for damage to the estate and not for injury to the person,personal feelings or character,upon the death,bankruptcy or insolvency of the party injured,passes to the executor or assignee as a part of his assets,because it affects his estate,and not his personal rights see also traver state farm mut.auto.ins,worth rev on other grounds,legal malpractice claim arising from representation in personal injury case survives death of client.
the court of appeals found for the attorneys after holding that its prior decision in estate of arlitt paterson controlled.at.in estate of arlitt,the court held that an malpractice claim does not accrue during a decedent therefore does not survive the the estate injuries do not arise until after death see estate of arlitt paterson,antonio,pet.denied.
we disapprove estate of arlitt holding that no legal malpractice claim accrues before death when an attorney negligent drafting results in increased estate tax consequences.even though an estate may suffer significant damages after a client death,this does not preclude survival of an malpractice claim.while
