amanda armstrong and taxpayers hereinafter referred to collectively as armstrong appeal from the district court order dismissing their action against the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands cnmi seeking recovery of income tax rebates and accrued interest under the cnmi tax code.armstrong also seeks declaratory and injunctive relief regarding the manner in which the cnmi government administers the payment of rebates.the district court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claims,and dismissed the action pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.
armstrong contends first that the district court had federal question jurisdiction over the claims under because the cnmi has adopted the internal revenue code,et irc,as a local territorial income tax called the northern mariana territorial income tax nmtit.armstrong argues that because the provisions of the nmtit mirror those of the irc,claims that arise under the nmtit raise a federal question and therefore arise under the laws of the united states for the purposes of.
armstrong also argues that the district court had original jurisdiction over her claims pursuant to a provision in the covenant to establish a commonwealth of the northern mariana islands in political union with the united states of america covenant,reprinted in note which provides that the united states tax laws shall be adopted by the cnmi as a local territorial income tax and shall be in force in the same manner as those laws are in force in guam.thus,argues armstrong,just as the guam district court has jurisdiction over matters that arise under the provisions of guam tax code,which also mirrors united states tax laws,the cnmi district court has jurisdiction over matters that arise under the provisions of the cnmi tax code.
we have jurisdiction under and a.because we agree with the district court determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over armstrong claims,we affirm.
backgrounda.the cnmi covenant and adoption of federal tax law as a local territorial tax system 
from until,what is now the cnmi was a trust territory administered by the united states pursuant to an agreement with the security council of the united nations.see generally joseph horey,the right of in the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands.law policy journal,providing brief overview of cnmi history see also quoting language of,describing trusteeship terms united states de leon guerrero,cir.in,the islands entered into formal negotiations with the united states to finalize and make permanent the relationship between the entities.see id.
on february,the negotiations culminated with the signing of the covenant see de leon guerrero,at see also horey.law policy journal at describing history of covenant and several covenant provisions.this instrument,which governs the cnmi political relationship with the united states,provides that the united states district court for the northern mariana islands nmi district court,as a court established under article iv of the united states constitution,shall have the same jurisdiction as other united states district courts.see covenant a,codified as amended at see also nguyen united states,d describing how jurisdiction is vested in article iv courts by acts of congress.
the covenant also contains provisions that govern the adoption of an income tax system for the cnmi.first,covenant section provides that t he income tax laws in force in the united states will come into force in the northern mariana islands as a local territorial income tax on the first day of january following the effective date of this section,in the same manner as those laws are in force in guam.to implement this provision,the cnmi legislature adopted the nmtit,enacting the northern marianas income tax act of and,currently codified as amended in the northern mariana islands commonwealth code cmc at cmc.see.may.
under the nmtit,cnmi taxpayers 
are not required to pay federal income taxes to the united states internal revenue service.however,over the course of a tax year,a cnmi taxpayer pays the exact same amount of tax to the cnmi government,through either payroll withholding deductions or quarterly payments,as a citizen of one of the several states with the same income would pay to the united states government.
olopai guerrero,wl,at,see cmc describing a general fund into which all revenues raised pursuant to the tax laws and other revenue laws shall be deposited.
section provision that the cnmi shall adopt the united states tax laws as a local territorial income tax constitutes what is commonly referred to as a mirror code system.congress has described such systems,which are implemented in several insular areas,including guam,the virgin islands,and puerto rico,as the provisions of law which make the provisions of the income tax laws of the united states in effect in a possession of the united states.note see guam virgin islands puerto rico.
in addition to covenant section,covenant section authorizes the cnmi to enact additional local tax laws the government of the northern mariana islands may by local law impose such taxes,in addition to those imposed under section,as it deems appropriate and provide for the rebate of any taxes received by it note.accordingly,several provisions of the nmtit impose additional tax obligations on the cnmi and its taxpayers,and set forth a procedure by which cnmi taxpayers may obtain significant rebates on taxes owed.see cmc establishing rebate amounts cmc b establishing rebate procedures cmc specifying that the interest on overpayments shall be calculated only on the amount not already rebated cmc discussing special rebate trust account cmc b discussing authority to make refunds.
armstrong claims 
on january,armstrong filed a complaint in the nmi district court she alleged,on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated,that the cnmi failed to calculate and pay statutory interest due on accrued rebate claims in violation of the nmtit.armstrong sought a judicial declaration that interest applies to cnmi rebates the cnmi government is required to pay such interest cnmi taxpayers are entitled to offset their accrued rebates,plus interest,as a credit against taxes owed on wages and the cnmi government is estopped from asserting the applicable statute of limitations contained in,due to the cnmi government inaccurate representations that cnmi taxpayers were not entitled to interest on rebates.
armstrong also sought injunctive relief enjoining the cnmi government from expending funds set aside in the special rebate trust account,as required by cmc,so that the outstanding and accrued rebate claims could be satisfied.last,armstrong sought payment of accrued interest,in amounts to be proven at trial.
c.the district court ruling 
in response to armstrong complaint,the cnmi moved to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b on the ground that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.the district court granted the cnmi motion.although the court recognized that the cnmi adopted the united states tax laws as required by the covenant,it reasoned that those laws came into force as local territorial taxes,and that therefore no provision in the no other the court to exercise jurisdiction over claims seeking enforcement of these local laws.armstrong timely appealed.
armstrong presents two arguments that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over her claim we address,and reject,each in turn.
first,armstrong contends that the claims invoke federal question jurisdiction under.because the rebate provisions of the nmtit provide the legal basis for armstrong rebate claims,however,we conclude that the claims do not arise under federal law for the purposes of federal question jurisdiction.
second,armstrong argues that the court had original jurisdiction over the claims under covenant section,which provides that the united states tax laws shall be in force in the cnmi in the same manner as they are in force in guam.
although in guam,the district court has exclusive jurisdiction over claims,the instrument that governs guam relationship with the united that confers e
