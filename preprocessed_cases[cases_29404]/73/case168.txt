petitioner scott mathis,a registered representative and principal with various brokerage firms over the years,seeks review of a december,final order of the securities and exchange commission the sec or commission,which concluded that mathis willfully failed to disclose the existence of certain tax liens filed against him and thereby violated a and b a of the securities exchange act of the exchange act,a and b a.the sec conclusion that mathis acted willfully,which followed mathis appeal of various determinations of the financial industry regulatory authority,finra and its predecessor,the national association of securities dealers,nasd subjects mathis to statutory disqualification from the securities industry.
in his petition to vacate the sec order,mathis argues that he was not aware that he was obligated to disclose the tax liens against him on finra uniform application for securities industry registration or transfer,or form u,which mathis completed in november and august.he also claims that he was unaware of his duty to amend a form u previously filed in to reflect the existence of the liens from onward.he therefore challenges the sec conclusion that his conduct was willful and that the tax liens were material information that had to be disclosed.
we conclude that there was substantial evidence supporting the sec factual finding that mathis intentionally failed to disclose the liens on his forms u and that the liens were material.moreover,the sec did not abuse its discretion when it determined that mathis conduct constituted a willful violation of the exchange act provisions relating to applications and registration.we therefore deny mathis petition and affirm the sec order.
background 
the following facts are either undisputed or are supported by substantial evidence in the record.
the forms u 
from through,mathis worked in the securities industry as a broker or principal with various brokerage firms.at all relevant times,finra has required any person who works in the investment banking or securities business of a finra member to register as a securities representative,a stockbroker or principal,among other categories.nasd rules a,a,a.to register,applicants must complete a form u,in which they provide detailed information about their personal,employment,disciplinary,and financial background.
in september,mathis started as a broker with the boston group lp,a finra member,and signed and filed a form u the original form u.after the boston group dissolved in july,mathis became associated with the national securities corporation national securities as a broker and principal until september,when he voluntarily stopped working there.for reasons not relevant here,mathis was permitted to transfer his registration from the boston group to national securities without submitting a new form u.
in june,mathis became associated with investprivate,a he founded and controlled.he signed and filed a second form u to register as a representative and principal with investprivate on november.starting in june,mathis also served as the chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of,celebritystartups,a company he founded.on august,mathis signed and filed a third form u to register as a representative and principal with celebritystartups 
in completing a form u,applicants are required to swear or affirm that they have read and understand the items and instructions on this form and that their answers including attachments are true and complete to the best of their knowledge.in addition to requiring mathis to affirm the accuracy of his answers,all three forms u at issue in this appeal the original form u and the two later forms filed in and required mathis to update the information he provided on the forms by causing an amendment to be filed on a timely basis whenever changes occur to answers previously reported.he further represented that to the extent any information previously submitted is not amended,the information provided in this form is currently accurate and complete.similarly,the general instructions for each form warned mathis that he was under a continuing obligation to update information required by form u as changes occur.nasd notice to members april,nasd lexis,at see form u instructions,finra,may.

the tax liens 
in separate written notices between august and september,the internal revenue service irs informed mathis that it had entered five unsatisfied tax liens against him,totaling,due to mathis failure to pay a substantial portion of his personal income taxes owed for tax years,and.the five liens were as follows a lien entered august,in connection with his unpaid taxes for and the august tax lien a lien entered september,in connection with unpaid taxes for the september tax lien a lien entered may,in connection with his unpaid taxes for the may tax lien a lien entered july,in connection with unpaid taxes for the july tax lien and a lien entered september,in connection with unpaid taxes for the september tax lien.each of these notices advised mathis that the irs had made a demand for payment of the unpaid tax liability and informed him that,as a consequence of his nonpayment,there is a lien in favor of the united states on all property and rights to property belonging to mathis for the amount of these taxes 
in addition,sometime in,after receiving most of the irs notices,mathis appears to have requested to pay his overdue taxes in installments.in letters to mathis in late and approving his request,the irs emphasized that to protect the government interest a notice of federal tax lien has already been filed.the letters explained,moreover,that a notice of federal tax lien is a public notice that the government has a claim against your property to satisfy a debt and that the government would release remove the lien only when mathis had paid what he owed.
although the irs notices alone provide substantial evidence that mathis was aware of the unsatisfied tax liens,mathis was also aware of the liens through other sources,including a work colleague.tim holderbaum,whom mathis had hired to design a website for investprivate,informed mathis in december about a credit check that revealed mathis was subject to a tax lien.in an email to mathis dated december,holderbaum wrote that he could not obtain the necessary credit approval to establish an online store for investprivate till the tax lean sic issue is resolved.holderbaum further testified that mathis did not express any concern or reservation about that information.
having learned of their existence as early as,mathis knowingly failed to disclose the liens on the two forms u filed in and,failed timely to amend the original form u to reflect those liens,and failed as well to amend the or the forms u to reflect the july and september tax liens.
mathis efforts to conceal the liens also involved affirmative misrepresentations.on both the and forms u,for example,mathis responded no to the question do you have any unsatisfied judgments or liens against you similarly,on an annual representative certification for national securities,dated january,mathis claimed that he had paid all federal,state,and local taxes due in full,and falsely denied having any liens entered against you,which were not previously disclosed on f orm u.
by letter dated july,finra asked mathis to explain his failure to disclose the five federal tax liens.the letter prompted mathis to disclose the liens for the first time on an amended form u,which he filed eleven days later.mathis paid the liens approximately one month after disclosing them,and the irs released the liens a few months thereafter.
mathis attempted to explain his failure to disclose the liens in a series of responses to finra letter request.initially,he claimed that to the best of his recollection,he was not aware of the pendency of any federal tax liens at such times and further was not aware of any obligation to report such matters on form u.in subsequent testimony during an interview with finra staff in august,mathis acknowledged that he had received the five irs notices,but advanced several other explanations for his failure to disclose the liens.first,mathis claimed that he had relied on the advice of a boston group colleague and former finra official,kye hellmers,whose understanding was that if matters were not directly related to the securities industry,they need not be reported on the form.second,mathis testified that he thought a distinction existed between an irs notice of a tax lien and the tax lien itself,and that he was not obligated to report the irs notice.third,mathis explained that on the january national securities annual representative certification,a lack of concentration caused him to answer yes to the question whether he had paid his federal,state,and local taxes.fourth,he testified that he only cursorily reviewed the irs notices of tax liens before forwarding them to his accountant,who was working directly with the irs on a payment plan to address mathis federal tax debt.
procedural history 
in february,finra division of enforcement filed a complaint against mathis that charged him,as relevant to this appeal,with willfully failing to amend his original form u to disclose the liens,and willfully failing to disclose the tax liens on the two forms u filed in and,when he started investprivate and celebritystartups.in may,the parties entered into a settlement in which some of the charges were dismissed and others settled,while three counts against mathis remained,all of which concerned the tax liens at issue.mathis denied these remaining charges and requested a hearing before a finra hearing panel,which was held in july and lasted for two days.
in december,a finra hearing panel the panel determined that mathis became aware of the disclosure requirement after january and thereafter willfully failed to disclose the tax liens on his forms u.the panel found that mathis made a conscious effort to conceal his tax liabilities from his new employer by falsely representing on the national securities annual certification in january that he was current in his taxes.although it concluded that mathis had not acted willfully with respect to events from to january because he had reasonably relied on the advice of hellmers,his former boston group colleague the panel nevertheless imposed a fine and a suspension for failing to disclose the tax liens on his forms u after january 
mathis appealed the panel decision to the finra national adjudicatory council the nac.in a decision issued in december,the nac largely affirmed the panel decision,but disagreed with its finding that mathis had reasonably relied on hellmers advice from to january.instead,the nac concluded that mathis had willfully failed to amend his form u to disclose the five tax liens from the time he received the notice of the first tax lien in august through mid.in particular,the nac found that hellmers had offered only his opinion about mathis obligation to report the liens,and that he had specifically advised mathis that it was the responsibility of the boston group compliance department to determine if an unsatisfied tax lien should be reported.although the nac found that mathis violations started as early as,it affirmed the panel sanction,describing it as an appropriately remedial sanction for mathis willful failure to amend his form to disclose the five tax liens at issue and his willful failure to disclose the tax liens pending against him at the time he filed two initial forms.
mathis petitioned the sec to review the nac decision,challenging principally the nac finding of willfulness and arguing that statutory disqualification was an excessive sanction rejecting mathis claim that he was unaware of the existence of the liens pending against him and that he had reasonably relied on the advice of his colleague,the sec sustained the nac substantive decision relating to mathis forms u as well as the sanctions imposed against him.it determined that mathis had voluntarily provided false answers on his form regarding the tax liens and that the nondisclosure was material.explaining that willfulness means that the respondent intentionally committ ed the act which constitutes the violation and does not require that the person also be aware that he is violating one of the rules or acts,the sec concluded that mathis had willfully violated membership rule im and conduct rule.the conclusion that mathis acted willfully,by operation of a f and g of the exchange act,a f and g,subjected mathis to a statutory disqualification,or bar,from associating with any finra member firm potentially a more severe sanction than a monetary penalty or temporary suspension.see feins am.stock,cir statutory disqualifications include primarily prior felony convictions,willful violations of the federal securities laws,and other conduct that has,or could have,resulted in expulsion or suspension from a organization.exchange act g,g a registered securities association may,and in cases in which the commission,by order,directs as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors shall,deny membership to any registered broker or dealer,and bar from becoming associated with a member any person,who is subject to a statutory disqualification.
mathis timely filed this petition to review and vacate the sec order,insofar as it determined that he was subject to statutory disqualification.
