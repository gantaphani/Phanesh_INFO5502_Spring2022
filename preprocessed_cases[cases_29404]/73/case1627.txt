we must decide whether escape assessments,an assessment that is made because the property in question was not assessed during the initial assessment period,should be included in computing the tax increment used to determine the funding for redevelopment agencies.this is an issue of first impression.
the california redevelopment law crl health,et provides for the formation of redevelopment agencies to help eradicate blight.typically,a redevelopment agency prepares a redevelopment plan and then borrows money to complete the plan.a redevelopment agency repays its debt using tax increment.tax increment is based on the theory that property values will increase as a redevelopment occurs.the increase in property values will cause an increase in tax revenue.the tax increment is the tax revenue attributable to the increased property values.
defendants county of ventura and christine cohen collectively,the county argue that escape assessments should not be included in computing the tax increment.plaintiff community development commission of the city of oxnard cdc and amicus curiae california state university channel islands site authority disagree.we conclude the controlling statutes require inclusion of all tax revenue,including escape assessments,in computing the tax increment.
the funding process

property taxation 
all property in this state,not exempt under the laws of the united states or of this state,is subject to taxation under the revenue and taxation code.the county assessor must assess all property subject to general property taxation at its full value on january of each year.the county assessor assesses all real property within the county,while the initial valuation of business personal property is made from a business property statement prepared by the taxpayer.cal,art.xiii,heavenly valley el dorado county bd.of equalization th,d.
a lien for the yearly assessment attaches to the property annually as of on the first day of january preceding the fiscal year for which the taxes are levied.the subsequent assessment and levy are necessary in order to fix the amount of the tax but they do not result in the creation of a new obligation they are simply administrative steps necessary to the enforcement of the right which accrued on the lien date.citations.when the amount is ascertained,it relates back to the time the lien became fixed.california computer products,county of orange d.california computer products.
once property is assessed,it is listed on the assessment roll,which must be made available for inspection by the public.a property owner may dispute the assessment of his or her property by appealing to the county board of equalization cal,art.xiii.an application for equalization reduction of an assessment must be filed before september,subd.b.
the county board of equalization meets to decide the issues raised in the various equalization applications,subds.a,b and has the authority to equalize the values of all property on the local assessment roll by adjusting individual assessments.cal,art.xiii.equalization has been defined as adjusting the value of property assessed to conform to its real value.county of sacramento assessment appeals bd.d.after the completion of the equalization hearing process,required changes are made to the assessment roll,which becomes the equalized assessment roll.
reference is made in various statutes to the phrase last equalized assessment roll.this phrase,or similar words,means the entire assessment roll on august,which shall include any changes made by the county board during the month of july,together with changes made pursuant to revenue and taxation code sections and.the above provisions,including the right to file an application for equalization of an assessment up to september,establish that the last equalized assessment roll may not reflect all changes to initial assessments during any tax year.
escape assessments 
another type of assessment that probably will not be reflected in the equalized assessment roll is an escape assessment.if property has been either underassessed or unassessed,the assessor shall assess the property at its value on the lien date for the year for which it escaped assessment.it shall be subject to the tax rate in effect in the year of its escape,see also american airlines,county of san mateo cal th,d.section of the revenue and taxation code simply extends the power and duty of the assessor,enabling and requiring him to list and assess property which he had failed to assess,notwithstanding the time for assessment had passed and the exercise of this power is directly in accord with the policy and express provisions of the constitution,which requires all property not exempt from taxation to be taxed.farmers.bank board cal,discussing former political code section.
escape assessments are to be treated the same as property regularly assessed on the roll on which it is entered,subd.a.the statutory scheme for escaped assessments thus embodies the principle that the right to the taxes on escaped property accrues on the lien date,not on the date of entry on the tax roll.california computer products,supra,d at.

the system devised to divide the tax revenue between the redevelopment agency and other government entities that otherwise would receive the funds is known as tax increment.tax increment is based on the theory that the assessed value of the property in the redevelopment district will increase as a result of the redevelopment projects.this increase in assessed value will lead to an increase in tax revenue.the increase in tax revenue is known as the tax increment and is used to pay for the cost of redevelopment,subd.a.
this division of tax revenue is described in redevelopment agency county of san bernardino cal d,i f,after a redevelopment project has been approved,the assessed valuation of taxable property in the project increases,the taxes levied on such property in the project area are divided between the taxing agency and the redevelopment agency.the taxing agency receives the same amount of money it would have realized under the assessed valuation existing at the time the project was approved,while the additional money resulting from the rise in assessed valuation is placed in a special fund for repayment of indebtedness incurred in financing the project.see also cal,art.xvi,health.
the first step in determining the tax increment is to establish a base year assessed value of all of the taxable property within the redevelopment project area.health and safety code section,subdivision a defines the base year as the assessed value of the taxable property in the redevelopment project as shown upon the assessment roll used in connection with the taxation of that property by the taxing agency,last equalized prior to the effective date of the ordinance that approved the redevelopment plan see also cal,art.xvi.all taxes attributable to the base year assessed value of the property are distributed as they would have been had a redevelopment plan not been adopted.health,subd.a.

factual summary 
the dispute in this case arises from a mistake made by the ventura county assessor office assessor office.the parties stipulated to all relevant facts.
cdc is the governing body for the oxnard redevelopment agency,which is duly organized pursuant to the crl.all of the redevelopment areas under cdc control are within the county of ventura.christine cohen was the for the county of ventura at all relevant times.
the city of oxnard adopted several redevelopment plans pursuant to the applicable provisions of the crl,including the historic enhancement and revitalization of oxnard redevelopment plan hero plan.an electrical cogeneration power plant power plant was located within the area subject to the hero plan for several years before the fiscal year beginning july,and ending june.
the assessor office was responsible for assessing the value of the real property,improvements,and fixtures at the power plant.the assessor office failed to assign any value to the fixtures located at the power plant by july,despite having done so in previous years.the parties agree the omission was inadvertent.the certified assessor roll sent to the county auditor,therefore,included assessments only for the land and improvements.the total assessment included in the certified assessor roll for the power plant was and the total tax was computed to be.various adjustments were made to the certified assessor roll after it was submitted to the county auditor,and on august,it became the equalized assessment roll.
it appears the failure to assess the value of the fixtures at the power plant was discovered sometime after the assessment roll was equalized on august.on february,the assessor office transmitted an assessment roll change to correct the omission.this escape assessment placed the value of the fixtures for the power plant at,causing a tax increase of 
when the error was discovered,cdc requested the county auditor to adjust cdc tax increment to include the missing assessment.the auditor refused,citing a practice to base tax increments on the equalized assessment roll without adjustments for changes to the assessment roll that would affect the tax increment either positively or negatively.
procedural summary 
cdc combined a petition for writ of mandate,complaint for damages,and a request for declaratory relief in a single document filed in ventura county superior court the complaint.the complaint sought a writ of mandate directing the county to distribute all tax increment pursuant to the provisions of health and safety code section damages according to proof and a declaration that the computation of the tax increment must include escape assessments.the county filed an answer denying all the allegations of the complaint and asserting various affirmative defenses.
cdc motion for change of venue was granted,and the matter was transferred to kern county superior court.code civ,subd.a.four witnesses testified at the trial.the two primary witnesses were david schey and christine cohen.
schey testified as both a percipient witness and an expert witness for cdc.schey is a fiscal consultant who works for various cities and redevelopment agencies throughout california.he discussed the escape assessment and the evolution of the current dispute.he also determined that cdc would have been entitled to an additional for fiscal years through if all changes not reflected in the equalized assessment roll had been included in the tax increment calculation from his experience,schey knew other counties also base the tax increment calculation on the equalized assessment roll,but many also make periodic corrections to the computation in his experience,some counties base the tax increment on actual taxes collected.
cohen,the for ventura county,testified that she declined to include the escape assessment in the tax increment calculation because cdc was unable to provide an interpretation of the code that would convince her that the county approach was incorrect.she was not aware of any resolutions adopted by the ventura county board of supervisors relating to the calculation of tax increment.if the tax increment were calculated on the actual tax receipts,it could be onerous for her office because it is easier to compute the tax increment on the equalized roll.no one in her office examined the data to determine the net effect on the tax increment as a result of all the changes to the equalized roll.the tax revenue generated from the power plant escape assessment was distributed to those entities that would otherwise receive tax proceeds if there were no redevelopment occurring.she did not know how many roll corrections occur in redevelopment areas,although the total roll corrections for the entire county for one year was approximately.
the trial court entered judgment in favor of the county,concluding the term levied taxes in health and safety code section,subdivision b referred to taxes generated from the equalized assessment roll.
resolution of this dispute requires us to apply health and safety code section hereafter section to the undisputed facts in this case.since we are interpreting statutory and constitutional provisions,we review the matter de novo.redevelopment agency county of los angeles th,d.
our interpretation of section is guided by principles.first,we look to the plain meaning of the words of the statute to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so that the purpose of the statute may be fulfilled.day city of fontana cal th,d,dafonte,cal th,d.we may not look to extrinsic sources if the statute is clear and unambiguous on its face.people otto cal th,d.nor may we add to or alter the words of a statute to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute.dafonte,at,d.
the parties agree that the base year assessment required by section,subdivision a is the assessment as reflected on the last equalized assessment roll before the effective date of the ordinance establishing the redevelopment district.the parties also agree that any escape assessments that occurred after the assessment roll was equalized,but before the effective date of the ordinance,are not part of the base year assessment calculations.redevelopment agency county of los angeles,supra,th at,d.
the relevant portion of section,subdivision b provides that the portion of the levied taxes each year in excess of the taxes levied on the base year assessment shall be allocated to and when collected shall be paid into a special fund of the redevelopment agency to pay the principal of and interest on loans.cdc argues section,subdivision b requires the tax increment be based on the taxes assessed and collected for the property within the redevelopment district,including any escape assessments or other changes to the equalized assessment roll.the county,on the other hand,argues that subdivision b requires the tax increment be calculated on the equalized assessment roll without adjustment for any changes,either positive or negative,that may occur after august the date on which the assessor roll is equalized.
we disagree with the approach of the county.
unlike section,subdivision a,subdivision b of this section does not refer to the equalized assessment roll.instead,subdivision b states the redevelopment agency is to receive the benefit of that portion of the levied taxes in excess of the taxes attributable to the base year assessments.it is apparent from the plain meaning of these words that the legislature intended to include in the tax increment calculation all tax revenue generated from the property in the redevelopment area.the lack of any words to limit the application of the phrase levied taxes in subdivision b precludes any other conclusion.
the county approach would require us to modify section,subdivision b by replacing the phrase levied taxes with the phrase taxes levied on the equalized assessment roll.we reject this request for three reasons.first,we are not permitted to add words to a statute to accomplish a purpose that is not apparent from the face of the statute.dafonte,supra,cal th at,d.
second,the legislature clearly knew how to refer to the last equalized assessment roll when it wanted to do so.see,subd.a.indeed,the legislature provided a comprehensive definition of the term in revenue and taxation code section et.since section,subdivision a refers to the equalized assessment roll in the calculation for base year assessments,it is clear the legislature would have inserted language to limit the revenue calculation in subdivision b of section to revenue generated from the equalized assessment roll if that were its intention.the failure to mention the equalized roll in subdivision b is compelling evidence that the tax revenue to which the redevelopment agency is entitled is not restricted to the revenue based on the equalized assessment roll.
third,our resolution minimizes the possibility of mischief.there can be hostility between counties and redevelopment agencies over revenue.while the parties agree the mistake in this case was innocent,one easily can imagine a situation where an auditor mistake is not so perceived by an agency or the public.this is especially so when a mistake would minimize the tax revenue due to the redevelopment agency and increase the revenue to be paid to other jurisdictions.
another factor compels our conclusion that such mistakes,no matter how innocent,should not accrue to the detriment of the redevelopment agency.redevelopment agencies frequently issue bonds to pay for the cost of redevelopment.bell community redevelopment agency woosley d.the marketability of those bonds is based in part on the redevelopment agency ability to pay the principal and interest due on the bonds.see generally in re nathan estate cir,fn.davis united states.an investor must be able to estimate the tax revenue that the redevelopment agency will receive.it would be difficult for investors to evaluate the bond issue if the redevelopment agency revenue were dependent upon the efficiency of the assessor office.the legislature could not have intended such instability.
each of these reasons leads us to reject the county position and conclude that escape assessments must be included in the tax increment calculation 
the county contentions 
the county offers numerous arguments why their approach is correct.we will discuss the main points.
revenue and taxation code section 
the county contends that revenue and taxation code section,subdivision a requires the tax increment to be calculated on the equalized roll.this section explains how redevelopment tax increment is to be allocated to the taxing jurisdictions when the area included in the redevelopment plan involves more than one taxing jurisdiction.
the county auditor first is instructed to withdraw the revenue determined to be due to the redevelopment agency pursuant to section of the health and safety code,subd.a.next,the auditor is to refer to the tax rates set pursuant to revenue and taxation code section to determine how much of that revenue should be charged to each taxing agency within the area included in the redevelopment plan.finally,the statute states,in order to determine each jurisdiction share of that redevelopment increment,the factors or rates for all tax rate areas that are part of a redevelopment project shall be applied to the current assessed value of the taxable property within the redevelopment project area,less the assessed valuation on the base year assessment,subd.a,italics added.citing revenue and taxation code section,the county asserts that the reference to current assessed value of the taxable property refers to the assessments on the last equalized roll.
revenue and taxation code section provides no authority for this argument.that statute provides that the phrase last equalized county assessment roll,in those words or in similar words,or in any words intended to refer to the latest or current assessment roll of the county,is defined pursuant to the rules provided in that chapter.ibid.the phrase is defined in the subsequent statutes to include the entire assessment roll,as amended by the county board of equalization as it exists on august.
the county error is that the phrase current assessed value of the taxable property,as used in revenue and taxation code section,subdivision a,is not the equivalent of the phrase last equalized county assessment roll.instead,current assessed value of the taxable property,like section,subdivision b requirement that all levied taxes are to be included in the tax increment,reflects the intent to include all property at its current assessed value.this phrase is inconsistent with the county argument that errors in the equalized assessment roll may not be corrected.
unnecessary to refer to the last equalized roll 
we also reject the suggestion that the legislature concluded it was unnecessary to refer to the last equalized assessment roll in section,subdivision b.the county makes various arguments to support this contention.first,it claims the legislature reached this conclusion because each year the levied taxes are based on the equalized roll.the facts in this case prove this assertion wrong.the levied taxes in the fiscal year included over in taxes that were based on an assessment that was not included in the equalized assessment roll 
second,the county argues the reference to the last equalized assessment roll in section,subdivision a necessarily included the phrase in subdivision b of that section.we think the opposite is true.as explained above,the reference to the last equalized assessment roll in subdivision a establishes that the legislature knew how to refer to that document when it intended to do so.the decision to refer to all levied taxes,instead of the taxes levied on the equalized assessment roll,demonstrates that the legislative intent was to ensure that the redevelopment agencies received all incremental tax revenue,not just that revenue generated from the equalized assessment roll.
nor does the legislature use of the word levied in both subdivisions a and b of section support the county position.subdivision a refers to the rate upon which the tax is levied each year.subdivision b refers to the portion of the levied taxes each year.this portion of each subdivision refers to the taxes levied,or imposed,in a specific year using the current assessment and the current tax rate.the legislature choice of these words does not provide any support for the county position that the phrase that portion of the levied taxes each year is restricted to those taxes imposed on the equalized assessment roll.
escape assessments are not levied 
the county takes its argument one step further,suggesting that the tax imposed as a result of an escape assessment is not levied as that term is used in section,subdivision b.thus,according to the county,the taxes resulting from an escape assessment are not to be included in calculating the tax increment.the basis for this argument,it appears to us,is the assertion that because revenue and taxation code section,which authorizes imposition of escape assessments and other changes to assessments on the equalized roll,does not state that the resulting tax is levied,then the resulting tax falls outside the scope of section.
the relevant portion of revenue and taxation code section states,if any property belonging on the local roll has escaped assessment,the assessor shall assess the property on discovery at its value on the lien date for the year for which
