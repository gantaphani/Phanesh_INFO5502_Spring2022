proposition,adopted in,limits the amount that the assessed value of real property may be increased to reflect increases in the property actual market value.when ownership of the property changes,however,the property may be reassessed at its current market value.see pacific southwest realty county of los angeles cal th,d,pacific southwest.changing the assessed value of real property to its current market value can result in a substantial increase in the tax on that property.thus,determining whether and when a change of ownership has occurred can have significant tax consequences.
here,the ownership of land subject to a lease has changed.we must decide whether a building on that land,constructed after the lease had commenced,has also changed ownership.the answer depends on who owns the fee or equivalent interest in the building for these lessor or the lessee.we conclude that,for purposes of proposition,the lessor owns the building as well as the land.accordingly,the change in ownership of the land also changed ownership of the building.we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal,which reached a similar conclusion.
facts and procedural history 
robert and electra anderson the grandchildren are the grandchildren of stanley and marguerite anderson the grandparents.each grandchild is the beneficiary of one of two trusts that together hold a percent interest in property on north rodeo drive in beverly hills.real party in interest northern trust bank of california northern trust is the cotrustee of the trusts.in february,the trusts,along with two other trusts not involved in this litigation,leased the property to tommy hilfiger retail,hilfiger for years with two options to extend the term.at the time the parties entered the lease,the property was improved with a retail building.
the written lease defined the premises being leased as including the improvements.paragraph a of the lease,captioned ownership,provided subject to lessor right to require their removal or become the owner thereof as hereinafter provided in this paragraph,all alterations and utility additions made to the premises by lessee shall be the property of and owned by lessee,but considered a part of the premises.paragraph c required hilfiger to surrender the premises by the end of the last day of the lease term or any earlier termination date,with all of the improvements,parts and surfaces thereof clean and free of debris and in good operating order,condition and state of repair,ordinary wear and tear excepted.a provision in an addendum to the lease,also captioned ownership,stated during the term of this lease,the improvements shall be the property of and owned by lessee but considered a part of the premises.the improvements shall,at the expiration or earlier termination of this lease,become the property of lessor and remain upon and be surrendered by lessee with the premises.another lease provision gave the lessor authority to eject hilfiger from the premises for a breach of the lease.under the lease,any proceeds from the taking of any part of the premises by eminent domain belonged to the lessor.
the lease required hilfiger either to renovate the existing retail building on the property with a minimum expenditure of million or to demolish it and build a new one with a minimum expenditure of million.it provided for certain rent credits depending on which of these options hilfiger chose.it also stated that a ll monetary obligations of lessee to lessor under the terms of this lease are deemed to be rent.it gave the trusts,as the lessor,certain control over changes to the existing building,including approval of any architectural plans,alterations,or construction of new improvements.it also recognized that hilfiger intended to construct a flagship location on the premises and stated that the lessor agreed to cooperate in this regard.the lease also required the lessor consent for hilfiger to mortgage or encumber the improvements,or to assign or transfer the leasehold.
the lease contemplated that the lessor would have authority to finance,refinance,or sell the premises,any part thereof,or the building of which the premises are a part it required hilfiger to pay the real property taxes,but required the lessor to pay any increase in real property taxes due to,or resulting from,the sale of the premises.it also required hilfiger to repair any damage to the property at its expense,but required the lessor to make any insurance proceeds available to hilfiger for the repairs.the lease did not specifically state whether the monthly rent was for the land or the building,or both,but the evidence established that hilfiger paid rent for the land,and not for the building.
hilfiger chose to demolish the existing building and build a new one,at a cost of million.it completed and occupied the new building in late.the new building was assessed as new construction at that time.thereafter,hilfiger paid all expenses associated with the building.
on june,john anderson,the grandchildren father,died.the parties agree that under the terms of the trusts,this event transferred ownership of the trusts interests in the property from the grandparents to the grandchildren.the grandchildren applied for the million reassessment exclusion under revenue and taxation code section rick auerbach,the los angeles county assessor assessor granted the exclusion.however,taking the position that the trusts owned the building as well as the land for property tax purposes,the assessor applied the exclusion to both on a pro rata basis.it allocated approximately percent of the exclusion to the building and percent to the land.northern trust,as trustee for the grandchildren,contested this allocation before the los angeles county assessment appeals board board.it contended that the trusts owned only the land and not the building,and thus the entire exclusion applied to the land.
after holding an evidentiary hearing,the board ruled in the grandchildren favor.it concluded that hilfiger,rather than the trusts,owned the building and directed the assessor to apply the exclusion solely to the land.it relied on the following facts to support this conclusion the agreement,the lease states that ownership of the new improvements was held by hilfiger once the new improvements were completed in.other provisions in the agreement support the conclusion that the trusts and hilfiger intended the new improvements to be owned by hilfiger for as long as hilfiger was leasing the land on which the new improvements were located.for example,the elimination of all references in the agreement to lessor ownership of improvements,the provisions relating to payment of rent only for the use of the land,and the requirement that insurance loss proceeds received by the trusts for any damage to the improvements be forwarded to hilfiger all demonstrate that hilfiger owned the new improvements constructed at the property.
the actions and practices of the trusts,the grandchildren,and hilfiger also support the conclusion that hilfiger owned the new improvements as of june.first,hilfiger built the new improvements at its own cost.second,hilfiger paid all expenses related to operation of the new improvements.third,the trusts the grandchildren had no right or claim to possess or occupy the new improvements in,nor did they do so at any time.all benefits associated with the use and occupancy of the new improvements went to hilfiger,and not to the trusts or to the grandchildren.this is most clearly supported by the absence of any rental payments by hilfiger for the new improvements.
the assessor filed a petition for writ of mandate in the superior court challenging the board decision.the court agreed with the board and denied the petition.the assessor appealed.a divided court of appeal reversed the judgment.in an opinion authored by acting presiding justice mallano,the majority concluded that notwithstanding the lessee construction of the improvements,both the land and the improvements are subject to,and included in the calculation of,the exclusion.justice vogel dissented,concluding that the board and superior court reached the correct decision.we granted northern trust petition for review.
ii.discussion 
proposition generally limits the maximum amount of any ad valorem tax on real property to percent of its full cash value.cal,art.xiii a,subd.a.the constitution defines full cash value as the county assessor valuation of the property on the tax bill or,thereafter,the appraised value of real property when purchased,newly constructed,or a change in ownership has occurred after the assessment,subd.a,italics added.this appraised value may be adjusted for inflation from year to year but only at a maximum rate of percent per year,subd.b.
the issue in this case is to what extent a change in ownership cal,art.xiii a,subd.a occurred when the trusts interest in the property on north rodeo drive changed from the grandparents to the grandchildren.the parties agree that the land changed ownership,but they disagree whether the change in ownership included the building as well.northern trust contends that hilfiger now owns the building for real property tax purposes under the california constitution cal,art.xiii a,subd.a,and thus the change in ownership of the trusts interest in the property did not include the building.the assessor contends that,for these purposes,the trusts continue to own the building as well as the land,and thus the change in ownership included both.the difference in these positions has substantial practical significance.the reassessment exclusion of section permits the first million of the value of the property that changed ownership to be excluded from the reassessment.the land and building together obviously have far greater value than the land alone.under northern trust position,the entire million exclusion would apply to the value of the land.under the assessor position,the million exclusion would have to be prorated between the value of both the land and the building,resulting in a far greater reassessment than if the entire exclusion applied to the land.
this issue is governed by statute.in pacific southwest,supra,cal th,d,we explained the relevant statutory and analytical framework for deciding this issue.proposition did not itself define change in ownership,so it fell to the legislature to do so.a task force studied the matter.the panel work culminated in the report of the task force on property tax administration hereafter task force report,which was submitted to the assembly committee on revenue and taxation on january.pacific southwest,supra,at,d.the task force report made various recommendations,which resulted in the enactment of the revenue and taxation code provisions at issue here.the key provisions relevant here are section,which contains the basic test section,which contains examples of what is a change in ownership and section,which contains examples of what is not a change in ownership.see pacific southwest,supra,at,d.
the task force report drafters stressed the need for uniformity and consistency in the application of section general rule.pacific southwest,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,it recommended that this general definition control all transfers.the task force also recommended giving specific examples of what is and is not a change in ownership,which are set forth in sections and.it stressed,however,that these examples must be consistent with section general test.the entire statutory design would be destroyed by providing statutory treatment for specific transfers which are inconsistent with the general test.in that case,the general test would be overruled by the specific rules and the entire statutory design might be held invalid because of the lack of any consistent,rational interpretation of the constitutional phrase,change in ownership.pacific southwest,supra,at,d,quoting the task force report.because the legislature,in enacting section,adopted its language verbatim after reviewing the task force report,it is evident that the legislature intended for section to contain the overarching definition of a change in ownership for reassessment purposes.id.at,d.accordingly,we turn to section to determine whether the building changed ownership for reassessment purposes.
section provides a change in ownership means a transfer of a present interest in real property,including the beneficial use thereof,the value of which is substantially equal to the value of the fee interest.its governing test contains three parts a change in ownership means a transfer of a present interest in real property,including the beneficial use thereof,the value of which is substantially equal to the value of the fee interest.to determine whether the transaction in the case at bar worked a change in ownership under proposition,we begin with that test.pacific southwest,supra,cal th at,d.in pacific southwest,we found that the transaction at issue a sale and leaseback met section test and,hence,that it resulted in a change of ownership.pacific southwest,supra,at,d.as we explain,we reach a similar conclusion regarding the building here.
the parties agree that the trusts own the land and thus have a present interest in it,even though it is currently being leased to hilfiger.the question here solely concerns who owns the building.before entering into the lease with hilfiger,the trusts clearly owned the then existing building as well as the land.if,as the assessor argues,the trusts also own the newly constructed building,then a change of ownership of that building has occurred.but northern trust argues that hilfiger owns the new building.it relies primarily on the facts that the lease provides that hilfiger own s the building during the term of the lease,hilfiger built it at its own expense,and hilfiger pays no rent for it.if northern trust is correct,the change of the trusts interest in the property from the grandparents to the grandchildren did not change ownership of the building.
the general purpose of section,evident from its three subdivisions,is to ensure that it is the fee interest,or its equivalent value,that is generally subject to property taxation,and that tax reassessment follows the fee interest or its equivalent through various changes in ownership.in this case,for purposes of a section change in ownership,hilfiger does not own the fee interest in the building,or its equivalent,but owns an estate of lesser value.the trusts owned the fee interest in the entire premises before they entered into the lease,and they still own the fee interest.
the lease states that hilfiger own s the building during the term of the lease.whatever this might mean for other purposes,this statement is not dispositive for purposes of section test,which is all that we are deciding here.the lease also provides that the building will become the lessor property at the end of the lease.it made hilfiger ownership s ubject to the requirement that hilfiger surrender the improvements to the lessor when the lease ended,as well as circumscribed by the lessor authority to eject hilfiger from possession for a breach of the lease.hence,for purposes of proposition,hilfiger has a leasehold interest in the building or at most a possessory interest in an estate for years,not ownership of the fee interest.the fee interest in the entire premises,including the building,remains with the trusts.as we explained in pacific southwest,a freehold estate is distinguished from other forms of estates in that it is of indeterminate duration citations.but an estate for years is not a freehold estate.indeed,under california law an estate for years is not real property at all but rather a chattel form of though the substance of the estate,being land,is real property,notwithstanding the fact that a lease is a present possessory interest in land,there is no question that as a nonfreehold estate it is a different species of interest from a freehold estate in fee simple a leasehold is not an ownership interest,unlike the possession of land in fee simple it is for that reason that common parlance refers to the owner of a freehold estate,encumbered or unencumbered,but to the holder of a lease the freeholder is seised of land,whereas the leaseholder is not.pacific southwest,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
other provisions of the lease support the conclusion that,
