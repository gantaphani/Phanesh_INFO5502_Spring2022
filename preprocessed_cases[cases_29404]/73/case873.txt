like many state,local,and territorial jurisdictions,guam has struggled for years with chronic budget deficits.guam settled on a unique solution to its financial problems it refused to refund income taxes,using the money to fund government spending.confronted with meritorious and uncontested claims for tax refunds,guam did not issue the refunds,often for several years at a time.
apparently recognizing that some guam taxpayers desperately needed their excess tax payments to which the guam government has no legal claim guam established an expedited refund process.purportedly,taxpayers facing,for example,medical or funeral expenses,would move to the front of the line and be granted refunds without waiting for guam to make good on the huge backlog of claims.in practice,the expedited refund process was effectively standardless,and it devolved into arbitrariness and favoritism.
a group of guam taxpayers brought this suit against guam and several of its officers in their official capacities.the taxpayers alleged that guam violated the tax provisions of the organic act of guam,by failing timely to refund overpayments,and,via a claim brought under,the taxpayers also challenged the arbitrary expedited refund program as a violation of equal protection.
the district court granted summary judgment to the taxpayers on both claims,entered a permanent injunction both ending the expedited refund program and requiring guam to pay approved refunds in a timely manner,and awarded substantial attorney fees and costs.guam challenges the district court orders on a number of grounds.we affirm.
taxpayers rea mializa paeste,jeffrey paeste,sharon zapanta,and glenn zapanta,on behalf of a class of guam taxpayers collectively,the taxpayers,brought this suit against guam,along with the governor,the director of the department of revenue and taxation,and the director of the department of administration of guam in their official capacities collectively,guam,challenging systematic delay and unfairness in guam handling of income tax refunds.the taxpayers asserted one claim,against all the defendants,under the organic act of guam,and another,against all but guam itself,under,alleging a violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,extended to guam by u 
the district court granted a motion for class certification after discovery,the court granted the taxpayers motion for summary judgment as to both claims.it issued findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of its grant of summary judgment.
the district court findings of fact,which guam does not challenge on appeal,paint a troubling picture of guam practices.guam has,s ince the early,financed chronic budget deficits by regularly delaying the payment of guam income tax refunds to its taxpayers such that many refunds were not paid in a timely manner and during some periods,no refunds were paid to any one.guam failed timely to pay refunds even after guam legislature enacted two separate statutes requiring that money be set aside for that purpose.
traditionally,the government of guam has paid income tax refunds in a,order,the same way the internal revenue service ordinarily pays federal income tax refunds.but,in light of the chronic delays,for years guam paid some refunds on an expedited basis,out of the chronological order otherwise applicable.the expedited refund process was not governed by any formal process or any regulations,nor,it appears,any consistently followed set of standards.the result was starkly unequal treatment of refund requests.
the director of the department of revenue and taxation drt testified,for example,that the reasons taxpayers offered for requesting expediting returns were ranked,from medical needs as the most serious to financial hardship as the least.in reality,however,w hile taxpayers experiencing medical emergencies were often unable to obtain expedited refunds,other taxpayers with less urgent financial needs receive d their refunds on an expedited basis.indeed,the greatest number of refunds was paid to drt category of financial hardship despite it purportedly being the lowest priority.
the process was also opaque and tedious.guam did not formally approve or reject requests for expedited refunds,so some taxpayers stood in line at drt offices day after day to check on the status of their refund requests.in practice,to obtain an expedited refund,a taxpayer would often need to persuade one of a series of public officials to include his or her name on a list,given to drt,resulting in expedited refunds for those with the right political connections.drt employees also successfully expedited their own refunds,and those of family and friends,often without filling out the purportedly required form,submitting supporting documentation,or visiting the drt.similarly,the named plaintiffs refunds were expedited,even though they submitted no requests for expedited treatment,in an apparent attempt to render this case moot.
based on these facts,the district court concluded that the taxpayers were entitled to summary judgment on both claims.it also entered a permanent injunction prohibiting guam from operating its expedited refund program.the injunction further provided that,as to any refund claim that contained no material errors and was not subject to an audit or other investigation,the government of guam shall pay the corresponding refund no later than six months after the filing of the claim for refund or six months from the due date for filing the claim for refund,whichever is later finally,the court awarded substantial attorney fees and costs to the taxpayers 
these consolidated appeals followed.
guam challenges the taxpayers equal protection claim as not cognizable under,which provides 
every person who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,of any state or territory or the district of columbia,subjects,or causes to be subjected,any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws,shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law,suit in equity,or other proper proceeding for redress 
emphases added.guam contends that no defendant is a person within the meaning of,and that the challenged actions were not taken under color of territorial law.guam is wrong.
the taxpayers contend that both of guam arguments regarding are waived,as they were not raised before the district court until long after judgment was entered on the merits see dream palace cnty.of maricopa,cir.guam responds that at least the definition of person may be raised for the first time on appeal as it implicates subject matter jurisdiction,and,in the alternative,that the court should exercise its discretion to reach the arguments.
three circuits have held that whether a party is a person under is not a jurisdictional question but rather a statutory one.settles parole comm n,accord barker goodrich,cir bolden se.transp,cir en banc.we agree and so hold.
whether the defendant is a person within the meaning of the statute is a necessary inquiry for the purposes of establishing the essential elements of a claim.pistor garcia,cir.but,as a general matter,the absence of a valid as opposed to arguable cause of action does not implicate jurisdiction.steel citizens for a better env t,see also verizon,pub.serv.comm of,same.here,the taxpayers claim,including their contention that the defendants are persons within the meaning of the statute,was not made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or wholly insubstantial and frivolous.steel,at internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,that claim was not only arguable but,as the district court held,actually meritorious.thus,guam statutory argument does not implicate subject matter jurisdiction.recharacterizing an issue of statutory interpretation as jurisdictional is mere wordplay.settles,at.
nor,as guam contends,is there a circuit split on this question.both seventh circuit cases on which guam relies as holding to the contrary grounded their jurisdictional holdings on eleventh amendment sovereign immunity.see sherman cmty.consol.sch.dist,cir concluding that a suit against a state official was an effort to obtain a judgment binding the state of illinois as an entity and therefore barred by the eleventh amendment toledo,peoria state of ill,dep t of,cir relying on state sovereign immunity in concluding that t his section action against a state agency fails for lack of federal court jurisdiction.while the statutory definition of person is s imilar to and often conflated with eleventh amendment immunity,the concepts are distinct.barker,at.there is no circuit split as to the nature of the statutory question when stripped of its eleventh amendment component.bolden,at.
guam does not contend that it is entitled to eleventh amendment immunity,but does assert federal sovereign immunity,arguing that it is entitled to immunity to the same extent accorded the federal government.this argument is also unavailing.
even if guam enjoys sovereign immunity,of whatever sort,from the taxpayers claim,that claim was not brought against guam itself,but only against its officers in their official capacities,and only for declaratory and injunctive relief under the principle of ex parte young,actions for prospective relief are not treated as actions against guam itself.guam soc.of obstetricians gynecologists ada,cir internal quotation marks omitted.

guam society of obstetricians gynecologists ada held that a guam officer sued in his official capacity is a person within the meaning of.at.guam arguments to the contrary are meritless.
two years before we decided ada,ngiraingas ii held that neither the territory of guam nor its officers acting in their official capacities are persons under.at.nearly all of the supreme court analysis addressed whether guam itself was a person,concluding,based principally on legislative history,that it was not.see id.at.but the plaintiffs in that case had also sued several guam officials in their official capacities for damages.id.at.the supreme court noted the conclusions of the district court and this court that because a judgment against those defendants in their official capacities would affect the public treasury,the real party in interest was the government of guam.id.at.the court own analysis as to the officials was limited to the following petitioners concede,and we agree,that if guam is not a person,neither are its officers acting in their official capacity.id.at citation omitted.
two years later,ada held that a guam official is a person when sued in his official capacity for prospective relief.at.ada binds us,and ngiraingas ii,an supreme court decision,offers no basis for us,as a panel,to reconsider ada.see miller gammie,cir en banc.
even if we could revisit ada,we would decide the issue in accord with that case.ada acknowledged the general statement as to guam officers in ngiraingas ii,but pointed out the established distinction between suits against governmental officials for damages,such as ngiraingas,and those for injunctive relief.id.at.as ada noted,state officers,when sued for damages in their official capacities,are,like states,not persons within the meaning of,because a judgment against a state official in his or her official capacity runs against the state and its treasury.id.citing will.dep t of state police,kentucky graham.but,as ada explained,the rule is entirely different with regard to prospective relief,which does not run directly against the state treasury suits for such relief are not treated as actions against the state.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the court concluded we can see no reason why the same distinction between injunctive and damages actions against officials should not apply to a territory.id 
there is,indeed,no reason why these established principles,applicable to states,should not apply to territories as well.accord mccauley of virgin islands,cir citing will,at brow.farrelly,cir,as amended may,see also playboy,pub.serv.comm of puerto rico,cir concluding that ngiraingas ii did not foreclose liability,in part because the plaintiffs sought only injunctive relief pistor,at noting that graham same principles fully apply in the context of indian tribes.ngiraingas ii did not,it is true,expressly state that the exception applies to suits against territorial officers.but that silence indicates little the court did not address prospective relief at all,because the plaintiffs sought none.see at.particularly given the cursory treatment of the defendants in that case,and the plaintiffs concession there that the same rule would apply to both guam and the defendants,we do not read ngiraingas ii to establish markedly different treatment of suits as between states and territories.
guam puts forward another theory as to why ada is not binding that it is inconsistent with ngiraingas sanchez,cir ngiraingas i,the case reviewed by the supreme court in ngiraingas ii.ngiraingas i concluded that guam is in essence an instrumentality of the federal government,much like a federal department or administrative agency,and so guam,like the federal government,should not be held liable on the same terms as other entities.id.at citation omitted quoting sakamoto duty free shoppers,cir thus,we held,guam itself was not a person within the meaning of.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
in reliance on ngiraingas i,guam now argues that its officers should be treated in the same way as federal officers for the purposes of.section provides no cause of action against federal agents acting under color of federal law.billings united states,cir.but ngiraingas i is unhelpful to guam for several reasons.
first,if there really were an irreconcilable conflict in our caselaw,we could not simply pick one case to follow we would be required to call this case en banc.united states torre jimenez,cir citing atonio wards cove packing,cir en banc see also united states washington,cir en banc 
second,the portion of ngiraingas i on which guam relies is almost surely no longer binding precedent.although ngiraingas ii affirmed ngiraingas i holding that guam is not a person under,it did so on an entirely different rationale.see ngiraingas ii,at.the dissent in ngiraingas ii understood the majority opinion in ngiraingas ii as rejecting our conclusion that guam is outside the coverage of because it is an instrumentality of the federal government,observing that our interpretation was flatly inconsistent with the statute manifest intent that at least natural persons could be held liable for acts under color of territorial law.at brennan,dissenting see also ada,at.
finally,there is a third reason that the argument based on ngiraingas i does not avail guam.ngiraingas i analysis of suits is not inconsistent with ada.the portion of ngiraingas i on which guam relies is its analysis as to whether guam was a person,not as to whether its officials were.as to the officials sued in that case,we relied,as the supreme court noted,ngiraingas ii,at,on the established doctrine that a suit where the relief sought would affect the public treasury and public administration is deemed to be a suit against the government itself in holding that the individual defendants acting in their official capacities were not amenable to suit under section,ngiraingas i,at.in other words,ngiraingas i holding as to the defendants was explicitly predicated on the fact that the suit was one seeking damages.ada recognized the rule precluding suits for damages against officials in their official capacities,but also recognized the established,contrary principle applicable to suits seeking prospective relief.at.
in sum,the defendants in this case are persons within the meaning of for purposes of prospective relief.
guam next argues that none of the conduct at issue in this case was undertaken under color of territorial law.the organic act,which established guam territorial income tax,is,indeed,a federal statute passed by congress and signed by the president.see.section establishes,with some exceptions not important in this case,a guam tax code mirroring the provisions of the federal internal revenue code,another federal statute,and delegates enforcement and collection authority to guam officials.bank of,nat.trust sav.ass chaco,cir per curiam see also gumataotao,at sayre riddell,cir en banc.how,guam asks,could the implementation of two federal statutes constitute action under color of territorial law 
at the outset,we note some confusion regarding the extent to which the taxpayers rely on.in its briefing,guam asserted that both the claims in this case were brought under the oral argument suggested confusion on this score.the complaint is quite clear,however,that only the equal protection claim is asserted under,and the district court was even clearer plaintiffs first cause of action is for violation of the organic act of guam,while plaintiffs second cause of action is under for violation of the equal protection clause.the district court was right only the equal protection claim was asserted under.
this clarification goes a long way towards answering guam argument.the equal protection claim brought under is that guam officials established an expedited refund process that was so standardless and arbitrary that it violated principles of equal protection.that process was not established by congress and signed by the president it is not mentioned in the organic act or the internal revenue code.it was created and administered entirely by guam officials.those officials used the power vested in them by virtue of their position as territorial officers to authorize or refuse refunds of tax overpayments collected by guam,held by guam,and obliged to be refunded by guam.no officer or agency of the federal government was involved at any point.
moreover,even if implementation of a federal law other than the constitution did in some sense underlay the claim,that circumstance would not alter our conclusion that the defendants acted under color of territorial law.the traditional definition of acting under color of state law requires that the defendant in a action have exercised power possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law.west atkins,quoting united states classic.thus,generally,a public employee acts under color of state law while acting in his official capacity or while exercising his responsibilities pursuant to state law.id.at see also naffe frey,cir.
we recognize that suits against territorial officers are importantly different from those against state officers.because territories are organized under federal law,see const.art.iv,cl,the actions of territorial officers are always,in some sense,under color of federal law.but that can not be,and is not,the sense in which that term is used in.section does not generally authorize challenges to actions taken under color of federal law,but it does,expressly,contemplate suits for violations of federal rights under color of territorial law.see district of columbia carter,noting that,with the exception of the territories,actions of the federal government and its officers are at least facially exempt from proscriptions emphasis added footnote omitted ada,at.so the same general principles apply to the interpretation of under color in cases involving territorial officers as apply in cases involving state officers.otherwise,the inclusion of territory in would be rendered largely nugatory.
all of the defendants in this case were territorial officers,accused of administering the expedited refund program while acting in their official capacities,or,in other words,using power possessed by virtue of territorial law and made possible only because they were clothed with the authority of territorial law.west,at internal quotation marks omitted for that reason,williams united states,on which guam relies,undercuts its argument.williams held that the defendant conduct was not undertaken under color of district of columbia law,even though he had arrested the plaintiff for a violation of district of columbia law,because he was a federal official,not a official and the district of columbia had no authority over him and thus did not exercise coercive power through him.id.at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.in other words,while the officer applied and effectuated district of columbia law,he was still,as a federal official,acting under color of federal law.here,the opposite is the case.the defendants are,and acted as,guam officers,not officers of the federal government,and so,even if they were effectuating federal law,they were acting under color of territorial law.
guam argues otherwise,maintaining that the particular contours of congress delegation to guam officials of authority to administer guam income tax,see chaco,at,indicates that the defendants were in reality acting under color of federal law.we see no basis for establishing a special limited to the relationship between congress and guam officials established by the tax provisions at issue here.our caselaw indicates that these defendants would be properly sued under even if the actions they took as territorial officers were required by federal law.

similarly here,even if the territorial officials had been obliged by federal law to institute the arbitrary expedited refund process which they most certainly were not they were empowered to act only in their capacities as territorial officers.thus,they were acting under territorial law within the meaning of 
we arrive,finally,at guam only challenge to the district court merits decisions guam challenges one particular provision of the district court permanent injunction,the requirement that guam pay refunds within six months once guam determines that the requests are valid and not subject to investigation or audit.according to guam,that requirement is grounded in a legal error.we review the district court legal conclusions underlying the injunction de novo and the scope of the injunction for abuse of discretion.armstrong brown,cir.
the district court stated in its conclusions of law that the provisions of the internal revenue code applicable on guam generally require defendants to pay refunds to taxpayers no later than six months after the filing date of the corresponding claims for refund,a legal conclusion guam contends is wrong.in support of the deadline in the injunction,the district court provided the following analysis under the internal revenue code,a taxpayer can sue to recover his or her refund six months after its filing date,a,signifying that a taxpayer right to a refund vests at that time,unless there is an offset,audit,or som
