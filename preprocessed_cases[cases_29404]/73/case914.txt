the internal revenue service irs validly issues a notice of deficiency nod to a partner in a partnership,when no proceeding is pending,no notice of final partnership administrative adjustment fpaa has been issued,and the normal statute of limitations in a has not expired.as such,we affirm the tax court denial of alex and liset meruelo husband and wife and hereinafter referred to as the meruelos or the petitioners motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.
background 
meruelo was the sole member of meruelo capital management,llc mcm.in,mcm was a limited liability company llc and a disregarded by default,because it did not file a form which allows an llc to elect to be treated as a corporation for that year.as such,mcm did not and was not required to file a federal tax return for.instead,all of mcm income and losses were to be reported on the meruelos joint tax returns.see reg.a,b ii.
in,mcm owned a percent interest in intervest financial llc intervest.intervest had five members.the members were treated as partners for income tax purposes.intervest was an entity subject to the unified audit and litigation procedures of the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of tefra.
on october,intervest filed a form,partnership return of income,for the tax year.the return listed mcm as a member,but it did not indicate that mcm was a llc,a disregarded entity,or that meruelo rather than mcm was actually intervest member for for federal tax purposes.the return reported a ordinary loss from foreign currency transactions.intervest issued mcm a schedule k,partner share of income,credits,deductions,for reporting an ordinary loss of as a passthrough item from intervest to mcm.
the meruelos filed a joint tax return for on october.the return claimed the loss as a passthrough item from mcm.the return did not identify intervest or that intervest was the source of the loss.the return indicated that mcm was a partnership.however,it did not indicate that mcm was a llc,a disregarded entity,or that meruelo was actually intervest member in for federal tax purposes.
before the expiration of the normal period of on assessing federal income tax attributable to a partnership item or an affected item see a,a,the irs attempted to secure an extension of the statute of limitations for the tax year from the meruelos through the execution of a form i,entitled consent to extend time to assess tax as well as tax attributable to items of a partnership.by securing the extension,the irs would have had additional time to investigate the circumstances behind the meruelos claimed loss and may have been able to avoid the problems at issue here.however,the meruelos refused to grant the extension.therefore,the irs issued a to the meruelos on october,a few days before the statute of limitations expired.the nod indicated that the meruelos were not entitled to the loss reported and owed a deficiency of in federal income tax and in penalties for the tax year.
the irs has never audited intervest return and has never notified intervest that it will begin an audit.further,the irs has never issued a notice of regarding intervest return.
procedural history 
on january,the meruelos timely mailed their tax court petition challenging the deficiency contained in the nod.see a.on october,the meruelos moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that the irs issued the nod prematurely,making it invalid.specifically,the meruelos argued that the nod was premature,because it related to affected items and was issued before the issuance of any notice of fpaa and before the irs had accepted as filed intervest tax return,no final resolution at the partnership level.alternatively,the meruelos argued that the items in the nod were not affected items.
on november,the irs moved to stay the proceedings in this case pending the resolution of a federal criminal investigation,the progress and outcome of which may have affected the disposition of this case.the irs stated that it had just learned that the meruelos reported loss was generated by a tax shelter related to a grand jury investigation and that investigation could affect or be affected by the criminal case.essentially,the irs indicated that a proceeding and adjustment may result as allowed by the extended period of limitations under c if fraud or other special circumstances were discovered in the criminal investigation 
the tax court granted the stay on november.the tax court ordered status reports every days.the irs status reports noted that an indictment had been filed and that the individual indicted was involved in the transactions at issue in this case,and said transactions are part of the criminal prosecution.
the meruelos moved to lift the stay on may,and the irs did not oppose.the tax court lifted the stay on july.
after the tax court lifted the stay,the irs filed an objection to the meruelos motion to dismiss.notably,the irs conceded that for purposes of the present deficiency proceeding,partnership items must be accepted as reported on the partnership return on june,the tax court denied the meruelos motion to dismiss in a published opinion.meruelo comm r,wl.the tax court held that the nod was valid and not premature and that the items were affected items in deciding that the nod was valid,the tax court reasoned as follows first,t he normal deficiency procedures apply to affected items,and a valid nod requires that any proceeding involving the related partnership be complete.meruelo,at.second,
w hen the commissioner or irs opts not to begin a proceeding or issue an fpaa within the normal period of limitations,the proceeding is considered complete when the commissioner accepts the partnership return as filed.whether the commissioner has accepted a partnership return as filed is a question of fact that turns in part on a finding of whether the commissioner opted to allow the normal period of limitations to expire without beginning a proceeding.
id.at citing roberts comm r,wl.finally,the tax court disagreed with the meruelos argument that the nod was invalid,based on the irs deferring any decision whether to audit intervest return until after the criminal proceedings.the tax court found 
where,as here,the commissioner has opted not to commence within the normal period of limitations a proceeding as to an entity subject to tefra,section a serves as no restriction on the time within that period when the commissioner may issue a nod related to the partnership.it therefore was proper for respondent to have issued the nod to petitioners just before the normal period of limitations was going to expire on petitioners and intervest taxable years.although respondent may have later considered during this proceeding the possibility of beginning a proceeding as to intervest on account of fraud or the like,any such consideration did not invalidate the nod.
id.at.thus,because the irs issued the nod during the normal limitations period applicable to tefra entities and had accepted intervest return as filed,the nod was valid and the tax court had jurisdiction.id.at.the meruelos moved for reconsideration,which was denied on september.
on september,the parties reached an agreement as to all issues,including the amount of tax owed by the meruelos,except the procedural and jurisdictional issues related to the tefra procedures and the validity of the nod.on october,the tax court entered its final decision.it held that the meruelos were liable for in additional income tax and in penalties.the meruelos filed a timely appeal on december.fed.a.
