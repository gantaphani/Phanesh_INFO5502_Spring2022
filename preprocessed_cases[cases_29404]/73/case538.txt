this case stems from kenton county enactment of a licensing ordinance that comprehensively regulates sexually oriented businesses within the county jurisdiction.a group of such businesses and their employees brought suit against the county under and,challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance.before the district court,the plaintiffs raised more than ten separate constitutional claims.both sides moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted to the county.
the plaintiffs raise four issues on appeal.first,they claim that the ordinance violates the first amendment by barring entertainers from entering areas of an establishment occupied by customers within one hour of the entertainers performing on stage.second,they claim that the ordinance violates their rights under the contracts clause of article i,of the constitution.third,they claim that the ordinance judicial review provisions do not satisfy the first amendment requirements.fourth,they claim that the ordinance license fees are excessive,taxes that violate the first amendment.following a brief recitation of the background of this case,we address each of the plaintiffs challenges in turn,relating details relevant to each respective challenge when appropriate.ultimately,we affirm the district court with respect to the first three challenges and we vacate and remand for further proceedings with respect to the fourth challenge.
on august,the county adopted ordinance,which regulated sexually oriented businesses within the county and required that such businesses,along with managers and entertainers working therein,obtain licenses from the county.the ordinance has been amended several times since this case began.the current version of the ordinance,is the subject of this appeal.
businesses must submit a required application,along with a fee of,in order to secure a license.should a business license be denied,the county refunds of that fee.the applicable fee for entertainers and managers is,none of which is refundable.the ordinance also creates a structure for administrative appeal of license denials and allows for judicial review of such denials in a manner provided by law.
two segments of the ordinance govern a licensee responsibilities.first,sections and,taken together,impose affirmative duties on licensees,breaches of which are punishable within the county administrative framework when a licensee fails to fulfill a duty,the county can levy a penalty.for some violations,the penalty is a.whereas an establishment or managerial licensee can accrue points over a period before its license is subject to revocation,an entertainer licensee is permitted only eighteen points within the same period.more serious violations,though,may result in suspension or revocation as a penalty instead of a.second,section defines certain courses of conduct as violations of chapter that constitute misdemeanor offenses under kentucky law.there is an overlap between conduct criminally punishable under section and conduct that could bring administrative sanction under sections and.section makes operating without a current,license a misdemeanor offense.

the plaintiffs first attack the ordinance commingling provision,which is found within the provisions of sections and.because the provision was intended to target prostitution,likely will have the effect of reducing prostitution,and leaves substantially intact the amount of protected speech,we reject this challenge.
the provision at issue reads as follows 
e ntertainers must maintain a minimum distance of five feet from areas on the establishment premises being occupied by customers,for a minimum of one hour after the entertainer appears on the establishment premises.this regulation is not intended to prohibit ingress or egress from the premises or entertainers sic use of the premises common restroom.it is intended to control illicit sexual contact and reduce the incidents of prostitution occurring in the establishments.regulating a reasonable delay between the times the entertainers appear and their commingling with customers is a narrowly tailored furtherance sic of this interest.penalty for violation license suspension after being cited for two such violations.
ja emphasis in original.because the ordinance forbids anyone from being anywhere but on stage,this provision requires that an entertainer stay at least five feet away from areas being occupied by customers for at least one hour after the entertainer performs on stage.managers,establishments,and entertainers each have an affirmative duty to ensure the enforcement of this provision.
although the plaintiffs contend that this provision should be subjected to strict scrutiny,it is that laws targeting the secondary effects of establishments are subject to intermediate scrutiny.in renton playtime theatres,the supreme court held that an ordinance designed to concentrate such establishments in one area of a city would be subject to intermediate scrutiny because it was a time,place,and manner restriction,d.although five members of the court abandoned the premise that such restrictions are sixteen years later in city of los angeles alameda books the court continued to apply intermediate scrutiny to laws targeting secondary effects,d applying intermediate scrutiny to an ordinance dispersing,rather than concentrating,adult businesses.in each of those cases,the court applied its earlier ruling in united states,which set intermediate scrutiny as the standard when the government regulates pursuant to an interest unrelated to speech content.see,d.
there is no doubt that prostitution constitutes a secondary effect within the meaning of the pertinent case law.see alameda books,at.because the county sought to target prostitution,intermediate scrutiny applies here.in order to survive such scrutiny,a regulation must meet three requirements.first,the government must have had the actual purpose of suppressing secondary effects when it enacted the ordinance.white river amusement pub,town of hartford,cir collecting cases.see also christy ann arbor,cir.second,the entity must have had a reasonable evidentiary basis for concluding that its regulation would have the desired effect.although not extraordinarily high,this evidentiary burden requires that the entity show that the evidence upon which it relied was reasonably believed to be relevant to the problem that the entity sought to address.renton,at.alameda books,at.plurality id.at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment.third,the ordinance must leave the quantity and accessibility of speech substantially intact.id.at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment id.at.as discussed,the necessary rationale for applying intermediate scrutiny is the promise that zoning ordinances like this one may reduce the costs of secondary effects without substantially reducing speech.although the alameda books plurality did not discuss the third requirement,justice kennedy expressly said that consideration of this issue was required for his concurrence in the judgment.justice kennedy opinion binds us on this point.see,ben bar,village of somerset,cir.
under the above test,the plaintiffs challenge to the commingling provision must fail.first,there is no doubt that the county sought to target prostitution.the county hired consultants to investigate the presence of prostitution and other harms in the adult establishments within the county.in enacting the ordinance,the county relied on the consultants observations,on evidence from other jurisdictions,and on reports of police officers.in the provision at issue,the county noted that the provision is intended to control illicit sexual contact and reduce the incidents of prostitution occurring in the establishments.the record demonstrates quite clearly that the county sought to target prostitution.
the county also adopted a regulation reasonably believed to be relevant to solving that problem.five women from one club in covington,kentucky,were charged with prostitution as the result of a police raid.at that club,the undercover officers who conducted the raid said they were solicited for sex within minutes of entering the club.in some clubs,the county consultants observed sexual activity occurring.in other clubs,they received reports from entertainers indicating that sexual activity had occurred in those clubs in the past.
the consultants observations about the establishments business model is also revealing.customers purchase drinks from an establishment bar.by purchasing a drink,a customer gains time with an entertainer.as the price of the drink increases,the amount of time increases.in some establishments,the privacy of a conversation location also varies directly with the drink cost.for more lengthy conversations,the price of a drink can exceed.dancers did confide to the consultants that oral sex has occurred during the more lengthy conversations.to be sure,the plaintiffs did put forward evidence that,at some clubs,buying a conversation was simply buying a conversation.however,we think it a reasonable conclusion on this record that there is an enhanced risk of prostitution when the purchase of a drink brings a longer and more secluded conversation between an adult entertainer and a customer.the direct and circumstantial evidence relied upon by the county demonstrates the existence of a prostitution problem under alameda books.
the county chosen course also seems reasonably designed to reduce prostitution.as noted,the provision at issue requires that an entertainer stay at least five feet away from areas being occupied by customers for at least one hour after the entertainer performs on stage.as applied to these clubs,it is clear that the provision at issue will substantially lessen the number of entertainers who can commingle with customers.the average number of entertainers employed on a given night at these clubs is between seven and eight.almost uniformly,the consultants found that the entertainers danced for sets lasting roughly six minutes.as a result,full performances by each entertainer,back to back,would take only to minutes.absent an alteration in that schedule,the restriction would leave few,if any,gaps during which entertainers who dance on a given night could commingle with customers.given that the prostitution problem in the county arises directly from the mingling of customers and entertainers during conversation drinks,we hold that the provision at issue is related directly to curbing prostitution.
to be sure,establishments may find ways to minimize the ordinance effect.dancers who do not dance on a particular night are free to mingle with customers.establishments might also lengthen entertainers performances or increase the length of breaks in between performances.such measures would create greater gaps during which entertainers who had performed could mingle with customers.nevertheless,the provision aggregate effect will be to reduce both the number of entertainers available to mingle and the amount of time they can spend mingling.we can not say that the ordinance is not reasonably designed to further the county interest simply because those subject to it might try to lessen its impact.
we next examine whether the provision leaves quantity and accessibility of speech substantially intact.alameda books,at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment.in the context of the zoning ordinance at issue in alameda books,justice kennedy wrote if two adult businesses are under the same roof,an ordinance requiring them to separate will have one of two results one business will either move elsewhere or close.the city premise can not be the latter.it is true that cutting adult speech in half would probably reduce secondary effects proportionately.but again,a promised proportional reduction does not suffice.ibid.emphasis added.justice kennedy then voted to uphold the ordinance because d ispersing adult businesses is reasonably likely to cause a substantial reduction in secondary effects while reducing speech very little.id.at.
we conclude that this provision leaves the quantity and accessibility of protected speech substantially intact for several reasons.first,it restricts only those dancers performing on a particular night and restricts them only for an hour after their performances.those not performing on a particular night may mingle as they wish those performing may mingle after the time bar passes.second,entertainers may still remain five feet from areas that customers occupy,so the provision permits entertainers who performed within the previous hour to speak with customers,as long as the entertainers are in areas five feet away from areas accessible to customers.dls,city of chattanooga,cir upholding a buffer zone between customers and the stage.third,the provision does not bar communication itself.instead,it bans physical presence in a particular area for a particular length of time.should entertainers within the club want to converse with patrons from five feet away,or via cellular phone,television,or electronic chat,this provision would serve as no bar to such conversation.nothing in the ordinance bars entertainers from arranging specific times to meet outside the adult establishments or,say,at the local coffee house.there,discussions of literature,public affairs,or eroticism may flow freely.we simply can not conclude that this provision,which regulates commingling only in a particular place and only for a limited period of time,substantially impairs the quantity and accessibility of protected speech.
in other words,the county has targeted contact between adult entertainers and customers that created a risk of prostitution.it has done so in a manner that substantially preserves the ability of those affected to communicate with each other,although in a less physical way than they could previously.we thus conclude that the provision satisfies intermediate scrutiny.
the plaintiffs next contend that the whole ordinance violates the contracts clause of article i,section,of the constitution because it impairs a settlement agreement between some of the plaintiffs and the city of covington.we reject this claim.
the contracts clause says that no state shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts.const.art.i,cl.there are three factors that courts must consider when evaluating contracts clause claims.the first factor is whether the complainant has shown a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship.linton by arnold comm r of health env t,cir citing energy reserves group,kansas power light,d.because this factor suffices to dispose of the plaintiffs contracts clause claim,we decline to address the other two.
establishing a substantial impairment requires showing that there is a contractual relationship that a change in law impairs that contractual relationship and that the impairment is substantial.motors romein,d.although no agreement is in the record of this case,we will assume that a settlement agreement exists and that it constitutes a contract under the clause,mascio pub.employees ret,cir holding that a pension agreement between an individual and ohio was protected by the contracts clause.
the plaintiffs can not show that any settlement agreement between themselves and the city of covington was substantially impaired.first,the background kentucky law makes clear that valid county ordinances trump city ordinances in cases like this one.the county clearly had the power both to enact this ordinance and to make the ordinance effective within covington borders.under the kentucky constitution,only when a power is expressly granted to a county government may it exercise that power within an incorporated city.fiscal court of jefferson county city of louisville,striking down under the kentucky constitution broad delegation of power to county fiscal courts but upholding express delegations because the general assembly expressly has delegated the power to regulate adult businesses to county fiscal courts,see z,the county had the power to enact an ordinance that would operate within covington borders.under kentucky law,when a county enacts a valid ordinance that prescribes penalties,it will trump a less strict city ordinance.there is no question that the ordinance at issue here creates a system of administrative and criminal penalties.and,as noted above,the ordinance is a valid exercise of county power.accordingly,it trumps any less strict covington ordinance.
second,that background rule must have been incorporated into any agreement between covington and the plaintiffs.the agreement at issue here did not involve two parties,each with full power to contract.instead,one party,covington,could have agreed only to exercise its own power in a particular way.no reasonable party could have expected covington to sign away power that it did not possess,and which belonged to a legally superior entity.energy reserves,at.quoting veix sixth ward loan ass n.because the plaintiffs never reasonably could have interpreted covington assent as being broader than covington power under kentucky law,we hold that there could have been no substantial impairment of the settlement agreement.
moreover,when an industry is highly regulated,it is unlikely that an exercise of general legislative power will constitute a substantial impairment of contract rights.energy reserves,at quoting veix,at.see also hudson water mccarter.there are few industries more highly regulated than adult entertainment.that much is illustrated by the history of such regulation in covington and kenton county,by the provisions of kentucky law expressly granting to counties and cities the power to regulate adult businesses,see cities z counties,and by the multitude of other municipal ordinances covered by the consultants report.
thus,given the background and the highly regulated status of the industry,the plaintiffs can not reasonably have expected their agreement with covington to bar future regulation by the county.accordingly,we reject the plaintiffs contracts clause claim.
the plaintiffs next challenge the ordinance review provisions,claiming that they do not provide sufficiently prompt judicial review.because they regulate protected speech,the review provisions must satisfy applicable jurisprudence,which contains two requirements.dallas,d.first,any restraint prior to judicial review can be imposed only for a specified brief period during which the status quo must be maintained.ibid.second,there must be prompt judicial review of the licensor decision,which includes a prompt judicial decision.ibid.see also city of littleton gifts,d.
as long as the regulation at issue applies reasonably objective,nondiscretionary criteria and does not seek to censor content,a state ordinary court procedures will satisfy the second requirement.bronco entm t charter twp.of van buren,cir citing gifts,at.however,i f a licensing scheme involves the application of subjective standards,rules requiring a speedy judicial decision may be necessary.ibid.see also deja vu of cincinnati,union twp.bd.of,cir noting that licensing ordinances applying subjective standards,such as the ordinance at issue in freedman maryland,d,necessitate that strict time limits be placed on judicial review citing gifts,at,and quoting.
addressing plaintiffs challenges requires a detailed explication of the ordinance review provisions,which are both administrative and judicial in nature.the administrative provisions may be split into three parts review upon the rejection of an application for a new or renewed license,see review upon the assessment of points by the license inspector,see and review upon the institution of a penalty,such as suspension or revocation,for a violation of any of the ordinance provisions,see each of those administrative sections contains a clause providing for judicial review in a manner provided by law.see f,h,d.section contains a provision that applies to license denials,suspensions,and revocations,as well as a provision that stays the effect of orders denying,suspending,or revoking license during the pendency of judicial review.section,which creates misdemeanor penalties,is not relevant to the outcome of this appeal.we address the relevant review procedures in turn.
upon the filing of a complete application for a new license or for the renewal of an existing license,the county issues a temporary license that remains in effect pending administrative and judicial review.if an application for a new or renewal license is denied,the applicant may request a hearing for reconsideration,which must be filed within ten days of the receipt of the initial decision.there is no obligation to pursue an administrative appeal judicial review in a manner provided by law may be sought immediately.if an appeal is filed,a hearing must be scheduled for within fifteen calendar days from the date of filing.once a hearing is held,a decision must be issued within ten days.
with regard to hearings under section,the ordinance contains the following review procedures.the ordinance requires notification by mail of the license inspector and then permits an appeal of that assessment to a hearing officer within twenty days.the hearing officer must then schedule a hearing that must occur within ten days of the receipt of the appeal.within ten days of the hearing,the hearing officer must issue a decision setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law.once again,there is no obligation to pursue an administrative appeal before seeking judicial review.any license holder aggrieved by the decision of either the license inspector or the hearing officer to assess points may seek judicial review in a manner provided by law.
with regard to administrative violation of chapter hearings,the following process is in place.whenever the license inspector receives verified or otherwise credible information that a violation of chapter has occurred the hearing officer is obligated by section to hold a hearing the subject of the hearing is whether the licensee has violated any of the provisions listed in this chapter.the hearing officer must set the date for the hearing for some date between ten and thirty days after the inspector receipt of the information indicating that a violation occurred.if the hearing officer finds a violation,he may suspend or revoke the license issued under this chapter,or in the case of a renewal application,he may refuse to renew such license.the hearing officer must issue findings of fact and conclusions of law and an order wherein the hearing officer may dismiss the complaint,or suspend or revoke a license or permit previously issued,or renew or refuse to renew a license previously issued.any license holder aggrieved by the decision of the hearing officer to suspend such license may seek judicial review in a manner provided by law.
in addition to the specific judicial review provisions noted above,the ordinance also contains another provision,section,that guarantees judicial review to challenge the denial of a new or renewal license application or the suspension or revocation of an existing license.section contains two clauses a clause and a clause.the former says that,f ollowing a final decision by the license inspector or hearing officer denying,suspending or revoking a license,or disapproving the renewal application for a license,such licensee or applicant may seek judicial review in a manner provided by law.the latter says that the license inspector or hearing officer shall stay enforcement of the ordinance pending the final disposition of proceedings for judicial review,during which time the status quo of the applicant will be maintained.emphasis added.
we note that there is an ambiguity in section section refers only to preserving the status quo for an applicant,not for a licensee.it is unlikely that this textual distinction was an oversight because the judicial review clause of the same section by its terms applies to a licensee or applicant.were the ordinance to countenance the suspension or revocation of a license during the pendency of judicial review,it would raise serious constitutional problems.see bronco entm t,at t he status quo must be maintained during that period and during the course of any judicial review.citing deja vu of nashville,metro.gov t of nashville,cir.section need not be read to countenance suspension or revocation pending judicial review,however,and the ordinance is at least ambiguous on this point.section provides for judicial review of various adverse administrative actions,including denials,suspensions,and revocations,and,immediately following that provision,states the license inspector or hearing officer shall stay enforcement of the ordinance pending the final disposition of proceedings for judicial review if enforcement of the ordinance is stayed pending a final judicial decision on the validity of a suspension or revocation,no licenses will be suspended or revoked pending judicial review.the text following this provision during which time the status quo of the applicant will be maintained need not be read to limit stays of enforcement effectively,maintenance of the status quo for license holders only to applicants,given all of the text preceding that clause.
at oral argument,moreover,the county attorney expressed his understanding that licensees subject to suspension or revocation could operate during the pendency of both administrative and judicial review.accordingly,given the ordinance textual ambiguity and the county proffer at oral argument,we read section to permit both licensees and applicants to operate during the pendency of administrative and judicial proceedings.
we now address the plaintiffs challenges to the ordinance provisions.at each step of the ordinance administrative process,applicants and licensees may seek judicial review in a manner provided by law.although we acknowledge the vagueness of that language,we conclude that the ordinance language points to judicial review pursuant to,which provides generally for judicial review of administrative action.in nightclubs,city of paducah,cir,this court dealt with a city ordinance that provided for judicial review in any court of competent jurisdiction.we read that language to apply.ibid.based on nightclubs,we conclude in this case that judicial review in a manner provided by law under the county ordinance refers to review under.
the plaintiffs allege that review under fails to satisfy the requirements of the first amendment because it creates infinite delays in the process of reaching a judicial determination.for this proposition,they refer to nightclubs,which held that was unconstitutional as applied to an licensing ordinance.in nightclubs,the court noted that such judicial review would not in any way limit the time for furnishing transcripts,conducting a court hearing,or rendering a judicial decision.at citing east brooks books city of memphis,cir.
nightclubs would be controlling here,but for the supreme court decision in gifts.there,the court held that ordinary judicial review practices and procedures satisfy the requirement of prompt judicial review as long as the licensing regulation applies reasonably objective,nondiscretionary criteria unrelated to the content of the expressive materials that an adult business may sell or display.gifts,at.the plaintiffs do not argue that the ordinance at issue employs anything other than such criteria.hence,the central holding of ordinary judicial review does not satisfy the promptness requirement because it does not offer a specific time limit for a no longer controlling.as our court recently noted when considering a tennessee statute,ordinary judicial review generally will satisfy gifts.see odle decatur county,cir.moreover,unlike the ordinance at issue in nightclubs,the ordinance at issue here preserves the status quo in every relevant respect,including during the pendency of a license application and during the various penalty proceedings.following gifts,the nightclubs court holding that unconstitutionally delays a prompt judicial decision must be overruled.
nevertheless,the plaintiffs raise two further arguments seeking to distinguish the judicial review at issue here from that upheld in gifts.first,they claim that review by the courts under generally is entirely discretionary,and thus violates this court decision in deja vu of nashville,at,because it fails to guarantee a final judicial adjudication on the merits,as required under freedman first safeguard.br.of appellants,at.second,they claim that the standard of review provided by fails to satisfy the first amendment because it is of limited scope and confined to limited issues.ibid.we conclude that the plaintiffs characterizations of kentucky law on these points are inaccurate and that these arguments lack merit.
first,with respect to discretionary review,the plaintiffs correctly characterize the review that provides in cases.in taxpayer action group madison county board of elections,the kentucky court of appeals noted that the decision under to review an administrative determination rests within the discretion of kentucky trial courts.however,the kentucky supreme court has held specifically that procedural due process requires judicial review of administrative action where constitutional rights are involved.see hilltop basic,county of boone,citing morris city of catlettsburg.
constitutional rights are involved in every action challenging a licensor refusal to permit a private party to exercise his first amendment rights.that is,where what is being administered is a prior restraint on free speech,constitutional rights are obviously implicated.thus,kentucky law itself alleviates the plaintiffs concerns.precedent indicates that judicial review under of the county licensing determinations will be accorded as a matter of right.hilltop,at morris,at.under gifts,we must presume that kentucky courts are aware of the constitutional need to avoid undue delay result ing in the unconstitutional suppression of protected speech.at.thus,the plaintiffs allegation that the review at issue here is discretionary is not borne out by kentucky law.
second,with respect to the standard of review,the plaintiffs argue that a claimant challenging administrative action under can only prevail if the administrative determination was arbitrary and capricious.again,with regard to administrative law cases,the plaintiffs are correct.see,trimble fiscal court snyder.see also lab.of am.holdings rudolph,public contracts quoting am.beauty homes louisville jefferson county planning zoning comm n,reis campbell county bd.of,teacher termination special fund francis,worker compensation thomas cabinet,adoption.the plaintiffs also are correct that such judicial review is deferential to administrative determinations,permitting a challenge to succeed only if the administrative action violated procedural due process or if the evidence in the challenger favor was so compelling as to mandate a finding in his favor.snyder,at.
however,as in the context of deciding whether judicial review is discretionary in cases involving constitutional issues,the kentucky courts have determined that a different,more searching,review applies in first amendment cases.the kentucky supreme court has adopted the following as a principle of kentucky law w hen a regulatory body,directly or indirectly,undertakes the responsibility of restricting constitutionally protected speech,which includes lawyer advertising,it must resolve any doubts in favor of permitting the constitutionally protected speech.in re appeal of hughes coleman,in hughes coleman,the court conducted a searching review of the determinations of the attorney advertising commission and the board of governors of the kentucky bar association to disapprove certain attorney advertisements.the court rendered judgment for the attorneys,reversing the kentucky bar association judgment,because,in part,the association decisions reflect ed,arguably,a resolution of the doubt against allowing the constitutionally protected speech.ibid.
hughes coleman demonstrates that kentucky courts will not follow the deferential judicial review that the plaintiffs claim they will impose.rather,kentucky courts will resolve reasonable doubts in favor of protecting speech.ibid.in other words,kentucky courts will not apply the standard of review that applies to decisions about zoning,snyder,or public contracting,lab,at,to administrative decisions restricting first amendment rights.the heightened standard of review applied by the kentucky courts accords with the longstanding principle that courts should apply searching review to actions impinging on the freedom of speech.see speiser randall,d t he line between speech unconditionally guaranteed and speech which may legitimately be regulated,suppressed,or punished is finely drawn.the separation of legitimate from illegitimate speech calls for sensitive tools.mcnary haitian refugee,d applying de novo rather than standard to constitutional claims in the context of a particular immigration program wilson bredesen,cir noting that tennessee law subjects administrative determinations to de novo review when constitutional questions are at issue citing state robinson.
accordingly,we conclude that the plaintiffs efforts to distinguish review under from the judicial review upheld by the supreme court in gifts are unpersuasive.we expressly overrule nightclubs on this issue and hold that,as a general matter,satisfies the first amendment.
the plaintiffs next claim that the fees imposed by the ordinance are unconstitutionally large.the ordinance imposes a license fee for establishments,of which is refunded if the license application is denied,and a fee for managers and entertainers.the district court,although noting that the information provided by defendant in support of the expenses it would incur in administering the ordinance could have been broken out and calculated in more exacting detail,nevertheless upheld the licensing fees because they were reasonably related to the expenses incident to the administration of the ordinance.
we note from the outset that the supreme court has never enunciated a comprehensive approach to the constitutionality of a licensing fee charged for the exercise of first amendment rights.thus,we begin from general principles.when the government bears its own costs,one can expect or at least hope for a degree of frugality.elected officials are often loath to incur prodigal or superfluous expenditures because such waste puts them at an electoral risk.commensurately,the government decision to incur expenditures is generally immune from legal challenge by the taxpayers.hein freedom from religion,d.but once the government transfers the cost of a measure to private parties via a licensing fee,that measure becomes subject to private challenge.states generally may enforce their laws as vigorously,or with as much laxity,as they like.a state may choose to call out the national guard to enforce an ordinance,but leaving licensees with the check would go too far.
over the course of several decades,the supreme court decided three cases that influence our approach here cox new hampshire,murdock pennsylvania,and forsyth county nationalist movement,d.we believe that those cases require a consideration in secondary effects cases of three questions whether the fee maximum amount will deter the exercise of first amendment rights,whether the measures the cost of which the county seeks to transfer to licensees via its fee structures are narrowly tailored means of advancing the county interest in curbing secondary effects,and whether the county cost estimates for those measures are reasonable.because the district court did not undertake this inquiry,and because genuine issues of material fact are present on these issues,we vacate the district court summary judgment on this issue and remand for further proceedings.
we now turn to those three supreme court decisions.first,in cox,at,the court upheld a law that required a permit before a group could parade down a public road.the permit fee ranged from a nominal amount to,depending on the public expense or policing cost associated with the event.ibid.the court held that the cox fee was constitutionally permissible,noting that there is nothing contrary to the constitution in the charge of a fee that is not a revenue tax,but one to meet the expense incident to the administration of the act and to the maintenance of public order in the matter licensed.ibid.
second,in murdock,at,the court struck down a flat fee charged by a city to all canvassers and solicitors.the court held that where a license fee is fixed in amount and unrelated to the scope of the activities of petitioners or to their realized revenue,it is unconstitutional.the court reached that result based on its conclusion that the flat fee was not imposed as a regulatory measure to defray the expenses of policing the activities in question.that is,because it forced some licensees to bear more than the costs they would impose,the fee violated the first amendment because it required potential licensees to purchase,through a license fee or a license tax,the privilege freely granted by the constitution.ibid.
third,in forsyth county,the court sharply limited cox and struck down a discretionary fee with a high upper limit.the ordinance at issue provided that applicants for permits had to pay in advance an amount,not to exceed,to be determined by the licensor and designed to meet the expense incident to the administration of the ordinance and to the maintenance of public order in the matter licensed.ibid.the ordinance language was lifted almost from the ordinance at issue in cox,at.
nevertheless,the court struck it down and made clear that a licensing fee regulation must meet two requirements.first,it must not delegate overly broad licensing discretion to a government official.second,any permit scheme controlling the time,place,and manner of speech must not be based on the content of the message,must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest,and must leave open ample alternatives for communication.at.in its holding the court sharply limited cox,noting that nothing in cox suggested that the new hampshire statute permitted a licensing fee to vary based on content,such as whether the speech would provoke a hostile reaction from its audience.
our court has distilled two general principles from cox,murdock,and forsyth county.first,an ordinance requiring a person to pay a license or permit fee before he can engage in a constitutionally protected activity does not violate the constitution so long as the purpose of charging the fee is limited to defraying expenses occurred in furtherance of a legitimate state interest.northeast ohio coalition for the homeless city of cleveland,cir.in other words,in order to transfer the cost of a government measure to a licensee,the measure itself must be legitimate.northeast ohio coalition,at.thus,the measure must not be based on the content of the message,must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest,and must leave open ample alternatives for communication.forsyth county,at.second,the court also acknowledged that forsyth county created some limit on the amount the government could charge,based on the potential for a fee to deter protected speech.northeast ohio coalition,at.
we believe that such a framework adequately guards against the dangers discussed by the court in forsyth county and murdock.first,even if each individual cost assessed reflects a narrowly tailored means of advancing the government interest,there is still a chance that the fee total amount will significantly deter constitutionally protected speech.forsyth county,at.second,upon close consideration,we believe that the dangers highlighted by the murdock court are subsumed within the forsyth county analysis.if the government measures are narrowly tailored means of advancing the government interests,and if the government estimates of the costs of those measures are reasonable,then transferring those costs to licensees can not be a facially unconstitutional tax under murdock.
applying those principles here,we must remand this case for further proceedings because there are genuine issues of material fact that preclude granting summary judgment to the county.a ny permit scheme controlling the time,place,and manner of speech must not be based on the content of the message,must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest,and must not be so high as to deter constitutionally protected speech.forsyth county,at.the county bears the burden of showing that its measures are narrowly tailored.see fly fish,city of cocoa beach,cir.see also nightclubs,at kentucky restaurant concepts city of louisville,d,bright lights city of newport.
we acknowledge that the regime at issue is not,alameda books,at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment,which raises the possibility that the county is penalizing an unpopular subset of its businesses.there is evidence in the record,for example,that the county charges an operational tax that can not exceed on businesses outside the industry.according to the county license inspector,those other businesses and some of their employees must file applications similar to those required from establishments.the licensing regime for those businesses also incorporates administrative hearings and.were we confronting a regulation that targeted the press,such differential treatment could only be justified if the county could point to some special characteristic of the press that would warrant the higher fee.minneapolis star tribune.comm r of revenue,d d ifferential treatment,unless justified by some special characteristic of the press,suggests that the goal of the regulation is not unrelated to suppression of expression,and such a goal is presumptively unconstitutional.
however,the supreme court has repeatedly reviewed secondary effects ordinances under the degree of scrutiny applicable to regulations.alameda books,at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment.see also renton,at.that is so despite the government clear differential treatment of adult businesses in those cases.the differential treatment is justified,the court has held,by the peculiar secondary effects associated with adult businesses.as long as the fee differential is justified by the secondary effects of adult businesses,we will treat it as for forsyth county purposes.
thus,the forsyth county inquiry collapses into the question of narrow tailoring.the county choices with regard to the costs it will pass on to licensees are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored to serve the significant governmental interest in combating secondary effects.forsyth county,at.we can not conclude that there was no genuine issue of material fact on this issue,and so we must vacate the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings.
the county has given various estimates of the hours its officials will spend enforcing this ordinance.the licensing inspector,the county says,will spend forty hours attending hearings,forty hours conducting initial inspections of the five establishments in the county,twenty hours conducting inspections,and hours listening to general questions and complaints.in his deposition,though,the county treasurer said that we have no background to go on as far as how many hearings that would happen or whatever of point assessments.
the county also has incorporated various possibly questionable costs into the fee calculation,including a cost of and a yearly amount exceeding for the purchase and maintenance of database software,customized for the licensing regime.we can not say,without more evidence about the necessity of incurring this cost,that a measure whose goal could be reached either by using the county current computer system or by employing less costly database software is narrowly tailored to advance the county interests.
similarly,the county has factored in a per applicant cost for a background check.it is clear from the record that the city of covington also conducts background checks as part of its licensing regime.a covington license,though,costs only for any applicant,including for establishments.the county has not explained why its background checks,which it concedes are more expensive than those conducted by covington,will further the county interest any more than measures.
we also note two other points.first,many of the costs incorporated by the county will be paid only once or will decrease substantially in amount by the second year.over time,the county revenues may exceed the costs imposed by the licensees in terms of administering the regime.in that scenario,it would be clear that the fees would not reflect narrowly tailored means of reducing secondary effects.second,the county retention of from denied establishment applicants must reflect only the costs the county incurs in the license denial.although we make no determinations in this regard,there is a genuine issue as to whether the retention of that amount might far exceed the costs of processing and denying those applications.
the district court failed to undertake any tailoring inquiry in this case,as required by forsyth county,at.after briefly engaging in that inquiry ourselves,we can not conclude that there was no genuine issue of material fact on this issue.we stress that we have not made any findings about whether the county properly assessed these costs against its licensees.however,the district court must,on remand,engage in an inquiry that determines whether the measures,whose costs were passed on to licensees,were narrowly tailored to advance its interests in combating secondary effects.forsyth county,at.
without engaging in further inquiry on this issue,we instruct the district court on remand to determine whether the fee total amount will deter the exercise of first amendment rights whether the measures associated with the fee amount are narrowly tailored means of advancing the county interests and whether the county cost estimates for those narrowly tailored measures are reasonable.
based on the foregoing,we affirm in part and vacate in part the judgment of the district court,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
kenton county ordinance purports to address the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments by imposing a licensing scheme that requires businesses to apply for business licenses,pay annual fees,and abide by restrictions on the conduct of employees.i respectfully dissent from the majority opinion because ordinance is insufficiently to survive intermediate scrutiny,fails to provide prompt judicial review,and imposes excessive licensing fees.however,i agree with the majority analysis of the contracts clause issue in section iv of its opinion.
kenton county ordinance attempts to target the negative secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments such as prostitution and other illicit sexual conduct by requiring entertainers to maintain a minimum distance of five feet from areas on the establishment premises being occupied by customers,for a minimum of one hour after the entertainer appears on the establishment premises.ordinance a.
a restriction on adult entertainment that affects protected expression and is designed to decrease the secondary effects of such expression is subject to intermediate scrutiny.city of los angeles alameda books,d kennedy,concurring the intermediate scrutiny test is governed by united states,d.according to the court,a government regulation is sufficiently justified if it is within the constitutional power of the government if it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest if the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression and if the incidental restriction on alleged first amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest,at.accord hamilton bogarts,michigan,cir.although legislatures may regulate adult entertainment establishments in order to address secondary effects such as crime and prostitution,this regulation must be crafted so that the incidental restriction on alleged first amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest,at.
ordinance falls far short of this objective.the ordinance forbids entertainers from coming within five feet of areas for an hour after the entertainers performances.as the majority notes,this provision would leave few,if any,gaps during which entertainers who dance on a given night could commingle with customers.op.at.at the very least it would reduce both the number of entertainers available to mingle and the amount of time they can spend mingling.op.at.one can not credibly assert that this stringent restriction leaves the quantity and accessibility of speech substantially intact.alameda books,at.kennedy,concurring.
as a result of the ordinance restrictions,patrons and entertainers are prohibited not only from physical contact or solicitation of prostitution,but also from conversation on any subject.although the county has a legitimate interest in decreasing the incidence of prostitution,it may not go to any length to achieve this goal.regardless of whether entertainers and customers wish to continue to develop the erotic fantasy created on stage or whether they wish to talk about an upcoming political election or any other topic,ordinance severely limits their ability to do so.an ordinance that restricts interaction to such a degree that the most viable options for conversation between patrons and entertainers include communication via cellular phone,television,or electronic chat,op.at,clearly decreases and substantially interferes with the quantity and accessibility of speech.
the contradictions between the majority discussion of the effectiveness of the regulation and its discussion of the requirement reveal the fatal weakness in ordinance regulatory scheme.although the language of the ordinance highlights the need to prevent illicit sexual contact and prostitution,the regulation purports to attempt to decrease the incidence of prostitution by decreasing the opportunities for entertainers and customers to talk to each other,a drafter of the ordinance discussing the desire to decrease the opportunity for negotiations.thus,the potential effectiveness of this ordinance in deterring prostitution is directly proportional to its effectiveness at foreclosing opportunities for speech.the supreme court has expressly stated that a regulation that works in this way is unconstitutional.in his concurring opinion in alameda books,justice kennedy repeatedly emphasized that a city may not assert that it will reduce secondary effects by reducing speech in the same proportion.alameda books,at.kennedy,concurring.see id.at.kennedy,concurring it is no trick to reduce secondary effects by reducing speech or its audience but a city may not attack secondary effects indirectly by attacking speech.
a key factor in many of the ordinances that courts have determined to be narrowly tailored is the ordinances regulation of conduct and not the expression of the entertainers.for example,in city of erie pap,d,the supreme court upheld an ordinance that required dancers to wear pasties and while performing.the court noted that nudity itself was not the message being expressed in nude dance.pap,at.therefore,the court held that the restrictions contained in the ordinance were narrowly tailored to the government interest in public health and safety because t he ordinance regulates conduct,and any incidental impact on the expressive element of nude dancing is de minimis.id.at.
under some circumstances,this court has upheld statutes that require buffer zones between entertainers and patrons while the entertainers are dancing.in dls,city of chattanooga,cir,the ordinance at issue required dancers to remain six feet away from customers during performances.id.at.the buffer zone was found to be narrowly tailored to address disease transmission and violent crime concerns.id.at.however,the ordinance challenged in dls was found to be narrowly tailored because it addressed problems that occurred due to the near nudity of dancers during the performances,such as dances involving the licking of whipped cream from dancers bodies and the potentially violent propensities of men desiring to be in close proximity with dancers.id.these concerns are not at issue here since the entertainers are fully clothed while conversing with patrons.
the effect of buffer zones on the ability to converse with patrons was not discussed in dls however,it was at issue in deja vu of nashville,metropolitan government of nashville and davidson county,tennessee,cir,in which this court upheld an ordinance that imposed a buffer zone between entertainers and customers during performances.the plaintiffs contended that the ordinance violated entertainers first amendment rights by limiting conversation,but,despite its recognition of entertainers rights to free expressive association,the court upheld the buffer zone in part because customers and entertainers could still converse from a distance.id.at.the court held that the governmental interest in preventing prostitution and the spread of disease through transfer of bodily fluids justified the distance requirement between customers and performers.id.at.in the instant case,the provision restricting interaction goes farther than the regulation at issue in deja vu of nashville by requiring entertainers who are not dancing to remain five feet away from areas,well outside of a range within which normal conversation could occur.
as demonstrated by dls and deja vu of nashville,ordinances that impose a distance requirement while an entertainer is performing are on firmer constitutional ground than the ordinance at issue in this case.the ordinances previously upheld by this court targeted the real danger of immediate illicit sexual contact instead of targeting speech that purportedly could lead to future prostitution.the ordinances involved regulation of physical contact which is incidental to the entertainer erotic message.to the extent physical contact is a part of the erotic message,the ordinances attempted to narrowly tailor restrictions to the goal of preventing illicit sexual contact by prohibiting contact while nude or entertainers are dancing.however,ordinance effective prohibition on virtually all communication,including innocuous conversations,is not narrowly tailored to these goals.
ordinance licensing scheme acts as an unconstitutional prior restraint on protected speech.a prior restraint exists when the exercise of a first amendment right depends on the prior approval of public officials.deja vu of nashville,at.this court has recognized that any system of prior restraint carries a heavy presumption against its validity.id.at.licensing schemes in a city ordinance regulating sexually oriented businesses constitute a prior restraint that must incorporate at least the first two freedman maryland,d procedural safeguards in order to avoid being deemed an impermissible prior restraint.id.at.the first freedman safeguard requires the issuance of a license within a specified and reasonable time period during which the status quo is maintained.deja vu of cincinnati,union township board of trustees,cir en banc quoting city of dallas,d.the second freedman safeguard requires the assurance of a prompt final judicial decision when an applicant appeals an adverse licensing action.freedman,at.the supreme court has recently clarified that this second factor will in most cases be satisfied by allowing applicants to appeal license denials through a state ordinary judicial review process.city of littleton gifts,d.thus,in order for a licensing ordinance regulating sexually oriented businesses to be constitutional,it must ensure the maintenance of the status quo until a prompt final judicial decision is reached regarding an adverse licensing decision.deja vu of cincinnati,at.accord odle decatur county,tennessee,cir.
kenton county ordinance acts as an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech inasmuch as it does not allow for prompt judicial review of license suspensions and revocations and does not provide for the maintenance of the status quo in some cases.section governs hearings regarding violations of the ordinance.ordinance.these hearings are distinct from hearings governed by section to determine whether points should be assessed for ordinance violations.section provides that when a license inspector receives credible information regarding a violation of the ordinance she must schedule a hearing to occur ten to thirty day
