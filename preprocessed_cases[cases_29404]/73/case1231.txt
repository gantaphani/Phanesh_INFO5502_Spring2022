this consolidated appeal centers on the internal revenue service the service and the appropriate limits of its summons power.nero trading,llc,et,nero trading and ironwood trading,llc,et,ironwood trading collectively,appellants appeal the orders of the united states district court for the northern district of georgia re nero trading and the united states district court for the middle district of florida re ironwood trading.nero trading appeals the district court denial of its petition to quash administrative summonses issued by the service and ironwood trading appeals the district court denial of its like motion to quash and the court grant of the government motion to enforce the summonses.the appellants argue that the district courts erred in finding that the government made a prima facie showing that the summonses should be enforced under united states powell,d and contend that enforcement of the summonses constituted an abuse of the courts processes.because the district court did not explain its decision to not hold an evidentiary hearing in the nero trading case and did not sufficiently explain its rationale for denying nero trading motion to quash the summonses,we can not adequately review the district court decision in that case.as regards the ironwood trading case,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying ironwood motion to quash and granting the government motion to enforce the summonses.accordingly,because we conclude that nero trading has been deprived of a fair opportunity to substantiate its claims,we reverse and remand to the united states district court for the northern district of georgia for proceedings consistent with this opinion.we affirm the judgment of the united states district court for the middle district of florida.
