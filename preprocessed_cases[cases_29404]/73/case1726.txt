vinod patel,owner of the pacheco pass motel in gilroy,appeals from a judgment upholding the tax assessments imposed on the motel by the city of gilroy city.appellant contends that the ordinance that created and defined the tax is unconstitutionally vague.we disagree and affirm the judgment.
background 
in june,following an audit,the city notified appellant that he owed in delinquent taxes,interest and penalties,under the city transient occupancy tax ordinance,gilroy city code section,et.the ordinance requires the proprietor of each hotel to collect,along with the rent,a percent tax from each transient for the privilege of occupancy in the hotel.
after a hearing in august,the administrative services director director found that appellant owed the city,attributable to exemptions improperly claimed for the audit period ending december,plus interest.the director noted that the motel kept very erratic records,and that there were no written agreements for stays of more than days,which would have allowed an exemption from the tax.however,the director also noted that many of the hotel patrons had in fact stayed longer than days,as reflected in the room rental cards.the director further found that appellant had collected some tax,which he had included in the room rate without itemizing it on the rental cards.consequently,the director allowed an exemption from the tax for all of the patrons who appeared to have stayed more than consecutive days.the director declined to impose penalties,finding no intent to underreport taxes.
appellant filed a timely appeal to the gilroy city council,which conducted a hearing and upheld the director findings.in january,appellant,together with the owners of the leavesley inn filed a petition for a writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief.the petitioners alleged that the assessment violated their rights to due process and equal protection,and that the transient occupancy tax ordinance was facially void for vagueness.
in august the city filed its own complaint to recover the amounts found due by the director and the city council,along with the interest that had continued to accrue pursuant to a stipulation by the parties,the court ordered that the outcome of the proceedings against the city would control the outcome of the city collection lawsuit against appellant.as part of the stipulation the parties acknowledged that if the city prevailed,it would be entitled to recover the amount found due by the director,plus accrued interest.on june,the court entered judgment in favor of the city,finding the transient occupancy tax ordinance to be valid and constitutional.

the primary focus of the parties dispute is the definition of the terms used in section,hotel,occupancy,and transient.from to,the period for which appellant was audited,hotel was defined as any structure,or any portion of any structure,which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling,lodging or sleeping purposes,and includes any hotel,inn,tourist home or house,motel,studio hotel,bachelor hotel,lodging house,rooming house,apartment house,dormitory,public or private club,mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location,or other similar structure or portion thereof.former ord.the term occupancy refers to the use or possession,or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portions thereof,in any hotel for dwelling,lodging or sleeping purposes.and a transient is any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession,permit,right of access,license or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less,counting portions of calendar days as full days.any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy.in determining whether a person is a transient,uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this chapter may be considered.
appellant contends that these terms are hopelessly confusing because they are defined in a circular way and fail to distinguish temporary living arrangements from permanent ones.the definitions of hotel and occupancy,for example,are flawed because they contain the words dwelling and lodging,which imply either a temporary or a permanent situation.the day restriction in the definition of transient is inadequate to clarify the reach of the tax,appellant adds,because it suggests that a tenant of an apartment on a arrangement must pay the tax for the first days,a situation not intended by the lawmakers.it is only on day,when the renter pays the second month rent,that the owner may safely assume no tax is due.but the ordinance chose to use the words hotel and transient,which apparently was intended to exclude this hypothetical.
appellant argument is,as it expressly invokes a hypothetical scenario appellant himself does not face.whether a apartment rental would create confusion in the lessor and lessee is not the problem presented here.rather,here the only issue was whether appellant failed to collect tax for those guests who stayed in his motel for or fewer days without a written agreement for a longer stay.appellant can not prevail by simply suggesting hypothetical situations in which constitutional problems may arise.people sipe th,d,italics added.s peculation about possible vagueness in hypothetical situations not before the court will not support a facial attack on a statute when it is surely valid in the vast majority of its intended applications.hill colorado,supra,at.see also tobe city of santa ana cal th,d,unless law sweeps in substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct,facially vague law must be invalid in all respects and applications evangelatos superior court cal d,in facial vagueness challenge party must demonstrate vagueness in all of its applications,not just some instances of uncertainty or ambiguity american academy of pediatrics lungren cal th,d.
appellant maintains,however,that we must exercise stricter scrutiny of the ordinance because it prescribes criminal penalties for violations kolender lawson,fn,d where a statute imposes criminal penalties,the standard of certainty is higher.penal enactments are given greater scrutiny when their enforcement threatens the exercise of constitutional rights,such as freedom of expression or freedom of movement.chicago morales,supra,at.tobe city of santa ana,supra,cal th at,d.but where no such constitutional rights are at stake,it is the facts of the case and not hypothetical situations that determine the viability of a vagueness challenge.chapman united states,d people sipe,supra,th at,d.thus,if the conduct with which appellant is charged falls clearly within the bounds of the ordinance,appellant may not be heard to complain.tobe city of santa ana,supra,cal th at,d.
