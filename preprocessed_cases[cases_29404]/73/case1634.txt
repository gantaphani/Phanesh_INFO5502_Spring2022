the essential issue presented is whether a petition for writ of mandate under code of civil procedure section lies to challenge a property assessment.
we conclude a petition for writ of mandate does not lie in these circumstances,and even assuming the petition were construed as a complaint for refund of excess taxes paid,the complaint would be.therefore,the judgment is affirmed.
factual and procedural background 
in july,little purchased the subject real property,a apartment building at west adams boulevard in los angeles.
in,the assessor established the base year value for the property following the change of ownership in the amount of for land and for improvements 
first assessment appeal.
in,due to the depressed real estate market in los angeles,little filed an application to reduce the assessed value of the subject property 
little application challenged the assessor description of the property.the assessor records indicated the property consisted of two buildings,while little contended there was only a single building on the parcel.the hearing officer referred the matter for a field check.
the record reflects the property originally consisted of two buildings,a building as well as a building.the building was destroyed by fire prior to little purchase but the assessment roll had not been updated to reflect that change.
the hearing resulted in a reduction in value to,or per unit for units,which little accepted as reasonable.
second assessment appeal and subsequent reassessments.
in,little filed a second assessment appeal for a further reduction from the base value set in,based on a proposition 
in,the board reduced the assessed value to.
the value remained on the assessment roll,changing only insofar as the percent annual inflationary increases.by,the assessed value was.
in,the assessor issued a notice of assessed value change.the assessor restored the base year value of,together with the compounded inflation adjustment maximum annual adjustment of percent under,increasing the assessment to.
third assessment appeal.
on november,little filed an application for changed assessment seeking a return to the previous year valuation of.little contended the base year value of was incorrect,and that based on the size of the units,the correct base value was,pursuant to the assessment.
on august,after conducting an evidentiary hearing,the board made a finding of fact that the property consists of studio units having an average unit size of square feet.however,the board denied the application for changed assessment,ruling as follows 
the board finds that the application before it today is clearly an invalid application.the board finds that the base year was properly determined on the application in the amount of.therefore the application is denied as invalid.the state board of equalization rule states the board shall not reconsider or rehear an application or modify a decision unless state board of equalization rule d states once an application is filed,the base year value determined pursuant to that application shall be conclusively presumed to be the base year value for that assessment.italics added.
superior court proceedings.
on february,little filed a petition for writ of mandate,seeking to overturn the board denial of his third assessment appeal.a first amended petition followed on june.
the assessor demurred to the petition,contending mandamus did not lie because little had an adequate remedy at law,in the form of a complaint for refund of property taxes.the trial court overruled the demurrer.
thereafter,little and the assessor filed briefs,supported by declarations and exhibits.
in essence,little contended the assessor made a mistake.in setting the base year value,he erroneously determined that the property consisted of units valued at each when in fact it contained studio units valued at each.in,the assessor admitted the mistake and agreed to correct the mistake.for the next six years the assessor acted as if the mistaken value had in fact been corrected.when the assessor without warning in suddenly reverted to the incorrect value,little initiated proceedings before the board to have the mistake corrected.since the assessor mistake unquestionably did not involve the exercise of an assessor judgment as to value,the incorrect value was not subject to the limitations period governing judgmental errors in determinations,but was and here is subject to correction without limitation as to time under r t code section a.
by way of opposition,the assessor contended little was not entitled to mandamus because in,on the first assessment appeal,little put in issue the assessor understanding of the property,the board equalized the base year value of the property at and little accepted that determination.little can not now properly rely on a renewed challenge to the assessor understanding of the property at the time of the first assessment appeal,whether the property was more accurately described as consisting of studio apartments or,as a basis for setting aside the board base year value assessment.
trial court ruling.
on november,the matter came on for hearing.the trial court denied the petition.the statement of decision provides in pertinent part 
little is entitled to mandamus pursuant to section if the assessor determination of a base year value did not involve the exercise of his judgment as to value.if the determination did involve the exercise of judgment as to value,the statute of limitations expired in,four years after the first assessment appeal,and little is barred from bringing this action.little argues that the assessor base year value determination of on does not involve the assessor exercise of judgment as to value rather it a purely objective assessment verifiable upon inspection.the court is not persuaded.whether the units were or studio,the value determination in entailed the exercise of discretion thus,the assessor and the board considered,among other things,whether the property consisted of one building or two,units or units,in determining the value of the property and setting the base value of.judgment was involved in the value determination.furthermore,even if one were to believe that for several years little had no idea whether he bought units or studios,he had constructive notice of the true facts.little had four years to complain about the issue.
the trial court further found that with respect to the board decision on the second assessment appeal,little contends the assessor made the recommendation after inspecting the property,and stipulated at that juncture that the property contained studio units of square feet each,and that each unit had a value of per unit for a total of.respondent,on the other hand,contends that the value change in solely resulted from a proposition assessment.hence,the base year value never changed,and was simply temporarily replaced by the proposition assessment of.little application for changed assessment the second assessment appeal was based on two grounds,one a challenge,the second a proposition change.evidence in the records shows that the assessor recommended the value based on little proposition claim,and not on the change in base value claim.aside from little own declaration,nothing in the records indicates the contrary.thus,even if the statute of limitations did not bar little,he has not established that the is the proper base year value.
on december,little filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment denying his petition for writ of mandate.
contentions 
little contends he was entitled to proceed under his petition for writ of mandate he is entitled to have the corrected base year value entered on the assessment roll because the incorrect base year value did not involve the as
