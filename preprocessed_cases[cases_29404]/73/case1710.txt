under the community redevelopment law health et crl,local redevelopment agencies receive tax increment funds generated by redevelopment projects they have initiated.the crl requires that percent of such tax increment funds be placed in a low and moderate income housing fund housing fund.the legislature has directed that,in general,housing fund proceeds should be used to increase,improve or preserve a community supply of housing affordable to,low and individuals and families.
in this case an unincorporated association,plaintiff and appellant hogar dulce hogar hogar,challenged the manner in which defendant and appellant community development commission of the city of escondido the agency calculated payment to its housing fund.in its complaint,hogar alleged that in calculating the amount it paid into the housing fund,the agency had unlawfully deducted from its gross tax increment receipts amounts it had agreed to pay the county of san diego the county and then paid the housing fund percent of its net tax increment receipts.hogar asserted the crl requires that percent of gross tax increment funds be placed in the housing fund as opposed to the percent of net tax increment funds the agency paid into the fund.
the trial court agreed with hogar.the trial court found that under the crl the agency was required to pay the fund percent of its gross,rather than net,tax increment receipts.the trial court ordered that the agency reimburse the fund the amounts which should have been paid into the fund from the time the fund was established in until the date of the judgment.
we reverse in part.under the applicable statute of limitations,the trial court could only order reimbursement of the housing fund for a period commencing three years before hogar complaint was filed.contrary to the trial court finding,the discovery rule by which the statute of limitations is tolled until the plaintiff discovers the factual basis for a cause of action,has no application in this case.where,as here,no individual has asserted any individual loss,and a public entity violation of a statutory duty has been disclosed in public hearings and public records,the discovery rule is not necessary to protect the plaintiff substantial rights.moreover,use of the discovery rule in this context could unduly disrupt a public entity ability to operate with fiscal certainty.
background 
the agency 
the agency became operative under section in.under the crl,at the time a redevelopment area is designated,the amount of property tax revenues which are then being collected in the redevelopment area and remitted to various governmental agencies is frozen and the redevelopment agency is permitted to retain solely for redevelopment purposes any increase or increment in property taxes realized thereafter.craig city of poway th,d.as is often the case,at the time it adopted its redevelopment plan,the agency entered into an agreement with the county under which the agency agreed it would remit to the county a portion of the tax increment it realized under the terms of the tax sharing agreement,the county,which collected the taxes,retained a percentage of the gross tax increment and remitted the balance to the agency.
as we have noted,the crl requires that redevelopment agencies set aside percent of their tax increment receipts in a housing fund devoted to increasing the availability of housing in redeveloped areas,subd.a.with respect to the agency housing fund obligations,the tax sharing agreement provided the amounts retained by the county shall not constitute a receipt of tax increment by the agency for the purposes of health and safety code section.the agreement further provided that in the event a final court judgment determined this aspect of the agreement was invalid,any future amounts payable to the county under this agreement shall be reduced by twenty percent.reimbursement of payments already made to the county shall be limited to those not barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
in light of its agreement with the county,the agency only paid its housing fund percent of the net amount it received from the county rather than percent of the gross amount of tax increment receipts to which it was entitled.in the agency was advised by its own counsel that this method of calculating the amount due the housing fund was improper and that it was required to pay the housing fund percent of the gross tax increment.the underfunding issue was discussed at a public meeting and the agency contacted the county in an effort to amend the tax sharing agreement.the county responded by stating that in the event the validity of the tax sharing agreement was challenged,the county would assist the agency in defending the agreement.however,the county was unwilling to amend the tax sharing agreement or otherwise provide the agency any relief from the provisions of the agreement.
in the agency sued the county and argued provisions of the tax sharing agreement had to be modified so the agency could comply with provisions of section,subdivision a.in the trial court in that action granted the county motion for summary judgment.the court found that the agency,notwithstanding its obligations under the crl,was bound by its agreement with the county until a third party had obtained a judgment invalidating it.because no third party had challenged the agreement,the trial court found the agency was not entitled to any relief.
in the state controller notified the agency its method of calculating its contribution to the housing fund was improper.in the face of the state controller notice,in the county agreed to amend the tax sharing agreement so the agency would be able to pay the housing fund percent of its gross tax increment receipts.
hogar was formed as an unincorporated nonprofit association in.its members are residents of the agency.in hogar filed a petition for a writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory relief.hogar alleged the agency and defendant and appellant the city of escondido the city had failed to make proper contributions to its housing fund,had used the fund improperly and had failed to make required annual reports about the fund.eventually,the trial court certified the action as a class action brought on behalf of and residents of the city.the agency and the city answered the petition and complaint and brought a against the county.
the matter was heard by the trial court,which rendered a statement of decision.as indicated,the trial court found the agency initial calculation of the amounts due the housing fund was improper and ordered the agency to reimburse the housing fund the amounts due under the crl from through the time of trial.the parties agree that,with interest,this amounted to million.the trial court denied hogar remaining claims for relief.because no final judgment had been entered,the trial court found that the agency was not yet entitled to any indemnity under the terms of the tax sharing agreement.
judgment was entered on the statement of decision.
hogar filed a timely notice of appeal and the agency filed a.
discussion 
for purposes of clarity,we first take up the agency standing and statute of limitations contentions.
hogar standing 
initially,the agency challenges hogar standing to obtain relief with respect to acts which occurred before it came into existence in.the agency argues that with respect to funds which should have been paid into the housing fund before hogar was created,hogar has no beneficial interest.we reject this aspect of the agency.
