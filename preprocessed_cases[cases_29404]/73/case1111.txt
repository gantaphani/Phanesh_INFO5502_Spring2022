jay bishop and gene cardenaz collectively appellants appeal their convictions and sentences for one count of conspiring to defraud the internal revenue service irs,in violation of,and two counts each of attempted income tax evasion,in violation of.we affirm.
the main issue at trial,and on appeal,is whether the appellants conduct was willful.each argues that the district court erred in relying on an objective standard for good faith in determining willfulness,and that the district court improperly excluded as hearsay proffered testimony about willfulness.
bishop also claims that his waiver of a jury trial was invalid.cardenaz claims that the district court erred in denying his untimely faretta motion to complete the trial as his own counsel,and in calculating the tax loss for sentencing purposes.
factual background 
bishop and cardenaz,along with robin mcpherson collectively defendants,who is not a party to this appeal,were employed as managers by american wireless cable systems.in,american wireless sold its marketing business to defendants for.defendants,as equal shareholders,formed an called continental wireless cable to take over american wireless marketing business.as an,all of continentals profits and losses passed through to the shareholders without first being taxed to the corporation.it was undisputed at trial that some commonly designate interim payments to their shareholders as officer loans until the end of an accounting period because the classification of profit and loss is uncertain,an s corporation shareholder who is at personal risk may apply the corporate loss against compensation on his or her personal tax return,and an shareholder may carry losses forward or back to other tax years as may be appropriate under existing regulations.
continental employed douglass lambrose,an accountant who died before trial,to maintain its books and records.lambrose prepared continental general ledger until the summer of,when continental accounting staff took over.in addition,lambrose handled tax matters for continental,including preparation of continental income tax return.the return reported a loss of.continental disbursements to the defendants were entered as officer loans and thus the tax returns showed no corporate officer compensation.continental did not file tax returns for or.
lambrose office also prepared bishop and cardenaz individual tax returns.the individual returns reported that defendants were at risk in continental,and each claimed a loss from continental operations.the loss was also carried back to previous years.
charles guskey started working as an accountant for continental in september.he was generally responsible for accounting relating to the contracts with various partnerships,while tamberly halkola did most of the other accounting and bookkeeping tasks as instructed by the appellants.per defendants instructions,halkola continued to enter the payments continental made to them as officer loans,although she questioned the lack of documentation.
appellants sold their marketing business in february of and formed a general partnership,diversified wireless cable,which received the proceeds from the sale.later in,the sec filed a complaint and obtained a tro against continental,freezing its operations,its bank accounts,and the bank accounts of its principals.continental was placed in involuntary receivership,and a receiver was appointed to wind down the affairs of the business.continental was ordered to prepare an accounting of all funds received and disbursed.guskey undertook this accounting,but did not complete it.consequently,the receiver was unable to prepare and file continental tax returns for.
several years later,defendants were indicted for tax evasion,and their bench trial commenced on october,and lasted until november.the central issue during the trial was whether the officer loans made by continental to its shareholders were reportable income to the shareholders during the tax years in question,and,if so,whether the appellants knew that the loans included reportable income.
the government relied on testimony that cardenaz referred to the money he received from continental as income and said he intended to pay taxes on the income later on.the government argued that the officer loans were in fact distributions of income,and noted that there were no promissory notes indicating an obligation to repay,no repayment schedules,no personal collateral,and no authorization for loans in corporate minutes.guskey testified that he told the defendants at various times that they should show some of the officer loans as income.cardenaz claimed that his inability to obtain copies of continental tax returns made it impossible for him to file his own tax returns for and.bishop did not testify.
appellants main defense was that they could not have been willful in treating the money they received from continental as officer loans because they relied on the professional advice of their accountant,lambrose.the death of lambrose in created difficulty for both sides in presenting their case.both sides made efforts to obtain testimony relevant to willfulness,but relied mainly on circumstantial evidence.the district court returned guilty verdicts on all counts and imposed guideline sentences of thirty months in custody,as well as financial penalties.
willfulness 
proof of willfulness is essential to support a conviction under,which makes it a felony to willfully attempt in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this title or the payment thereof see united states bishop,d.willfulness is also an element of conspiracy to defraud the united states the government must prove the existence of an agreement to accomplish an illegal objective,an overt act in furtherance of the objectives of the conspiracy,and intent on the part of the conspirators to agree,as well as to defraud the united states.united states crooks,cir.
more generally,willfulness is an element in all criminal tax cases.willfulness,as construed by our prior decisions in criminal tax cases,requires the government to prove that the law imposed a duty on the defendant,that the defendant knew of this duty,and that he voluntarily and intentionally violated that duty.cheek united states,d.
c arrying this burden requires negating a defendant claim of ignorance of the law or a claim that because of a misunderstanding of the law,he had a belief that he was not violating any of the provisions of the tax law.this is so because one can not be aware that the law imposes a duty upon him and yet be ignorant of it,misunderstand the law,or believe that the duty does not exist.
id.at.the rationale behind the subjective standard in cheek is to avoid criminalizing unwitting violations of the complicated and extensive tax laws.
good faith reliance on a qualified accountant has long been a defense to willfulness in cases of tax fraud and evasion.see united states claiborne,cir,abrogated on other grounds,ross oklahoma,d.a defendant may rebut the government proof of willfulness by establishing good faith reliance on a qualified accountant after full disclosure of information.id.this court has not had occasion to establish the boundaries of this defense.
the trial court considered cases from other circuits dealing with the good faith reliance on an accountant defense after cheek.the fifth and the seventh circuits have not modified the requirement that the taxpayer hand over all relevant information to the accountant.see united states becker,cir united states masat,cir.the government cites these cases in support of the proposition that requiring full disclosure to establish good faith reliance on professional advice is not inconsistent with cheek.the government argues that if a defendant did not make full disclosure to his accountant,then he probably did not act in good faith.the appellants protest that the subjective good faith standard of cheek should modify the full disclosure traditionally required for a successful good faith reliance on professional advice defense.we agree with the fifth and the seventh circuits.
we hold that cheek does not change the rule that a defendant claiming good faith reliance on the advice of a tax professional must have made full disclosure of all relevant information to that professional.the district court applied the correct legal standard when it found the reliance defense inapplicable to defendants because they did not make full disclosures.the district court wrote,in its memorandum decision 
i have taken into consideration the defense in this case of good faith.that is the good faith that the defendants have alleged that they had in relying upon the advice of the accountant.and i find that the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt willfulness despite the defendants defense 
and i want to make clear the defendants have no burden in this case.they did not have the burden of showing good faith.the government had the burden of showing willfulness,and the government has met that burden of showing willfulness beyond a reasonable doubt despite the evidence that the defendants each presented regarding good faith reliance 
the term willfully,i find,is what has been referred to in cheek united states 
willfulness as construed by our prior decisions in criminal tax cases requires the government to prove that the law imposed a duty on the defendant and that the defendant knew of this duty and that he voluntarily and intentionally violated that duty.
and i find that that occurred as to each of the defendants in this case.
and i find that as far as good faith is concerned,the professional advice that the defendants of all,they did follow it accurately,but most importantly i find that the advice that the professionals gave to the defendants was advice that was not based on complete information that should have been given to them by the defendants.
and i find that because of the defendants failure to disclose all pertinent facts to the professionals,that the defense is inapplicable or was not sufficient to overcome the government proof in this case.and that government has proved,i find,based on all the evidence in the case and all the reasonable inferences that i can draw from the evidence that the defendants all acted willfully despite the fact that they did have professionals that they appeared to rely on.
emphasis added.appellants do not challenge the district court factual findings that they failed to disclose all relevant information to the tax professionals on whose advice they claim to have relied.because the district court applied the correct legal standard to defendants good faith reliance on a professional defense,and appellants do not challenge the factual findings underlying the decision,the district court did not err on this issue.
the hearsay objections 
hearsay is defined as a statement,other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing,offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.c.the district court decision to exclude evidence as hearsay is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.united states ortega,cir.n ot every hearsay error amounts to a constitutional violation.at a minimum,a defendant must demonstrate that the excluded evidence was important to his defense.united states,cir.however,e rror can not be harmless where it prevents the defendant from providing an evidentiary basis for his defense.united states saenz,cir.
the question is whether the trial court exclusion of certain testimony prevented the defendants from putting on their defense.because of lambrose death,testimony about the advice he gave defendants was hard to come by.when alleged error is predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence,we make a inquiry whether a substantial right of the party was affected and when the ruling is one excluding evidence,whether the substance of the evidence was made known to the court by offer or was apparent from the context within which questions were asked.a.in the absence of an offer of proof of what the testimony would have been,reversal will lie only where there is plain error.united states kupau,cir.
appellants assert that the district court improperly excluded items of testimony from the following four witnesses guskey,cardenaz,michelle bishop,and denise steffens.
a exclusion of guskey testimony 
although guskey was an accountant for continental,he did not prepare defendants individual tax returns,nor did he advise them about their individual tax returns,except to suggest that instead of classifying all the loans or all the monies received as loans,that a portion of that be picked up as income.defendants sought to have guskey testify about his conversations with them regarding tax advice defendants received from lambrose and how defendants were going to follow that advice.lambrose or an associate had prepared bishop and cardenaz individual tax returns in,as well as bishop return.defendants argued for introduction of this testimony on the grounds that it fell within the state of mind hearsay exception under federal rule of evidence,or it was,as it was proof of defendants good faith reliance on expert advice defense,and was not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted 
appellants first argument is that guskey excluded statements were offered to prove acts that the defendants intended to take in the to seek lambrose tax advice or to follow lambrose tax that as statements of intent they qualified as state of mind testimony,which is an exception to the rule against hearsay under federal rule of evidence.defendants also argue that the statements are excepted from hearsay as statements of motive,namely,that defendants intended to take future action because of lambrose advice.see.
appellants second argument is that guskey excluded statements were not hearsay at all,because they were not offered for the truth of the state of mind of taxpayers,but rather offered simply to prove that the defendants relied on professional advice.there was no real controversy during the trial that the defendants had been receiving tax advice from their accountant,but there was also no evidence about the substance of that advice.defense counsel was apparently trying to obtain proof of what lambrose had told the defendants through guskey testimony.guskey knew only what,if anything,he had been told by lambrose.
on,the government elicited from guskey that he had suggested to the defendants that some portion of the officer loans should be reclassified and treated as income.the trial court also asked guskey some questions on this subject.on examination,defense counsel attempted to elicit testimony from guskey to clarify his advice about the officer loans.w as it your understanding from talking to lambrose and the principals that the officer loans indeed were going to convert to a compensation when the system transferred the government objected on the basis of hearsay,and the court sustained the objection,even when defense counsel pointed out that the government had opened the door with its questioning.
the government argues on appeal that any statements that defendants made to guskey about advice they received from lambrose and statements that guskey made to lambrose about that advice were excludable as statement s of memory or belief to prove the fact s remembered.both defendants and lambrose statements to guskey were statements of recollection of past events lambrose giving advice to defendants and were offered to prove the fact allegedly remembered that lambrose gave advice to defendants.statements of memory to prove the fact remembered are excluded from the state of mind exception in rule.
assuming arguendo that the government objection mischaracterized the question as eliciting hearsay,the real question is whether the defendants were denied the right to present their defense.the court refusal to hear the remembered advice was not prejudicial because there was no real dispute.the testimony,if allowed in,would have proved only that the defendants understood that the money received could be treated temporarily as a loan,and could be realized as income at some future time when it would then become taxable.however,at trial,there was no serious dispute about the validity of that accounting strategy.the dispute was whether the defendants intended to treat the officer loans as loans indefinitely in the hope that the taxability of the income as income would go away.on this point,the hearsay was irrelevant,and properly excluded on that account.
the government also argues that the district court did not improperly prevent guskey from testifying about statements he made to defendants about officer loans.the government cites various portions of guskey testimony on direct and cross examination,and notes that defendants fail to identify other relevant statements about which guskey was precluded from testifying.
furthermore,the government alleges that guskey was not defendants tax accountant or advisor,and that there was no evidence that defendants relied on guskey advice.even if guskey statements to defendants about the substance of lambrose alleged advice were wrongly excluded,the alleged error did not deprive them of their defense that they in good faith relied on professional advice.the court heard in several forms the defense that the defendants had acted on the advice that the officer loans were at least a temporary tax shelter.the question at trial was whether the defendants knew that at some time the loans would have to be realized and reported as income.
in their reply briefs,appellants contend that guskey excluded testimony did not relate solely to what the defendants had told him about lambrose past tax advice to defendants.appellants cite guskey proffer as support for their argument that guskey statements would have shown acts that defendants intended to take in the future in following lambrose tax advice.according to the proffer,defendants told guskey,that they would record the money that they were presently receiving as officer loans as income in the future.statements of intent to perform a future act are admissible state of mind testimony under rule.however,it was for the trier of fact to determine whether,in good faith,the defendants ever intended to report their receipts as income and pay the taxes on the income.the trier of fact found that the defendants did not in good faith intend to pay taxes on the money they received.
any error in excluding guskey testimony about what defendants told him they intended to do or why they intended to do it was harmless.such testimony may fall under the state of mind exception to the rule against hearsay,but it would still be,and duplicative of the defendants own testimony about their state of mind,if they chose to testify.the best evidence would be the defendant own testimony.in a jury trial,guskey seconding the defendants statements that they would record the money as income in the future intent and that they had been following tax advice of outside consultants motive might have been helpful to the defense.in a bench trial,however,such testimony would have been cumulative and virtually irrelevant.
we hold that the district court properly excluded as hearsay guskey testimony about what lambrose told him regarding the advice lambrose gave the defendants.contrary to appellants claim,such testimony was offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted lambrose gave defendants certain advice,and they relied on that advice.no one cares what lambrose told guskey except if it were true that lambrose gave the defendants certain advice.defendants did not testify about the advice lambrose had given them,nor did they testify that they had turned over all relevant information to lambrose about payments received by them.
also,guskey was properly prevented from testifying about what defendants told him lambrose had told them.that would have been hearsay,and only testimony about defendants state of mind at the time,a subject about which they could be examined and if they took the stand.but as a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered,as the government points out,it is not only hearsay,but irrelevant hearsay.
b exclusion of cardenaz testimony 
when cardenaz took the stand,his counsel asked him the following series of questions 
q and did lambrose give you tax planning advice as far as your compensation was concerned 
a yes.i got all of my tax planning advice from lambrose.
q and is that when the subject of officer loans came up 
q would you tell us what lambrose told you in that regard 
roetzel objection.hearsay.
the court sustained.
this was error.cardenaz had the right to tell the court his own version of the tax advice on which he claimed to have relied.he would,of course,be subject to on the nature of the information that he gave to lambrose.on appeal,cardenaz argues that lambrose advice was not introduced for its truth,but rather for its effect on cardenaz and his lack of willfulness to violate federal tax laws,and therefore was not hearsay.see.c.although the court erred by excluding cardenaz testimony,the error was harmless.by the time cardenaz testified about his reliance on lambrose unspecified advice,the court already knew about the undisputed evidence of several hundred thousands of dollars that had flowed into defendants bank accounts,of which lambrose had known nothing.in view of the overwhelming evidence of undisclosed sums received by the defendants without lambrose knowledge,whatever lambrose may have told cardenaz was irrelevant to defendants claim of good faith reliance on a professional.
the government contends that defendants did not inform the court that lambrose statements were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted.the government also asserts that cardenaz testimony would have been irrelevant with respect to bishop,because cardenaz state of mind upon hearing lambrose advice had no bearing upon bishop willfulness in violating the tax laws.
appellants argue that they were not required to inform the district court that the statements were not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted,because it was apparent from the context of cardenaz testimony why they were being offered,quoting united states chang,cir,and because the district court made it clear in excluding guskey testimony that it would not allow answers to questions about lambrose tax advice,heyne caruso,cir.
finally,appellants state that even if they did not make a proper proffer of cardenaz testimony at trial,they are still entitled to plain error review of the district court decision to exclude the evidence.they argue that a defendant raising a good faith reliance defense is entitled to offer evidence of what he relied upon,even over a timely hearsay objection.the proposition is correct in principle,but on this record,the trial court rejection of the evidence for the wrong reason does not entitle the appellants to a new trial.there was no evidence to support their claim that they relied on professional advice after full disclosure of relevant facts.there was no reversible error in dealing with cardenaz testimony.
c exclusion of michelle bishop testimony 
defense counsel asked the following series of question of michelle bishop,jay bishop wife 
q did you have any discussion with chuck guskey about your taxes 
a yes,i do recall casual conversations with guskey regarding the taxes,yes.
q and would you talk to him about your personal tax returns or tax liabilities 
a he did give advice regarding tax returns,yes.
q and to your recollection,what was he give you any advice about the taxes 
hendrickson objection.
the court she can answer that question.did he give you advice,yes or no 
the witness yes,he did.
q did he give you advice was bishop present at that time 
a yes,he was.
q and what advice did he give you about your returns 
hendrickson objection.
the court sustained.
warren your honor,it would go to state of mind.
the court sustained.
appellants argue that bishop should have been allowed to testify about the tax advice guskey gave her and her husband,because these statements were offered to show bishop good faith reliance on a tax professional.further,defendants claim that guskey statements were not hearsay because they were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted.rather,these statements were evidence responsive to the government theory of the case that the defendant ignored professional advice,relevant for its effect on the hearer,
