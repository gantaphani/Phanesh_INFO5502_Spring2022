standards of review 
the district court granted summary judgment to the irs in appeal number and dismissed with prejudice the irs petition in appeal number.in dismissing with prejudice,the district court considered evidence beyond the pleadings,a procedure to which ford did not object,so we review the dismissal under the standard applicable to an entry of summary judgment.natural gas nash oil gas,cir.

the district court held that the certificates of assessments,payments,and other specified matters referred to herein as summary record assessment for the tax years,which were supplied to ford on form,satisfied the requirements of requiring the treasury secretary to furnish the taxpayer a copy of the record of the assessment upon request and setting forth the required contents of a summary record of assessment consequently,the district court determined that ford was not entitled to a writ of mandamus.further,because ford had received the information and notice to which he was entitled,the district court concluded that summary judgment in favor of the irs was appropriate.
a federal district court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the united states or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.to be entitled to issuance of a writ of mandamus,ford had to show that his right to the writ was clear and indisputable.in re antrobus,cir quotation omitted.
on appeal,ford contends that the district court erred in denying his petition for a writ of mandamus because he was never informed of the date of the assessment or the date the assessment was signed by an assessment officer there was no date of original assessment,even though he demanded assessments for ten years the summary record assessment did not contain any information as to what type of tax debt he has incurred or what kind of activity created this debt or at what point in time,aplt.opening br.at on the summary record assessment his name was typed in all capital letters and included his social security number,which he had relinquished the form provided to him was inadequate for the reasons stated in his arguments through and he was denied discovery and a hearing.although ford also challenges any suggestion that he did not file returns for and later years,this issue is not relevant to the district court holding that ford was not entitled to a writ of mandamus.
ford arguments are without merit.form contains the required information identification of the taxpayer,the character of the liability assessed,the taxable period,if applicable,and the amount of the assessment.see doc,at.it also includes the date of assessment,which is the date the summary record is signed by an assessment officer.courts,including this one,have held that a summary record assessment,provided on form,is presumptive proof of a valid assessment.march irs,cir quotation omitted collecting cases.ford has failed to produce any evidence on summary judgment to rebut this presumption.moreover,his argument that form is invalid because it reflects his social security number and shows his name in all capital letters is wholly frivolous.
finally,ford complains that the district court erred in granting summary judgment without first holding a hearing and without permitting him to engage in discovery.but he has made no showing that he requested additional time for discovery,nor has he identified any issues on appeal that were compromised by the court decision to base its ruling on the pleadings alone,ford i,at.accordingly,the district court judgment is affirmed.
in this appeal,ford challenges the district court determination that the case had concluded when ford complied with the irs summonses.five of ford issues on appeal were decided against him in ford i,at.they are there was no evidence that he failed to file tax returns that revenue officer pryor did not have delegated authority to issue the administrative summonses the form used for the summonses,form,is obsolete and has been outlawed by the irs ford was not in contempt of court and he was denied due process by the district court ruling without a hearing and by the district court denial of his motion to reconsider the order finding him in contempt of court.the holdings of ford i are law of the case and must be followed in this appeal.see weston harmatz,cir applying doctrine,stating holding of prior appeal must be followed by the appellate court in subsequent appeals.
ford remaining arguments are the district court for the district of new mexico lacked jurisdiction over him because his residence in new mexico was not within a federal enclave and therefore he did not receive remuneration from within the united states the summonses did not identify him because his name was typed in all capital letters and the district court had no jurisdiction over him because he made only a special appearance in court this court has previously rejected ford federal enclave argument,united states chisum,cir noting this argument was rejected many years ago in united states collins,cir,cert.denied,and we do so again here.similarly,we have held above that his argument pertaining to typing his name in all capital letters is wholly frivolous.
