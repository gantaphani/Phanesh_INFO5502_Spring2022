who are limited partners of madison recycling associates madison,a limited partnership organized under the laws of the state of new york,appeal from judgments of the tax court sustaining adjustments sought by the commissioner of the internal revenue service the commissioner or the irs to madison partnership return and holding them liable for taxes.the principal issue on appeal is whether the notice of final partnership administrative adjustment the fpaa was issued by the irs within the period of limitations for assessing any income tax,for madison taxable year,attributable to any partnership item or affected item.
background 
madison is a partnership subject to the provisions of the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of tefra,a,stat,et accordingly,the treatment of madison partnership items is determined at the partnership level.the parties are in agreement with respect to the adjustments made in the fpaa but disagree as to whether the fpaa was timely.
a.the partnership agreement 
madison agreement of limited partnership,executed on september,named richard roberts roberts as the general partner and tax matters partner the tmp roberts was madison sole general partner and its tmp in and at all other relevant times.under the partnership agreement,roberts,as general partner,had exclusive management power over the partnership.the agreement provides,in relevant part,that the general partner has the power and authority on behalf of the partnership 
a to execute,acknowledge and deliver any and all instruments necessary,convenient or advisable to effectuate any and all of the foregoing,including,without limitation,equipment purchase agreements,leases,licenses,security agreements,management consulting agreements and other agreements between the partnership and one or more third parties 
e to employ on behalf of the partnership agents and independent contractors,including,without limitation,employees,accountants,lawyers and appraisers,and to obtain such other assistance and services and to pay such remuneration therefor as the general partner deems proper 
j to file all necessary income and other tax returns and reports required to be filed by the partnership 
n to perform any other acts specifically authorized to the general partner by any other provision of this partnership agreement.in addition,in furtherance of the foregoing,the general partner shall possess all of the power and authority of a general partner in a partnership without limited partners as is provided under the laws of the state of new york 
under the partnership agreement,the limited partners have no right or authority to bind or act for the partnership.rather,upon admission to the partnership,each limited partner granted an irrevocable power of attorney to the general partner,giving roberts the authority to make,execute,and file,inter alia,a ny and all documents as may be deemed necessary or desirable by the general partner to carry out fully the provisions of the partnership agreement.
madison partnership tax return and related tax proceedings 
madison filed its form,partnership return of income,with the brookhaven service center in holtsville,new york,on march.the return was prepared by freedman,madison accountants,and signed by roberts as madison tmp and general partner.at that time,harris freedman freedman and shaye jacobson jacobson were partners in freedman.
in,the irs determined that roberts had violated by promoting and selling limited partnership interests in various plastics recycling partnerships,including madison.on august,the united states,pursuant to,filed a civil complaint in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts,seeking an injunction against roberts and other promoters of the partnerships.that same day,in accordance with a consent agreement signed by roberts on august,the court issued a permanent injunction against roberts and other promoters to prevent them from further organizing,promoting,or selling abusive tax shelters.roberts moved to paris,france,in,and apparently has continued to reside there ever since.in january,pursuant to,the irs assessed in civil penalties against roberts for his role in the promotion of the plastics recycling partnerships.
the irs began its examination of madison tax filings in.on april,roberts executed a form,power of attorney and declaration of representative,appointing freedman and jacobson as to represent madison before the irs.form stated that the tax matters of madison for which the were appointed were as follows

federal tax form number and all related irc matters 
year s or period s 
form also stated the attorney s or either of them are authorized,subject to revocation to receive confidential information and to perform any and all acts that the principal s can perform with respect to the above specified tax matters excluding the power to receive refund checks,and the power to sign the return unless specifically granted.
subsequently,jacobson,as for roberts,on two separate occasions signed a form,consent to extend the time to assess tax attributable to items of a partnership.the first consent,dated november,extended the period of limitations for assessments relating to madison tax year to june.the second,signed on august,extended the period to december.
sometime between august and october,while the examination of madison tax filings was ongoing,the irs initiated a criminal tax investigation of roberts.the special agent assigned to conduct the criminal investigation did not contact roberts,who was in france,during the investigation.on december,the investigation was discontinued without a recommendation that roberts be prosecuted for any offenses.
on december,the irs mailed the fpaa with respect to madison tax year to roberts,as tmp.the fpaa increased the partnership ordinary income by,and disallowed a business energy investment credit and an investment tax credit,each in the amount of million.roberts did not file a petition in the tax court for readjustment of the items set forth in the fpaa but,partners other than the tmp including the petitioners in the instant suit filed a timely petition for readjustment in 
petitioners subsequently sought summary judgment on the ground that the statute of limitations for the assessments had expired prior to the issuance of the fpaa.petitioners claimed that the consent forms signed by jacobson did not extend the period of limitations for the individual limited partners because jacobson was not specifically authorized to extend the period of limitations for them.this is so,they claimed,because the general partner did not file a written statement that met the requirements of reg.b t.the limited partners also contended that the power of attorney executed by roberts was not sufficient to authorize a representative to extend the period of limitations for the limited partners and,moreover,that form was ineffective because it had been altered by handwritten changes.
the tax court denied petitioners motion for summary judgment.the court held that the tmp had,under the terms of the partnership agreement,broad and exclusive powers over the business of the partnership,including the authority to enter into an agreement with the commissioner to extend the period of limitations under b b with respect to all the limited partners.the court reasoned that roberts therefore also had the authority to delegate this power to his to execute consents to extend the period of limitation with respect to all of madison partners.the court stated,moreover,that,even if roberts,as the tmp,had not delegated his authority to enter into the agreements with the irs,roberts,as the general partner,could and did delegate this authority to jacobson.
the tax court rejected petitioners argument that the consents were invalid because the specific procedures of reg.b it had not been met.the court explained that the language of the regulation is permissive and not mandatory,and that,in any event,noncompliance with th e regulation can not invalidate authority to extend the period of assessment granted by a partnership prior to the promulgation of the regulation.madison recycling assocs.comm r,cch,wl quoting cambridge research dev.group comm r,wl.the court,moreover,rejected petitioners claim that the consents were invalidated due to the alterations to form 
summary judgment having been denied,the case was scheduled for trial on february.on december,petitioners moved for a continuance,seeking to secure evidence relating to the irs criminal and civil investigations of roberts.petitioners claimed that the information was necessary to support their claim that the criminal investigation and the civil penalties imposed on roberts created a conflict of interest that had legally removed roberts authority to act,personally or through a representative,on behalf of the partnership.the commissioner filed an opposition,and the tax court denied petitioners motion 
following the trial,petitioners filed a motion to reopen the proceedings in order to allow them the opportunity to secure the complete administrative file on roberts,including materials relating to the irs criminal investigation.the commissioner again opposed petitioners motion,stating that petitioners could have obtained the information through a formal discovery request,but had failed to do so during the ten years since the filing of the partners petition for readjustment,and that all relevant materials subject to disclosure,including portions of the criminal investigation file,had been provided to petitioners the tax court denied petitioners motion.
the tax court subsequently issued an opinion,in which it held that the fpaa was timely because roberts was not operating under any conflict of interest that would have rendered ineffective the consents that he authorized.the court stated that there was nothing to suggest that roberts had a powerful incentive to ingratiate himself with the government.madison recycling assocs.comm r,cch,wl.this was the case,the court reasoned,particularly since there was no evidence that roberts or his was aware of the criminal tax investigation at the time the consents were signed.id.the tax court also disagreed with petitioners claim that the proceedings resulted in a conflict of interest.the court noted that those proceedings had been completed,and the penalties imposed,prior to jacobson execution of the consents.see id.this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review the tax court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.see a the united states courts of appeals shall review the decisions of the tax court in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions tried without a jury.see also callaway comm r,cir.in doing so,w e owe no deference to the tax court statutory interpretations,its relationship to us being that of a district court to a court of appeals,not that of an administrative agency to a court of appeals.callaway,at quoting exacto spring comm r,cir posner,baizer comm r,cir although a presumption exists that the tax court correctly applied the law,no special deference is given to the tax court decisions.
the period for assessing income tax attributable to any partnership item or affected item for a partnership taxable year does not expire until the date that is three years after the later of a the date on which the partnership actually files its information return for the taxable year in question,or b the last date for filing such return for such year without extensions.a.in this case,absent extensions,any fpaa for madison taxable year should have been issued by april.under tefra,however,the commissioner may receive an extension if,before the assessment period expires including any periods covered by a prior extension,he secures the consent of a each and every limited partner or b the partnership tmp or any other person authorized by the partnership in writing to enter into such an agreement.id.b.
the expiration of the period of limitation on assessment is an affirmative defense,and the party raising it must specifically plead it and carry the burden of proving its applicability.amesbury apartments,comm r,wl see chimblo comm r,cir.the taxpayer must,first,make a prima facie case establishing the filing of the partnership return,the expiration of the statutory period,and receipt or mailing of the notice after the running of the period.amesbury apartments,at.second,if this showing is made,the burden of production then shifts to the commissioner to show that the bar of the limitations period is not applicable.id.at see transpac drilling venture comm r,cir.third and finally,if the commissioner succeeds,the burden shifts back to the taxpayer to show that the alleged exception to the expiration of the limitations period is ineffective or otherwise inapplicable.amesbury apartments,at.the burden of persuasion,however,remains always with the taxpayer.id.
only the third step of the inquiry is implicated here as the tax court rightly determined,petitioners have not met their burden of showing that the consents executed by jacobson on behalf of roberts were invalid.as an initial matter,there is no question that roberts had the authority,both in his capacity as general partner and as the tmp,to enter into binding agreements with the irs on behalf of the partnership.and,through form,roberts,as the general partner for madison,appointed jacobson and freedman as for the partnership for purposes of filing the partnership returns and all related tax matters.as the tax court further noted,even if roberts,in his capacity as tmp,did not delegate his authority to enter into agreements with the irs,roberts could,under the terms of the partnership agreement and under new york law delegate his authority,as general partner,to bind the partnership and its partners to an extended limitations period.
since roberts could delegate his authority to consent to an extension of the limitations period,the only question that remains is whether he made an effective delegation in this case.section b of the internal revenue code provides,in relevant part,that the limitations period may be extended with respect to all partners by an agreement between the irs and the tmp or any other person authorized by the partnership in writing to enter into such an agreement.b b.the regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the tax year state that a partnership may authorize any person to extend the limitations period by filing a statement to that effect with the irs.the statement must meet four requirements it must provide that it is an authorization for a person other than the tmp to extend the assessment period with respect to all partners it must identify the partnership and the person being authorized by name,address,and taxpayer identification number it must specify the partnership year s for which the authorization is effective and it must be signed by all persons who are general partners at any time during the year s for which the authorization is effective.see regs.b 
the tax court,in denying petitioners motion for summary judgment,conceded that the specific procedures of the regulation were not met in this case.even if the form were to be deemed to be a statement under the regulation,there is no question that the form signed did not specifically provide that it was an authorization for a person other than the tmp to extend the assessment period with respect to all partners.rather,it gave freedman and jacobson broad powers relating generally to tax matters affecting the partnership.
even though the requirements of b t are not met,we find that the consents to extend the limitations period are valid.for,b t was not promulgated until,see b t,temporary proced.admin,well after the consents were executed.as the tax court has held,b t can not invalidate authority to extend the period of assessment granted by a partnership prior to the promulgation of the regulation.cambridge research dev.group,at see also stating that treasury regulations do not generally apply retroactively 
petitioners,relying on our decision in transpac drilling venture commissioner,cir,argue,however,that the consents are invalid because roberts and,thus,jacobson was laboring under a conflict of interest that legally removed his and his
