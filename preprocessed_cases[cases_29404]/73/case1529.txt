appellants united water conservation district and its board of directors collectively,district manage the groundwater resources in central ventura county.appellant city of san buenaventura city pumps groundwater from district territory and sells it to residential customers.the district collects a fee from groundwater pumpers,including the city,based on the volume of water they pump.the water code authorizes this fee,and requires the district to set different rates for different uses.groundwater extracted for purposes must be charged at three to five times the rate applicable to water used for agricultural purposes.
article xiii d of the california constitution governs fees upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership,including a user fee or charge for a property related service.cal,art.xiii d,subd.e.the city contends that the fees it pays the district violate article xiii d because they exceed the proportional cost of the service attributable to the parcel s of land from which the city pumps its water.id,subd.b.
the threshold question before us is whether the district groundwater extraction charges are and thus subject to article xiii d.the trial court,relying on pajaro valley water management agency amrhein th pajaro,concluded that they are.it found that the district pumping charges violated article xiii d because,pursuant to section,the district charged the city three times the rate it charged pumpers who extracted water for agricultural purposes.the court calculated the amount of overcharges in two separate years and issued writs of mandate requiring the district to refund these amounts to the city.the district appeals this decision,and the city,seeking declaratory relief that the trial court denied.
we conclude that the pumping fees paid by the city are not and that pajaro is distinguishable.we reject the city alternative arguments.the pumping fees are not taxes subject to the requirements of article xiii c.in addition,substantial evidence supports the trial court finding that the charges are valid regulatory fees because they are fair and reasonable,and do not exceed the district resource management costs.therefore,we reverse the judgment awarding relief to the city and direct the trial court to vacate its writs of mandate.otherwise,we affirm.
background 
and statutory background 
the district is organized and operated pursuant to the water conservation district law of codified as amended in et.its stated purpose is to manage,protect,conserve and enhance the water resources of the santa clara river,its tributaries and associated aquifers,in the most cost effective and environmentally balanced manner.to this end,the water code authorizes the district to conduct water resource investigations,acquire water and water rights,build facilities to store and recharge water,construct wells and pipelines for water deliveries,commence actions involving water rights and water use,prevent interference with or diminution of stream and river flows and their associated natural subterranean supply of water,and acquire and operate recreational facilities associated with dams and reservoirs.
the district covers approximately acres in central ventura county along the lower santa clara river valley and the oxnard plain.it comprises portions of several groundwater basins along the santa clara river,from upstream to downstream,the district includes most or all of the piru,fillmore,santa paula,oxnard forebay,oxnard plain,and mound basins.to the east of the oxnard plain basin,the district includes the west las posas basin and part of the pleasant valley basin.
groundwater recharge in these basins occurs naturally from rainfall as well as from river and stream flow infiltration and percolation.heavy demand for groundwater throughout the district from both agricultural and urban users causes overdraft,the amount by which extractions exceed natural water recharge.see.artificial recharge is critical to minimize the overdraft.the district replenishes the groundwater supply directly by spreading diverted river water over grounds at the northern part of the oxnard plain.in addition,the district augments groundwater indirectly by delivering water through pipelines to users near the coast who would otherwise attempt to meet their water needs by pumping it from the ground.despite these mitigation efforts,pumping in the district has exceeded recharge,both natural and artificial,by an average of per year over the past decade.this has led to problems of subsidence and salt water intrusion into aquifers along the coast.
the district water management activities and ongoing operating expenses require a means of funding.the district currently generates revenue from three main sources property taxes,water delivery charges,and,at issue here,pump charges.historically,the district relied solely on property taxes and water delivery charges.in,after it had become clear that these two sources were insufficient to support the district activities,particularly the reversal of overdraft and saline intrusion on the oxnard plain basin,the district began levying a charge on groundwater produced within its territory,pump charges.
the water code authorizes districts to impose pump charges in one or more zones within the district for the benefit of all who rely directly or indirectly upon the ground water supplies.zones may overlap and include the entire district,as does the district zone a,from which revenues are applied to a general fund used for conservation efforts.although the rates charged may vary from zone to zone,the rate within each zone must be fixed and uniform for each of two classes of use water used for agricultural purposes and water used for all other purposes.subject to exceptions not at issue here,section prohibits a district from equalizing the rates charged for the two types of use instead,the rate for use must be between three and five times that charged for agricultural use.the district has always set rates at the minimum ratio.
in the and early,the district planned and constructed the freeman diversion project freeman,a major improvement to its surface water diversion facilities along the santa clara river near saticoy.freeman permanently diverted water from the santa clara river to recharge groundwater in the oxnard plain basin in order to mitigate declining water levels and seawater intrusion.to help finance freeman,the district imposed groundwater pumping charges in the area that it determined received the recharge benefit from freeman.this area,designated as zone b,currently comprises the basins south of the santa clara river north bank,which include the oxnard plain basin,the oxnard forebay basin,the pleasant valley basin,and a portion of the west las posas basin.
the city overlies nearly the entire mound basin.at the time the district implemented the pumping charges to fund freeman,there was a lack of technical agreement as to the degree pumpers in the mound basin benefited from district activities.the city maintained that its wells would not benefit from freeman and filed several lawsuits seeking to invalidate both the new charges and the district general pump charges as they applied to city.the parties reached a settlement in.the agreement provided that the mound basin would be excluded from the charges and a separate billing zone zone c would be established covering the area of the oxnard plain basin north of the santa clara river.within zone c,municipal pumping rates for freeman were to equal agricultural rates on the oxnard plain south of the santa clara river.this was accomplished by setting the rates for zone c equal to a third of the rates for zone 
the settlement agreement expired at the end of the water year when the district paid off its construction loan for freeman.beginning in the water year,zone c was abolished and incorporated into zone b,resulting in substantially higher pumping rates for groundwater extractors in the former zone c.it is this increase in rates to which the city objects.
the constitutional overlay 
proposition was adopted by the electorate in.it added article xiii a to the california constitution,imposing important limitations upon the assessment and taxing powers of state and local governments.amador valley joint union high sch.dist.state bd.of equalization cal d.its principal provisions set maximum rates for ad valorem property taxes and for increases in a property assessed valuation.howard jarvis taxpayers city of riverside th.crucially,proposition restricted cities,counties,and special districts from imposing special taxes except by a vote of the district qualified electors.cal,art.xiii a.a special tax is a tax imposed for specific purposes,as opposed to a general tax,which is imposed for general governmental purposes,accord,cal,art.xiii c,subd.d.a local government use of certain types of special taxes ad valorem taxes on real property or a transaction tax or sales tax on the sale of real property was prohibited by proposition altogether.cal,art.xiii a.
a series of judicial decisions diminished proposition import by allowing local governments to generate revenue without a vote.see schmeer county of los angeles th,discussing several such cases.the watershed case was knox city of orland cal th,in which the california supreme court upheld,as a special assessment rather than a special tax,a city levy on real property to fund park maintenance.a special assessment under knox did not require voter approval at all.it was a compulsory charge placed by the state upon real property within a district,made under express legislative authority for defraying in whole or in part the expense of a permanent public improvement therein id.at.a special tax,while also levied for a specific purpose,differed from a special assessment in that it need not confer a special benefit upon the property assessed beyond that conferred generally.id.at,fn.omitted.the result was that proposition directive of limiting the taxes imposed on property owners,and in particular homeowners,was circumvented through an ever increasing proliferation of special assessments and other fees and charges that were not deemed taxes.see apartment of los angeles county,city of los angeles cal th,apartment association.
in response,the voters in approved proposition,which added articles xiii c and xiii d to the state constitution.see howard jarvis taxpayers city of riverside,supra,th at.proposition intent was to prohibit unratified exactions imposed on property owners as such.apartment association,supra,cal th at.it restricted local governments attempting to raise funds from property owners to four methods an ad valorem property tax,a special tax,an assessment,and a fee or charge the terms are interchangeable for services.cal,art.xiii d,howard jarvis taxpayers city of fresno th.proposition extended proposition limitations on ad valorem property taxes and special taxes by placing similar restrictions on assessments and fees and charges,including the vote requirement.howard jarvis city of riverside,supra,at.
while proposition sharply limited local governments ability to raise revenue from property owners without their consent,it did little to limit the imposition of regulatory fees imposed on a basis other than property ownership.fees classified as something other than taxes were not subject to proposition.for example,in sinclair paint state bd.of equalization cal th,the supreme court considered certain fees imposed on manufacturers that contributed to environmental lead contamination.sinclair paint concluded that the fees funding services for potential child victims of lead poisoning constituted bona fide regulatory fees,not taxes,because the legislature imposed the fees to mitigate the actual or anticipated adverse effects of the fee payers operations,and by law the amount of the fees must bear a reasonable relationship to those adverse effects.id.at.
largely in response to the sinclair paint decision,california voters approved proposition in to close the perceived loopholes in propositions and that had allowed a proliferation of regulatory fees imposed by the state without a vote of the legislature or imposed by local governments without the voters approval.schmeer county of los angeles,supra,th at.proposition broadened the constitutional definition of tax to include any levy,charge,or exaction of any kind imposed by the state or a local government,with specified exceptions.id.at,citing cal,art.xiii c,see,subd.f t his measure defines a tax for state and local purposes so that neither the legislature nor local governments can circumvent the restrictions in props.and on increasing taxes by simply defining new or expanded taxes as fees.
taken together,propositions,and create a classification system for measures promulgated by local government entities.any such measure is presumptively a tax.if the revenue is collected for a benefit or service see cal,art.xiii c,subds.e e,certain regulatory costs see id.subd.e,the use,lease,or purchase of government property see id.subd.e,judicial fines or penalties see id.subd.e,or property development charges see id.subd.e,it is not a tax.in addition,a measure is not a tax if under article xiii d it constitutes an assessment on real property or a fee or charge.see id.subd.e.a fee or charge is any levy other than an ad valorem tax,a special tax,or an assessment,imposed upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership,including a user fee or charge for a property related service.id.subd.e.
a measure classification determines the requirements to which it is subject.taxes can not be levied by a special purpose district such as the district for general revenue purposes.cal,art.xiii c,subd.a.a special purpose district can levy a tax for a specific purpose only with the approval of a majority of voters.id.subd.b.
in order to levy a fee or charge,a number of procedural and substantive requirements must be met.as relevant here,the fee must not exceed the proportional cost of the service attributable to the parcel.cal,art.xiii d,subd.b.although fees generally require approval by either a majority of the affected property owners or of the voters in the affected area,a fee for water service does not.id.subd.c.
a fee or charge for a benefit or service that is neither nor a tax must not exceed the reasonable costs to the local government of conferring the benefit,granting the privilege,or providing the service or product.cal,art.xiii c,subds.e e.t he manner in which those costs are allocated to a payor must bear a fair or reasonable relationship to the payor burdens on,or benefits received from,the governmental activity.id.subd.e.such a fee or charge normally does not require voter approval.
procedural background 
after freeman was paid off and the terms of the settlement were no longer in force,the district proposed to eliminate zone c and merge it with zone b,effectively tripling the city rate per of water.in addition,in both the and water years,the district proposed increasing the rate charged zone a.the district notified well owners of the proposed changes and invited them to comment.only a minority of the well owners,including the city,submitted protest letters.over the city objections,the district eliminated zone c and adopted the proposed rates.
the city filed two lawsuits,which were consolidated.it sought to overturn the district rate decisions through a writ of mandate code civ,an administrative mandate id,declaratory relief id,and a reverse validation action id.et.the california federation of farm bureaus,the ventura county farm bureau,and the pleasant valley county water district answered the validation cause of action and intervened in the others the district filed a seeking declaratory relief upholding its rate determinations in water year.
the city challenged the rates on two fronts.first,it asserted that the ratio between groundwater extraction rates for and agricultural uses constituted an illegal subsidy for agricultural users at the expense of other users.second,the city questioned the propriety of including in the zone a rates certain of the district expenses that the city contended either did not benefit it at all or benefitted it less than other groundwater users.the city maintained that these practices violated propositions,and,the common law of ratemaking,and section,subdivision a,of the government code san marcos legislation 
the trial court concluded that the groundwater extraction charges bore a reasonable relationship to the city burdens on and benefits from the regulatory activity and thus were valid regulatory fees rather than special taxes subject to proposition were property related fees and charges subject to article xiii d and were not,as property related fees,taxes under proposition.the court did not determine whether the san marcos legislation or the common law of utility applied to the extraction charges but found that,if they did,the charges did not exceed the reasonable cost to the district of providing the service and were reasonable,fair,and equitable.
analyzing the extraction charges under article xiii d,the trial court similarly found that the charges in the aggregate were reasonably proportional to the district costs and comported with proposition.however,it found that the ratio between rates for and agricultural water use mandated by section was unconstitutional under proposition for the water years in question because the district failed to present evidence that the rate differential reflected a cost differential.the court found that the city was entitled to a partial refund in the amount it paid in excess of a rate based upon the district average cost for all types of water usage.it issued writs of mandate awarding the city a partial refund of for and for,plus interest 
the district appeals the trial court conclusion that proposition applies to its groundwater extraction charges.in the alternative,it appeals the court ruling that to satisfy proposition,the district must present quantitative evidence justifying the rate disparity rather than pointing to qualitative differences between agricultural and other water users that impact the relative cost of conservation services.the district also appeals the court decision to award a partial refund rather than to remand to the district so that it can conduct further proceedings to determine whether the ratio is justified under article xiii finally,the district contends that the court refund calculation is incorrect.
the city,seeking declaratory relief.first,it asks us to hold that section rate ratio is facially unconstitutional.it also requests a declaration that the district must limit its groundwater extraction charges to the cost of providing services that have a demonstrated relationship to groundwater use.in addition,the city seeks a declaration that the district rate structure must take into account the scientific evidence regarding how different groundwater basins respond to specific recharge efforts rather than charging all groundwater users a uniform rate for conservation efforts.the city does not challenge the trial court findings that the groundwater extraction charges were not special taxes under proposition and did not violate the common law of utility ratemaking.
we conclude that the pump charges paid by the city are neither fees nor taxes,that they do not exceed the district reasonable costs of maintaining the groundwater supply,and that the district allocates those costs in a fair or reasonable relationship to the city burdens on this resource.accordingly,we reverse the judgment in favor of the city and direct the trial court to vacate its writs of mandate.

the pump fees are not property related fees or charges 
the trial court determined that it was constrained by pajaro and,as a result,concluded that the pump fees at issue constituted fees or charges.before explaining why pajaro is distinguishable,we must discuss the trio of supreme court cases underlying its holding apartment association richmond shasta community services district cal th richmond and bighorn desert view water agency verjil cal th bighorn.
supreme court authority regarding property related fees and charges 
apartment association involved a municipal housing code provision that imposed an annual fee on residential rental property owners to finance the city cost of inspection and enforcement.apartment association,supra,cal th at.the supreme court held that the fee was not subject to proposition because it was imposed on landlords not in their capacity as landowners,but in their capacity as business owners.id.at.it thus was more in the nature of a fee for a business license than a charge against property.ibid.
the court explained that regulatory fees and fees are not mutually exclusive.apartment association,supra,cal th at t he mere fact that a levy is regulatory or touches on business activities is not enough,by itself,to remove it from article xiii d scope.the hallmark of a fee is that it applies only to exactions levied solely by virtue of property ownership.id.at.in other words,proposition applies to exactions that are directly associated with property ownership and that burden landowners as landowners rather than on levies linked more indirectly to property ownership.id.at,first italics added.
richmond again considered the scope of a fee or charge.the district that supplied water to residential and commercial users imposed a connection fee for new water service,one component of which was a fire suppression charge used to purchase equipment for the volunteer fire department.id.at.a group of real property owners challenged the ordinance as levying an illegal fee.id.at.
while agreeing with the plaintiffs contention that supplying water is a service within the meaning of article xiii d definition of a fee or charge,richmond rejected their broader argument that all water service charges are necessarily subject to the restrictions that article xiii d imposes on fees and charges.richmond,supra,cal th at.the supreme court distinguished a fee for ongoing water service through an existing connection from a fee for making a new connection to the system.id.at.the former requires nothing other than normal ownership and use of property whereas the latter results from the owner voluntary decision to apply for the connection.ibid.because the charge on the owner voluntary decision to apply for a service connection was not a charge on the service itself,it was not subject to proposition.id.at.
finally,in bighorn,a case that pajaro ultimately found dispositive,the supreme court reiterated that rates and other charges for water delivery were within the meaning of proposition.bighorn involved a local agency that provided domestic water service to residents within its special district.a resident in the district sought to place an initiative on the ballot that would have limited the agency rates and other water delivery charges.bighorn,supra,cal th at.the court of appeal held that article xiii c,section of the california constitution,which vests local voters with the power to reduc e or repeal any local tax,assessment,fee or charge by initiative,did not apply to the fees and charges at issue.see bighorn,at,fn.omitted.
the supreme court disagreed,finding it obvious that section applied to fees and charges.the only issue was whether the meaning of fees and charges in article xiii c,which does not define the phrase,is coextensive with its meaning in article xiii d,where it is limited to fees and charges.see cal,art.xiii d,subd.e.bighorn did not resolve this question other than to conclude that the fees and charges in article xiii c included the fees and charges in article xiii citing richmond for the proposition that a public water agency charges for ongoing water delivery are fees and charges within the meaning of article xiii d,the court held that such charges are also fees within the meaning of section of article xiii bighorn,supra,cal th at.
relying on dictum in apartment association that it is unclear whether a fee to provide gas or electricity service is the same as a fee imposed on the consumption of electricity or gas apartment association,supra,cal th at,the agency in bighorn argued that its volumetric charges were based on consumption rather than property and were not subject to proposition.in its view,only the fixed monthly charge that it imposed on all customers regardless of usage was.
the court rejected this argument.pointing out that article xiii d includ es a user fee or charge for a property related service cal,art.xiii d,subd.e,bighorn concluded that c water delivery charges also fall within the definition of user fees,which are amounts charged to a person using a service where the amount of the charge is generally related to the value of the services provided.citation.bighorn,supra,cal th at.
like the district here,the pajaro valley groundwater basin faced problems of overdraft and seawater intrusion from decades of groundwater overuse.the pajaro valley water management agency was created by special statute to combat these problems,in part by supplementing the area water supply with sources other than groundwater.to that end,the agency was authorized to impose groundwater augmentation charges on the extraction of groundwater.pajaro,supra,th at.
the agency adopted a groundwater management plan that included the construction of a mile pipeline to import water from a neighboring county.it planned to fund the project in part through higher groundwater augmentation charges against all extractors of groundwater.the charges were levied at a set rate per.metered pumpers,many of which were large,agricultural users,paid based on their actual usage.residential users paid a flat fee based on an estimated average rate of consumption per dwelling.pajaro,supra,th at.
the agency brought an action to validate the increased groundwater augmentation charges.the trial court declared the charges valid but the court of appeal reversed,holding that they constituted a charge incidental to property ownership.because the agency had not complied with proposition procedural requirements for imposing such a charge,the augmentation charge was held invalid.pajaro,supra,th at.
the appellate court characterized the augmentation fee as being charged in return for the benefit of ongoing groundwater extraction and the service of securing the water supply for everyone in the basin.pajaro,supra,th at,fn.omitted.ultimately,though,pajaro concluded that whether the agency fee was for a service was immaterial because it was imposed as an incident of property ownership.id.at.water extraction,the court posited,is an activity in some ways more intimately connected with property ownership than is the mere receipt of delivered water.id.at.
pajaro recognized that the conceptually similar apartment association undermined its conclusion,insofar as that case held that as an incident of property ownership means solely by virtue of property ownership rather than on an incident of property ownership.pajaro,supra,th at.however,pajaro dismissed apartment association as being of questionable vitality given that bighorn did not mention the case at all.ibid.pajaro found no material distinction,for article xiii d purposes,between a charge on groundwater extraction and a charge on delivered water.id.at.although the court speculated that the extraction charge might survive scrutiny under bighorn if it were imposed only on users,the fact that a large majority of pumpers were using the water for residential or domestic uses was dispositive.id.at.
the level of abstraction at which we should analyze the constitutional text is unclear.do we determine whether groundwater extraction fees in general are imposed as an incident of property ownership or do we focus on the specific fee imposed by the district and if the latter,do we consider the district fee without regard to the payor at issue or do we consider the city purpose in pumping groundwater 
the pajaro court implied that the result could differ at least from district to district if not from user to user when it suggested that a charge on groundwater extracted for nonresidential purposes might fall within the rationale of apartment association.pajaro,supra,th at.but this is far from certain.our constitution applies statewide.it would be anomalous to assign its provisions different meanings in different locations.see cal,art.iv,subd.a all laws of a general nature have uniform operation ex parte smith cal,g eneral laws shall operate uniformly,or in the same manner upon all persons who stand in the same category,that is to say,upon all persons who stand in the same relation to the law,in respect to the privileges and immunities conferred by it,or the acts which it prohibits.similarly,the city questions how the district can apply a uniform rate as required by section that is lawful as to the city but unconstitutional as to rural residential groundwater users.
we need not resolve this issue.whether we consider this specific pump fee or pump fees in general,we conclude that the fee is not and that article xiii d does not apply.
pajaro was based upon a unique set of facts that the vast majority of property owners in the pajaro valley obtained their water from wells,and that alternative sources were not practically feasible.pajaro,supra,th at conc.opn.of bamattre manoukian.that is far from the case here.while the record does not disclose the exact number of residential customers who pump water in lieu of connecting to an existing water delivery network,it is evident that this number is insubstantial relative to the number of residential customers receiving delivered water.there are at most parcels with wells in the district.the city,whose parcels account for only about percent of the water extracted from these wells,delivers water to approximately residential dwelling units in the district.and of course the city itself uses the water it pumps for commercial rather than residential purposes 
pajaro also found it significant that the agency pump charge did not serve a regulatory purpose.see pajaro,supra,th at concluding that fee charged to smaller,unmetered wells based on estimated usage was not justified on regulatory grounds but that a regulatory purpose might still be readily invoked with respect to metered extractions.according to pajaro,bighorn le ft open the possibility that delivery of water for nonresidential purposes is not a service,and that charges for it are not incidental to the ownership of property.a finding that such a fee is not imposed as an incident of property ownership might be further supported by a clearly established regulatory purpose,to internalize the costs of the burdened activity or to conserve a supplied resource by structuring the fee in a manner intended to deter waste and encourage efficiency.id.at,fn.omitted.here,as the trial court found,the groundwater extraction fees serve the valid regulatory purpose of conserving water resources.cal,art.x.
even if there were no factual record regarding the relative number of residential versus commercial well owners and a clear regulatory purpose,we would still conclude that a charge on groundwater extraction is not imposed as an incident of property ownership.in orange county water dist.farnsworth d,the court of appeal considered a similar pump fee.the charge was challenged,among other reasons,on the ground that the water which underlies real property is a part of the property itself and that the charge in question is,in effect,a tax levied by reason of ownership of the property id.at.the court of appeal summarily rejected this argument.it found that t he charge in question is more in the nature of an excise tax levied upon the activity of producing ground water by pumping operations than a tax levied by reason of the ownership of property.id.at.
we agree with farnsworth that a pump fee is better characterized as a charge on the activity of pumping than a charge imposed by reason of property ownership.given this characterization,the facts here are not materially different from those in apartment association.the pump fee is not imposed solely because a person owns property.rather,it is imposed because the property is being used to extract groundwater.it ceases along with the business operation,whether or not ownership remains in the same hands.for that reason,the district must prevail.apartment association,supra,cal th at.
that bighorn did not cite apartment association is unsurprising.richmond squarely stood for the proposition that charges for domestic water delivery service are property related,even though other charges less directly associated with the provision of water,namely connecting a property to the delivery system,are not.bighorn,like richmond,dealt with a public water agency charges for ongoing water delivery.bighorn,supra,cal th at.it merely clarified that the charges for this service were subject to proposition whether they were consumption charges or charges imposed regardless of water usage.id.at.apartment association was far less relevant than richmond to this issue.the supreme court failure to cite a marginally relevant case does not signal that case implicit overruling.see griffith city of santa cruz th,characterizing apartment association as dispositive of a challenge.
nor do we think it overly important that pumping may not always be a business operation.see pajaro,supra,th at,fn.discussing the distinction set forth in apartment association between a charge imposed on a person because he owns land and one imposed because he engages in certain activity on his land and doubting that it is satisfactorily captured by a distinction between business and domestic uses or purposes.in the city case,of course,it is.the city pumps water for the municipal supply,which it then sells to residential customers.see city of south pasadena pasadena land water cal,in administering a public utility,such as a water system,even within its own limits,a city does not act in its governmental capacity,but in a proprietary and only capacity.but even with respect to the individual household that elects to pump water for its own consumption,the supreme court made clear in richmond that residential business operations are not the only household activities exempt from article xiii d.that article applies only to charges on an activity that requires nothing other than normal ownership and use of property.richmond,supra,cal th at,italics added.voluntarily generating one own utilities arguably is not a normal use of property,and in any event,it is a business operation in the sense that it affects the demand for municipal services.wickard filburn.
we also disagree with pajaro that the groundwater extraction charge need not constitute a fee for service provided by the district in order to fall within article xiii d scope.see pajaro,supra,th at the agency contends that the charge is not a service fee,but that proposition seems beside the point if the charge is imposed as an incident of property ownership.that is simply an untenable construction of the constitutional text,particularly taken in context.
article xiii d provides that t he amount of a fee or charge imposed upon any parcel or person as an incident of property ownership shall not exceed the proportional cost of the service attributable to the parcel.cal,art.xiii d,subd.b,italics added.plainly,this refers to a service fee,albeit one imposed as an incident of property ownership.id.at subd.b.most of the other substantive requirements imposed in section,subdivision b also explicitly apply to fees and charges for local government services.for example,subdivision b prohibits revenues from the fee or charge from exceed ing the funds required to provide the property related service.subdivision b states that n o fee or charge may be imposed for a service unless that service is actually used by,or immediately available to,the owner of the property in question.it also forecloses f ees or charges based on potential or future use of a service.ibid.subdivision b proscribes charges for general governmental services including,but not limited to,police,fire,ambulance or library services,where the service is available to the public at large in substantially the same manner as it is to property owners.these provisions refer to services.
california constitution,article xiii d,section confirms this interpretation.it provides in relevant part that n o tax,assessment,fee,or charge shall be assessed upon any parcel of property or upon any person as an incident of property ownership except f ees or charges for property related services as provided by this article.
we think it that in charging property owners for pumping groundwater,the district is not providing a service to property owners in the same way that the bighorn agency provided a service by delive
