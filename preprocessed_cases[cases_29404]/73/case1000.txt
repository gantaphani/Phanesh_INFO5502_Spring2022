background 
lois ordlock and her husband,bayard ordlock,live in california,a community property state.the ordlocks filed joint federal income tax returns in california for the years,and.because all three returns understated the ordlocks tax liabilities,the commissioner of the internal revenue service made several assessments of additional amounts of tax,penalties,and interest owed by the ordlocks for those three years.
over the next two decades,the ordlocks made several payments on the tax debt.except for one payment of made from ordlock separate property all payments and credits applied to the couple tax debt were made from community property the ordlocks remained married at the time all payments were made,and are still married today.
on march,ordlock filed a request under b for innocent spouse relief from joint and several liability on the tax debt for the years,and.on july,the commissioner mailed ordlock a notice of determination that granted her relief under b of for all three years.in relevant part,the notice stated

federal income tax law and california community property law 
married couples who file joint returns are generally jointly and severally liable for the full amount of tax due on their combined incomes,even though one spouse may have earned more than the other.see d ness comm r,cir.married couples may avoid joint liability by filing separate returns and paying tax at the rates applicable to married persons filing separate returns.d.
under,if a taxpayer does not pay an assessed tax after a notice and demand,a lien in favor of the united states in the amount of the delinquency arises upon all property and rights to property,whether real or personal belonging to the taxpayer,united states craft,d.it is well established that state law controls the determination of the nature of the legal interest the taxpayer has in property for purposes of.in re mcintyre,cir.
in california,all property acquired by a married person during the marriage is generally considered community property.see cal.under a of the california family code,community property is liable not only for the joint debts of the couple,but also for the separate liabilities of one spouse 
except as otherwise expressly provided by statute,the community estate is liable for a debt incurred by either spouse before or during marriage,regardless of which spouse has the management and control of the property and regardless of whether one or both spouses are parties to the debt or to a judgment for the debt.
this state law reflects the principle articulated by the california supreme court that the policy of protecting the creditors of a spouse outweighs the policy of protecting family income babb schmidt,cir quoting weinberg weinberg,cal d.
ii.innocent spouse relief 
because d makes individuals who file joint tax returns strictly liable for the income tax debts of their spouses,congress has long provided limited innocent spouse relief for certain spouses who are jointly and severally liable for tax liability stemming from a joint return.
congress first provided innocent spouse relief in e of the code,which was enacted in.see act of january,stat.in,congress repealed e and replaced it with,which provides expanded forms of innocent spouse relief.see internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of,pub,stat,the act.section replaced e for any liability for tax arising after july,and for any liability for tax remaining unpaid as of that date 
to qualify for innocent spouse relief,the taxpayer must show that the couple filed a joint return,that the return contained an understatement attributable to erroneous items of the other spouse,and that in signing the return,the innocent spouse did not know or have reason to know of the understatement.see b the taxpayer must also show it would be inequitable to hold her liable.b d.
a taxpayer can qualify for innocent spouse relief under one of three provisions of b,c,or f.section b is available to all joint filers.section c applies only to those taxpayers who are no longer married,legally separated,or not living together.section f provides for selective equitable relief for those taxpayers who do not meet the requirements of b or c.
if a taxpayer is found eligible for innocent spouse relief,the taxpayer may then seek a refund for any payments that the taxpayer made on the spouse tax debt.see g 
iii.rules of statutory construction 
whether preempts community property law for purposes of calculating innocent spouse refunds is an issue of first impression that depends upon statutory construction.
the starting point in every case involving construction of a statute is the language itself.greyhound hood stages,d internal quotation marks omitted.in ascertaining the plain meaning of a statute,the court must look to the particular statutory language at issue,as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.mccarthy bronson,d quotation marks and brackets omitted.where the words of a statute are not conclusive as to congressional intent,they should be placed in their proper context by resort to legislative history.league to save lake tahoe,trounday,cir.
because domestic relations are preeminently matters of state law congress,when it passes general legislation,rarely intends to displace statutory authority in this area.mansell mansell,d.moreover,the supreme court has held that federal law supplants community property law only where the congressional intent to accomplish such a result is clear and unequivocal.see hisquierdo hisquierdo,d.
iv.statutory analysis 
the question before us is whether congress,in enacting,intended to preempt california community property law with respect to an innocent spouse right to a refund.the answer depends on our interpretation of certain language in a and g,the refund provision.we address each section in turn.
section a provides 
an individual who has made a joint return may elect to seek relief under the procedures prescribed under subsection b and 
if such individual is eligible to elect the application of subsection c,such individual may,in addition to any election under paragraph,elect to limit such individual liability for any deficiency with respect to such joint return in the manner prescribed under subsection c.
any determination under this section shall be made without regard to community property laws.
emphasis added.
ordlock argues that the final sentence of a is comprehensive and applies to all sections of,including g.she contends that this broad statement demonstrates congress clear intent to preempt community property law for the purpose of calculating refunds.
the commissioner argues that the final sentence of a does not demonstrate congress intent to preempt community property law with respect to all subsections of.rather,congress intended that the final sentence of a apply only to determinations made under.according to the commissioner,the plain language of a indicates that the only determination within the meaning of is the initial decision that a taxpayer is an innocent spouse.whether that innocent spouse is then eligible for a refund,however,is a separate question governed by the applicable law of the state in which that spouse resides.in other words,the allowance of a refund is not a determination,and thus is not affected by the directive found in a to disregard community property laws.
we agree with the commissioner.
first,the root word determine or some conjugation of it appears five times in in each instance,it is used to refer to the commissioner decision that the petitioning spouse is an innocent spouse who is eligible for some degree of relief from joint and several tax liability.thus,it appears that this decision is the determination that the final sentence of a contemplates should be made without regard to community property laws.
by contrast,the word determine is absent from g,the refund provision of the statute.instead,g states that any credit or refund shall be allowed or made to the extent attributable to the application of this section.emphasis added.this is a significant distinction.see huffman comm r,cir words with a fixed legal or judicially settled meaning,where the context so requires,must be presumed to have been used in that sense.presumably,if congress had intended the final sentence of a to preempt community property laws with respect to the issuance of a refund,it would have clarified that the decision to make such an issuance was a determination within the meaning of the statute 
we find that the text of the statute provides,at the very least,some indication that congress used the word determination in the final sentence of a to refer only to the commissioner decision regarding relief from joint and several liability.
we also find that the legislative history of the statute supports this interpretation.
from the time of the first enactment of innocent spouse relief under e in,there was language that preempted the operation of community property law,but only for the limited purpose of the determination of the spouse to whom such items of gross income are attributable.this makes sense because community property law contemplates that property acquired by the couple during marriage belongs to the marital community,the irs must ignore community property law when deciding whether the items listed on the couple tax return are the responsibility of an individual spouse.thus,the determination long required by e suspended community property law solely for purposes of determining which spouse was responsible for the item on the federal income tax return that gave rise to the tax liability 
the final sentence of a did not appear in the statute until congress passed the act,expanding the availability of innocent spouse relief.to understand why congress replaced the old language with the new,we turn to the house and senate bills.
the house bill would have liberalized the availability of innocent spouse relief by repealing understatement thresholds and by making relief available and apportionable to the extent that the spouse lacked knowledge or reason to know about the understatement.notably,the house bill would have carried forward the old language of e providing that the determination of the spouse to whom items of gross income other than gross income from property are attributable shall be made without regard to community property laws.pt,at.
like the house bill,the senate bill was designed to make innocent spouse relief more widely available.the senate,however,proposed two completely new approaches for expanding relief.first,the senate bill would have allowed certain spouses to elect separate liability relief,which,in essence,would retroactively place the spouses on a footing.under this form of relief,detailed rules and regulations were required to allocate almost all items on the tax return between the spouses.second,the senate bill contained a limited form of equitable relief,a,as amended and passed by the senate on may,reprinted in cong.rec.
the senate proposal to allow elections introduced additional complexity into the process of allocating items between spouses.accordingly,because there were more scenarios in which the irs would have to label an item on a tax return as belonging to an individual spouse instead of the community,there were more instances in which the irs would have to disregard community property laws.as a result,broader language was required than was found in the house bill,which preempted community property laws only for purposes of allocating gross income between spouses.accordingly,the senate bill included the language now found in the final sentence of a.
when the differences between the house and senate bills were reconciled in conference,the final version included the house provision for greater general innocent spouse relief b,the senate provision for separate liability relief c,and the senate provision for equitable relief f.because the senate provisions for separate liability and equitable relief survived conference,the broad language of a also made it into the final version of the statute.
this history strongly suggests that the final sentence of a was drafted to account for the expanded means of allocating items between spouses to determine eligibility for innocent spouse to expand the preemption of community property laws to the issuance of refunds.significantly,nothing in the legislative reports suggests that congress intended to set aside state law ownership interests in property for refund purposes.to the contrary,the senate report makes it clear that community property law was to be preempted only in the context of allocating items between spouses so as to place them on a separate return basis.see,at,defining the scope of the preemption of community property laws as applicable with respect to t he allocation of items.similarly,the conference report does not acknowledge any difference between the house and senate bills regarding the suspension of community property laws.
in conclusion,after considering the disputed language in the context of the statute as a whole,we hold that the final sentence of a does not preempt community property law for purposes of the issuance of innocent spouse refunds.
ordlock also relies on g,the refund provision itself,as evidence that congress intended to preempt california community property law with respect to the issuance of refunds.section g provides 
g credits and refunds.
in as provided in paragraphs and,notwithstanding any other law or rule of law other than sections,b,or,credit or refund shall be allowed or made to the extent attributable to the application of this section.
res the case of any election under subsection b or c or of any request for equitable relief under subsection f,if a decision of a court in any prior proceeding for the same taxable year has become final,such decision shall be conclusive except with respect to the qualification of the individual for relief which was not an issue in such proceeding.the exception contained in the preceding sentence shall not apply if the court determines that the individu
