this is a tax case involving another example of the now infamous son of boss tax shelter.the internal revenue service irs determined that american boat,llc implemented an illegal tax shelter and misstated certain information on its tax documents,resulting in significant tax underpayment by its owners.on july,the irs issued american boat a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment fpaa.american boat,through its tax matters partner american milling,lp,sued the united states seeking judicial review of the fpaa.the district court agreed with the irs that american boat transactions were invalid and that the related tax benefits were american boat does not appeal.the government,however,appeals the district court determination that american boat and its members are not subject to penalties.although we see merit in some of the government arguments,we find no reversible error below.
background 
this case arose from a series of transactions constituting an example of what is now known as a son of boss tax shelter.the shelter,which was aggressively marketed by law and accounting firms in the late and early,is a younger version of its equally illegal boss bond and options sales strategy shelter.see kligfeld holdings comm r,wl providing a description of the son of boss tax shelter.a son of boss shelter may take many forms,but common to them all is the transfer to a partnership of assets laden with significant liabilities.id.the liabilities are typically obligations to purchase securities,meaning they are not fixed at the time of the transaction.the transfer therefore permits a partner to inflate his basis in the partnership by the value of the contributed asset,while ignoring the corresponding liability.see also clearmeadow.at.the goal of the shelter is to eventually create a large,but not,loss on a partner individual tax return.this may occur when the partnership dissolves or sells an asset.in turn,this artificial loss may offset otherwise,thereby sheltering them from uncle sam.
in this case,american boat does not challenge the district court determination that the particular transactions and tax structure violated tax law.fortunately for those of us less mathematically inclined,we need not dwell on the finer details of american boat transactions.the irs will receive its delinquent taxes.the real question in this case is whether american boat,managed by david jump,had reasonable cause for its underpayment.if it did,then no penalty applies if it did not,american boat owners will be liable for forty percent of the underpayment of.see h.
jump is a louis businessman who has developed a large grain and commodities business in central illinois.he has owned a variety of business interests,including a fleet of towboats operating on the mississippi river.in,as jump wealth continued to grow,his chicago banker advised him to consider planning his estate.at his banker recommendation,jump contacted erwin mayer,an attorney at the chicago law firm of altheimer gray.
mayer developed an estate plan that reorganized jump operating entities into a number of limited partnerships.mayer also established the jump family trust,which eventually owned more than percent of jump many business assets.as part of the reorganization,mayer recommended that jump engage in a version of the son of boss tax shelter.the shelter permitted one of jump entities to report a large loss,thereby allowing jump to offset gains earned from the dissolution of another of his entities.altheimer gray provided a written opinion regarding the validity of the transaction,upon which jump accountants relied in preparing subsequent income tax returns.although jump transactions were likely an invalid son of boss tax shelter,the irs did not discover them until after the statute of limitations had expired.
jump next encounter with the son of boss shelter came in,purportedly as an indirect result of a of titanic proportions.one of jump towboats,with multiple loaded barges in tow,struck a bridge near downtown louis.some of the barges broke free from the towboat,floated down river,and crashed into the admiral,a floating casino in the louis harbor.
the passengers aboard were in grave danger as the admiral moorings began to break.with no means of navigation,the would be left to the currents of a mississippi river.the ship was too tall to fit under the next bridge,meaning that the inevitable collision would either capsize the boat or tear it to pieces.either outcome could have resulted in one of the worst maritime disasters in united states history.but,fortunately,one of the admiral moorings held the towboat released its remaining barges and pinned the casino against the riverbank until assistance arrived.
the wayward towboat was owned by american milling,lp,which at that time was the overarching entity that owned most of jump businesses.american milling potential liability from an accident such as the one that nearly occurred would have easily exceeded the company insurance coverage.as a result,jump was advised that he should readjust the ownership structure of his companies to limit potential liability.
in addition to his admiralty attorneys,jump contacted mayer again,who was still at altheimer gray.mayer,familiar with jump various businesses,advised jump that he isolate the towboats from his companies remaining assets.as a result,american boat company,llc was born.it eventually came to own and operate jump mississippi river towboats.
mayer reorganization advice,however,was not what attracted the irs attention.in addition to restructuring,mayer advised jump to conduct another version of the son of boss tax shelter.to do so,mayer created two other companies for jump in late gateway grain,llc,and omaha pump,llc.sometime thereafter,jump transferred his eighteen towboats,which were owned by various entities,to american boat 
on december,gateway grain and omaha pump engaged in short sales of united states treasury notes resulting in proceeds totaling approximately million.both companies also entered into repurchase agreements with morgan stanley,their broker,using the proceeds as collateral until the notes were replaced.
the next day,gateway grain and omaha pump transferred their brokerage fat with more than american boat.along with the proceeds,however,came the obligation to close the transactions.on december,american boat used the million proceeds to close the short sales,resulting in an overall economic loss of just.
the next steps were a series of complex transactions that are largely irrelevant to the issues in this case suffice it to say that jump was able to increase the basis of the eighteen towboats owned by american boat to match the partners newly inflated outside basis.the basis in the towboats increased from what american milling had originally claimed was to a combined total of.
american boat accomplished this feat by claiming that the contribution of the proceeds increased the partners basis by million,but that american boat assumption of the corresponding million obligation to close the short sales was not a liability that reduced the partners basis under of the internal revenue code.see.the result was a drastic artificial increase in the basis that permitted jump and his entities to claim much higher deductions for the depreciation of the towboats and to offset taxable gains earned by later sales of some of the boats.based on the structure of the various entities,the consequences of these tax benefits flowed through to jump individual tax return.
in addition to the reorganization,mayer,who had since moved his practice to the law firm of jenkens gilchrist,provided jump with an opinion letter regarding the validity of the transactions.among other things,mayer opined that the increased partnership basis was permissible because the obligation to close the short sales was not a liability under.the opinion further stated that the taxpayer had a business purpose for the transferring the positions to american boat and that it likewise had a reasonable expectation of making a that the government claims were shams.
beginning in the taxable year,american milling and jump claimed substantial tax benefits on their respective returns as a result of the son of boss shelter.in doing so,jump provided mayer opinion letter to his accountants at deloitte and touche.although deloitte was not asked to opine on the validity of american boat transactions in or,the accountants informed jump that they considered the legal position taken by jenkens gilchrist to be accurate.deloitte further told jump that it had implemented the same strategy for some of its other clients,and it could have easily done so for him.
jump and his companies later changed their accounting firm from deloitte to a regional firm,scheffel companies,which also prepared and signed their tax returns.like deloitte,scheffel was not asked to advise as to the propriety of the transactions,but it raised no objection or concern about the increased tax basis in jump towboats.
according to american boat,jump did not know or have reason to know in that mayer,altheimer gray,or jenkens gilchrist had structured similar transactions for other taxpayers.from jump perspective at that time,he was merely returning to the same reputable attorney who restructured his businesses two years prior.the government points out,however,that jenkens gilchrist offered similar tax shelters to thousands of wealthy individuals,and the opinion letters were often formulated using a template that ignored the economic realities of the transactions.
as the number of taxpayers using variations of the son of boss tax shelter rose over the next several years,so too did the scrutiny from the irs,and jenkens gilchrist was at the heart of it.opinion letters from mayer and two other lawyers at jenkens daugerdas and donna only led to the firm demise,cemco investors,llc united states,cir see also nathan koppel,how a bid to boost profits led to a law firm demise,wall,may,at,but their roles in the transactions also resulted in a federal criminal indictment for each of them.see chad bray,in bdo case,charged with fraud,wall,june,at.
the irs discovered american boat son of boss transaction during its investigation of jenkens gilchrist,and it issued an fpaa on july.the irs determined that american boat tax shelter was invalid,and it adjusted the company basis of its towboats by approximately million.the irs also imposed a forty percent penalty due to underpayment resulting from a gross valuation misstatement.see h.
american milling,the tax matters partner for american boat,deposited the challenged tax with the irs and sought judicial review of the fpaa in the southern district of illinois.see a,e.the district court held that american boat son of boss transactions were invalid and lacked economic substance,particularly after we indicated that a similar transaction was invalid,see cemco investors,at,and the fifth circuit determined that the same version of the tax shelter was illegal,see kornman,at.american boat does not appeal the court decision that its shelter was invalid.
on the issue of penalties,however,the district court found that american boat,through its managing partner david jump,had reasonable cause for inflating the basis in the tugboats,and the penalty in therefore did not apply.see c reg.a.the court found that jump turned to mayer,who was already familiar with jump businesses,for legitimate advice following the maritime accident.at that time,there was no reason for jump to know that mayer advice was risky or incorrect,and the tax shelter,although invalid,was but one component of an overall business readjustment.furthermore,two accounting firms,deloitte and scheffel,did not raise any objection to the tax ramifications of the transactions.
the government now appeals the district court ruling that american boat demonstrated reasonable cause for its underpayment.we find no error in the district court ruling.
ii.analysis 
before turning to the primary dispute in this american boat established reasonable must first address our jurisdiction to consider the issue.
jurisdiction 
the parties both agree that the district court had jurisdiction to determine whether american boat had reasonable cause for its tax underpayment.but a recent decision of the court of federal claims has called our jurisdiction into question.see clearmeadow.
first,a bit of background is in order partnerships do not pay federal income taxes the entity,however,must file an annual information return stating the partners distributive share of the partnership income,deductions,and other tax items.see grapevine,united states,see also.the individual partners then report their distributive share of taxable items on their personal income tax returns.see.
to avoid the inefficiency associated with requiring the irs to audit and adjust each partner tax return,congress created a unified procedure for auditing and litigating partnership items.see tax equity and fiscal responsibility act tefra of,see also new millennium trading,llc comm r,wl,at,grapevine.at.the treatment of all partnership items should be determined at the partnership level,c,a,and any nonpartnership item is resolved during a proceeding,id.a,a see also grapevine,fed cl.at.
prior to,all those relating to a partnership assessed at the partner level.new millennium trading,wl,at.in,as part of the taxpayer relief act,a,stat,congress amended tefra to provide that penalties related to adjustments of partnership items should also be determined during the proceeding.see,f see also new millennium trading,wl,at.section now provides that the tax treatment of any partnership item and the applicability of any penalty,addition to tax,or additional amount which relates to an adjustment to a partnership item shall be determined at the partnership level emphases added.similarly,f states that a court has jurisdiction to determine the proper allocation of partnership items among the partners,and the applicability of any penalty,addition to tax,or additional amount which relates to an adjustment to a partnership item.
on the other hand,if an individual partner wishes to raise a defense to the imposition of a penalty,he must do so in a refund proceeding under c.a court does not have jurisdiction to consider a defense in a proceeding.see new millennium trading,wl,at jade trading,llc united states.
the question,then,is whether the reasonable cause defense in c is a defense or both.although tefra defines a partnership item in various ways,the definition broadly includes items required to be taken into account for the partnership taxable year,as well as those more appropriately determined at the partnership level than at the partner level.a see also tigers eye trading,wl,at noting that defenses include all defenses that require factual findings that are generally relevant to all partners or a class of partners and not unique to any particular partner.the relevant treasury regulation defines the term to include the legal and factual determinations that underlie the determination of the amount,timing,and characterization of items of income,credit,gain,loss,deduction,reg.a b see also reg.c.
in contrast,a defense at the is limited to those that are personal to the partner or are dependent upon the partner separate return and can not be determined at the partnership level.reg.d see also tigers eye trading,wl,at.the treasury regulation notes that one example of a determination is whether the individual partner has reasonable cause as provided by c.reg.d.
despite the inclusion of reasonable cause in treasury regulation d,the vast majority of courts have held or indicated that a partnership may also raise such a defense on its own behalf,based on the conduct of its general or managing partner.see klamath strategic inv.fund ex rel.croix ventures united states,cir stobie creek,llc united states,see also long term capital holdings united states,d,considering,without discussing the jurisdictional question,whether the partnership had reasonable cause to claim large losses santa monica pictures,llc comm r,wl,at.may,addressing,without reference to jurisdiction,the reasonable cause defense at the partnership level.
a number of other courts have not directly addressed the issue but have held that a partner may not raise a reasonable cause defense in a proceeding,leaving open the possibility that a partnership might raise the defense on its own behalf.see awg leasing trust united states,d,referring separately to a reasonable cause defense and a similar defense,and finding that the court lacked jurisdiction because the plaintiff trust did not present any evidence in support of a reasonable cause defense on behalf of the trust emphasis added tigers eye trading,wl,at a defense based on the reasonable cause exception under section c may be raised in a proceeding if it is not a defense.new millennium trading,wl,at noting that courts have considered the reasonable cause defense when presented through a general or managing partner,but not at the whitehouse hotel.comm r,wl,at,stating that c reasonable cause defense is a determination,but refusing to apply it because plaintiff did not meet prerequisites in c jade trading.at noting that plaintiffs asserted a defense,as compared to a similar defense by the partnership or managing partner.
as these cases indicate,there has been little dispute previously that a well as an individual raise its own reasonable cause defense.but the court of federal claims recently held that the reasonable cause exception in c is only a determination that a court may not consider during a proceeding.see clearmeadow.at.
to the extent that the court holding in clearmeadow wholly forecloses a partnership from raising an reasonable cause defense,we disagree.the court primary premise is correct a partner may not raise a defense during a proceeding.but we see nothing that would prevent a partnership from raising its own reasonable cause defense,permitting a court to consider the conduct of its managing partner on behalf of the partnership.as the above cases have held,a partnership might raise such a defense based on facts and circumstances common to all partners and which relies on neither an individual partner tax return nor his unique conduct.
the clearmeadow court relied on treasury regulation d,which defines a defense,finding that cases such as klamath and stobie creek are directly contrary.at.although the regulation cites c as an example of a defense,it does not foreclose a similar defense on behalf of the partnership it only states that whether the partner has met the criteria of section c is a defense.reg.d.the fifth circuit concluded that this language did not rule out a reasonable cause defense,see klamath,at,and we agree.
in this case,the irs adjusted american boat partnership items arising out of its return of partnership income form,filed in the name of american boat company,llc.the adjustment focused on american boat inside basis.to the extent that jump raises a defense or seeks a personal refund,we do not have jurisdiction.but american boat claims that the partnership,through its general partner,had reasonable cause for its tax position.accordingly,we find that the district court had jurisdiction to consider this issue.
merits of the government appeal 
with our jurisdiction intact,we now turn to the substance of the government argument that american boat did not demonstrate reasonable cause for its tax position.specifically,the government asserts that the company could not have reasonably relied on mayer advice due to his inherent conflict of interest and that,in any event,mayer opinion letter did not meet the threshold requirements of treasury regulation c.
section of the internal revenue code imposes a mandatory penalty for certain tax underpayments that meet the statutory requirements.a,h see also thompson comm r,cir.if the underpayment is due to a gross valuation misstatement,that is,a misstatement of the correct adjusted basis by percent or more,the taxpayer must pay a penalty of forty percent of the delinquent tax.a,h.
but not every tax underpayment is subject to penalties.a taxpayer who had a reasonable cause for the underpayment,and acted in good faith with respect to that portion,has a valid defense c see also reg.a.whether a taxpayer had reasonable cause depends on all of the pertinent facts and circumstances of a particular case,with the most important factor being the taxpayer effort to assess his proper tax liability.reg.b.
a common means of demonstrating reasonable cause is to show reliance on the advice of a competent and independent professional advisor.see united states boyle,d when an accountant or attorney advises a taxpayer on a matter of tax law,such as whether a liability exists,it is reasonable for the to rely on that advice.stobie creek.at t he concept of reliance on the advice of professionals is a hallmark of the exception for reasonable cause and good faith.
relying on a professional,however,will not always get a taxpayer off the hook.to constitute reasonable cause,the reliance must have been reasonable in light of the circumstances.reg.b,c see also stobie creek.at.this is a determination with many variables,but the question turns on the quality and objectivity of the professional advice obtained.klamath strategic inv.fund,llc united states,d,aff sub nom.klamath strategic inv.fund ex rel.croix ventures united states,cir quoting swayze united states,cir.
at a minimum,the taxpayer must show that the advice was based on all relevant facts and circumstances,meaning the taxpayer must not withhold pertinent information,and not based on unreasonable factual or legal assumptions,including those the taxpayer knows or has reason to know are untrue.reg.c see also stobie creek,fed cl.at.other relevant considerations are the taxpayer education,sophistication,business experience,and purposes for entering the questioned transaction.reg.c.
as a general principle,a taxpayer need not challenge an independent and competent adviser,confirm for himself that the advice is correct,or seek a second opinion.boyle,at.this is particularly so where the taxpayer is relying on advice of counsel concerning a question of law as opposed to,for example,meeting a statutory deadline.see id.at.as the supreme court has noted,most taxpayers are not competent to discern error in the substantive advice of an accountant or attorney.to require the taxpayer to challenge the attorney would nullify the very purpose of seeking the advice of a presumed expert in the first place.id.at.
a taxpayer is not reasonable,however,in relying on an adviser burdened with an inherent conflict of interest about which the taxpayer knew or should have known.see,neonatology,comm r,cir chamberlain comm r,cir pasternak comm r,cir carroll leboeuf,lamb,greene macrae,llp,d,i f a law firm had an interest in the sale of a particular tax product,a court could conclude that its opinion would not provide protection from irs penalties.what exactly constitutes an inherent conflict of interest is somewhat undefined,but when an adviser profits considerably from his participation in the tax shelter,such as where he is compensated through a percentage of the taxes actually sheltered,a taxpayer is much less reasonable in relying on any advice the adviser may provide.
in cases involving son of boss shelters or similar transactions,courts have upheld the imposition of penalties on taxpayers who relied on advisers involved in implementing the strategy,including jenkens gilchrist.see stobie creek.at see also maguire,llc united states,wl,at,new phoenix sunrise comm r,wl,at.even though prior to the events leading to its public disgrace and dissolution of the law firm,jenkens gilchrist enjoyed a vaunted reputation in legal and tax matters,at least some courts have found that their involvement in structuring the tax shelters constituted an inherent conflict of interest.see stobie creek.at.important to the court decision in stobie creek was that the taxpayer advisers received fees calculated as a percentage of the capital gains sheltered by their strategies.id.noting that the taxpayer knowledge that the firms were financially interested in the implementation of the strategy diminished the reasonableness in relying on their advice.likewise,in new phoenix,the court found that jenkens gilchrist actively participated in the development,structuring,promotion,sale,and implementation of the tax shelter transaction the f
