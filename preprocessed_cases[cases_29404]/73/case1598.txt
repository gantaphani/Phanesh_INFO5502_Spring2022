plaintiff and appellant estuardo ardon ardon appeals an order striking his class action allegations in an action against the city of los angeles city.ardon contends the city telephone users tax tut is an illegal tax.he seeks on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated a refund of tut.we affirm.
the city and ardon agree that a prerequisite to pursuing a tax refund action is that the plaintiff must first file a government claim with the city.the primary issue in this appeal is whether ardon was entitled to present a single claim to the city on behalf of himself and the entire class,or whether each member of the purported class is required to file an individual claim with the city prior to filing suit.
ardon contends he properly filed a government claim with the city on his own behalf and on behalf of the class he purports to represent.the city contends ardon is limited to filing an individual claim on his own behalf.we hold that ardon can not present a claim on behalf of the entire purported class.
in woosley state of california cal th,d,woosley,our supreme court held that article xiii,section of the california constitution article xiii,section prohibits the courts from expanding the methods for seeking tax refunds expressly provided by the legislature.the policy underlying article xiii,section is that strict legislative control over the manner in which tax refunds may be sought is necessary so that governmental entities may engage in fiscal planning.
here,the applicable claims statute is government code section section,which does not expressly allow a class action claim.under woosley and the policy underlying article xiii,section,ardon can not assert a class claim under section for a tax refund.
factual and procedural background 
ardon government claim.
on october,ardon presented a claim to the city,on behalf of himself and all similarly situated taxpayers in the city of los angeles,requesting cessation of the collection of tut and the return of monies collected under the tax during the prior two years.ardon claims that the los angeles municipal code exempts from the tut all amounts paid for telephone services to the extent those amounts are exempt from the federal excise tax fet.because the fet was allegedly improperly collected,ardon contends,so too was the tut.
on december,the city attorney responded to ardon claim to the extent that the october letter presents a tax refund claim against the city by estuardo ardon,notice is hereby given that the claim is rejected by the city.to the extent that the letter attempts to present a tax refund claim on behalf of a class,that purported claim is denied as well,in part on the basis that there is no legal standing to file a claim on behalf of a class.on december,ardon filed suit against the city.
ardon operative pleading.
on march,ardon,on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated,filed a corrected first amended class action complaint for declaratory,injunctive,monetary and other relief the complaint set forth counts for declaratory and injunctive relief preventing further improper collection of the tut count one declaratory relief regarding the alleged unconstitutional amendment of the tut count two,money had and received count three,unjust enrichment count four,violation of the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution count five,and a claim for writ of mandamus count six.by way of relief,the complaint sought,inter alia,certification of the matter as a class action code civ,an accounting by the city of the tut funds collected,and prompt return of those monies to the members of the class.
the city demurrer and motion to strike.
the city demurred to the entire complaint,asserting,inter alia there is no authorization for a class action the california constitution prohibits courts from enjoining the collection of a tax and a tax refund is an adequate remedy at law so that an injunction is not available.
the city concurrently filed a motion to strike all class action allegations from the complaint on the ground ardon was not permitted to file an government claim with the city on behalf of a purported class.the city contended that pursuant to woosley a class claim for a tax refund is not permitted unless the legislature has expressly authorized one.before ardon could bring a class action lawsuit,the city argued,each member of the purported class was required to have filed an government claim with the city.
the trial court granted the city motion to strike the class allegations.it also partially overruled and partially sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,and stayed certain causes of action.ardon filed a timely notice of appeal from the order on the city motion to strike and demurrer 
contentions 
ardon makes two main arguments on appeal.he first argues that he was required to file a claim in the manner set forth in the government claims act,not in the manner set forth in the los angeles municipal code.ardon second argument is that the trial court erred in interpreting woosley to prohibit a class action in this case.we agree with ardon first contention but do not agree with his second 
discussion 
ardon was required to file a claim in the manner set forth in the government claims act prior to pursuing an action for a tax refund against the city.
under the government claims act,no suit for money or damages may be brought against a public entity until a written claim has been presented to the public entity and the claim either has been acted upon or is deemed to have been rejected.hart county of alameda th,d.in general,claims for money or damages against a local public entity must be presented in the manner set forth in the government claims act,unless the claim falls within specified exceptions.see.however,if the claim falls into one of the specified exceptions,and the claim is not governed by any other statutes or regulations expressly relating thereto,it shall be governed by the procedure prescribed in any charter,ordinance or regulation adopted by the local public entity,subd.a.
the city contends that ardon must file a claim under los angeles municipal code section section and former section section ardon,conversely,contends that sections and are preempted by the government claims act.compare batt city and county of san francisco th,d batt with county of los angeles superior court th,d oronoz.we need not decide the preemption issue because we hold,for the reasons stated below,that sections and do not apply to the claims asserted by ardon.accordingly,ardon was required to present a claim to the city in the manner set forth in the government claims act.
we interpret sections and de novo see bohbot santa monica rent control bd.th,d bohbot by the same rules applicable to statutes.see carson harbor village,city of carson mobilehome park rental review bd.th,d bohbot at,d.our fundamental task is to ascertain the city council intent.see smith superior court cal th,d,smith.the meaning of a provision of a municipal code may not be determined from a single word or sentence the words must be constructed in context see people shabazz cal th,d.where reasonably possible,we also avoid any construction that renders particular provisions superfluous or unnecessary see dix superior court cal d,or that would lead to absurd consequences.see smith,at,d.
section is irrelevant to this case.it governs claims for refund of overpayment of taxes imposed by article and of chapter of the los angeles municipal code.mun.code.article pertains to business taxes,and article,which is suspended,pertains to use taxes.the tut appears in article.mun.code,ch.therefore,the claim procedure contained in section,by its terms,is inapplicable.
section is entitled senior citizen.subdivision a of section provides an exemption from the tut for any individual years of age or older or any disabled individual who lives in a household with less than a specified combined income subsection c of section,in turn,provides f or individuals years of age or older,and for disabled individuals,any individual entitled to be exempt from the taxes imposed by this article tut who used telephone,electric or gas services and paid more than in such taxes may apply for a refund thereof on forms provided by the director of finance.section,subdivision c further provides except as otherwise provided in this section,refunds of overpaid taxes shall be made in the same manner as is provided in section of this chapter for refunds of overpayments in business taxes.
under the plain language of section,individuals who qualify for the seniors and disabled persons exemption set forth in subdivision a may seek a refund of the tut under subdivision c thereof.ardon claim does not implicate section for two reasons.first,ardon has not alleged that he,or any member of the class he purports to represent,is years of age or older or is disabled.second,ardon claim of tut illegality is not within the ambit of the section refund procedure.because section is not implicated,we need not reach the issue of whether section is preempted by the government claims act.
ardon can not present a government claims act claim for a tax refund on behalf of a class.
we now turn to the issue of whether ardon can make a claim on behalf of the class he purports to represent.this presents a question of law,which we review de novo.oronoz,supra,th at,d.
government code section provides that a claim is filed by a claimant.although no provision in section expressly allows a claimant to assert a claim on behalf of a class,ardon contends that under city of san jose superior court cal d,city of san jose or san jose,he may file a section claim on behalf of the class he purports to represent.we reject this contention.as we will explain,article xiii,section,as interpreted by woosley prohibits us from expanding the scope of section to allow class claims for tax refunds.
as we will further explain,whether a claimant can file a section claim on behalf of a class depends on whether the claimant is required to comply strictly with the requirements of the statute or whether the claimant can merely substantially comply.if strict compliance is required,the claimant can not pursue a class claim.on the other hand,if the claimant substantial compliance can satisfy the statute,he or she can pursue such a claim.we shall conclude that where,as here,the claimant seeks a refund of taxes,strict compliance is required.see batt,supra,th at,d strict compliance with ordinance in action for refund of local taxes ibm personal pension plan city and county of san francisco th,d strict compliance of statute in action for refund of property taxes neecke city of mill valley th,d neecke a taxpayer must show strict,rather than substantial,compliance with the administrative procedures established by the legislature.
under city of san jose,a section class claim may be filed in an inverse condemnation or nuisance action.
in earlier cases,the courts held that strict compliance with claims statutes was essential to maintain an action against a governmental entity.see witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions,witkin.this rule sometimes led to harsh results.witkin.thus over time the courts allowed substantial compliance with claims statutes.witkin.
in city of san jose,supra,cal d at,the supreme court described the circumstances under which a claim could substantially comply with a claims statute t o gauge the sufficiency of a particular claim,two tests shall be applied is there some compliance with all the statutory requirements and if so,is this compliance sufficient to constitute substantial compliance a claim substantially complies with a claims statute if there is sufficient information to reasonably enable the public entity to make an adequate investigation of the merits of the claim and to settle it without the expense of a lawsuit.id.at.
in city of san jose,the plaintiff sought damages against a city under nuisance and inverse condemnation theories of recovery.the issue was whether the plaintiff could file a section claim on behalf of a class.applying the substantial compliance test,the court concluded that the term claimant,as used in section,must be equated with the class itself,and thus rejected the suggested necessity for filing an individual claim for each member of the purported class.city of san jose,supra,cal d at.the court further reasoned to require such detailed information in advance of the complaint would severely restrict the maintenance of appropriate class to recognized policy favoring them.code civ,city of san jose,at,italics added.the court thus held that claims statutes,including section,do not prohibit class actions against governmental entities for inverse condemnation and nuisance.city of san jose,at,italics added.
woosley rejected the extension of the city of san jose case to tax refund claims.
several court of appeal decisions extended the holding of city of san jose to permit the filing of class claims seeking tax refunds.woosley,supra,cal th at,d,citing schoderbek carlson d.schoderbek,lattin franchise tax board d.lattin,and santa barbara optical state bd.of equalization d,santa barbara optical.in santa barbara optical,the court held that the plaintiffs could file a claim with the state board of equalization for a refund of sales taxes on behalf of a class.santa barbara optical,at.in lattin,the court held that the plaintiffs could file a claim with the franchise tax board for a refund of state income taxes on behalf of a class.lattin,at.both santa barbara optical and lattin relied on city of san jose.santa barbara optical at.lattin,at.
in schoderbek,the plaintiffs brought a class action for a refund of local property taxes and other relief against county officials and others.revenue and taxation code section provided that a suit for a property tax refund could not be brought unless a claim for a refund had been filed.the plaintiffs argued that they should be excused from filing any refund claim because they represented approximately homeowners and it would be an undue burden to require so many homeowners to go through the expense of pursuing their administrative remedies.schoderbek,supra,d at.the court,however,cited city of san jose and stated plaintiffs argument overlooks the simple fact that they could have filed a claim for the refund with the county on behalf of themselves and on behalf of the members of the class they represent.schoderbek,at.
ardon argues that we should apply city of san jose to his claim against the city for a refund of the tut he and members of his purported class paid.in woosley,however,our supreme court rejected the extension of city of san jose to tax refund claims.the court stated contrary to the line of court of appeal decisions cited above,schoderbek,lattin,and santa barbara optical,we conclude,for the reasons that follow,that the holding in city of san jose should not be extended to include claims for tax refunds.woosley,supra,cal th at,d.
c.the underlying policy of article xiii,section.
in the following paragraph,the woosley court explained why it would not extend the holding of city of san jose to tax refund claims the california constitution expressly provides that actions for tax refunds must be brought in the manner prescribed by the legislature.article xiii,section,of the california constitution provides in this regard after payment of a tax claimed to be illegal,an action may be maintained to recover the tax paid,with interest,in such manner as may be provided by the legislature.italics added.this constitutional limitation rests on the premise that strict legislative control over the manner in which tax refunds may be sought is necessary so that governmental entities may engage in fiscal planning based on expected tax revenues.woosley,supra,cal th at,d,citing state bd.of equalization superior court cal d.
woosley follows a line of supreme court cases that broadly construed article xiii,section in light of the paramount policy underlying that provision.see state bd.of equalization superior court,supra,cal d at,pacific gas electric state bd.of equalization cal d,pacific gas electric modern barber cal.emp.stab.com.cal d.these cases emphasized that article xiii,section serves the important purpose of prohibiting an unplanned disruption of revenue collection,so that essential public services dependent on the funds are not unnecessarily interrupted.state bd.of equalization superior court,at,quoting pacific gas electric,at,see also modern barber cal.emp.stab,at.
this policy is especially important where,as here,a plaintiff seeks to assert a class action on behalf of very large numbers of people,and the governmental entity faces an unexpected and huge liability.it is vital that the legislature retain control over the manner in which claims may be asserted,so that governmental entities have sufficient notice of claims to allow for predictable and reliable fiscal planning.
under woosley,ardon can only file an individual claim,not a claim on behalf of a class.
in woosley,the plaintiff sought to assert a claim for a refund of vehicle license fees and use taxes on behalf of a class.in light of article xiii,section and its underlying policy,the court stated w e hold that the class claim filed in the present case was not authorized by the statutes governing claims for refunds of vehicle license fees and use taxes.accordingly,that claim is valid only as to woosley in his individual capacity,and the class in the present class action properly may include only persons who timely filed valid claims for refunds.woosley,supra,cal th at,d.
in reaching its decision,the court required the plaintiff to strictly comply with the applicable claims statute.see woosley,supra,cal th at,d.vehicle code section provided that a claim for a refund of vehicle license fees could be filed by the person who has paid the erroneous or excessive fee or penalty,or his agent on his behalf.the court held within the context of this statute,the term person does not include a class,and a class representative who files a claim on behalf of all others similarly situated,without the knowledge or consent of such other persons,is not the agent of the members of the class.citations.accordingly,a class claim for refunds of vehicle license fees,such as the one here at issue,is not authorized by statute.woosley,at,d,fn.omitted.
the court concluded in sum,article xiii,section,of the california constitution precludes this court from expanding the methods for seeking tax refunds expressly provided by the legislature.woosley,supra,cal th at,d.it also overruled schoderbek,lattin,and santa barbara optical to the extent they expressed views to the contrary.woosley,at,d,
under woosley,ardon can not file a section claim for tax refunds on behalf of a class.the language of section is similar to the language of vehicle code section a claim must be filed by the claimant or by a person acting on his or her behalf.when strictly,rather than substantially construed,the syntax and diction of section indicate that it applies to individual claims,not to claims on behalf of a class.for example,section provides that the claim must state the name and post office address of the claimant,subd.a.this language implies that the claim is being asserted by an individual,not a class.likewise,section provides that a claim must state the date,place and other circumstances of the occurrence or transaction which gave rise to the claim asserted,subd.c.this language does not contemplate different occurrences or transactions related to various members of a class asserting a collective claim.indeed,no mention is made of a claim filed on behalf of a class.
by contrast,when the legislature wanted to authorize class claims for refunds of particular state taxes,it used very different language.in two statutes,the legislature has expressly allowed class claims,albeit with stringent restrictions revenue and taxation code section,subdivision b and section both provide for a claim filed for or on behalf of a class of taxpayers 
the absence of express language in section regarding claims on behalf of a class indicates that the legislature did not intend to allow such claims for tax refunds.where statutes involving similar issues contain language demonstrating the legislature knows how to express its intent,the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject is significant to show that a different legislative intent existed with reference to the different statutes.county of san diego san diego norml th,d.
under woosley,a section claim for a tax refund can not be pursued in a manner not expressly provide by the legislature.ardon therefore can not present a section claim on behalf of the class he purports to represent.
oronoz was incorrectly decided.
in oronoz,this court held that under city of san jose,a section claim for a refund of local taxes could be asserted on behalf of a class.oronoz,supra,th at,d.we overrule that aspect of oronoz in this case.
we stated in oronoz woosley did not disapprove san jose or suggest that its holding with respect to claims under government code section should be limited,but refused to extend the holding in san jose to tax refund claims governed by other statutes.oronoz,supra,th at,d,italics added.that is incorrect.woosley did not limit the holding of city of san jose to tax refund claims governed by other statutes.rather,woosley stated that the holding of city of san jose should not be extended to include claims for tax refunds,period.woosley,supra,cal th at,d.
further,the holding of woosley,by its plain terms,applies to section claims for tax refunds filed on behalf of a class.woosley stated that city of san jose held that a class claim could be filed pursuant to government code section woosley,supra,cal th at,d.woosley concluded that this holding regarding section claims should not be extended to include claims for tax refunds.woosley,at,d.thus a section claim for a tax refund on behalf of a class is precisely the type of claim that is prohibited by the plain language of woosley.
moreover,as noted above,for purposes of determining whether a claimant can assert a claim on behalf of a class,there is no material difference between the language of section and the statutes interpreted by woosley.compare,a claim shall be presented by the claimant or by a person acting on his or her behalf with,the person who has paid the erroneous or excessive fee or penalty,or his agent on his behalf,may apply for and receive a refund.thus,contrary to oronoz,the woosley decision did not decline to extend the holding of city of san jose based on any purported difference between section and the claims statutes at issue in woosley.woosley instead turned on the nature of the claims claim for a tax refund must be treated differently than a claim for inverse condemnation and nuisance.see woosley,supra,cal th at,d.this is because article xiii,section and its underlying policy require different treatment.
in city of san jose,the court did not consider article xiii,section or its underlying policy.rather,the court relied upon the policy in favor of class actions,as expressed by statute,code civ.city of san jose,supra,cal d at.but as woosley recognized,claims for tax refunds are different.the constitutionally mandated strict legislative control over how to obtain tax refunds outweighs the statutory policy in favor of class actions.see woosley,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,ardon section claim for tax refunds must receive a different treatment from the section claim for damages asserted by the plaintiff in city of san jose.
ardon argues that woosley does not control in this case because its holding relied on article xiii,section,a provision which ardon contends applies to state,not local taxes.in oronoz,we agreed with this argument.see oronoz,supra,th at,fn,d,citing eisley mohan cal d,and pacific gas electric,supra,cal d at,fn.
oronoz,however,interpreted woosley too narrowly.the reasoning of woosley applies with equal force to claims for refunds of local taxes.the holding of woosley was based on the premise that strict legislative control over tax refunds was necessary so that governmental entities could engage in fiscal planning.woosley,supra,cal th at,d.local public entities,like the state,have an overriding interest in fiscal planning based on expected tax revenues.
we therefore join a line of court of appeal cases which have applied the policy underlying
