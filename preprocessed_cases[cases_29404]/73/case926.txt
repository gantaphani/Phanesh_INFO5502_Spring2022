naify was a longtime california resident until his death in april in december,naify began implementing a plan to avoid paying california income tax on gains he expected to realize from converting his telecommunications tci notes into at t stock after tci merged into at t.as part of the plan,naify formed mimosa,mimosa as a delaware corporation.he became its sole shareholder,and took steps to ensure that mimosa did not operate in california.naify then transferred his tci notes to mimosa.after tci merged into at t,mimosa converted the tci notes into at t stock,which led to a gain of million.
after naify death,his estate filed naify california personal income tax return for the tax year.naify return did not report the million gain as taxable income.consequently,his return did not reflect that any california income tax was due on the million gain nor that he had paid california income tax on that gain.
nearly a year later,in july,naify estate filed its federal estate tax return.at the time the estate filed its return,the california franchise tax board ftb had not asserted a claim against the estate for california income tax on the million gain.in its return,however,the estate deducted,as a claim against the estate,million for the estimated amount of california income tax that naify might owe if his california tax avoidance plan failed.
three months later,the ftb initiated an audit of naify california personal income tax return for the tax year.in july,the ftb issued a notice of proposed assessment in which it asserted that naify estate owed million,plus interest and penalties,for california income tax on the million gain.naify estate disputed that it owed california income tax on the million gain.after lengthy negotiations,in,the estate settled the california income tax claim for million,million of which was interest.
meanwhile,in early,the irs had initiated an audit of the estate federal estate tax return.the irs disallowed the estate deduction of million for the estimated amount of california income tax that naify estate might owe if his california tax avoidance plan failed.after the estate settled with the ftb,however,the irs allowed the estate to deduct the million it paid to settle the california income tax claim.as a result of the adjusted deduction,the estate paid a federal estate tax deficiency of million.
in march,the estate filed a claim with the irs for a refund of the million tax deficiency it paid when the irs adjusted its deduction for the california income tax claim.in its claim,the estate sought to adjust the deduction from million to million.in order to arrive at the million value,the estate discounted the million that it believed that naify owed in california income tax on the million by,which was the probability,according to the trust expert,that naify tax plan would fail the irs rejected the estate claim it concluded that the california income tax claim was contingent and disputed and,thus,the amount of the deduction for the claim was limited to the million the estate paid to settle the claim.
in april,the trust,as successor in interest to naify estate,filed a complaint against the government in district court.the trust complaint asserted a single claim for refund of federal estate taxes based on its allegation that the value of the ftb claim against the estate for california income tax,as of the date of naify death,was million.after the government filed its answer,it moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court granted the government rule c motion because,inter alia,the trust complaint did not show that the estimated amount of the deduction for the california income tax claim was ascertainable with reasonable certainty as of the date of naify death and,as a result,the trust deduction was limited to the million it paid to settle the claim.
the district court entered judgment against the trust on september.the trust filed its timely notice of appeal on october.the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to a.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.

we begin our discussion with a brief overview of federal estate tax deductions for claims against an estate.we then turn to the merits of the government motion 
the federal estate tax is a tax on the privilege of transferring property upon one death propstra united states,cir.the federal estate tax is imposed on the decedent taxable estate.a,a.the taxable estate is determined by reducing the gross estate by deductions allowable under the internal revenue code.a.claims against the estate are one type of deduction allowable under the internal revenue code.a.claims against the estate are personal obligations of the decedent existing at the time of his death,whether or not then matured,and interest thereon which had accrued at the time of death.reg.only claims that are enforceable against the decedent estate may be deducted.see estate of duval comm r,recognizing that a claim is an assertion of a right and if there is no assertion of a right,there is no claim to deduct,aff,cir.tax obligations are deductible,if at all,as claims against the estate.reg.a.
the trust contends that the district court erred when it determined that the estimated amount of the california income tax claim could not be deducted because it was not ascertainable with reasonable certainty as of the date of naify death and,as a result,its deduction was limited to the million it paid to settle the claim.
the treasury regulations mandate that,in order to deduct the estimated amount of a claim against the estate,the estate must show that it is,inter alia,ascertainable with reasonable certainty.reg.b.an estate can not deduct a claim based on a vague or uncertain estimate.see,e,estate of saunders comm r,explaining that stating and supporting a value is not equivalent to ascertaining a value with reasonable certainty.if a claim value is not ascertainable with reasonable certainty,but later becomes certain,an estate may petition the tax court or file a claim for a refund.reg.b.
here,the trust pleading demonstrates that the estimated amount of the california income tax claim was not ascertainable with reasonable certainty as of the date of naify death.the trust can not rely on its allegation that o n the date of marshall naify death,april,the amount of plaintiff california tax liability was ascertainable with reasonable certainty because that is not a factual allegation.rather,it is a legal conclusion that we need not accept as true.see mining council watt,cir we do not,however,necessarily assume the truth of legal conclusions merely because they are cast in the form of factual allegations.
as for the trust other allegations in its pleading,they show that the ftb had not asserted,nor assigned a value to,the california income tax claim as of the date of naify death.as the district court recognized,several events would need to have occurred in order for naify california income tax liability on the million gain to come due.the ftb would need to,inter alia,assert the california income tax claim by initiating an audit of
