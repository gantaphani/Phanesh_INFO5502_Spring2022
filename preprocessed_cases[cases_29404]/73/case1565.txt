in august,the city of san diego the city formed a special assessment district known as the greater golden hill maintenance assessment district the district for the purpose of providing various services and improvements for the benefit of properties in the district.the same month,golden hill neighborhood association,an association of property owners in the golden hill area and individual property owner john filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of the district and its initial assessments under article xiii d of the california constitution which was enacted by the voters passage of proposition in.the association filed a second suit in challenging the district assessment charges for fiscal year and decision to carry over to that fiscal year unspent funds from the assessments collected for fiscal year.the court consolidated the two actions and tried the case on documentary evidence and the parties oral argument.the trial court entered judgment for the association on the first cause of action,for writ of mandamus,in their complaint and entered judgment for the city on every other cause of action in the association consolidated pleadings.
the city and the association both appeal the judgment.the city appeals the portion of the judgment in favor of the association on its initial mandamus cause of action,contending the formation of the district and the special assessments levied by the district complied with all of the requirements of article xiii d.the association appeals the portion of the judgment in favor of the city,contending,among other things,that the district should be dissolved because there would not have been a majority of votes in favor of its formation if the voting weight assigned to the city open space and park land in the district had not been improperly inflated the services and improvements for which the assessment was levied do not confer special benefit on the assessed properties and as the trial court ruled,the engineer report supporting the assessment failed to separate general benefits from special benefits as required by article xiii 
we conclude that the association challenge to the vote establishing the district is meritorious and that the trial court correctly ruled that the required engineer report supporting the district assessments failed to adequately separate general benefits from special benefits as required by article xiii accordingly,we direct the issuance of a writ of mandate vacating the resolution establishing the district and invalidating the assessments levied by the district.
article xiii d 
because the city appeal and the association appeal raise the same essential issue whether the formation of the district and the district assessments comply with the requirements of article xiii d we begin with an overview of article xiii d to provide a proper context for the factual and procedural background of the case.
article xiii d limits a local government ability to levy special assessments against real property.the california supreme court has explained that a special assessment is a compulsory charge placed by the state upon real property within a district,made under express legislative authority for defraying in whole or in part the expense of a permanent public improvement therein.citation.citation.in this regard,a special assessment is levied against real property particularly and directly benefited by a local improvement in order to pay the cost of that improvement.citation.the rationale of special assessment s is that the assessed property has received a special benefit over and above that received by the general public.the general public should not be required to pay for special benefits for the few,and the few specially benefited should not be subsidized by the general public.citation.citation.a tax,on the other hand,is very different.unlike a special assessment,a tax can be levied without reference to peculiar benefits to particular individuals or property.citation.indeed,n othing is more familiar in taxation than the imposition of a tax upon a class or upon individuals who enjoy no direct benefit from its expenditure,and who are not responsible for the condition to be remedied.citations.therefore,while a special assessment may,like a special tax,be viewed in a sense as having been levied for a specific purpose,a critical distinction between the two public financing mechanisms is that a special assessment must confer a special benefit upon the property assessed beyond that conferred generally.silicon valley taxpayers,santa clara county open space authority cal th,silicon valley.
in passing proposition and enacting article xiii d,the voters clearly sought to limit local government ability to exact revenue under the rubric of special assessments.silicon valley,supra,cal th at.article xiii d restricts government ability to impose assessments in several important ways.first,it tightens the definition of the two key findings necessary to support an assessment special benefit and proportionality.an assessment can be imposed only for a special benefit conferred on a particular property.art.xiii d,subd.b,subd.a.a special benefit is a particular and distinct benefit over and above general benefits conferred on real property located in the district or to the public at large.art.xiii d,subd.i.the definition specifically provides that g eneral enhancement of property value does not constitute special benefit.ibid.further,an assessment on any given parcel must be in proportion to the special benefit conferred on that parcel no assessment shall be imposed on any parcel which exceeds the reasonable cost of the proportional special benefit conferred on that parcel.art.xiii d,subd.a.the proportionate special benefit derived by each identified parcel shall be determined in relationship to the entirety of the capital cost of a public improvement,the maintenance and operation expenses of a public improvement,or the cost of the service being provided.ibid.because only special benefits are assessable,and public improvements often provide both general benefits to the community and special benefits to a particular property,the assessing agency must first separate the general benefits from the special benefits conferred on a parcel and impose the assessment only for the special benefits.art.xiii d,subd.a.second,article xiii d established strict procedural requirements for the imposition of a lawful assessment.silicon valley,at.
under article xiii d,local agencies must give the record owners of all assessed parcels written notice of the proposed assessment,a voting ballot,and a statement disclosing that a majority protest will prevent the assessment passage.art.xiii d,subds.c,d.the proposed assessment must be supported by a detailed engineer report.art.xiii d,subd.b.at a noticed public hearing,the agencies must consider all protests,and they shall not impose an assessment if there is a majority protest.art.xiii d,subd.e.silicon valley,supra,cal th at.a majority protest exists if,upon the conclusion of the hearing,ballots submitted in opposition to the assessment exceed the ballots submitted in favor of the assessment.in tabulating the ballots,the ballots shall be weighted according to the proportional financial obligation of the affected property.art.xiii d,subd.e.
the california supreme court noted in silicon valley that b efore proposition was passed,courts reviewed acts of local governmental agencies,such as the formation of an assessment district,under a deferential abuse of discretion standard.silicon valley,supra,cal th at.the drafters of proposition specifically targeted this deferential standard of review for change.article xiii d,section,subdivision f,provides in any legal action contesting the validity of any assessment,the burden shall be on the agency to demonstrate that the property or properties in question receive a special benefit over and above the benefits conferred on the public at large and that the amount of any contested assessment is proportional to,and no greater than,the benefits conferred on the property or properties in question.id.at.a local agency burden of proving that an assessment meets these requirements is to be liberally construed and courts should exercise their independent judgment in reviewing local agency decisions that have determined whether benefits are special and whether assessments are proportional to special benefits within the meaning of article xiii d.id.at.
factual and procedural background 
in,the greater golden hill community development corporation gghcdc received a grant to explore the possible formation of a maintenance assessment district mad in the golden hill area of san diego.after holding two community meetings,gghcdc mailed surveys to golden hill property owners to gauge support for the formation of the district.percent of the surveys returned to gghcdc expressed support for the creation of a mad.the city then retained the engineering firm sci consulting group sci to prepare the engineer report that is required to form a mad under the landscape and lighting act of,codified at streets and highways code section et sts.
in june,the city council passed a resolution stating its intention to form the district and collect assessments to pay a prescribed portion of the costs of future improvements,maintenance services of those items described in the engineer report for the district.the city council preliminarily approved sci engineer report and directed the city clerk to set a date for a public hearing on the proposed formation of the district and mail assessment ballots to the property owners in the district area at least days before the hearing.on july,the city council held a public hearing on the formation of the district and counted the ballots received from property owners.of the valid ballots the city received,were in favor of forming a mad and were opposed.the vote for each property was weighted according to the proposed amount of the assessment to be levied against the property as specified in the engineer report and attached assessment roll.the total assessment amount of attributable to the voting properties consisted of yes votes in the amount of and no votes in the amount of.thus,formation of a mad was approved by percent of the weighted vote.based on those voting results,the city council passed resolution no.r ordering formation of the district,approving the engineer report,and confirming assessments against properties in the district in the total amount of for fiscal year,as estimated in the engineer report.
the engineer states that the purpose of the district is to provide funding for debris and litter removal,enhanced litter containers,sidewalk sweeping,sidewalk power washing,trash removal,landscaping services,graffiti removal,and trail and canyon beautification.the report further describes the services and improvements to be provided by the district as i nstallation,maintenance and servicing of public improvements and incidental expenses,including but not limited to landscaping,sprinkler systems,shrubs and trees,sidewalks,gutters,water,street lighting,signage and materials,supplies,utilities and equipment,as applicable,for property within the district,and any incidental costs thereto 
the engineer report divides the district into benefit zone and benefit zone.the report specifies the following services to be provided in zone twice a week sidewalk sweeping and weeding,graffiti removal,litter removal,street light inspections and reports,and enhanced trash receptacles with regular emptying.the report next specifies the following services to be provided in zone as needed large bulk item pickup,removal of illegal dumping,removal of public health and sanitation hazards,and barricading of sidewalk and safety hazards.the report states that zone will receive sidewalk sweeping and weeding,and litter removal twice a month,and the following services as needed graffiti removal,street light inspections and reports,large bulk item pickup,removal of illegal dumping,removal of public health and sanitation hazards,and barricading of sidewalk and safety hazards.both zone and zone are to be provided basic landscaping and tree maintenance services as needed,and the following enhanced service and maintenance as needed sidewalk power washing,infrastructure improvements,clock maintenance,and equipment.both zones will also receive trail beautification services as needed and canyon beautification services quarterly.the report calls for the installation and maintenance of decorations and banners in zone and,for both zones,newsletter and web site information and special events.
the engineer report explains that the special benefit to each parcel was apportioned based on the parcel linear square footage,stating each property is assigned a single family equivalent benefit factor sfe.the sfe for each single f amily home is,and sfe for other properties are based upon the relative intensity of use trip factors in relation to a single family home.the report assigned sfe of to residences and condominiums,per square foot to commercial properties,and to vacant properties,churches and parking lots.
the engineer report concluded that s ince building area,property type and linear frontage are good determinates of relative benefit to property,and since the population density in the greater golden hill area and height of buildings is average for an urbanized area,a split of the assessments based on property single family equivalent benefit units sfe versus linear frontage is deemed to be reasonable.therefore,of the assessments are allocated based on sfe and are allocated based on street frontage.significantly,as to publicly owned parcels,the report states an assessment has been levied upon each publicly owned parcel in the same manner as privately owned property.each publicly owned parcel,except parks or designated open space area,has been assessed on the same basis as other parcels within the district.italics added.
the consolidated actions 
on august,the association filed a petition for peremptory writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief the complaint to enforce the provisions of article xiii d,and challenge the decision of the city council to overrule protests of real property owners and approve the assessment engineer report,and approve formation of the district.the first cause of action of the complaint concerned amendments to san diego municipal code section defining what constitutes an improvement for which a mad may be formed.the association alleged that most of the items listed in that definition of improvement were adopted from the property and business improvement district act of and were not intended to provide special benefit to real property under article xiii d.the association requested an order enjoining the city from levying assessments for maintenance and improvement services listed in san diego municipal code section and issuance of a writ of mandate commanding the city to comply with the requirements of article xiii d and streets and highways code section 
the second cause of action of the complaint challenged the legality of the vote that established the district,asking the trial court to adjudicate and determine that the fair assessed value of all real property located within the boundaries of the district be reduced in weighted dollar valuation,in compliance with the requirements of streets and highways code section,and article xiii d,section,subdivision a.in the complaint prayer for relief,the association requested an order dissolving the district if the trial court determined that the weighted value of the yes votes cast after fair apportionment of the city vote is less than the weighted value of the no votes cast in the july,election.
the third cause of action alleged that the engineer report failed to separate general from special benefits.the association asked the court to enjoin the city from levying assessments within the district without fairly separating general from special benefits,and assessing only for special benefit s.
thus,the complaint essentially presented the following three claims that the services and improvements for which the district levied assessments against properties in the district did not provide special benefit to the properties as required by article xiii d that the district should be dissolved because the voting that established it was unlawfully weighted and that the engineer report did not adequately separate the general benefits from the special benefits to be conferred on the district properties and imposed the assessment only for the special benefits,as required by article xiii d,section,subdivision a 
in june,the city council approved a special assessment for the district for the fiscal year,with a proposed budget of.on july,the association filed its second petition for peremptory writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief the complaint challenging the city council approval of the assessment and engineer reports for the district and certain other mad.the complaint raised the following issues whether the district properly credited and applied surplus funds it collected for the fiscal year to the assessment for the fiscal year whether the district violated california law by not submitting any of the new and increased expenditures in its budget to property owners for their vote of approval and whether the engineer report adequately separated general benefits from special benefits to real property.
the judgment 
the judgment states petitioners first cause of action for writ of mandate in the complaint is granted with judgment entered thereon in favor of petitioners.the effect of this language is unclear because the complaint did not request a writ commanding or prohibiting any specific action by the city it simply requested writs broadly commanding the city to comply with article xiii d and various statutes.further,the judgment does not direct the issuance of a writ or otherwise specify any particular mandamus relief,and there is no indication in the record that any writ ever issued.consequently,it is uncertain whether the trial court intended to invalidate the formation of the district or simply invalidate the assessments levied by the district as being unauthorized by article xiii 
the trial court explained its reasoning for its decision as to some of the association claims in a written ruling that is referenced in and attached to the judgment.regarding its decision in favor of the association on the cause of action for writ of mandate in the complaint,the court ruled that the city failed to show in the initial engineer report that the assessment was based upon special benefits conferred on each parcel.the court ruled that the special benefits identified in the report were for the general enhancement of the district and did not suffice as special benefits,and that the report did not address special benefits as applicable to each parcel.the court further ruled that the engineer report failed to distinguish between general benefits and special benefits conferred on the district.
as noted,the trial court ruled against the association and in favor of the city on each of the association other causes of action in their consolidated pleadings.thus,the judgment,including the attached written ruling,appears to uphold the assessment even though the defects the court found in the engineer report in granting the association unspecified mandamus relief failure to show special benefit and separate general benefits from special benefit are present in both the and engineer reports 
validity of the vote establishing the district 
because the validity of a special assessment imposed by a local agency is a constitutional question after the passage of proposition,we exercise our independent judgment in determining whether such an assessment complies with article xiii silicon valley,supra,cal th at.accordingly,we review de novo whether the vote establishing the district and special assessment met the requirements of article xiii d.as the california supreme court has noted,it is undisputed that courts can invalidate elections that are conducted contrary to the provisions of proposition.greene marin county flood control water conservation dist.cal th,greene.
article xiii d,section,subdivision e requires that the voting on a proposed special assessment be weighted according to the proportional financial obligation of the affected property.this proportionality provision of subdivision e is directly tied to the proportionality requirement of article xiii d,section,subdivision a,which provides that the proportionate special benefit conferred upon each assessed parcel must be determined in relationship to the entire cost of a public improvement or service,and that the amount of the assessment imposed on any parcel may not exceed the reasonable cost of that proportionate special benefit.
the principle that a property owner vote on a proposed special assessment is to be weighted according to the owner proportional share of total assessment amount the owner being granted one vote for each dollar assessed against his or her property is rooted in proposition fundamental purpose of requiring taxpayer consent for any new assessment,fee or charge levied by local government.this fundamental purpose was expressly stated in the preamble to proposition,which reads the people of the state of california hereby find and declare that proposition was intended to provide effective tax relief and to require voter approval of tax increases.however,local governments have subjected taxpayers to excessive tax,assessment,fee and charge increases that not only frustrate the purposes of voter approval for tax increases,but also threaten the economic security of all californians and the california economy itself.this measure protects taxpayers by limiting the methods by which local governments exact revenue from taxpayers without their consent.silicon valley,supra,cal th at,quoting ballot,text of,italics added.proposition further stated that t he provisions of this act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes of limiting local government revenue and enhancing taxpayer consent.silicon valley,at,quoting ballot,supra,text of,italics added.
proposition weighted voting requirement,set forth in article xiii d,section,subdivision e,enhances taxpayer consent by giving property owners whose properties are proposed to be assessed in amounts greater than other owners properties a proportionately greater say as to whether the proposed assessment will be instituted.as the california supreme court noted in greene,the,requirement rooted in the state and federal equal protection provisions do not apply to fee and assessment elections conducted by limited purpose government agencies that disproportionately affect certain property owners.greene,supra,cal th at,fn,italics added.an election on whether to institute a special assessment that will disproportionately affect property owners must be conducted by use of the weighted voting system prescribed by article xiii d,section,subdivision e.
as required by article xiii d,section,subdivision e,the vote for each privately owned property in the district was weighted according to the amount of the proposed assessment to be levied against that property,as set forth in the engineer report and attached assessment roll.the engineer report explained that the special benefit to each parcel was apportioned based on the parcel linear square footage.the report also assigned each property an sfe factor based on its relative intensity of use trip factors in relation to a home,and based percent of the property assessment amount on its sfe number and the remaining percent on its street frontage.regarding publicly owned properties,the engineer report stated that e ach publicly owned parcel,except parks or designated open space area,has been assessed on the same basis as other parcels within the district.italics added.however,the engineer report did not then specify an sfe for park and open space land or explain how the assessment amount and corresponding vote weighting for such properties was calculated.the assessment roll attached to the engineer report listing all of the assessed properties and their sfe numbers and assessment amounts included city properties with assigned sfe of and with varying assessment amounts,presumably due to varying sizes.the city conceded at trial that that these parcels are open space the assessed properties that the city voted with a sfe of also included a parcel consisting of a portion of balboa park 
under article xiii d,it is the city burden to show that the contested assessment amounts charged against its park and open space parcel are proportional to,and no greater than,the benefits conferred on those properties.art.xiii d,subd.f,italics added.the city has not met that burden.we have thoroughly reviewed the entire trial court and administrative record,including the and engineer reports for the district,and are unable to determine from that review how the contested assessment amounts charged against the city park and open space parcels were calculated,or whether they were proportional to the special benefits,if any,to be conferred on those parcels,as required by article xiii d,section,subdivision a.to the extent the assessment amounts charged against the city park and open space parcels exceeds the reasonable cost of the proportionate special benefit conferred upon those parcels,the vote for those parcels was overweighted and the vote for the other properties in the district was diluted.such disproportionate vote weighting would violate the requirement that the ballots for the voting properties be weighted according to the proportional financial obligation of the affected property art.xiii d,subd.e and deprive the owners of underweighted properties the full say to which they are entitled regarding the imposition of a special assessment.
government code section,which was designed to clarify the implementation of proposition greene,supra,cal th at,provides that d uring and after the tabulation,the assessment ballots and information used to determine the weight of each ballot shall be treated as disclosable public records,as defined in government code section,and made equally available for inspection by the proponents and the opponents of the proposed assessment,subd.e,italics added.under that statute,the city was required to publicly disclose how the sfe and assessment amounts for the city park and open space properties were calculated,whether it did so in the engineer report or elsewhere 
when a local agency owns a substantial amount of property subject to a special assessment,its failure to publicly disclose the basis for the determination of the proposed assessment amounts to be charged against its parcels invites the sort of mischief the association suggests the city committed in this case,the agency could overassess its own properties without public scrutiny for the purpose of obtaining a majority affirmative vote on the special assessment here,the city failure to publicly disclose how the sfe and assessment amounts for the city park and open space properties were calculated compromised the transparency and integrity of the election process by depriving other property owners in the district the opportunity to review and challenge the vote weighting for those properties.
in its reply brief,the city addresses the association accusation that the assessment engineer overassessed the parcels within the district to ensure adequate votes to form the district.the city asserts,in its words,that it has continually rebutted this false accusation by demonstrating that the city,a municipal corporation and property owner within the district,has carried a substantial portion of the district assessment burden,paying approximately or more per year of the estimated district budget annually since its inception.however,the amount of the city overall assessment burden is immaterial to whether the amount assessed against,and corresponding vote weight given to,any particular city parcel was properly determined.what is material to that issue is whether the particular assessment amount is proportional to the special benefit conferred on the property.a local agency could view in special assessment charges as a small price to pay to shift over in costs for improvements and services that would otherwise have to be paid from its general revenues to the property owners in a special assessment district.
at trial,the city counsel asserted the city open space parcels were not assigned sfe of as a voting tactic,but were assigned that sfe because they require a lot of debris removal and landscape maintenance that other parcels do not require.however,there is no evidence or analysis in the record to support counsel assertion,there is no evidence that the city park and open space parcels would receive special benefits proportional to their assessment amounts and corresponding voting weight.the city counsel also argued to address the issue of where did the public get notice of this sfe,we ignoring there are pages and pages of assessment rolls on the back of the engineer report that sets forth the calculation.and,for example,on the assessment roll for the assessment,it set out very clearly that the sfe for the balboa park parcel is there.counsel further pointed out that the assessment roll specified the linear front footage and assessment amount for that parcel.however,the assessment roll specification of the sfe and assessment amounts for the city park and open space parcels sheds no light on how those figures were determined.simply stated,notice of the amount of an assessment is not notice of the basis for an assessment 
because the city has not met its burden of showing that the assessment amounts charged against its park and open space parcels were proportional to the special benefits conferred on those parcels,we can not conclude that the vote the city cast for those parcels was properly weighted under article xiii d,section,subdivision e.
the association argues the city failure to explain the assessment amounts for the open space and park properties should result in nullification of the city entire vote for those properties,which would reduce the weighted vote in favor of forming the district to a minority.it is undisputed that the city voted properties and that of them were park or open space property.the city attached a list of its properties in the district,with corresponding assessment amounts,to its opposition to the association trial brief.the association identifies the first five properties on that list as a fire station,consisting of two parcels,with a combined assessment rounded to the nearest dollar of a youth center,with an assessment of a city transportation facility,with an assessment of and a commercial property,with an assessment of the sixth property,with an assessment of,is part of balboa park.the remaining are the properties that the city conceded at trial were open space land.
the total assessment for the city properties was.the total assessment for the five developed properties,excluding the balboa park parcel,was.thus,the difference between those amounts,was the total assessment for the city open space properties and balboa park parcel.if the city vote for the park and open space properties were entirely invalidated,the assessment amount of the votes favoring formation of the district would be reduced in rounded numbers from to,and the vote opposing formation in the assessed amount of would prevail 
at trial,the city argued that the sfe for its open space parcels should not be reduced to zero,and that if it were reduced from to to the sfe assigned to vacant lots in the engineer report,the vote in favor of forming the district would still prevail.it is not our place to determine the proportionate special benefit the city open space parcels would derive from the proposed special assessment in this case,or to determine the basis upon which the amount of the special assessment against those parcels should be calculated,as those are factual matters properly addressed by an assessment engineer.because the administrative and trial court record does not reveal the basis for calculating the assessment amounts levied against the city open space property,in determining the validity of the election on the formation of the district,we conclude it is appropriate to eliminate those amounts from the weighted vote.
as noted,in the prayer of their complaint,the association requested an order that the district be dissolved,if it appears after review that the weighted value of the yes votes cast after fair apportionment of the city vote is less than the weighted value of the no votes cast in the july,election.we conclude that a writ of mandate vacating the resolution establishing the district is the most appropriate means of accomplishing that result.the fact that the association did not specifically tie its request to dissolve the district to their mandamus cause of action does not preclude our directing the issuance of such a writ.see valdez himmelfarb th,failure to pray for the proper form of relief is not fatal to a complaint dicker bisno d,plaintiff in a contested case may secure greater relief than that requested in prayer.the association prayer for mandamus relief compelling compliance with article xiii d,along with their specific request to dissolve the district,was sufficient for the trial court to direct the issuance of a writ vacating the resolution forming the district.accordingly,we will direct entry of a judgment to that effect.
separation of general benefits from special benefits 
the association contends and the trial court found that the engineer report supporting the district assessments failed to adequately separate general benefits from special benefits as required by article xiii article xiii d,section,subdivision a provides that o nly special benefits are assessable,and an agency shall separate the general benefits from the special benefits conferred on a parcel.article xiii d does not explain what it means to separate general benefits from special benefits or provide any methodology for doing so.however,the court of appeal in beutz,supra,th,thoroughly explained article xiii d requirement.
in beutz,the county of riverside formed a special assessment district consisting of all residential properties in the community of wildomar to pay the costs of maintaining landscaping in three closed public parks and one new park in the community.the landscaping assessment was part of a master plan to acquire and develop the parks.beutz,supra,th at.the engineer report for the assessment listed the special benefits that maintaining the landscaping would confer on the assessed properties.regarding general benefits,the report stated it is recognized that the general public may benefit from these parks.however,the benefits to the general public will be offset by the county payoff of the debt incurred by the ortega trail recreation and park district,when the county acquired the park properties.the payoff totaled.additionally county funds of approximately will be used to refurbish the parks with new playing fields,landscaping,structures,and other recreational appurtenances.also on an annual basis the county proposes to contribute approximately for the purpose of funding recreational programs.id.at.
regarding the required separation of general and special benefits under article xiii d,the beutz court quoted the following discussion from a pamphlet issued by the legislative analyst office in december explaining proposition local government must use a professional engineer report to estimate the amount of special benefit landowners would receive from the project or service,as well as the amount of general benefit.this step is needed because proposition allows local government to recoup from assessments only the proportionate share of cost to provide the special benefit.that is,if special benefits represent percent of total benefits,local government may use assessments to recoup half the project or service costs.local governments must use other revenues to pay for any remaining costs.this limitation on the use of assessments represents a major change from the law prior to proposition,when local governments could recoup from assessments the costs of providing both general and special benefits.beutz,supra,th at.
thus,the beutz court noted,separating the general from the special benefits of a public improvement project and estimating the quantity of each in relation to the other is essential if an assessment is to be limited to the special benefits,as required by article xiii d,section,subdivision a.beutz,supra,th at.the beutz court found that the engineer report in that case did not comply with article xiii d,section,subdivision a because it did not separate and quantify the general and special benefits to be realized from the implementation of the entire master plan.instead,the report assumes without supporting evidence or analysis that the general benefits of the master plan will be offset by the county expenditures of over to acquire and refurbish the parks and retire park debt,and its anticipated annual expenditures of approximately to fund park recreational programs.the magnitude of the county expenditures relative to the amount of the annual assessments begs the question,however,of whether the general benefits of the parks outweigh the special benefits to district properties in the proportion the engineer report suggests.beutz,at.
the beutz court concluded that the engineer report was deficient in two ways.first,it was missing an analysis of the quantity or extent to which the general public may reasonably be expected to use or benefit from the parks in relation to the quantity or extent to which occupants of wildomar residential properties,either in the aggregate or individually,may use or benefit from the parks.beutz,supra,th at.second,the report was missing an analysis of how or to what extent all wildomar residential properties in the aggregate,or specific wildomar residential properties in particular,will specially benefit from their occupants anticipated use of the parks.citation.it is by no means clear from the report that occupants of wildomar residential properties will use or benefit from the parks in a different manner,or more intensively,than persons from other communities.nor does the report address whether wildomar residents who live in close proximity to one or more of the parks may reasonably be expected to use those parks just as often,over time,as wildomar residents who live several miles away from the same parks.ibid.
the beutz court found those deficiencies in the engineer report were of constitutional proportions because the report failed to satisfy the county constitutional burden of demonstrating that the parks would confer special benefits on all wildomar residential properties,and the amount of the assessment on each wildomar residential parcel would be proportional to,and no greater than,the special benefits conferred on that parcel.art.xiii d,subd.f.beutz,supra,th at.the beutz court noted that if the engineer report had separated and quantified the general and special benefits of the master plan based on solid,credible evidence and purported to base the assessment solely on the special benefits,the substantial evidence standard of review may have applied to the report implicit conclusions that all wildomar properties would specially benefit from the parks in equal measure,and that the assessment on each parcel was proportional to and no greater than those special benefits.citation.the report,however,fail ed to explain the nature and extent of the general and special benefits of the parks or quantify both in relation to each other based on credible,solid evidence.id.at.
we agree with the beutz court repeated emphasis that the general and special benefits conferred on real property by a service or improvement for which a special assessment is to be levied must be separated and quantified.generally,this separation and quantification of general and special benefits must be accomplished by apportioning the cost of a service or improvement between the two and assessing property owners only for the portion of the cost representing special benefits.that is,the agency must determine or approximate the percentage of the total benefit conferred by the service or improvement that will be enjoyed by the general public and deduct that percentage of the total cost of the service or improvement from the special assessment levied against the specially benefitted property owners beutz,supra,th at noting that if special benefi
