this is an appeal from the united states tax court decision upholding the commissioner determination that mortensen is liable for a section a negligence penalty of for the taxable year.the penalty stems from mortensen deductions on his tax return based on his investment in cattle breeding partnerships established by walter hoyt iii.the hoyt partnerships have generated litigation across the country,see,river city ranches,cch,wl,and culminated in hoyt fraud conviction and prison sentence of twenty years.specifically regarding the taxable year,the commissioner issued a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment regarding the deductions and made a computational adjustment on mortensen return.this changed mortensen claimed loss of on the partnership to income of and consequently increased mortensen tax liability from to,an increase of.section a permits a negligence penalty of of the underpayment.the tax court found that mortensen did not carry his burden in proving that the commissioner assessment was erroneous or that mortensen did what a reasonably prudent person would have done under the circumstances.thus,the tax court affirmed the commissioner imposition of the negligence penalty under section a.mortensen appeals.for the following reasons,we affirm the tax court decision upholding the negligence penalty.
the history of these partnerships is complex.courts have described the partnerships in varying degrees of detail.see bales commissioner,cch,wl mekulsia commissioner,cir adams johnson,cir.additionally,the tax court below provided an excellent description of the partnerships.mortensen commissioner,ria,wl.we therefore only summarize the salient facts.
hoyt father was a prominent breeder of shorthorn cattle and in the late began promoting cattle breeding partnerships.when hoyt father died in,hoyt and other family members took over the partnerships and from through,hoyt organized,promoted,and operated more than one hundred cattle breeding partnerships.hoyt acted as the tax matters partner on each of the partnerships that were subject to the tax equity fiscal responsibility act of.see a,stat.hoyt was also the general partner and was responsible for the preparation of the tax returns for each partnership and he typically signed and filed each return.in addition,hoyt operated tax return preparation companies that prepared most of the investors individual tax returns.the relevant return,mortensen return,was prepared and signed by hoyt.hoyt was also a licensed enrolled agent,meaning that he was authorized,like a lawyer or cpa,to represent taxpayers and argue in proceedings before the internal revenue service.see adams,at hoyt was accredited by the irs as an enrolled agent,thereby permitting hoyt to prepare federal income tax returns for the partnership and to represent the partners in dealings with the irs.at the culmination of the irs investigation,hoyt and others were indicted for certain federal not tax a trial was held in oregon.the district court described hoyt crime as the most egregious white collar crime committed in the history of the state of oregon.hoyt was found guilty on all counts,sentenced to imprisonment,and ordered to pay restitution of million 
mortensen is college educated with a degree in engineering and during the relevant years was employed as a field engineer.at the time he invested in the partnerships,he had no significant investment experience and no experience with farming or cattle.mortensen first learned of the hoyt partnerships from a in late or early and along with four or five,requested an informational packet from the hoyt organization.mortensen received this packet which included various promotional materials prepared by the hoyt organization.these materials provided rationales for why the partnerships were good investments and why the tax savings were legitimate.the main document was titled hoyt and lb.tax shelter,and explained how the partnerships were designed to provide profits to partners over time.this document emphasized that the primary return on investment would be tax savings.see also adams,at each partner was expected to benefit from the partnership in two ways.first,hoyt assigned to each partner part of his cattle operation expenses,which the partners were able to claim as a tax deduction,lowering their tax liability on income from other sources.second,in later years the partnerships were expected to produce a profit as each partnership liquidated the livestock that it had been assigned.
the lb.tax shelter document contained various statements regarding the purported legality of the tax savings.after explaining the tax benefits,it stated now,can you feel good about not paying taxes,and feeling like you were not,somehow,abusing the system,or doing something illegal another section devoted to a discussion of irs audits stated that the partnerships would be branded an abuse by the internal revenue service and will be subject to automatic and constant audit.the document further compared the irs to children,included a cartoon depicting the irs as a native american preparing to attack the hs circle of wagons,and stated that irs employees did not have the proper experience and training or working knowledge of concepts required by the internal revenue code to properly evaluate the hoyt partnerships.
another section titled tax aspects contained a warning for investors 
out here,tax accountants do read brands,and our cowboys do read tax law.if you do have a tax man who knows you well enough to give you specific personal advice as to whether or not you belong in the cattle business,stay out.the cattle business today can not be separated from tax law any more than cattle can be separated from grass and water.do have anything to do with any aspect of the cattle business without thorough tax advice,and do waste much time trying to learn tax law from an offering circular.
emphasis added.despite its own warning,the circular devoted several pages to explaining the tax benefits of the hoyt partnerships and explained why investors should trust only hoyt organization to prepare their individual tax returns.
it is the recommendation of the general partner,as outlined in the private placement offering circular,that a prospective partner seek independent tax advice and counsel concerning this investment the limited partners should then authorize the tax office of hoyt sons to prepare their personal returns then you have an affiliate of the partnership preparing all personal and partnership returns and controlling all audit activity with the internal revenue service then,all partners are able to benefit from the concept of circle the wagons,and no individual partner can be isolated and have his tax losses disallowed because of the incompetence or lack of knowledge of a tax preparer who is not familiar with the law,regulations,format,procedures,and operations concerning the partnership that are required to protect the limited partners from internal revenue audits if a partner needs more or less partnership loss any year,it is arranged quickly within the office,without the partner having to pay a higher fee while an outside preparer spends more time to make the arrangements.
emphasis added.the document further warned that an audit or disallowance of the deductions by the commissioner could take away all or some of the tax benefits and that there would be a possibility that investors would have to pay back the tax savings plus interest and penalties.
mortensen testified that prior to investing,he conducted an investigation into the partnerships.specifically,mortensen testified that after receiving the informational packet from the hoyt partnerships,he mailed the packet to his father so that his father could show the information to a tax attorney.mortensen testified that his father told him that t he attorney looked over it and he said there was nothing illegal.mortensen testified that he did not know the attorney name,what research or investigation the attorney conducted,or essentially any other information that his father told him.
mortensen also testified that one of his decided to contact the irs for information before investing in the partnerships.the allegedly told mortensen that there was no indication from the irs that there was anything wrong with hoyt or anything like that.another traveled to california to go to hoyt offices and also to at least one ranch to be sure that it was a viable business and that there was actually people running a business and there was actually cows involved.
in july,mortensen invested in a hoyt partnership named durham genetic engineering.in december,mortensen signed several documents related to the partnership,including documents that assigned hoyt power of attorney and gave hoyt the ability to sign notes on mortensen behalf.mortensen also signed a document expressing his intent to make a capital contribution to and become a limited partner by purchasing units valued at.mortensen testified that at the time he made the investment,he believed that it would produce a profit and provide retirement income.mortensen also believed that he would be liable on the promissory notes,but believed that cattle existed that could be sold to cover the debt.
on mortensen return,the first year of his investment,he reported wage income of,interest income of,a partnership loss of and an investment credit of.this led to a zero tax liability.he later filed an amended return,listing the same wage and interest income,but now a partnership loss of.mortensen then filed a form,application for tentative refund,based on a carryback of a claimed net operating loss of from net operating losses may be carried back three years,and mortensen did so,resulting in a zero tax liability for,and and the refund of,and for those years.
starting with this first return and form in and through the return,hoyt or a member of the hoyt organization prepared mortensen tax forms.mortensen signed the returns without knowing how the items were calculated.he knew only that hoyt or a member of the hoyt organization had entered the items on schedules and on his return and he assumed their correctness.mortensen never had his returns reviewed by an accountant,lawyer,or anyone else outside the hoyt organization prior to signing and filing them.
throughout the years of mortensen involvement in the hoyt partnerships,his investment was transferred between various partnerships without him taking any action.mortensen testified that he believed that hoyt was using his power of attorney to do the necessary paperwork.he also testified that he believed one of the reasons for the changes was to maximize tax savings.hoyt did not provide mortensen with any type of verification when changes were made or any acknowledgment that his name was taken off promissory notes signed on his behalf.
during the years of his investments,mortensen made substantial cash payments to the hoyt organization.these payments totaled approximately and included the remittance of his tax refunds,the payment of quarterly and monthly installments on his promissory notes,special assessments imposed by the partnership,and contributions to purported individual retirement account plans maintained by the hoyt organization.in return,mortensen received only nominal amounts of his contributions back from the partnership 
for the first time,by letter dated may,the commissioner notified mortensen that partnerships sge taxable year was under review.this letter stated in part 
our information indicates that you were a partner in the above partnership during the above tax year.based upon our review of the partnership tax shelter activities,we have apprised the tax matters partner that we believe the purported tax shelter deductions credits are not allowable and,if claimed,we plan to examine the return and disallow the deductions credits.the internal revenue code provides,in appropriate cases,for the application of various penalties.
a similar letter dated may,notified mortensen that another of his hoyt partnerships was under review with respect to taxable year.
in late and,mortensen contacted the irs regarding the status of his refund.by letter,the commissioner notified mortensen that his through returns were being audited.
mortensen received additional notices from the commissioner related to various partnerships,including dsbs,the partnership at issue in mortensen tax return these notices were dated august,may,august,february,two notices,february,and february.
in,hoyt sent investors a copy of the tax court opinion in bales commissioner,cch,wl.hoyt claimed that the opinion was proof of the legality of the partnerships.mortensen testified that he did not read the entire opinion,but understood its basics,and relied upon information from hoyt in interpreting the opinion.
sometime in the early,mortensen began attending monthly meetings of hoyt partners that were held near his home.at these meetings,the investors would discuss various issues pertaining to the partnerships with other partners,including partners who had visited the ranches.based on his attendance at these meetings,mortensen considered himself actively aware of the proceedings of the business,and believed that he was materially participating in the partnership.
in january,the commissioner mailed hoyt investors a letter regarding the application of,the passive activity loss limitation provision.in response,hoyt mailed his investors a letter setting forth arguments as to why hoyt investors materially participated in their investments within the meaning of section.this letter asserted that the commissioner was incorrect and that the investors should do whatever necessary to materially participate in their investments at least to hours per year,depending on the circumstances.hoyt stated that time spent recruiting new investors and time spent reading and thinking about these letters counted toward the material participation requirement.
by letter dated february,the commissioner mailed the investors a response stating that i n hoyt letter misleading inaccurate premises were made which may directly affect you and your process in filing your individual tax return.the letter went on to state that hoyt had provided his investors with rulings and court cases superseded by section and were no longer relevant.the letter further informed investors that,contrary to hoyt claims,time spent reading and thinking about the letters did not count as material participation in their investments.the letter concluded by stating that the commissioner recommend s you consider having an independent accountant or attorney review this matter with you.
whenever mortensen received any correspondence from the commissioner,he would send copies to the hoyt organization.mortensen took no other action and never sought independent advice from an accountant or attorney.
mortensen also received from hoyt,numerous documents claiming to show the legitimacy of the partnerships and the legality of the tax claims made by the organization.the hoyt organization would portray irs employees as incompetent and claimed that they were engaging in unjust harassment of the hoyt investors.mortensen testified that he trusted these documents and believed and relied upon what the hoyt organization told him.he did not,however,seek independent advice.
after the february,notice from the commissioner regarding the examination of various partnerships that mortensen was involved in,the commissioner froze the refunds that mortensen had claimed on his and returns.nevertheless,on april,before filing his tax return,mortensen signed another series of documents evidencing his intent to invest in another partnership known as sge.
on his tax return,mortensen reported wage income of,interest income of,loss from partnership sge of,loss from dsbs of,capital gain of,farm income of,ira deduction of,adjusted gross income of,and a total tax liability of.the losses from the two partnerships were reported on schedules.the capital gain and ira deduction are derived from sge.mortensen attached a material participation statement claiming to have spent hours during working in various activities.hoyt signed the return as preparer on june,and mortensen signed it on july.
the commissioner ultimately issued a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment to mortensen with respect to dsbs that disallowed various deductions claimed on his return for.mortensen did not challenge the disallowance of the deductions.therefore,the commissioner made a computational adjustment against mortensen changing his claimed dsbs loss of to income of.this increased mortensen tax liability by.the commissioner then assessed a penalty pursuant to section a based on the determination that mortensen is liable for negligence or disregard of rules or regulations with respect to the amount of underpayment resulting from the dsbs computational adjustment.
mortensen challenged the commissioner assessment of the a penalty for negligence in the united states tax court.special trial judge goldberg held a trial where mortensen was the only witness to testify.after trial,the court issued a detailed page opinion upholding the commissioner determination.the court determined that mortensen was negligent in signing the power of attorney forms and in entering into the investment.mortensen commissioner,ria,wl.the court further concluded that mortensen was negligent in in claiming the hoyt partnership loss at issue in this case namely,the loss from dsbs.id.at,wl.the court rejected mortensen reasonable cause and good faith defenses as objectively unreasonable.id.at,wl.in sum,and o n the basis of the record before the court,it conclude d that petitioner actions in relation to the hoyt investment constituted a lack of due care and a failure to do what a reasonable or ordinarily prudent person would do under the circumstances.id.at,wl.the court found mortensen negligent with respect to entering into the investment and negligent with respect to claiming the dsbs loss on his return.id.mortensen now appeals to this court.
the only issue on appeal is whether the tax court erred in upholding the commissioner imposition of the a penalty for the tax year.
standard of review 
mortensen did not challenge the commissioner disallowance of the various deductions.the only challenge is to the assessment of the negligence penalty pursuant to section a.we review the factual findings of the tax court in this regard under the clearly erroneous standard.pasternak commissioner,cir citing leuhsler commissioner,cir see also roberson commissioner,wl at cir unpublished we reverse the tax court factual finding that the taxpayer acted negligently only if the tax court clearly erred.the commissioner decision to impose the negligence penalty is presumptively correct and the taxpayer has the burden of proving that he did not act negligently and that he did what a reasonably prudent person would have done under the circumstances.pasternak,at citing skeen commissioner,cir.the tax court finding that a taxpayer failed to meet his burden of proving due care is a finding of fact that this court reverses only if clearly erroneous.pasternak,at.
negligence 
a taxpayer is not required to be perfect for this would be an unrealistic expectation.even tax specialists can not be perfect.the code is complex.reasonable minds can differ over tax reporting and sometimes the irs disallows certain transactions.every time a transaction is challenged or disallowed,the taxpayer is not liable for penalties.only those taxpayers who fail to meet the applicable standard of do what a reasonable taxpayer would do under the be slapped with negligence penalties and interest.again,perfection is not required,but when the predators are circling,no reasonable ostrich sticks its head in the sand.see american ostrich association fact or fiction,available at.html head stating that ostriches do not stick their heads in the sand.the ostrich that does pays the penalty.
this court has defined negligence as lack of due care or failure to do what a reasonable and ordinarily prudent person would do under the circumstances.id.quoting leuhsler,at.negligence also includes any failure to make a reasonable attempt to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue code.roberson,wl at.negligence is strongly indicated when a taxpayer fails to make a reasonable attempt to ascertain the correctness of a deduction,credit or exclusion on a return which would seem to a reasonable and prudent person to be too good to be true under the circumstances.reg.b ii.thus,we judge mortensen conduct against that of the reasonable and ordinarily prudent person.
in applying the negligence standard,the tax court determined that mortensen was negligent both in entering into the investment and in reporting the losses for.the tax court cited mortensen decision to grant hoyt the authority to sign promissory notes on his behalf up to,as well as the authority to control the investments without any sort of confirmation or consultation.the court faulted mortensen for placing his trust entirely with the promoters of the investment and concluded that he did not adequately investigate either the legitimacy of the partnerships or the implications of the promissory notes.mortensen,ria,wl.this trust continued throughout,despite the constant switching of investments from partnership to partnership and without mortensen ever inquiring about or knowing the status of promissory notes signed on his behalf.id.
the tax court noted that from through,mortensen used the partnerships to report a total federal income tax liability of on income totaling.mortensen further filed the form purporting to completely eliminate his tax liabilities for the three years prior to his investment in the partnerships and resulting in a requested refund of.id.these large tax benefits were based solely on advice received from hoyt and mortensen never questioned the amounts on the returns and never had the returns reviewed by an independent tax professional.id.
the tax court also noted that the initial hoyt promotional materials included various warnings and advised mortensen to consult with an independent tax advisor.the court stated that mortensen 
failure to inquire is especially notable with respect to petitioner return and amended return.in preparing petitioner amended return for that year,the hoyt organization prepared a statement in which it was claimed that petitioner partnership interest had been switched from dge to sge.at that time,however,petitioner had signed partnership agreements and other documents pertaining only to sge the investment documents in the record show that petitioner did not invest in sge until april.
id.moreover,in the first year of his investment,mortensen was given a loss allocation of and did not question these amounts even though they purported to eliminate his tax liability for through.id.thus,the court found that mortensen should have been on notice from the beginning that something was amiss or that the tax savings were too good to be true and should have sought independent advice.
with regard to the return,the tax court noted that mortensen did not know how the reported losses were derived and knew only that hoyt reported them on mortensen schedules and his return.id.at,wl.mortensen claimed these losses despite the fact that the commissioner had been warning mortensen,at least since may,that there were potential problems with the tax claims being made on both the partnership returns and on mortensen returns.prior to signing his return,mortensen had received at least separate letters from the commissioner alerting him to suspected problems or alerting him to reviews that had been commenced with respect to various hoyt partnerships in which he was involved.id.at,wl.despite these warnings,mortensen did not further investigate the partnership losses and did not seek outside guidance before claiming them in full on his tax return.id.based on this,the tax court concluded that mortensen was negligent in in claiming the hoyt partnership loss at issue in this case namely,the loss from dsbs.id.
mortensen defenses to the negligence penalty 
section c states that the section a penalty is not imposed with respect to any portion of an underpayment if it is shown that there was a reasonable cause for such portion and that the taxpayer acted in good faith with respect to such portion.according to the treasury regulations,t he determination of whether a taxpayer acted with reasonable cause and in good faith is made on a basis,taking into account all pertinent facts and circumstances.reg.b.the most important factor in making this determination is the extent of the taxpayer effort to ascertain his proper tax liability.
pursuant to section c,mortensen claims that he reasonably investigated and relied on others who similarly investigated.the supreme court has held that good faith reliance on professional advice concerning the tax laws may be a defense to negligence.united states boyle,d.in order for reliance on professional tax advice to be reasonable,however,the advice must generally be from a competent and independent advisor unburdened with a conflict of interest and not from promoters of the investment.pasternak,at although petitioners argue that they relied on advice of financial advisors,industry experts,and professionals,the purported experts were either promoters themselves or agents of the promoters.advice of such persons can hardly be described as that of independent professionals.barlow commissioner,cir noting that courts have found that a taxpayer is negligent if he puts his faith in a scheme that,on its face,offers improbably high tax advantages,without obtaining an objective,independent opinion on its validity illes commissioner,cir finding negligence where taxpayer relied on person with financial interest in the venture goldman commissioner,cir rybak commissioner,wl sustaining negligence penalty where taxpayers relied solely on advice of persons not independent of investment promoters.in addition,the taxpayer must demonstrate that any expert opinion relied upon was rendered by the expert with knowledge of the pertinent facts necessary to render such advice.barlow,at r eliance must be reasonable and the taxpayer must show that the accountant had all the necessary information to make an informed decision.citations omitted.
mortensen first claims reasonable reliance based on information provided by hoyt and representatives of the hoyt organization.as the above citations demonstrate,however,essentially all courts have found reliance on the promoters of the investment insufficient to support a good faith defense.secondly,as the tax court found,there is no evidence that mortensen ever sought advice regarding his deductions,but rather,when he received his schedule and tax returns,assumed that they were correct.even assuming that mortensen received and relied upon advice from the hoyt organization,hoyt and his organization created and promoted the partnership,they completed petitioner tax return,and they received the bulk of the tax benefits from doing so.for petitioner to trust hoyt or members of his organization for tax advice to prepare his return under these circumstances was inherently unreasonable.mortensen,ria,wl 
mortensen further points to hoyt enrolled agent status and claims that he reasonably relied upon a person certified by the irs to practice before it.enrolled agents are required to pass an exam given by the irs demonstrating their competence prior to being accredited as enrolled agents.as we stated earlier,hoyt was an enrolled agent,accredited by the irs to prepare federal tax returns for the partnerships and to represent partners in proceedings before the irs.see also adams,at.enrolled agent status is certainly relevant in proceedings before the service.a taxpayer reliance on an enrolled agent advice,however,does not insulate the taxpayer from negligence penalties.an enrolled agent is not a representative of the irs,but is merely an individual authorized to appear before the service.much like a taxpayer reliance on an attorney or an accountant,reliance on an enrolled agent is a factor we may consider in determining the reasonableness of a taxpayer actions,but in circumstances such as these,where the enrolled agent is also the promoter of the investment,any purported reliance is of little to no value.
aside from his reliance on persons with a conflict of interest,mortensen also claims to have made a investigation and points to it as sufficient to support his reasonable cause claim.as part of this investigation,mortensen points to three actions reliance on the opinion of his father tax attorney,reliance on his alleged contact with the irs,and reliance on his trip to the hoyt offices.the tax court assumed the veracity of mortensen claims,but nevertheless,rejected mortensen claim that he reasonably relied upon any advice from a tax professional concerning the hoyt investment.mortensen,ria,wl.we find no error in the tax court conclusion.
mortensen first claims that he relied on his father tax attorney.the crux of this claim is that mortensen mailed his father the informational packet he initially received from hoyt and his father gave it to a tax professional to review.according to mortensen testimony,his father told him that t he attorney looked over it and he said there was nothing illegal.id.the tax court found that mortensen testimony on this point was vague and lacked any degree of detail.id.mortensen was unable to explain what information the tax professional relied upon,did not know his name or even if it was a tax accountant or tax lawyer,and had no written statement from the professional.in sum,the tax court found that petitioner did not reasonably rely on any advice that he received from the professional through his father because any such advice was not provided by someone who had all the necessary information to make an informed decision,and because the advice was conclusory and did not address any of the specific risks involved in an investment,including the tax risks.id.at.the tax court conclusion is with this court decisions.in barlow,this court held that the taxpayer failed to show that he acted reasonably or that the tax professional had all the information to make an informed decision.barlow,at.in roberson,this court likewise rejected the taxpayer claim where he could not demonstrate the tax preparer knowledge of or expertise in the particular investment field or that the preparer made any investigation of the bona fides of the investment.roberson,wl at.moreover,this court rejected roberson reliance on accountants who prepared his tax returns for two years because they neither evaluated the merits of the claimed tax credits and deductions,nor made any inquiries into the bona fides of the investment.id.thus,there is no support for the conclusion that the tax court clearly erred in rejecting mortensen purported reliance on the alleged tax professional.
mortensen next points to his alleged contact with the irs.this apparently told mortensen that there was no indication from the irs that there was anything wrong with hoyt or anything like that.mortensen,ria.the tax court found that the record is completely devoid of any detail concerning what information he provided to the irs or what information he received in return.id.at.finally,mortensen claims that another traveled to a hoyt ranch to confirm that there were actually cows and an operating business.with regard to this factor,the tax court found that there has been no suggestion that this coworker had any background in cattle ranching or was otherwise qualified to investigate the hoyt organization.the tax court decision to reject these two purported good faith reliance claims is likewise consistent with this court case law.see,leuhsler,at holding that even unsophisticated investors can not escape a negligence penalty by claiming reliance on the advice of those who are not professional investment counselors.again,there is no evidence that the tax court clearly erred in its conclusion.
the tax court further found that even if mortensen did rely on these individuals,this reliance was five years before the return at issue.in the intervening time,mortensen took large deductions nearly wiping out his tax liability from through.according to the tax court,in light of the large losses claimed by the partnerships,the discrepancies in the partnerships in which petitioner was involved,and the continuous warnings being sent by the commissioner,mortensen reliance was unreasonable under the circumstances.
