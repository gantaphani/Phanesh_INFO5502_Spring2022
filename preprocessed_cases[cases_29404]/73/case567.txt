this opinion addresses separate appeals from two district court cases involving the same parties and almost identical issues.plaintiff,living care alternatives of utica,living care,appeals district court decisions affirming the internal revenue service appeals office decisions to allow tax liens and levies on living care property for unpaid employment taxes for various periods between and.these appeals require an interpretation of the new internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of,stat.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
summary of facts 
living care owns and operates a nursing home facility in licking county,ohio,which has approximately beds and forty employees and receives ninety percent of its revenue from medicare and medicaid billing.this revenue totals approximately per month.since the,living care has struggled to comply with its tax obligations.the taxes at issue in the instant cases are payroll taxes withheld from employees paychecks and held in trust by the employer until payments are made to the government.from to,living care has intermittently failed to forward the required taxes to the irs.living care i,case involves annual payments for tax year and quarterly payments in and living care ii,case involves annual payments for tax years,and and quarterly taxes for various quarters in,and under a previous levy around or,living care entered into an installment agreement with the irs,but defaulted in.the total current liability including interest and penalties is approximately,although living care points out it has paid its newly accrued taxes since july.
in may and may,the government sent notices of federal tax liens and notices of intent to levy to living care,along with a notice of the taxpayer right to request a hearing before the irs appeals office,which the taxpayer timely invoked.collection due process hearings were conducted by phone in march living care ii,case and december living care i,case.notice of determination letters denying living care claims were mailed june and march,respectively.living care appealed these decisions separately to the district court for the southern district of ohio.in both cases,which were heard by different judges,the courts affirmed the irs see living care alternatives of utica,united states living care i,wl,living care alternatives of utica,united states living care ii,d.living care now appeals these decisions.
judicial review of collection due process proceedings 
collection due process hearings were created by the internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of,stat.the restructuring and reform act the method or standards for judicial review of these hearings is not yet settled,hence the problems in these cases.prior to this act,the irs had the right to levy on taxpayer property without any prior opportunity for a hearing or procedural due process,so long as procedures were provided.the supreme court sustained this approach almost years ago.see phillips commissioner.while passage of the restructuring and reform act does indicate congress intent to provide taxpayers with additional protection in the form of procedures prior to irs action,it must be interpreted in this historical context.tax liens and levies are not typical collection actions the irs has much greater latitude and leeway than a normal creditor.see generally leslie book,the collection due process rights a misstep or a step in the right direction hous.discussing the history of due process in tax collection proceedings.
the tax code grants taxpayers the right to a hearing both on notice of lien and on notice of levy.see b b.proceedings are informal and may be conducted via correspondence,over the phone or face to face.see reg.c,q.no transcript,recording,or other direct documentation of the proceeding is required.see id,q.taxpayers do have a right to an impartial hearing officer who has had no prior involvement with respect to the unpaid tax before the first hearing.b.a taxpayer may challenge his underlying tax liability at the collection due process hearing,only if he did not receive any statutory notice of deficiency for such tax liability or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dispute such tax liability.c b.any other relevant issue relating to the unpaid tax may be raised during the hearing,including spousal defenses,challenges to the appropriateness of collection actions,and alternative collection options such as posting of a bond,installment agreements,or offers in compromise.c a.by statute,the irs appeals officer must conduct a verification that the irs has met all legal requirements and fulfilled its procedural obligations to move forward with the lien or levy,consider defenses and collection alternatives proffered by the taxpayer and,make a determination that the proposed collection action balances the need for the efficient collection of taxes with the legitimate concern of the person that any collection action be no more intrusive than necessary.c emphasis added.this final balancing factor is novel in american tax law and injects into the calculus an equitable consideration for the taxpayer and his concerns.not surprisingly,the taxpayer in the instant cases relies quite heavily on this factor in its arguments for relief.
on completion of his review,the appeals officer sends his final decision to the taxpayer in a notice of determination letter.the statutes then allow for judicial review of this determination by whatever federal court has jurisdiction over the underlying tax either the tax court or the district courts.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo both the parties and the district court judges in these cases agreed that it was proper to review the irs appeals office de novo with respect to decisions about the underlying tax liability and for abuse of discretion with respect to all other decisions,see bartley united states,but the parties disagreed about whether the underlying liability was actually challenged in these cases.see part,infra.finally,the district court may only review issues that were originally raised in the collection due process hearing.see reg.f.
judicial review of collection due process hearings presents a real problem for reviewing courts.congress overlaid the restructuring and reform act on a previous system that involved very little judicial oversight.the result is a surprisingly scant record,comprised almost exclusively of the parties appellate briefs and the notice of determination letter.no transcript or official record of the hearing is required and,accordingly,one rarely exists.since normal review of administrative decisions requires the existence of a record,see citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d,overruled on unrelated grounds by califano sanders,d,congress must have been contemplating a more deferential review of these tax appeals than of more formal agency decisions.this might explain why,of six collection due process cases reviewed by the sixth circuit,five have been disposed of under our court rule and all six have been unpublished.none has overturned the irs decision or required a remand.see herip united states.cir unpublished minion commissioner,wl cir,unpublished wasson commissioner,wl cir,unpublished hauck commissioner,wl cir.may,unpublished brown commissioner,wl cir,unpublished diefenbaugh weiss,wl cir,unpublished.
ii.living care claims 
living care raises four identical claims in each case.they will therefore be analyzed together.
district court applied an incorrect standard of review 
living care agrees with the government that,in order to receive a de novo review of the appeals officers decisions,it had to have challenged the validity of the underlying tax liability at the collection due process hearings.otherwise,the appeals officers decisions are reviewed for abuse of discretion 
living care evidence that it challenged the validity of the underlying liability is exceptionally weak.one of the notice of determination letters does not mention this issue at all and the other states the underlying tax was not challenged.living care therefore argues that the appeals officers misconstrued and misunderstood its attempts to challenge the tax.
in large part,its argument is based on the premise that nursing homes are different.living care facility receives almost all of its income from government programs medicare and medicaid that require strict compliance with comprehensive regulatory regimes.these regimes limit the possibility for profit,control and limit admission of new patients,and mandate high standards in the areas of staffing,food,and medical care.living care argues that the regulatory regime became particularly oppressive starting in the mid.
these government mandated changes resulted in living care not being able to pay all its withholding obligations.the government required that living care meet the increased mandated care requirements and staffing requirements.living care did this and when the decision had to be made between paying for resident care and taxes,living care paid for the food,utilities,medications,staffing etc sic and delayed the payment of were not simply refused or neglected.
living care proof br.case at.living care maintains that it relied on the above argument during the collection due process hearings and that this argument was equivalent to challenging the underlying liability itself furthermore,it argues that the identical requests in its complaints to the district courts that the tax liability be removed also constituted a challenge to the validity of the liability.
the plain meaning of challenging validity of the underlying tax liability requires more than the taxpayer actions in these cases.passionately arguing that it is bad public policy to tax a nursing home that was trying in good faith to comply with a comprehensive regulatory scheme is not the same as challenging the validity of the tax.similarly,requesting that a district court remove a tax liability does not constitute a claim at the irs hearing and is not an assertion that the liability was not valid in the first place to the contrary,it seems to be admitting it was valid and then requesting that payment be excused.therefore,all aspects of the appeals officers decisions are reviewed for abuse of discretion.
abuse of discretion in the balancing analysis 
the tax code requires that an irs appeals officer,in making a final determination after a collection due process hearing,decide whether any proposed collection action balances the need for the efficient collection of taxes with the legitimate concern of the taxpayer that any collection action be no more intrusive than necessary.c c there is little discussion or guidance about this requirement in legal scholarship or case law.but see,book,the collection due process rights,supra,at.in most cases,reviewing courts have merely affirmed the appeals officer determination that he conducted the balancing test and that he found the results to be consistent with the decision to proceed with levying the property.see,jackling irs,d elkins united states,cdl,wl.one notable exception to this pattern is found in mesa oil,united states,no,wl,unpublished,where an oil company fell behind in its payroll tax deposits over a six quarter period,totaling about.there the district court,reviewing an irs appeals officer collection due process hearing and notice of determination,remanded the case to the irs for development of a more complete record and clarification of the reasoning behind the determination that the balancing test was met.the court was especially concerned that the notice of determination included no statement of facts,no legal analysis,and no explanation of how or why the proposed levy balanced the need for collection with the taxpayer interests but merely a blank recitation of the statute.id.at accord cox united states,d citing positively mesa oil remand for further development of the record and ruling that balancing did not occur because the irs erroneously believed taxpayer was ineligible for installment agreement.mesa oil remand is an exception to the general practice of reviewing courts showing deference to appeals officers conclusions regarding the balancing analysis.
in the instant appeals,living care presents three related arguments to support its claim that the balancing test was not met,or more accurately,that the appeals officers abused their discretion in conducting the balancing test.first,living care claims the appeals officers failed to include the existence of senior lienholders in their balancing analyses,in spite of the discussion of this fact during the hearings second,the officers failed to consider that,because of these senior lienholders,the net effect of an irs levy would be to shut down the business without generating any tax revenue for the government.since the irs liens would be junior to existing creditors and the existing debt exceeded the value of the property,the irs would collect nothing.finally,in its reply brief in the living care ii case case,living care correctly alleges,albeit for the first time,that the irs has a statutory duty to investigate,prior to executing a levy,the existence of liens on the property and determine that the equity in such property is sufficient to yield net proceeds from the sale of such property to apply to taxpayer liability.j c.
the government first responds that the appeals officers were aware of the other lienholders,as evidenced by the statement in the notice of determination from living care i that i f the business sells,proceeds will be distributed according to priority of claims.lien priority.in living care ii,the government argues that living care request for hearing makes no mention of these senior liens and that there is no evidence they were mentioned during the hearing.the lack of evidence from the hearing is potentially misleading since there is no formal record of the hearing and the government itself prepared the only account of what was discussed.the government stronger argument,made in the alternative,is that even if the senior liens were raised and ignored,there is no requirement that the government consider in its balancing analysis whether it will receive any revenue from a levy and sale,or whether the business will have to close down due to the levy and sale.it cites several cases for these propositions.see medlock united states,d cardinal healthcare,united states,wl.july,kitchen cabinets,united states,no,wl.the case law supports the proposition that the government is not required to continue subsidizing failing businesses by foregoing tax collection.any other conclusion would create a bizarre tax system with perverse incentives for businesses to maintain themselves on the edge of insolvency in order to enjoy immunity from tax enforcement.
the government response to living care statutory argument which the government first offered at oral argument since living care first raised the statute in its reply brief is that the statutory duty has not yet arisen.all that the statute requires is that the irs investigate the equity in a property prior to levying on it,not prior to the collection due process hearing.the only court that has apparently addressed this issue did so in the context of the collection due process verification requirement and agreed that the statutory investigation was not required prior to a collection due process hearing.in medlock,d at,the district court said 
appeals officer rich was not required,during the collection due process appeal process,to determine whether the equity in medlock property was sufficient to yield net proceeds or investigate the status of medlock property according to the plain language of the relevant statutory sections,f and j these actions must be taken before a taxpayer property may be levied upon by the irs but are prematurely raised at this stage of the collection process.appeals officer rich alleged failure to perform those actions therefore does not constitute a violation of the collection due process statutes.
we agree with this reasoning and find no statutory violation arising from the irs failure to investigate at this time the available equity in the taxpayer property.this failure can not,therefore,provide the basis for overturning the appeals officers balancing analyses or final decisions
