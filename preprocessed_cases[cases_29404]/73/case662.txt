this is the third appeal arising out of an effort by the internal revenue service irs to enforce administrative summonses against bdo seidman,llp bdo,an accounting firm that allegedly failed to disclose potentially abusive tax shelters that it promoted.see united states bdo seidman,cir bdo ii united states bdo seidman,wl cir,bdo i.the irs now appeals the district court ruling that sustained bdo claim of privilege with respect to a memorandum written by one of bdo employees.the irs also appeals a separate ruling that sustained the tax practitioner privilege asserted by a number of bdo clients intervenors with respect to documents.the intervenors the district court ruling that one document,document,fell within the exception to the tax practitioner privilege.for the reasons set for forth in this opinion,we affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.
backgrounda.the enforcement action 
in september,the irs received information suggesting that bdo was promoting potentially abusive tax shelters without complying with the internal revenue code irc listing requirements for such tax shelters.see a,a bdo ii,at.potentially abusive tax shelters included those transactions defined as tax shelters under c and arrangements identified by regulation as potentially abusive under b organizers of any potentially abusive tax shelter were required to maintain a list of persons to whom an interest in the shelter was sold.see a.additionally,organizers and sellers of c tax shelters were required to register the tax shelter with the irs.see id.a.failure to follow these registration and requirements was sanctionable by penalties.see id,
the irs commenced a compliance investigation into bdo alleged violations.the irs issued twenty summonses commanding production of documents,testimony relating to the transactions and information on the identity of the clients who had invested in the transactions.bdo ii,at.when bdo resisted these summonses,the irs petitioned the united states district court for the northern district of illinois for enforcement.id.at.bdo contended that the summonses could not be enforced because the investigation had no legitimate purpose.it also contended that the summonses were overbroad,issued in bad faith and sought information already in the irs possession.lastly,bdo submitted that the information sought was irrelevant to the investigation.id.at.bdo further asserted that a number of the documents were protected by the privilege,the tax practitioner privilege under a or work product protection.bdo ii,at.the district court ruled that the irs had issued the summonses in good faith and that enforcement would not constitute an abuse of process.it ordered bdo to produce all responsive documents except for those previously listed on privilege logs and submitted to the court by bdo for in camera inspection.id.at.
bdo then notified its clients that it intended to produce documents that would reveal their identities to the irs.in response,a number of clients sought to intervene as of right in order to assert the tax practitioner privilege under a the district court denied the motions to intervene,holding that the tax practitioner privilege would not prevent disclosure of the clients names.see bdo ii,at.the clients appealed this denial to this court.
on december,we entered an order remanding the case to the district court to permit it to undertake an in camera inspection of the documents for which the anonymous intervenors asserted a privilege.see bdo i,wl,at.we ordered the district court to make more extensive findings with respect to the claim of tax practitioner privilege for each document,taking into account the totality of the circumstances.id.after conducting this in camera review,the district court determined that the tax practitioner privilege did not prevent disclosure of the clients identities.at.the clients again appealed,and we affirmed the district court ruling on the question of privilege and its denial of the motions to intervene.bdo ii,at.
after our decision affirming the district court denial of the anonymous clients motion to intervene,the intervenors sought intervention as of right in order to assert a claim of privilege under the privilege,tax practitioner privilege or work product doctrine with respect to documents.the irs filed a document titled united states concurrence in intervenors motions to intervene and challenge to claims of privilege in which it argued that the district court should grant the motion,or,in the alternative,deny the claim of privilege.the irs and the intervenors also filed a joint motion in which the irs consented to the intervention and the parties set forth a proposed briefing schedule.on july,the district court granted the intervenors motion.
intervenors claims 
the intervenors asserted privilege,tax practitioner privilege or work product protection with respect to documents.the irs submitted that the documents either were not covered by the tax practitioner privilege under the tax shelter exception found in b,as it existed at the time of the communications,or that the documents fell within the exception to both the and tax practitioner privileges.
according to the irs,bdo,in conjunction with other firms,had engaged in the practice of selling prepackaged tax shelters,the sole purpose of which was the unlawful attempt to evade tax liability.the district court determined that the irs had failed to make a prima facie showing of crime or fraud that would justify a blanket determination that all of the documents fell within the exception.at.the court noted that,just because the irs characterized the transactions as abusive and unlawful cookie cutter tax shelters,such a characterization did not make them so.id.at.the court added that the question of whether bdo and the intervenors had violated the irc was the ultimate issue in the irs investigation and that a finding of fraud based solely on the irs allegations would place the proverbial cart before the horse.id.in a footnote,the district court added that,based on these same considerations,it could not hold that the intervenors or bdo were engaged in tax shelters which would fall within the tax shelter exception to the tax practitioner privilege.id.at.
although the district court was unwilling to apply the exception in blanket fashion,it proceeded to review each document in camera to determine whether individual documents fell within the exception.id.at.in conducting the review,the district court looked to the totality of the circumstances to determine whether there was sufficient evidence of crime or fraud to bring a document within this exception.id.at.to guide this evaluation,the district court identified eight,potential indicators of fraud which it drew from arguments made by the irs,from two other cases involving allegedly fraudulent practices by bdo and from an unrelated irs enforcement action against another accounting firm.at based on these cases and other factors that the irs had submitted were indicative of fraud,the district court arrived at the following eight factors to guide its in camera review of each of the documents 
the marketing of transactions by bdo the communication by the intervenors to bdo with the purpose of engaging in a transaction developed by bdo or a third party with the sole purpose of reducing taxable income bdo the intervenors attempting to conceal the true nature of the transaction knowledge by bdo,or a situation where bdo should have known,that the intervenors lacked a legitimate business purpose for entering into the transaction vaguely worded consulting agreements failure by bdo to provide services under the consulting agreement yet receipt of payment mention of the cobra transaction and use of documents.
at.the court further noted that the presence of these factors alone would not be sufficient to establish a prima facie case of fraud.see id.at.rather,the potential indicators of fraud were intended to serve merely as guideposts.see id.at.the ultimate question of whether a prima facie showing of crime or fraud had been made with respect to a particular document was to be determined under the totality of circumstances.
based on this review,the district court held that,with the exception of document,the irs had failed to make a prima facie showing of a crime or fraud.id.at.thus,the district court upheld the intervenors claim of privilege with respect to of the documents,although it did not specify which privilege or tax practitioner applied to each document.see id.at.
after finding prima facie evidence that document fell within the exception,the district court permitted the intervenors to provide an explanation that would negate the evidence of crime or fraud.id.at.the intervenors provided their explanation to the court and the irs responded.on may,after finding the intervenors explanation insufficient to rebut the prima facie evidence of crime or fraud,the district court ruled that document fell within the exception to the tax practitioner or privilege.at.
after the district court issued its final ruling with respect to document,the court of appeals for the second circuit reversed the decision of the united states district court for the southern district of new york in denney jenkens gilchrist,d.see denney bdo seidman,cir.the intervenors moved for reconsideration under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,arguing that,because the district court had relied on denney when establishing the factors that would guide its in camera review of each document,the court should reexamine its earlier ruling.at.the district court denied the motion,holding that the second circuit decision did not affect the controlling law in this case.id.at.the court added that its finding of prima facie evidence of crime or fraud was based on the totality of the circumstances,an inquiry guided,but not controlled,by the eight factors it previously had identified.id.at.
bdo privilege claims 
while its clients were seeking to intervene to protect their claims of privilege,bdo asserted its own claims of privilege and work product protection with respect to documents.the irs responded that the documents were neither protected communications nor work product,and,even if they were,the documents fell within the exception.at.after conducting an in camera inspection of each document,the district court determined that of the documents were within the privilege and that one other document,though not covered by the privilege,fell within the work product doctrine.id.at.however,the court concluded that six documents,as submitted to the court in redacted form,were not within the privilege and ordered their disclosure as so redacted.id.at.based on the same in camera review,the district court found no evidence that the communications in documents protected by the privilege or work product doctrine were made to further a crime or fraud.id.at.
one of the documents that the district court had found to fall within the privilege was a memorandum written by michael kerekes kerekes memorandum.kerekes was a lawyer and partner at bdo.in august,he wrote a memorandum to bdo outside counsel,david dreier,a tax attorney with the law firm of white case llp,requesting legal advice on pending irs regulations.in january,donna guerin,an attorney at the law firm of jenkens gilchrist,received a copy of the memorandum under circumstances that remain the subject of dispute at the time attorney guerin received the kerekes memorandum,jenkens gilchrist did not represent bdo,but these two entities,one an accounting firm and the other a law firm,serviced jointly clients on the same or related matters.according to attorney guerin,she received the letter from bdo as input into an opinion letter regarding tax shelters that jenkens gilchrist was preparing for both bdo and their common clients.although bdo and jenkens gilchrist subsequently were in civil litigation,see,denney jenkens gilchrist,d,there was no litigation pending against bdo or jenkens gilchrist at the time attorney guerin received the kerekes memorandum.
after the district court ruling on bdo claim of privilege for the documents,the irs received the kerekes memorandum from jenkens gilchrist in response to a subpoena.upon viewing the memorandum,the irs requested the court reconsider its privilege ruling with respect to the kerekes memorandum.the irs asserted that the document fell within the exception to the privilege or,alternatively,that the privilege had been waived.based on its prior in camera review of the document,the district court rejected the irs claim that the kerekes memorandum fell within the exception.at.the court noted that,even though the contents of the kerekes memorandum were new to the irs,they were not new to the court,and it had considered the arguments presented by the irs in its prior in camera review of the kerekes memorandum.the district court further held that disclosure of the kerekes memorandum to attorney guerin did not waive bdo claim of privilege because the memorandum related to a common legal interest shared by bdo and jenkens gilchrist and therefore fell within the common interest doctrine.id.at.the district court added that it would reach the same conclusion even if the common interest doctrine did not apply because it had found ample precedent to sustain the privilege as an unintentional disclosure.id.
discussion 
the irs timely appealed the district court ruling with respect to the kerekes memorandum.the irs contends that bdo waived any claim of privilege with respect to the memorandum when it disclosed the document to attorney guerin.the irs submits that the common interest doctrine does not apply because the communication was not made in anticipation of litigation.it further contends that the disclosure was voluntary,and,therefore,bdo can not claim that the privilege is preserved because any disclosure was inadvertent.alternatively,the irs contends that the district court erred by not reconsidering its ruling that there was no evidence of crime or fraud in connection with the kerekes memorandum after it found such evidence with respect to document.
the irs also appeals the district court ruling that the tax shelter exception to the tax practitioner privilege,b,does not apply to the documents for which the intervenors claimed the privilege.the irs contends that the burden was on the intervenors to prove that the tax shelter exception did not apply,a burden the irs claims the intervenors did not meet.
the intervenors the district court finding of prima facie evidence of crime or fraud with respect to document.the intervenors submit that the district court finding was in error because the irs failed to make a prima facie showing of each element of a particular crime or common law fraud.
a.the kerekes memorandum 
we first shall address whether the district court erred in sustaining bdo claim of privilege under the common interest doctrine and in rejecting the irs position that the kerekes memorandum fell within the exception to the privilege.
we review all necessary findings of fact and all applications of law to fact in connection with the district court ruling on a privilege claim for clear error.see united states frederick,cir application of law to fact united states evans,cir findings of fact.we shall reverse only if,on review of the entire evidence,we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.malachinski comm r,cir quoting coleman comm r,cir internal quotation marks omitted.on the other hand,the scope of a privilege is a question of law that we review de novo.see bdo ii,at.we review a district court decision regarding the exception for an abuse of discretion.united states,cir.
in federal courts,except when state law supplies the applicable rule of law,the privilege is governed by the principles of the common law as it may be interpreted by the courts of the united states in the light of reason and experience.although it ultimately was not adopted by congress,the rule of privilege promulgated by the supreme court in as part of the proposed federal rules of evidence has been recognized as a source of general guidance regarding federal common law principles.in re grand jury investigation,cir see also jack weinstein margaret berger,weinstein federal evidence joseph mclaughlin,ed.proposed rule provided 
a client has a privilege to refuse to disclose and to prevent any other person from disclosing confidential communications made for the purpose of facilitating the rendition of professional legal services to the client,between himself or his representative and his lawyer or his lawyer representative,or between his lawyer and the lawyer representative,or by him or his lawyer to a lawyer representing another in a matter of common interest,or between representatives of the client or between the client and a representative of the client,or between lawyers representing the client.
see proposed.b.put simply,in order for the privilege to attach,the communication in question must be made in confidence in connection with the provision of legal services to an attorney and in the context of an relationship.
the purpose of the privilege is to encourage full disclosure and to facilitate open communication between attorneys and their clients.bdo ii,at.open communication assists lawyers in rendering legal advice,not only to represent their clients in ongoing litigation,but also to prevent litigation by advising clients to conform their conduct to the law and by addressing legal concerns that may inhibit clients from engaging in otherwise lawful and socially beneficial activities.see frederick,at.the cost of these benefits is the withholding of relevant information from the courts.bdo ii,at.
recognizing the inherent tension between the beneficial goals of the privilege and the courts right to every person evidence,the courts have articulated the following principles to inform our analysis of the scope of the common interest doctrine 
c ourts construe the privilege to apply only where necessary to achieve its purpose.id.
only those communications which reflect the lawyer thinking or are made for the purpose of eliciting the lawyer professional advice or other legal assistance fall within the privilege.frederick,at.
because one of the objectives of the privilege is assisting clients in conforming their conduct to the law,litigation need not be pending for the communication to be made in connection to the provision of legal services.see united states schwimmer,cir.
because the privilege is in derogation of the search for truth,any exceptions to the requirements of the privilege must be strictly confined.in re grand jury proceedings thullen,cir.
although occasionally termed a privilege itself,the common interest doctrine is really an exception to the rule that no privilege attaches to communications between a client and an attorney in the presence of a third person.see robinson texas auto.dealers ass n.in effect,the common interest doctrine extends the privilege to otherwise communications in limited circumstances.for that reason,the common interest doctrine only will apply where the parties undertake a joint effort with respect to a common legal interest,and the doctrine is limited strictly to those communications made to further an ongoing enterprise.see evans,at.other than these limits,however,the common defense doctrine does not contract the privilege.thus,communications need not be made in anticipation of litigation to fall within the common interest doctrine applying the common interest doctrine to the full range of communications otherwise protected by the privilege encourages parties with a shared legal interest to seek legal assistance in order to meet legal requirements and to plan their conduct accordingly.see in re regents of the of california.this planning serves the public interest by advancing compliance with the law,facilitating the administration of justice and averting litigation.id.at.reason and experience demonstrate that joint venturers,no less than individuals,benefit from planning their activities based on sound legal advice predicated upon open communication.
having determined that bdo is not barred from asserting privilege under the common interest doctrine simply because it was not shared under the threat of litigation,we next shall determine whether the district court ruling on bdo claim of privilege was clearly erroneous.the district court recognized that the scope of the common interest doctrine is limited to a common legal interest to which the parties formed a common strategy.see at.the district court concluded that bdo and jenkens gilchrist,acting as joint venturers,shared a common legal interest in ensuring compliance with the new regulation issued by the irs,and in making sure that they could defend their product against potential irs enforcement actions.
there was,moreover,sufficient evidence to support the district court determination in this regard.the kerekes memorandum originally was addressed to bdo outside counsel,white case,and it sought advice on a legal question.at the time attorney guerin received the kerekes memorandum,bdo and jenkens gilchrist jointly serviced a number of common clients with respect to certain tax products.according to guerin,robert greisman,a partner at bdo,sent her the memorandum as part of bdo effort to coordinate with jenkens gilchrist a common legal position that bdo and jenkens gilchrist would communicate later to these common clients 
nonetheless,the irs asserts that,because the purpose of the communication was to coordinate the content of the message to their common clients,the communication between bdo and jenkens gilchrist was not made for the purpose of securing advice with respect to a common legal interest and,therefore,was not within the scope of the common interest doctrine.however,even if the ultimate reason for sharing the kerekes memorandum was to advance the joint interests of bdo and jenkens gilchrist in their representations to their common clients,it does not follow that the communication itself was not made to secure legal advice with respect to a common legal interest.communications do not cease to be for the purpose of receiving legal services just because the recipient intended to use the fruits of the legal services to guide its relations with customers.in essence,through the memorandum,two joint venturers,bdo and jenkens gilchrist,undertook a consultation between their respective counsel and bdo outside counsel with respect to the legality of the proposed financial course of action they would recommend to their common clients.this effort,as the district court recognized,was clearly within the scope of the common interest doctrine.
the district court findings do not leave us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.malachinski,at quoting coleman,at internal quotation marks omitted.the district court finding that the communication of the kerekes memorandum to attorney guerin was within the common interest doctrine was not clearly erroneous.further,because the privileged status of communications falling within the common interest doctrine can not be waived without the consent of all of the parties,jenkens gilchrist subsequent voluntary disclosure of the kerekes memorandum in response to the irs subpoena did not waive bdo claim of privilege.see john morrell local union of the united food commercial workers,cir in re grand jury subpoenas,john doe,cir see also advisory committee note,proposed.b,
we now address whether the district court erred when it held that the intervenors could not assert a privilege with respect to document because the document fell within the exception to the and tax practitioner privileges.we review a district court decision regarding the exception for an abuse of discretion,at.
the exception places communications made in furtherance of a crime or fraud outside the privilege.united states zolin,d.the exception is based on the recognition that the privilege necessarily will protect the confidences of wrongdoers.id.at.this cost is accepted as necessary to achieve the privilege purpose of promoting the broader public interests in the observance of law and the administration of justice.id.quoting upjohn united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.however,when the advice sought relates not to prior wrongdoing,but to future wrongdoing,the privilege goes beyond what is necessary to achieve its beneficial purposes.id.at.quoting john henry wigmore,evidence in trials at common law john mcnaughton internal quotation marks omitted emphasis in original.
to invoke the exception,the party seeking to abrogate the privilege must present prima facie evidence that gives colour to the charge by showing some foundation in fact,at quoting clark united states.internal quotation marks omitted.the party seeking to abrogate the privilege meets its burden by bringing forth sufficient evidence to justify the district court in requiring the proponent of the privilege to come forward with an explanation for the evidence offered against it.see united states davis,cir.the privilege will remain if the district court finds the explanation satisfactory.id.
bdo and the intervenors would require the party seeking to abrogate the privilege to make out a prima facie case of each element of a particular crime or common law fraud to invoke the exception.such a burden is inconsistent with our requirement that the party seeking to abrogate the privilege need only give colour to the charge by showing some foundation in fact,at quoting clark,at.internal quotation marks omitted.the approach advocated by bdo and the intervenors reflects the view of some circuits,which require enough evidence of crime or fraud to support a verdict in order to invoke the exception.see in re feldberg,cir.we expressly have rejected that approach.see id.
we therefore must determine whether the district court abused its discretion in determining that the irs had come forward with sufficient evidence to give color to its charge that document was a communication in furtherance of a crime or fraud.the district court engaged in a,in camera inspection of all documents for which the intervenors claimed a privilege to determine whether they fell within the exception.at.in determining whether there was prima facie evidence of criminal or fraudulent activity,the court looked at the totality of the circumstances,including the eight potential indicators of fraud discussed above see id.at.based on the totality of circumstances,the district court found no prima facie evidence of crime or fraud with respect to of the documents,a ruling that the irs does not challenge.
applying the same totality of the circumstance approach,the district court found prima facie evidence of crime or fraud with respect to document and instructed the intervenors to come forward with an explanation that would rebut the evidence.id.at.the intervenors responded and the irs provided further evidence to rebut the intervenors response.after considering all of the evidence,the district court concluded that the intervenors had failed to rebut the prima facie showing of crime or fraud.at.
the intervenors now challenge the district court ruling.first,the intervenors point to the decision of the united states court of appeals for the second circuit in denney bdo seidman,which reversed denney jenkens gilchrist,one of the cases from which the district court derived its potential indicators of fraud see denney bdo seidman,at.the second circuit decision in denney bdo seidman does not draw into question the district court totality of the circumstances analysis in this case.
in denney bdo seidman,the second circuit held that the district court for the southern district of new york had erred when it concluded,without factual support in the record,that the parties had agreed that their agreements were mutually fraudulent.denney bdo seidman,at.the second circuit decision did not address whether facts such as mention of the cobra transaction,vaguely worded consulting agreements or failure to provide services under the consulting agreements,the factors that the district court in the present case derived from denney jenkens gilchrist,would be indicative of fraud.moreover,the district court in the present case did not place dispositive weight on any one of the potential indicators of fraud,nor did the court limit its analysis to the eight potential indicators.at.
the remainder of the intervenors challenge asserts that the irs could not defeat the intervenors claim of privilege under the exception because the irs had failed to allege a particular offense or the elements of common law fraud,and,in any event,the intervenors had come forward with rebuttal evidence showing a legitimate purpose underlying the transactions in question.as we already have noted,our case law does not require a party seeking to invoke the exception to allege a particular offense or to make a prima facie showing with respect to each element of common law fraud.the irs only was required to present sufficient evidence to give colour to the charge that the communication was made in furtherance of a crime or fraud by showing some foundation in fact,at quoting clark,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
after concluding that there had been a prima facie showing that document was a communication made in furtherance of a crime or fraud,the district court gave the intervenors the opportunity to explain the communication.the intervenors offered an explanation,but the district court did not find it satisfactory.nor was the district court required to find the explanation satisfactory.thus,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that the irs had made a prima facie showing of crime or fraud which the intervenors failed to explain satisfactorily.
tax practitioner privilege 
we now shall address whether the district court correctly applied the tax practitioner privilege found in to the facts of this case.prior to,provided 
confidentiality privileges relating to taxpayer communications 
a uniform application to taxpayer communications with federally authorized practitioners.
general respect to tax advice,the same common law protections of confidentiality which apply to a communication between a taxpayer and an attorney shall also apply to a communication between a taxpayer and any federally authorized tax practitioner to the extent the communication would be considered a privileged communication if it were between a taxpayer and an attorney.
limitations.paragraph may only be asserted in 
a any noncriminal tax matter before the internal revenue service and 
b any noncriminal tax proceeding in federal court brought by or against the united states.
definitions.for purposes of this subsection 
a federally authorized tax practitioner.the term federally authorized tax practitioner means any individual who is authorized under federal law to practice before the internal revenue service if such practice is subject to federal regulation under section of title,united states code.
b tax advice.the term tax advice means advice given by an individual with respect to a matter which is within the scope of the individual authority to practice described in subparagraph a.
b section not to apply to communications regarding corporate tax shelters.the privilege under subsection a shall not apply to any written communication between a federally authorized tax practitioner and a director,shareholder,officer,or employee,agent,or representative of a corporation in connection with the promotion of the direct or indirect participation of such corporation in any tax shelter as defined in section d c iii.
to determine whether the district court correctly applied,we first must address the elements of the privilege and,specifically,whether the exception to the privilege for communications related to tax shelters is an element of the privilege or whether it is a true exception and the scope of the tax shelter exception.
elements of the tax practitioner privilege 
as with all assertions of privilege,the proponent of the tax practitioner privilege must establish each element of the privilege.see bdo ii,at.on the other hand,with respect to exceptions to the privilege,the burden rests on the party seeking to overcome an otherwise valid claim of privilege to prove preliminary facts that would support a finding that the claimed privilege falls within an exception.see charles alan wright kenneth graham,federal practice procedure,at.
the irs submits that b subsection b tax shelter exception to the tax practitioner privilege is not an exception to the privilege,but an element of the privilege itself.thus,under the irs theory,the party asserting the privilege must establish that the communication was not made,in the words of the statute,in connection with the promotion of the direct or indirect participation in any tax shelter.b.the intervenors,on the other hand,contend that the tax shelter exception is a true exception to the tax practitioner privilege,and,consequently,the opponent of the privilege bears the burden of establishing that the communication falls within the exception.
prior to the american jobs creation act of,stat.subsection b read 
the privilege under subsection a shall not apply to any written communication between a federally authorized tax practitioner and a director,shareholder,officer,or employee,agent,or representative of a corporation in connection with the promotion of the direct or indirect participation of such corporation in any tax shelter as defined in section d c iii.
b.the plain wording of this subsection evinces a clear intent to treat the rule embodied in subsection b as an exception to the tax practitioner privilege.the first sentence of subsection b refers to the privilege under subsection a.id.the fact that the privilege does not apply to the class of communications described in subsection b presupposes the existence of an otherwise applicable privilege.
this conclusion is supported further by the structure of as a whole.section a subsection a sets out a general rule,id.a,specific limitations on the situations in which that rule may be asserted,id.a,and defines key terms that further limit the scope of the rule,id.a.by placing some specific limitations on the general rule together with the general rule in subsection a while placing other limitations on the general rule in subsection b,the structure of the statute suggests that not all limitations to the privilege are of the same character.the most natural reading of the section as a whole is to consider those limitations to the scope of the general rule found in subsection a to constitute elements of the privilege and those limitations found in subsection b as exceptions to the application of that privilege.
the rationale underlying the tax shelter exception further supports this conclusion.subsection b originally was added in conference committee.the report of the conference committee explained that t he conferees did not understand the promotion of tax shelters to be part of the routine relationship between a tax practitioner and a client.at,cong.this rationale is analogous to the rationale underlying the exception,advice given to further future crime or fraud goes beyond what is necessary to achieve the beneficial aims of the privilege.see zolin,at.thus,in both situations,the rationale underlying the limitation on the claimed privilege goes to the necessity of the communications to achieve the beneficial aims of the privilege.
thus,based on the text,structure and purpose of subsection b,it is clear that the tax shelter exception is a true exception to the tax practitioner privilege.as with any other exception to a claimed privilege,the burden rests on the opponent of the privilege to prove preliminary facts that would support a finding that the claimed privilege falls within an exception.wright graham,federal practice procedure,at.as with the exception,the opponent meets this burden by bringing forth enough evidence to show some foundation in fact that the exception applies,at quoting clark,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
scope of the tax shelter exception 
the intervenors contend that the tax shelter exception found in subsection b applies only to tax shelters that shelter corporate taxes.the intervenors rely on the subsection heading and the legislative history of subsection b to support this contention.the irs,on the other hand,submits that the tax shelter exception,as it existed in,was not so limited.to support its position,the irs relies on the text of the statute and the legislative history of subsection b.the question thus becomes whether the tax shelter to which the communication relates must shelter corporate,as opposed to individual,taxes.
we begin with the text of the statute.only if the plain language of the statute is inconclusive or clearly contravenes expressed congressional intent do we look beyond the words themselves.oneida tribe of indians wisconsin,cir.to discern the scope of the tax shelter exception,we must look to the elements of the exception.to fall within subsection b,a communication must be written between a federally authorized tax practitioner and a director,shareholder,officer,or employee,agent,or representative of a corporation and made in connection with the promotion of the direct or indirect participation of such corporation in any tax shelter as defined by d c ii b.the plain text appears to apply to any tax shelter falling within the definition of a tax shelter found at d c ii,and at least one district court has found that the tax shelter exception applies to individuals when the tax shelter required the participation of a corporation.see doe wachovia,d.
the intervenors contend that subsection b heading,which,prior to the amendments,read s ection not to apply to communications regarding corporate tax shelters,see b,demonstrated a clear congressional intent to limit subsection b to tax shelters for corporate income taxes.as a general rule,t he title of a statute can not limit the plain meaning of the text.pennsylvania dep t of corr.yeskey,d quoting of trainmen baltimore ohio.internal quotation marks omitted omissions in original.a statute heading is of use only when it shed s light on some ambiguous word or phrase.yeskey,at.quoting of trainmen,at.internal quotation marks omitted alterations in original.as noted above,subsection b is not ambiguous.if anything,the heading adds ambiguity to subsection b.absent this heading,the subsection would not seem limited to corporate tax shelters at all.
although the section heading suggests that congress had corporate tax shelters in mind,the fact that a statute can be applied in situations not expressly anticipated by congress demonstrates breadth,not ambiguity.yeskey,at.quoting sedima,imrex,d internal quotation marks omitted.the plain language of subsection b is certainly broad because it applies to any written communication in connection with the promotion of the direct or indirect participation of such corporation in any tax shelter,b emphasis added,but such breadth does not make the text ambiguous.
further evidence of the intended breadth of the statute is found in its reference to the relatively broad tax shelter definition found in d c ii as opposed to the narrower definitions found in the version of the definition of tax shelter found at d c ii defines a tax shelter as any partnership,entity,plan or arrangement,a significant purpose of which is the avoidance or evasion of federal income tax.d c ii 
because subsection b is not ambiguous,we need not look to legislative history to determine its meaning.however,even if we were to consider legislative history,we would not find it useful because that history creates more ambiguity than it eliminates.even the legislative history that the intervenors cite in support of its argument that subsection b is limited to corporate taxes raises more questions than it answers.the conference report upon which the intervenors rely states that the tax shelters to which subsection b applies include,but are not limited to,those required to be registered as confidential corporate tax shelter arrangements under section d.at,cong.emphasis added.all this statement tells us is that the tax shelters referenced in subsection b reach a broader class of arrangements than the confidential corporate tax shelters then defined in d.it says nothing of how much broader the exception is intended to sweep.
the rest of the legislative history is equally unenlightening.subsection b was added to the bill in conference committee and had not been part of the prior debate on the legislation.after subsection b was added,one of the key architects of the bill expressed concern that the privilege itself would lead to confusion and litigation.see cong.rec.daily ed.july,statement of moynihan.confusion regarding the scope of the tax shelter exception was not limited to members of congress tax practitioners themselves expressed confusion as to the breadth of the tax shelter exception.see sheryl stratton,privilege unclear from the start,tax notes july.
next,the intervenors contend that the tax shelter exception applies only to communications when the corporation is the taxpayer.intervenor br.at italics in original.according to the intervenors,communication between a federally authorized tax practitioner and an s corporation officers or agents in connection with the s corporation participation in a tax shelter therefore would not fall within the tax shelter exception.the intervenors assert that s corporations are not taxpayers and that corporation in this context means a c corporation id.at.
we can not accept this argument.s corporations are both taxpayers and corporations under the irc although s corporations are not subject to taxes imposed by subtitle a,chapter of the irc,see id.a,this exception merely means that they do not pay directly income taxes.section does not exempt s corporations from other taxes imposed by the irc,such as employment taxes subtitle c and excise taxes subtitles d and e.notably,the irc defines taxpayers as any person subject to any internal revenue tax.id.a emphasis added this definition applies throughout the irc,except when otherwise distinctly expressed or manifestly incompatible with the intent of the statute.id.a.section does not express distinctly any intent to define taxpayer only to include income tax payers,nor would it be manifestly incompatible with to extend the tax practitioner privilege to advice given in connection with taxes other than income taxes.
additionally,s corporations must calculate their taxable income,id.b,and file a return,id.a.further,the s corporation taxable income is calculated in the same manner as an individual,with certain exceptions which are not relevant here.id.b.indeed,apart from computed income or losses,which are not relevant here,the s corporation calculates the income or losses passed through to its shareholders by calculating the s corporation gross income and subtracting the deductions allowed to the corporation.id.a emphasis added.
the intervenors provide no support for their argument that the term corporation,as used in b only means c corporation.the irc itself defines an s corporation as a small business corporation for which an election under section a is in effect,id.a it defines a c corporation as a corporation which is not an s corporation,id.a.this usage alone suggests that,when a particular section of the irc is intended to apply only to c corporations,congress will use that term,rather than the generic corporation.additionally,the irc and implementing treasury regulations define corporation for federal tax purposes as a business entity organized under a federal or state statute if the statute describes or refers to the entity as incorporated or as a corporation.b.
the regulations relied upon by the intervenors in support of their argument that corporation,as used in subsection b,means c corporation are inapposite.these regulations implement,which,as we have noted above,applies to a much narrower definition of tax shelter than the one applied in subsection b.congress chose to define tax shelter for purposes of subsection b using a broader definition than that found in.however narrowly the cited regulations may confine the application of,they are of little relevance in defining the breadth of the definition found in d c ii 
finally,we address the intervenors contention that application of the tax shelter exception to tax shelters that do not involve corporate income taxes would consume the general rule by destroying the privilege any time a corporation participates in a tax shelter.intervenors br.at.the intervenors submit that,if the tax shelter exception extends to individual income taxes,any time a corporation,such as a banking corporation or investment corporation,is involved in the tax shelter,the general rule of tax practitioner privilege will be negated.
a close look at the tax shelter exception makes clear that the intervenors submission overstates significantly the scope of that exception.first,the exception applied only to written communications.second,the written communication must have been between a federally authorized tax practitioner and a director,shareholder,officer,or employee,agent,or representative of a corporation.third,the written communication must have been in connection with the promotion of the direct or indirect participation of such corporation in any tax shelter,as defined in d c ii.b.
because the exception is limited to written communications,oral communications between a tax practitioner and the corporate agent remain within the general rule of privilege.further,because the tax shelter exception applies only when the written communication relates to the corporation direct or indirect participation in a particular type of tax shelter,one meeting the definition found in d c ii,the tax shelter exception will not affect any otherwise privileged communication that does not relate to a transaction falling within that definition.
most importantly,the tax shelter exception applies only to communications between the tax practitioner and the corporate agent.as noted earlier,the tax practitioner privilege is limited to communications that would be privileged if they had been made to an attorney the privilege protects only those statements made by the client to the attorney in confidence.see evans,at.a communication is not made in confidence when the client intends that the communication shall be disclosed to unprivileged third parties.see christopher mueller laird kirkpatrick,federal evidence,at ed see also proposed.a,a communication is confidential if not intended to be disclosed to third persons other than those to whom disclosure is in furtherance of the rendition of professional legal services to the client or those reasonably necessary for the transmission of the communication.however,an exception to this general rule permits disclosure of confidential communications by the attorney to an expert retained for the purpose of rendering legal services.mueller kirkpatrick,federal evidence,at.
the tax practitioner privilege protects those communications which would be privileged if made to an attorney.see a.this protection is embodied both in the general rule regarding confidential communications and in the exception for disclosures to experts retained to assist the tax practitioner.with respect to individual income taxpayers,the tax shelter exception has the effect of taking communications intended to be passed along in written form to corporate agents in connection with the corporation participation in a tax shelter out of the exception for communications to third party experts retained to assist the tax practitioner.such communications are subject to the general rule that communications to third parties are not privileged.for all other confidential communications between the individual income tax payer and its tax practitioner,both the general rule and the exception for communications to a retained expert apply.
thus,we can not accept the intervenors prediction that application of the tax shelter exception to individual income tax payers,as it relates to communications made before october,would swallow the general rule of tax practitioner privilege any time a corporation was involved in the shelter.
the district court decision 
we turn now to the district court ruling that the tax shelter exception did not apply to the intervenors documents.it is unclear what legal standard the district court applied in assessing the applicability of the tax shelter exception to the communications at issue.the district court disposed of the matter in a footnote,in which it stated that,for the same reasons it found that the irs characterization of the intervenors conduct as falling within the exception,it did not find that the intervenors engaged in tax shelters.see at.however,the tax shelter exception requires no showing of crime or fraud.further,the record is unclear regarding what evidence,if any,was produced by the irs to support its contention that the documents fell within the tax shelter exception.the irs did contend that a significant purpose of the financial products purchased by the intervenors was to avoid or evade federal income tax and the record reflects that some of the intervenors had purchased the financial product through a corporation.at.however,the district court decision does not indicate how these allegations fell short of establishing the applicability of the tax shelter exception.
additionally,the district court did not note which claims of privilege were sustained based on the privilege and which were sustained based on the tax practitioner privilege.see at.because we can not evaluate the legal standard employed by the district court,remand is necessary.in re grand jury proceedings thullen,at.thus,we must vacate the district court ruling with respect to the applicability of the tax shelter exception and remand for further consideration.
on remand,for each of the documents that the district court concluded to fall within a valid claim of privilege,the court should first determine whether the document falls within the privilege,the tax practitioner privilege or both privileges.for those documents that would fall within the privilege or both the and tax practitioner privilege,no further analysis is required,as the tax shelter exception applies only to the tax practitioner privilege.see b.for those documents falling solely within the tax practitioner privilege,the burden rests upon the irs to come forward with sufficient evidence to demonstrate some foundation in fact that a particular document falls within the tax shelter exception.to meet this burden,the irs must bring forward evidence that the communication relates to a tax shelter,as defined by d c ii the communication was made by a director,shareholder,officer,or employee,agent,or representative of the corporation and the communication was made in connection with the promotion of the direct or indirect participation of the corporation in such tax shelter.
conclusion 
for the forgoing reasons,the decision of the district court is affirmed in part and vacated and remanded in part.
affirmed in part,vacated and remanded in part 
sections and of the irc were amended by the american jobs creation act of,stat.the act eliminated the distinction between c tax shelters and other arrangements identified by the secretary under b by replacing the terms tax shelter and potentially abusive tax shelter with reportable transaction.reportable transactions are any transaction s with respect to which information is required to be included with a return or statement because such transaction is of a type which the secretary determines as having a potential for tax avoidance or evasion.all reportable transactions must be reported to the irs,see id.a supp.iv,and must satisfy the irc requirements,see id.a.
sections and also were amended by the american jobs creation act,see,stat,but they continue to provide penalties for failure to comply with the registration and requirements of and.see supp.iv.

the first case to which the district court looked in deriving its potential indicators of fraud was denney jenkens gilchrist,d.that case involved a civil rico class action in which the plaintiffs alleged that jenkens gilchrist had developed and bdo and others had marketed a tax shelter known as the currency options bring reward alternatives cobra.bdo sought to enforce an arbitration clause in its consulting agreements.based on what it deemed to be admissions by the parties,the court in denney concluded that bdo and its clients had engaged in mutual fraud in connection with the consulting agreements to conceal the true purpose of the agreements providing the clients with tax shelters advice.id.at.because the contracts were the product of mutual fraud between bdo and its clients,the arbitration clause was unenforceable.id.at.the court based its conclusion that the contracts were mutually fraudulent on the vague language in the consulting agreements and its findings that bdo did not provide any of the consulting services described in the agreements.id.at.the next case the district court looked to in developing its potential indicators of fraud was miron bdo seidman,llp,d.like denney,miron involved the enforceability of an arbitration clause in one of bdo consulting agreements and related to the cobra transaction.see id.at.the district court in miron noted the factors that led the court in denney to find that the consulting agreements had been the product of mutual fraud,but concluded that the consulting agreements at issue were factually distinguishable.see id.at.in particular,the court found that bdo had provided the services described in its consulting agreements.id.the court in miron noted also that,unlike the consulting agreements in denney,in which the only identified goal was expanding business operations,the consulting agreements at issue were intended to limit also the clients financial exposure on those expansions.id.at.based on these differences,the court concluded that the consulting agreements were not similarly suggestive of fraud.third case to which the district court looked in arriving at its potential indicators of fraud was united states kpmg llp,d.unlike denney and miron,kpmg did not involve bdo.kpmg involved an action brought by the irs to enforce summonses it issued to the accounting firm of kpmg as part of its investigation into kpmg alleged promotion of,and participation in,tax shelters.id.at.the court in kpmg held that boilerplate opinion letters provided to kpmg clients by the law firm of brown wood were not protected by the privilege because they had been provided as a part of kpmg marketing machine rather than as reasoned legal advice.id.at.the district court in the present action found the findings of the court in kpmg consistent with the irs allegation that bdo had engaged in the promotion of prepackaged tax shelters rather than individualized tax advice.see at.
guerin received the memorandum by fax.she asserts that the memorandum was sent to her by robert greisman,a partner with bdo.greisman contends that he does not remember faxing the memorandum to guerin and that on the day it was faxed to her he was at a meeting at a hotel in los angeles.there is no record of a fax having been sent from the hotel to jenkens gilchrist on that day and the document itself does not display the phone number of the origin of the fax.further,the memorandum was not received in a single transmission.the last three pages of the memorandum were sent at around,with the balance of the memorandum,that is,the first portion of the memorandum,being sent in a separate transmission at around.in addition to the memorandum being sent out of order in two transmissions,the fax heading indicates that those portions of the memorandum sent at around began at the second page of the transmission.the fax heading of the transmission sent around indicates that the portion of the memorandum sent at that time began at the eighth page of the transmission.the balance of both transmissions does not appear in the record.
the weight of authority favors our conclusion that litigation need not be actual or imminent for communications to be within the common interest doctrine.at least five of our sister circuits have recognized that the threat of litigation is not a prerequisite to the common interest doctrine.see in re grand jury subpoena custodian of records,newparent,cir in re regents of the of california,united states aramony,cir united states schwimmer,cir united states zolin,cir,aff in part and vacated in part on other grounds,united states zolin,d.we have found only one circuit that requires a palpable threat of litigation at the time of the communication.united states newell,cir quoting in re santa fe int l,cir.this position runs contrary
