george maciel appeals from a decision of the united states tax court,which upheld an internal revenue service irs notice of deficiency for the,and tax years.in a separate proceeding,maciel pled guilty to criminal tax charges.as part of its sentencing decision in that case,the federal district court found that maciel had not fraudulently intended to evade the payment of taxes.maciel contends that,under the doctrine of collateral estoppel,the sentencing court finding should have precluded relitigation of the fraud issue before the tax court.further,maciel contends that,even if relitigation is not precluded,the tax court erred in finding that he acted fraudulently when he failed to report income from a business sale.finally,maciel challenges the tax court denial of various business deductions.we reject maciel preclusion and fraud claims,but we hold that he is entitled to deduct certain bona fide business expenses.
background 
during a routine audit in,the irs determined that maciel had significantly understated his income on several tax returns.the agency referred maciel case for criminal prosecution.after initially charging maciel with two felony counts of tax evasion in violation of,the government filed a superseding information on september,charging maciel with two felony counts of willfully filing a false return in violation of.unlike,which requires proof that the defendant willfully attempt ed to evade or defeat the payment of tax,requires only proof that the defendant w illfully ma de and subscribe d a materially false return,see also united states boulware,cir considine united states,cir.
maciel entered a plea agreement with the government in which he pled guilty to both counts and admitted signing tax returns he knew to be inaccurate for both the and tax years.the plea agreement stated that one of two sentencing guidelines calculations would apply.the first provided for a base offense level of ten if the offense was committed in order to facilitate evasion of a tax.a.the second provided for a base offense level of six if otherwise.id.a.in either case,the government agreed to include a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,resulting in an adjusted offense level of either eight or four.the government also agreed to recommend that any sentence imposed be satisfied by home detention and electronic monitoring.
the presentence report psr subsequently concluded that maciel had intended to evade taxation and therefore was subject to the higher a sentencing guideline.the psr,however,determined that maciel adjusted offense level was nine,rather than eight as calculated in the plea agreement,because it considered maciel conduct not only in and tax years covered by the plea also in.maciel total underpayment during those three years increased his offense level by one point.
at his april,sentencing hearing,maciel urged the district court to reject the psr conclusion that he had fraudulently intended to evade taxation or,in the alternative,to consider only the tax losses from and.the government responded,without significant elaboration,that there appeared to be some intent on maciel part to do something.the government,however,agreed with maciel that,consistent with the plea agreement,maciel adjusted offense level should be no higher than eight.neither maciel nor the government attempted to call witnesses or introduce evidence on the question of intent to evade.instead,both sides agreed that the court has all the information it needs in order to make the sentencing determination.
the district court announced its decision at the conclusion of the sentencing hearing.with respect to maciel intent,the court explained 
i think on balance i am satisfied that the intent here was not primarily to avoid payment of tax.i think the intent may well have been to divert corporate money to personal use which is not a good thing and certainly is not something that the court should countenance and particularly since it did have a consequence in terms of the accuracy of maciel tax returns.
but i do think that the conduct looked at in its totality suggests that the reason maciel diverted the money was to avoid paying money to the internal revenue service.i think that the finding that the court would have to make.so i think we looking at the lower of the two calculations.
based on the government recommendation,the court sentenced maciel to three months of home detention.the court also imposed three years of probation,noting that maciel had not yet worked out the matters with the irs.as a special condition of his probation,maciel was required to comply and cooperate with the internal revenue service in a good faith effort to pay any outstanding tax liability including any assessed penalty and interest not limited to the two tax years that are charged in the information.
the irs informed maciel of his outstanding liability in a notice of deficiency sent on june.according to the irs,maciel owed more than in back taxes for and nearly in civil penalties pursuant to.section imposes penalties when any part of any underpayment of tax required to be shown on a return is due to fraud.
maciel took issue with the commissioner notice of deficiency and petitioned the tax court for a redetermination.he subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment,asserting that the irs was estopped from relitigating the issue of fraud or intent to evade tax by factual determination by the district court at maciel sentencing hearing and the judgment of the district court based on those factual determinations.according to maciel,absent a showing of fraud,the statute of limitations barred the irs from assessing back taxes for the years at issue.see a,c.the tax court denied maciel motion without opinion,and a bench trial followed on december and.
in an opinion filed february,the tax court generally affirmed the deficiencies and penalties levied against maciel.see maciel comm r,cch,available at wl.the court found clear and convincing evidence that maciel underpaid his income taxes due and owing for the years at issue,and that he fraudulently intended to evade the payment of his tax liabilities.wl,at.in support of its fraud finding,the court relied on the collective weight of a number of factors.for example,maciel regularly commingled funds among his various businesses,engaged in large unexplained cash transactions,mislabeled certain transactions as loans,failed to report any earnings from certain unincorporated business ventures,failed to keep adequate business records,and failed to inform his accountants and bookkeeper of his activities.id.at.
ii.preclusion 
maciel maintains that the doctrine of collateral estoppel issue preclusion required the tax court to adopt the finding of the district court at maciel criminal sentencing hearing that maciel did not intend to evade taxation.we consider de novo the availability of collateral estoppel.see littlejohn united states,cir.this circuit has not expressly decided whether,or under what circumstances,the parties to a civil suit should be bound by findings previously made at a criminal sentencing hearing.following the second circuit,we now hold that it is presumptively improper for a court to give preclusive effect to the findings of a sentencing court during subsequent civil litigation.
the doctrine of collateral estoppel promotes judicial economy and protects parties from the burden of successive litigation by barring the relitigation of issues in certain circumstances.see parklane hosiery shore,d.for example,when an issue is actually litigated and necessarily decided,after a full and fair opportunity for litigation,in a prior proceeding,a court decision is binding in a subsequent action between the parties or those in privity with the parties.shaw hahn,cir see also restatement second of judgments.the key question in this case is whether the parties had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the merits of the fraud issue during the sentencing hearing.littlejohn,at see also allen mccurry,d noting that the court has repeatedly recognized that the concept of collateral estoppel can not apply when the party against whom the earlier decision is asserted did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate an issue in the earlier case.
in deciding whether an opportunity to litigate is full and fair,a court must make a practical judgment based on at least two considerations.first,the court must compare the procedures in the prior and subsequent actions.if procedural opportunities unavailable in the first action could readily cause a different result in the second action,then the results of the first action generally should not be given preclusive effect.parklane hosiery,at.see also montana united states,d redetermination of issues is warranted if there is reason to doubt the quality,extensiveness,or fairness of procedures followed in prior litigation.second,the court must consider the parties incentives to litigate in the two actions.if a party had good reason not to contest an issue vigorously during the first action and did not,in fact,vigorously contest the issue,that party generally should be entitled to relitigate the issue during the second action.see charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,at ed.the most general independent concern reflected in the limitation of issue preclusion by the full and fair opportunity requirement goes to the incentive to litigate vigorously in the first action.see also parklane hosiery,at.noting that incentive problems sometimes arise when the second action was not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the first action.
we agree with the second circuit that findings made in a criminal sentencing proceeding ordinarily should not have preclusive effect in a subsequent civil case.in sec monarch funding,cir,the second circuit rejected the sec attempt to preclude a civil defendant from relitigating a sentencing judge finding that the defendant had committed securities fraud.in a prior criminal trial,the defendant had been convicted on obstruction of justice charges but had been acquitted on charges related to securities fraud.the sentencing judge nevertheless concluded,following extensive litigation,that the defendant was subject to a sentencing enhancement because he had committed securities fraud by at least a preponderance of the evidence.id.at.the second circuit observed that a plenary civil trial affords a defendant procedural opportunities that are unavailable at sentencing and that could command a different result.id.at.for example,u nlike a civil litigant,a criminal defendant opportunities to take discovery may be limited for sentencing purposes.id.the court also noted that the incentive to litigate a sentencing finding is frequently less intense,and certainly more fraught with risk,than it would be for a civil trial.id.
the second circuit has not confined monarch reasoning to situations in which the government seeks to apply a favorable sentencing decision in subsequent civil litigation.in united states currency in the amount of,cir,that court rejected a former criminal defendant attempt to invoke collateral estoppel against the government.the court held that the customs service could pursue a civil forfeiture action despite a sentencing judge previous finding that the currency at issue had been lawfully obtained.id.at.according to the court,the government had not had a sufficiently fair opportunity to litigate the relevant issues because procedural mechanisms crucial to the government ability to gather probative evidence in the civil forfeiture action were either not available,or were available to a lesser degree,in the sentencing proceedings.id.at.the government,for example,had not ha d recourse at sentencing to the full array of civil discovery procedures and could not have compelled the defendant to testify.id.at.the court did note,however,that the government in that case had an adequate incentive to litigate in order to ensure that the defendant received punishment commensurate to his offense.id.at.
the decisions in monarch and considered efficiency as well as fairness.the second circuit concluded that giving preclusive effect to sentencing findings would be unlikely to produce meaningful judicial economy benefits.indeed,the opposite might well be true.anticipating the possibility of preclusion in future civil litigation,parties would have an incentive to conduct lengthy on tangential issues,producing sentencing proceedings of mushrooming complexity and delaying the resolution of criminal cases.monarch,at see also,at wright et,at even if later claims involving the same issues are foreseeable,it may not be wise to augment the stakes of the first litigation.
the second circuit approach is entirely consistent with this circuit decision in allen city of los angeles,cir,overruled on other grounds by acri varian,cir en banc.maciel relies on allen to support his position that sentencing findings should have collateral estoppel effect,but we disagree with his view of that case.in allen,we considered whether the criminal conviction of police officers involved in the beating of rodney king precluded the defendants in a subsequent civil suit from arguing that the officers had acted without actual malice.we concluded that the criminal jury verdict necessarily meant that the jury had found actual malice.we remarked that the district court sentencing opinion add ed additional support to the criminal jury findings and held that both the criminal verdict and the sentencing opinion are a basis for collateral estoppel on the issue.id.at.if these statements are read in context,it is clear that we did not mean that the sentencing decision alone would have justified preclusion absent the jury corroborating finding of actual malice.at most,allen,like monarch and,indicates that a sentencing finding may be entitled to collateral estoppel effect in subsequent civil litigation when fairness and efficiency considerations support preclusion.
in this case,we conclude that maciel has failed to overcome the presumption against giving collateral estoppel effect to a sentencing finding.maciel argument that the government was not,in fact,prejudiced by the procedural differences in the sentencing and civil contexts is unpersuasive.the parties understood that the criminal and civil actions against maciel were proceeding on separate tracks,with the department of justice spearheading the criminal prosecution and the irs determining maciel civil liability.both maciel and the government recognized that the irs would have an opportunity after the criminal proceedings concluded to investigate maciel conduct and assess civil penalties.in his plea agreement,maciel expressly agreed to pay all taxes and penalties that may be due,as finally determined by an internal revenue service audit process and any administrative or judicial process.during the sentencing hearing itself,maciel counsel acknowledged that the issue of maciel outstanding tax liability and penalties remained pending on the civil level.
moreover,it is apparent that the government had virtually no incentive to litigate the fraud issue at sentencing.in some cases,the government obligation to seek a sentence consonant with a criminal defendant culpability will be incentive enough to ensure that relevant issues are litigated vigorously.see,at noting that the government desire to impose appropriate punishment on a criminal defendant should be at least as great as its desire to add funds to the treasury internal quotation marks omitted.in this case,however,the government incentive to prove fraud was minimal.the plea agreement provided that maciel was subject either to an adjusted offense level of four the applicable level without a showing of fraud or eight the applicable level with a showing of fraud.see.under the guidelines,an offense level of eight would have subjected maciel to a longer sentence than an offense level of four only if maciel criminal history category was ii or more.because the psr placed maciel in criminal history category i,both offense levels produced the same sentencing range of months.
maciel contends that the situation is somewhat more complicated because the psr,after concluding that maciel committed fraud and including his underpayment in its tax loss calculation,ultim
