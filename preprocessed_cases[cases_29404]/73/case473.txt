procedural history 
on may,the estate timely filed a complaint against the united states in the united states district court for the southern district of texas,seeking a refund of federal estate tax.the united states moved for summary judgment,arguing that the estate was not entitled to discount the value of the retirement accounts to reflect income taxes payable by the beneficiaries upon receipt of distributions from the accounts.additionally,the united states asserted that the retirement accounts should be valued at their fair market value as determined by the willing seller standard.
the district court granted the government motion for summary judgment.in doing so,the court specifically declined to consider any other factors that could affect the value of the retirement accounts as set forth in the expert report included in the estate response to the motion for summary judgment the court reasoned that the estate failed to raise such factors or refer to any evidence supporting them in its response.thus,the court concluded that the sole issue was whether,for estate tax purposes,the retirement accounts should be priced at their face value or whether they should be discounted to reflect the thirty percent income tax to be incurred by the beneficiaries upon distribution.estate of smith united states,d.applying the willing seller test,the court reasoned that while the retirement accounts may generate a tax liability for the beneficiaries in this case,a hypothetical willing buyer would not take that income liability into consideration when purchasing the underlying securities but would simply pay the value of the securities as determined by the applicable securities exchange prices.the court further stated that c ameliorates the double tax the estate and income taxes by allowing the taxpayer a deduction in the amount of the estate tax attributable to the particular asset.accordingly,the court found that the retirement accounts were properly valued at their fair market value as reflected by the applicable securities exchange prices on the date of the decedent death not including a discount for the tax payable by the beneficiaries upon distribution from the accounts.since there was no dispute between the parties that the estate initial tax return reflected the cash value of the retirement accounts,the court concluded that there was no material question of fact.
the estate timely appealed to this court,arguing that the district court erred by refusing to consider evidence properly included in the summary judgment,the additional factors that could affect the value of the retirement accounts as set forth in the expert opinion provided by that estate and when valuing the retirement accounts,failing to apply a discount for the federal income tax liability that will be triggered upon distributions from the retirement accounts to the beneficiaries.

summary judgment evidence 
the estate argues that the district court improperly refused to consider certain evidence even though the estate repeatedly made references to it.the summary judgment evidence in question consisted of the additional factors that the expert opinion stated should be considered in valuing the retirement accounts the lack of marketability and the need for a reasonable profit in order to induce a willing buyer to enter into a transaction
