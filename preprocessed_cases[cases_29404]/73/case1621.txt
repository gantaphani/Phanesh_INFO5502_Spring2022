the state board of equalization has promulgated a rule that grants to registered domestic partners certain property tax relief afforded to spouses.county assessors unsuccessfully challenged the rule in the trial court and now appeal,arguing that it is unconstitutional.we disagree.
in,voters adopted proposition,a constitutional amendment,which limits the amount of ad valorem tax assessed on real property unless there has been a change in ownership.after the legislature defined such a change of ownership to exclude,among other things,real property transfers between spouses,the voters adopted proposition,placing the spousal transfer exclusion in the state constitution.the state board of equalization the board then promulgated a rule excluding from the definition of change of ownership a transfer of real property to a registered domestic partner via intestate succession upon the death of the person registered domestic partner.thereafter,the legislature amended the statutory scheme to limit change of ownership by excluding any real property transfers between registered domestic partners from the reassessment of full cash value for property tax purposes.
plaintiff and appellant and intervener and appellant plaintiffs who are county assessors,filed an action for declaratory relief,asserting that neither the legislature nor the board had the authority to create the registered domestic partner exclusion from classification as a change in ownership.
as we will explain,the trial court correctly held the legislature can create an exclusion from change in ownership for registered domestic partners,without violating the california constitution,when the legislature amended provisions of the family code and revenue and taxation code,it ratified the board rule excluding certain real property transfers between registered domestic partners from the property tax reassessment provisions of proposition,and accordingly,the board rule is not unconstitutional.
constitutional and statutory background 
article xiii,section of california constitution provides that all property in this state is taxable unless exempted from taxation pursuant to california constitution or federal law.the passage of proposition limited the maximum amount of any ad valorem tax on real property to percent of its full cash value,with annual adjustments for inflation at a maximum rate of percent per year.cal,art.xiii a,subd.a,subd.b.full cash value is defined as the county assessor valuation of the property on the tax bill or,thereafter,the appraised value of real property when purchased,newly constructed,or a change in ownership has occurred after the assessment.cal,art.xiii a,subd.a italics added.
because proposition did not explicate the meaning of change in ownership,it fell to the legislature to define the phrase pacific southwest realty county of los angeles cal th,d,hereafter pacific southwest.a task force studied the matter and,on january,submitted to the assembly committee on revenue and taxation a report of the task force on property tax administration.ibid.the report made various recommendations,which resulted in the enactment of certain revenue and taxation code provisions.id.at,d,further section references are to the revenue and taxation code unless otherwise specified.
section defines change in ownership as a transfer of a present interest in real property,including the beneficial use thereof,the value of which is substantially equal to the value of the fee interest.section contains examples of what is a change in ownership,and section contains examples of what is not a change in ownership.sections through contain exclusions from a change in ownership,including certain transfers of mobile home parks,interspousal transfers,and certain transfers between parents and children,or grandparents and grandchildren.
in,the voters passed proposition,which enshrined in the state constitution the exclusions for interspousal transfers of real property,and such transfers between parents and children.cal,art.xiii a,subds.g,h.the argument in favor of proposition acknowledged that the protection against reappraisal of property transferred between spouses already was the law by statute,but asserted that constitutional protection should be afforded because some attorneys have argued that the statutory protection is unconstitutional.constitutional protection is more secure as it can only be changed by another vote of the people.voter information guide,argument in favor of.as for the exclusion for transfers between parents and children,the argument in favor of proposition premised its position on the protection of the family.ibid.
in,the board,which is authorized to adopt rules and regulations governing equalization,subd.c,amended its rule enumerating exclusions from a change in ownership for purposes of property tax reassessment,tit,hereafter rule.it did so by adding subdivision k to rule to exclude a ny transfer of separate property inherited by a surviving domestic partner by intestate succession upon the death of a registered domestic partner.
in,this exclusion by rule was expanded when the legislature added subdivision p to section,to create an exclusion from change in ownership for any transfer between registered domestic partners,commencing with the lien date for the fiscal year stats,ch.the exclusion added by section,subdivision p mirrors the language of the spousal exclusion in california constitution.in enacting this exclusion,the legislature noted that m any lesbian,gay,and bisexual californians continue to face economic discrimination,despite forming lasting,committed,and caring relationships with persons of the same sex according to the laws of this state.these couples build lives together,as do spouses,by purchasing property and creating and operating family businesses.expanding the rights of registered domestic partners with respect to property ownership would further california interests in promoting family relationships and protecting family members during life crises,and would reduce discrimination on the bases of sex and sexual orientation in a manner consistent with the california constitution.stats,ch,d.
thus,the legislature broadened the exclusion in rule to include not only transfers occurring by intestate succession as the result of the death of a registered domestic partner,but also to transfers between registered domestic partners during life.
the legislature explained that the exclusion set forth in subdivision p of section is intended to guarantee equality for all californians,regardless of gender or sexual orientation,and to further the state interests in protecting californians from the potentially severe economic and social consequences of abandonment,separation,the death of a partner,and other life crises.to this end,the legislature has enacted various statutes in an attempt to move california closer to fulfilling the promises of inalienable rights,liberty,and equality contained in sections and of article i of the california constitution.stats,ch,a,b.
the legislature made even more changes in the california domestic partner rights and responsibilities act of the act,which did not become operative until january,stats,ch.eff.family code section,subdivision a states registered domestic partners shall have the same rights,protections,and benefits,and shall be subject to the same responsibilities,obligations,and duties under law,whether they derive from statutes,administrative regulations,court rules,government policies,common law,or any other provisions or sources of law,as are granted to and imposed upon spouses.c a surviving registered domestic partner,following the death of the other partner,shall have the same rights,protections,and benefits,and shall be subject to the same responsibilities,obligations,and duties under law,whether they derive from statutes,administrative regulations,court rules,government policies,common law,or any other provisions or sources of law,as are granted to and imposed upon a widow or a widower.
