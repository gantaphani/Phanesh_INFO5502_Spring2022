these appeals require us to construe and apply a,reproduced in the appendix,a statutory provision that addresses the situation of a taxpayer who pays taxes on income that she must later restore because it is established in a subsequent year that she did not have an unrestricted right to the income.the statute permits such a taxpayer to reduce her tax liability for the year of repayment by the amount that her taxes in the year of inclusion would have decreased had the restored funds been excluded from her income in that year.but there is a catch by its terms,section a requires that the taxpayer must have had what appeared to be an unrestricted right to the income when she first reported it.
here,the controversy over the meaning and application of section a arises in the course of a suit brought by a receiver.the court below,noting that congress had enacted section in a spirit of fairness,fashioned a judicially created exception to the statute unrestricted right requirement.applying that judicially created exception,the court proceeded to deny the government motion to dismiss and granted a modicum of relief both sides appeal.after careful consideration of these appeals,we conclude that the district court erred that congress,in the spirit of fairness,tailored a statute to iron out a wrinkle in the internal revenue code does not give a court license to make the application of the statute.this conclusion leads us to apply the luminously clear language of the statute as written,sustain the government appeal,reject the,reverse the judgment below,and remand for entry of judgment dismissing the suit.
background 
this suit has its genesis in the efforts of robb evans associates,llc,a receiver the receiver,acting on behalf of a class of defrauded persons the underlying plaintiffs,to collect judgments previously rendered against a network of interlocking corporations and their proprietors,john and richard puccio.the twists and turns of the puccios fraudulent scheme are by now.see,zimmerman epstein becker green,zimmerman v,cir.zimmerman puccio zimmerman iv,cir.zimmerman cambridge credit counseling zimmerman ii,cir.we assume the reader familiarity with these opinions and with the district court exegetic accounts of the facts undergirding the class action litigation.see zimmerman cambridge credit counseling zimmerman iii supp,zimmerman cambridge credit counseling zimmerman i,supp,consequently,we rehearse here only those skeletal facts needed to put these appeals into workable perspective.
in,the puccio brothers formed cambridge credit counseling corporation cccc,a corporation organized under massachusetts law.at around the same time,they formed parallel corporations in florida and new york.these other corporations operated in much the same way as cccc and,for simplicity sake,we refer to the three,collectively,as cccc.
cccc held itself out as skilled in improving credit ratings and trumpeted its ability to help financially strapped individuals by creating debt management plans for a fee.under such a plan,an individual in straitened circumstances would make a single monthly payment to cccc,and cccc would at least in theory sprinkle payments around to the individual creditors.as part of its service,cccc aspired to clients debt,that is,to persuade creditors to mark clients accounts as current in exchange for promises that cccc would make regular payments.business boomed from to,cccc harvested over from hopeful clients.
the puccio brothers likewise owned and controlled an array of businesses,some of which provided support to the entities.the assets and operations of these businesses were inextricably intertwined with those of the entities all of them shared management,staff,office space,clients,and funds.for example,cccc freely transferred clients accounts to its brethren without bothering to notify the affected clients.
the balloon went up in,when the underlying plaintiffs brought a class action against the puccios and several of their corporations both and.roughly five years later,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the underlying plaintiffs on their consumer protection claims.laws ch,and their claims under the federal credit repair organizations act croa,et.judgment was entered against the corporations in the amount of and against the puccios in the amount of.the puccios unsuccessfully appealed.see zimmerman iv,at.
securing a judgment and realizing the fruits of that judgment are two different things.thus,the district court appointed the receiver and tasked it with collecting the judgments on behalf of the underlying plaintiffs.for the most part,though,the money had vanished into thin air the receiver was able to recoup less than endeavoring to boost this total,the receiver filed a claim for.the essence of the receiver claim follows.
the receiver can assert a refund claim on behalf of certain taxpayers,namely,the puccios and their corporations,which were judgment debtors.
in earlier years,those taxpayers reported as income,and paid taxes on,monies that they euchred from the underlying plaintiffs.
by virtue of the judgment,the taxpayers are now obligated to restore those monies to the underlying plaintiffs through the receiver.
the taxpayers may deduct those repayments,see,and may reduce their tax liability for the year of repayment by the amount that they overpaid in the years that they originally reported the income,see id.a.
because the amounts of these deductions will exceed the taxpayers tax liability for the year of repayment,refunds will be in order and those refunds should be paid to the receiver.
in june of,the internal revenue service irs denied the claim.the receiver responded by bringing this suit.see a.the government moved to dismiss,arguing among other things that the receiver who stands in the taxpayers shoes was not entitled to the benefit of section a because it never appeared to the taxpayers that they had an unrestricted right to the funds fraudulently obtained from the underlying plaintiffs.the district court denied the government motion to dismiss.although it agreed that the taxpayers never appeared to have an unrestricted right to the funds reported as income,it nonetheless concluded that,as a matter of equity,the fraudulent conduct of the puccios should not be imputed to the receiver.rob evans,llc united states,supp.accordingly,the court denied the government motion to dismiss,holding that the government was obligated to honor the refund request.see id.at.
the receiver,though,did not achieve a total victory.the court limited the amount of the refund by holding that it must be based on the amount the receiver had actually collected and deposited into the qualified settlement fund,not on the full amount of taxes paid by the taxpayers during the relevant years.see id.at see also note,supra.
after deciding the motion to dismiss,the district court stayed the case so that the receiver could file administrative refund claims for additional tax years.the irs denied those claims,and the receiver,in its own words,filed its first amended complaint in order to include claims for additional tax years.at that point,however,the receiver gratuitously added two other sets of allegations in the first amended complaint a constructive trust argument and a claim that section a did not require actual restoration of the funds to the qualified settlement fund as a condition precedent to deductibility.the government filed an answer and,since the district court earlier adjudication of the motion to dismiss had effectively resolved the essence of the dispute,the parties jointly moved for the entry of final judgment,reserving their rights to appeal.the court granted the joint motion without substantive comment,relying on the reasoning laid out in its prior decision on the motion to dismiss.these timely appeals followed.
ii.analysis 
in this venue,the government principal argument is that the district court erred in allowing the receiver access to the balm of section a because the taxpayers never appeared to have an unrestricted right to the reported income.in opposition,the receiver starts by questioning our appellate jurisdiction.past that point,the receiver asserts that the taxpayers did have an apparent unrestricted right to the reported income and,in all events,that the district court did not err in fashioning an equitable exception to the statutory unrestricted right requirement.finally,the receiver submits that it is entitled to recoup all taxes paid to the government under a constructive trust theory.before proceeding to more substantive matters,we briefly address the receiver jurisdictional challenge.
appellate jurisdiction.
the receiver jurisdictional challenge is premised on the contention that we lack jurisdiction because the government,despite reserving its right to appeal in the consent judgment,did not adequately manifest an intent to appeal.this challenge lacks force.
it is common ground that a party may preserve its right to appeal a consent judgment by reserv ing that right unequivocally.biw deceived local,indus.union of marine shipbldg.workers of,cir.quoting coughlin regan,cir.here,the joint motion for entry of final judgment unequivocally reserved the parties rights to appeal.to begin,the parties according to the motion itself move d the court to enter a final,appealable judgment.moreover,the motion made pellucid that the parties reserve d their rights to appeal any of the court rulings,findings or orders.erasing any vestige of doubt,the motion later reiterated that the parties reserve d their rights to challenge on appeal the court legal and factual findings.
although this language seems clear as a bell,the receiver suggests that something more was exigible.in the receiver view,a specific statement of the government intention to appeal was essential.to support this view,the receiver notes that some of the case law refers to an intent to appeal.see,scanlon super servant,cir.that language,though,does not set up a separate requirement it merely confirms that statements of an intent to appeal can in some circumstances supply evidence of a reservation of a right to appeal.see biw deceived,at.all that is needed to pave the way for appellate jurisdiction,however,is the clear reservation of a right to appeal,followed by the timely filing of a notice of appeal.see fed.app.a biw deceived,at.because that sequence of events occurred in this case,we have jurisdiction to hear and determine the government appeal.
b.the government appeal.
the government appeal challenges the viability of the receiver claim.before addressing this challenge,some is useful.
a taxpayer must include all of her gross income in her taxable income each year.see am.oil consol.burnet.this obligation extends even to income obtained unlawfully.see james united states,plurality opinion.at a later date,though,it may become evident that the taxpayer did not have a right to items previously included in her gross income.if the taxpayer restores such an item of income to its lawful owner,she may be able to deduct that repayment in the current year.see.but because the taxpayer situation may have changed say,her annual income may have decreased or her tax bracket may have been lowered,it may disadvantage her to take the deduction in the year of repayment.see united states skelly oil.
to guard against any such inequity,congress enacted.this statute does not itself provide for a deduction but,rather,applies only if a deduction is available under some other provision of the internal revenue code.see.progress subsids.comm r,cir.per curiam.in that event,section a allows a taxpayer to choose between two different ways of calculating her otherwise available deduction for the restored funds.under the first option,the taxpayer may simply deduct the amount of the restored funds in the year of repayment.see a.under the second option,the taxpayer may calculate her taxes for the year of repayment without deducting the amount of the restored funds and then reduce that tax liability by the amount her taxes were increased in the year or years of receipt because the disputed items were included in gross income.skelly oil,at see a.it is this latter method,which more or less puts the taxpayer in the position that she would have occupied had she never reported the income,that the receiver wishes to employ.
for section a to apply,a taxpayer must satisfy three prerequisites.she must show that 
an item was included in gross income for a prior taxable year or years because it appeared that the taxpayer had an unrestricted right to such item 
a deduction is allowable for the taxable year because it was established after the close of such prior taxable year or years that the taxpayer did not have an unrestricted right to such item or to a portion of such item and 
the amount of such deduction exceeds.
a.here,the government does not gainsay that the taxpayers included the funds at issue in income for prior years that,if the funds are restored,a deduction will be available and that the deduction,whatever its precise amount,exceeds.the receiver claim is derivative of the taxpayers rights.for present purposes,then,the dispositive issue reduces to whether,at the time the income was reported,it appeared to the taxpayers that they had an unrestricted right to the funds.as we explain below,if the funds were derived from fraudulent activity,it could not have appeared to the taxpayers that they had an unrestricted right to them.
the district court despite its eventual ruling in favor of the receiver thought not.it held that the receiver was collaterally estopped from advancing such an argument because the funds were derived from fraudulent activity the taxpayers were found to have committed fraud and,therefore,could not have had or appeared to have had an unrestricted right to the funds.rob evans,supp.at.our review of the receiver challenge to the district court application of the collateral estoppel doctrine is de novo.see faigin kelly,cir.
collateral estoppel,sometimes called issue preclusion,bars parties from issues of either fact or law that were adjudicated in an earlier proceeding.see manganella evanston ins,cir.kale combined ins,cir.here,the district court regarded certain determinations made in the federal class action suit as preclusive.in the absence of any objection,we follow the usual rule that t he preclusive effect of a judgment is determined by federal common law.taylor sturgell.
under federal common law,there are four prerequisites to the application of collateral estoppel.the party seeking preclusion must show that both proceedings involve the same issue of law or fact,the parties actually litigated that issue in the prior proceeding,the prior court decided that issue in a final judgment,and resolution of that issue was essential to judgment on the merits.global naps,verizon new eng,cir.we employ this framework to determine whether the receiver is collaterally estopped from asserting that the taxpayers could have believed that they had an unrestricted right to the funds at issue.
in this case,our inquiry is considerably shortened the receiver does not contest that the prior proceeding the federal class action satisfies the second,third,and fourth prerequisites for collateral estoppel.the critical factor is whether both proceedings involve the same issue.this factor turns on whether the district court earlier finding of fraud effectively resolved the question of whether the taxpayers had an apparent unrestricted right to the income reported on their tax returns.
the unrestricted right question can not be answered in a vacuum but,rather,must be answered in light of section a.according to treasury department regulations,section a covers an item included in gross income because it appeared from all the facts available in the year of inclusion that the taxpayer had an unrestricted right to such item.a the law is clear,though,that it can not be said to appear to an embezzler or fraudster that he has an unrestricted right to his gains notwithstanding the fact that he is obligated to report those gains in his annual gross income.see culley united states,fed.cir.kraft united states,cir.mckinney united states,cir.in short,section a unrestricted right language excludes all income reaped by taxpayers who know at the time of receipt that they have no right to the income.when a taxpayer knowingly obtains funds as the result of fraudulent action,it simply can not appear from the facts known to him at the time that he has a legitimate,unrestricted claim to the money.culley,at.it follows inexorably that if the taxpayers acquired the funds at issue by fraud,they could not have thought that they had an unrestricted right to those funds.
that ends this aspect of the matter.the district court squarely decided,in the earlier class action,that the taxpayers were swindlers who had obtained the underlying plaintiffs funds by fraud.in this regard,the district court held that the taxpayers representation s that cccc was a nonprofit entity were material,and that the taxpayers betrayed plaintiffs trust when,as was their policy for all cccc clients,they transferred plaintiffs accounts to their businesses.zimmerman iii,supp.at.the court considered this more than adequate to show that the taxpayers were engaged in fraud.see id.at.in a separate order,the court added frosting to the cake it found that the puccio brothers noncompliance with croa involved false pretenses,the use of false representations,and amounted to actual fraud.zimmerman cambridge credit,slip op.at.the brothers,through their network of corporations,had engaged in a pervasively deceptive course of business involving fraudulent misrepresentations to consumers.id.at.
this finding of pervasive fraud was affirmed on appeal,see zimmerman iv,at,and the class action judgments against the taxpayers have become final.thus,the receiver is collaterally estopped from challenging the finding.and because it has been conclusively determined that the taxpayers procured the funds at issue through fraud,the taxpayers could not have thought that they had an unrestricted right to the funds.see culley,at.consequently,the receiver,standing in their place and stead,is collaterally estopped from asserting that the taxpayers satisfied the requirements of section a 
the receiver offers virtually nothing in the way of developed argumentation against the application of collateral estoppel.the receiver does,however,make two points.first,it laments that the government was in large part responsible for providing the taxpayers with the legal cover that enabled them to execute their fraudulent scheme.this boils down to a suggestion that the government should be equitably estopped from disputing whether the taxpayers had an apparent unrestricted right to the funds.but estoppel against the government is hen teeth rare,especially when,as in this case,the proposed estoppel involves public funds.see opm richmond,see also heckler cmty.health servs.of crawford,i t is well settled that the government may not be estopped on the same terms as any other litigant.
in all events,the estoppel argument is suggested in an manner,unaccompanied by any fully formed argument.accordingly,we deem it waived.see united states zannino,cir.
the receiver remaining argument is no more convincing.in it,the receiver asserts that subsequent legislation,namely,a provision of the pension protection act of,q,demonstrates that the taxpayers reasonably could have believed that they had an unrestricted right to the fraudulently derived income.this assertion,though,arrives too late the finding of fraud was an essential element of a final judgment in an earlier proceeding,and the receiver is bound by that result.see manganella,at.
the receiver has a fallback position,arguing that it can obtain a refund even though the taxpayers themselves could not.this argument tracks the district court reasoning.stressing that section a was enacted to alleviate inequities,not to perpetuate them,the court concluded that congress could not have intended to impute the taxpayers fraud to the receiver and thus deny relief to fraud victims.see rob evans,supp.at.as a result,the district court determined that the receiver can not only step into the taxpayers boots,but it can also,as it were,knock the mud off them before putting them on.id.at.
this determination,which has the effect of giving the receiver the benefits of the taxpayers status without compelling the receiver to shoulder any of the burdens of that status,weaves an equitable exception into the fabric of section a.such formulations are generally disfavored.united states tierney,cir.having one cake and eating it,too,is not in fashion in this circuit.the text of the statute at issue does not support such a generous construction.
we review matters of statutory interpretation de novo.see medchem,comm r,cir.here,we start with the background principle that income tax deductions and credits are matters of legislative grace.id.at.d eductions are strictly construed and allowed only as there is a clear provision therefor.indopco,comm r,quoting new colonial ice helvering.section a is simply a method for calculating a deduction,so this principle controls.see id.
of course,the most reliable guide to the meaning of a statute is the statutory text.see.bank germain,we have stated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.if the plain language of a statute elucidates its meaning,that meaning governs.the fact that the equities real or perceived may favor the taxpayer does not allow an inquiring court to distort the statute plain meaning by importing its own notions of fairness.see united states,cir.
in this instance,congress did not sound an uncertain trumpet,and we believe that the district court erred in refusing to follow section a unambiguous textual mandate.nothing in the discernable legislative intent justifies carving out a special exemption from the unrestricted right requirement for parties in either the receiver or the underlying plaintiffs position.indeed,the legislative history of section does not contain even a glimmer of a reason to think that the provision was intended to give the victims of a taxpayer fraud a free pass around the unrestricted right requirement.the statute was plainly designed to alleviate an entirely separate problem the plight of taxpayers who are inadequately compensated for taxes paid on income later restored.see,reprinted in,reprinted in,see also skelly oil,at.
we add that although section was enacted to alleviate a perceived inequity,the inequity that the receiver deplores differs materially from the inequity that the statute was intended to correct.when a statute is aimed at addressing a particular inequity in the tax code,it does not follow that the statute may be interpreted to address every inequity attributable to the tax code.the opposite is true when a statute plain language permits only one interpretation,a court may not make an end run around that language by the simple expedient of pointing to the statute equitable purpose.see hawayek,cir.
relatedly,the receiver again echoing the district court asseverates that we should refuse to impute the taxpayers fraud to the receiver because doing so would not further the purpose of the fraud exception to recovery under section.rob evans,supp.at citing cooper united states,supp.this asseveration relies almost exclusively on the decision in cooper,a case similarly configured but arising in the bankruptcy context,in which the court predicated its holding on the ipse dixit that public policy would not be served by mechanically applying the statute.cooper,supp.at.in our view,cooper is wrongly decided the issue is not one of public policy but,rather,one of statutory construction.that issue,in turn,depends on whether the taxpayer appeared to have an unrestricted right to the funds.see culley,at.such an unrestricted right is what the plain language of section requires.see id.at mckinney,at see also seggerman farms,comm r,cir.declining to disregard the plain language of the tax code even if the code subjects taxpayers to harsh tax consequences.
in a variation on the same theme,the receiver says that its special status qua receiver justifies special treatment.see rob evans,supp.at noting that c ourts have exhibited a disinclination to impute fraud to a receiver in the corporate context.in support,the r
