microsoft corporation appeals the tax court deficiency judgment in favor of the commissioner of internal revenue the commissioner.in and,microsoft claimed export property deductions for certain commissions it paid to microsoft foreign sales corporation.these commissions were for royalty income subsidiaries earned from the international distribution of master copies of microsoft computer software.the commissioner disallowed the deductions because it concluded that master copies of computer software were not deductible export property under now repealed a b.during the applicable period,that section provided,in relevant part 
the term export property shall not include patents,inventions,models,designs,formulas,or processes whether or not patented,copyrights other than films,tapes,records,or similar reproductions,for commercial or home use,good will,trademarks,trade brands,franchises,or other like property 
a b because we interpret this section phrase copyrights other than films,tapes,records,or similar reproductions,for commercial or home use to include computer software masters,we reverse the tax court judgment.
statutory background 
in,in response to a troubled economy,congress twice tried but failed to enact legislation that would have exempted export property from tax liability in certain circumstances.both bills stated that intangible intellectual property would not be deductible export property,but exempted certain copyrightable materials.one bill provided that copyrights other than motion picture films or films or tapes used for radio or television broadcasting were not export property,cong.the other provided that copyrights other than films,tapes,or records for the commercial showing of motion pictures or used for radio or television broadcasting or to provide background music,were not export property,cong.neither bill was enacted.
the next year,congress successfully passed the revenue act of,stat,with stated goals which included putting the lagging economy on a high growth path,increasing the number of jobs,reducing the high unemployment rate,increasing exports,and improving the balance of payments hereinafter the disc legislation,at,reprinted in.the senate report explained that 
to provide tax incentives for firms to increase their exports,congress has provided tax deferral for of profits,so long as they are retained in a new type of corporation known as a domestic international sales corporation or a disc.the requirements for qualification as a disc in general are that substantially all of the corporation gross receipts and assets must be export related.
id.at,reprinted in at.by this legislation,congress sought to provide substantial stimulus to exports and at the same time to avoid granting undue tax advantages to the disc sic.id.at,reprinted in at.
in,responding to pressure from signatories to the general agreement on tariffs and trade,congress supplemented the disc regime with foreign sales corporations fscs in the tax reform act of,a,stat,hereinafter the fsc legislation.polychrome int l krigger,cir citing joint committee on taxation,general explanation of the revenue provisions of the deficit reduction act of,cong d,at cch.under the new legislation,fscs promoted the same goals as discs,but a fsc could permanently exclude,rather than defer,a portion of its profits from qualifying export sales.see conf,at,reprinted in.the language that determined qualifying export property remained the same in both the and versions of the law.in each,export property must have been 
a manufactured,produced,grown,or extracted in the united states by a person other than a disc fsc,

c not more than percent of the fair market value of which is attributable to articles imported into the united states.
c,a.both statutes excluded from export property patents,inventions,models,designs,formulas,or processes,whether or not patented,copyrights other than films,tapes,records,or similar reproductions,for commercial or home use,good will,trademarks,trade brands,franchises,or other like property.c b,a b the only difference between the clauses is that a comma after the word processes was omitted from the version.
although some uncertainty was expressed regarding whether and to what extent this exception applied to copyrighted computer software programs,see,tech.mem,wl,the parenthetical exception remained unchanged until,when congress amended a b to specify that computer software was within the parenthetical exception t he term export property shall not include copyrights other than films,records,or similar reproductions,and other than computer software whether or not patented,for commercial or home use see relief act of,stat.in making this change,congress recognized that treasury regulations excluded from treatment as export property computer software accompanied by the right to reproduce,but directed that n o inference was intended regarding the qualification as export property of computer software licensed for reproduction abroad under present law.conf,at,reprinted in.
factual background 
organized as a partnership in,appellant incorporated as microsoft corporation microsoft in.microsoft and forms described its business as the development,production,marketing,and support of a wide range of software for business and professional use,including operating systems,languages and application programs,as well as books,hardware and products for the microcomputer marketplace.
microsoft distributed its products internationally through two principal lines foreign computer makers known as original equipment manufacturers or oems and microsoft foreign subsidiaries known as controlled foreign corporations or cfcs.oems and cfcs purchased from microsoft computer software master copies software masters,which contained the object code for computer programs and related data files for microsoft products including operating systems such as and windows and applications such as word and excel.such purchases included a license which gave the oems and cfcs the right make copies for distribution to others.the software licensees could store the digital information from the masters on network computers at their facilities and modify,reproduce,and distribute the licensed software,paying a royalty for each copy of the copyrighted work distributed in the market or for each computer system the oems sold.
microsoft product release services group prs produced the master copies of the software and related documentation for distribution to the oems and cfcs.during the years at issue,prs provided masters on inch magnetic tape and on inch and inch magnetic diskettes diskettes.during this period,microsoft also exported individually packaged retail software,but deductions for these items are not at issue in this appeal because the commissioner determined that these individually packaged standardized software products came within the definition of export property.see microsoft,comm r of internal revenue,wl temp.reg.a t f.
microsoft organized microsoft fsc corporation as a virgin islands corporation in,and qualified it as a fsc to take advantage of the favorable tax provisions available under the fsc legislation.microsoft and treated the royalties that microsoft earned from the software master licenses to the oems and cfcs as foreign trading gross receipts ftgrs for the purpose of determining foreign trade income under.microsoft then paid a commission based upon these gross receipts,using the applicable administrative pricing rules of.
the commissioner disallowed microsoft deductions for commission amounts attributable to software masters because the commissioner determined that the software masters,which included the right to reproduce,did not qualify as export property,but instead constituted disqualified copyright property under a b.in response,microsoft filed suit in the tax court.it contended that the commissioner incorrectly disallowed its fsc commission deductions attributable to the export of software copies.the amounts of these claimed deductions were in and in the case came on for trial in.
tax court trial 
in the tax court,the parties stipulated that microsoft software development in the united states satisfied the domestic production requirement of a.at trial,microsoft argued that the parenthetical phrase other than film,tapes,records,or similar reproductions,for commercial or home use in a b the similar reproductions parenthetical covered the media to which copyrighted material is affixed.in microsoft view,once a software program was affixed to films,tapes,records,or similar reproductions,it became export property under a b.microsoft evidence showed that,in and,software,sound recordings,and motion pictures were distributed on a variety of media including magnetic tapes and diskettes and cds software,records,magnetic tapes,and cds sound recordings,and film,magnetic tapes,and laser video disks motion pictures.additionally,export procedures for each involved the use of master copies on some form of magnetic tape.microsoft evidence also showed that it used licensing techniques similar to those used by the motion picture and music industries,which allowed for product reproduction and adaptation to fit particular markets and required use of associated trademarks.
the commissioner argued that the parenthetical reference to films,tapes,records,or similar reproductions covered the particular content typically placed on the specifically listed media,and therefore included only sound recordings and motion pictures.the commissioner argued that because software is fundamentally different from motion picture and sound recordings,it could not constitute a similar reproduction falling within the parenthetical,and could not be export property under a.the commissioner presented evidence of differences between sound recordings and motion pictures as compared to software,and emphasized that computer software actually enables the computer to do a variety of useful functions while sound recordings and motion pictures are more analogous to data that can lead to different outputs,but can not add to a machine basic functionality.
the tax court ruled in favor of the commissioner.in an opinion filed september,and a decision filed july,the court held that 
w ithin the purview of the parenthetical,films,tapes,and records are content specific,and similar reproductions refers to films,tapes,and records on media that might be invented in the future.in sum,we hold that copyrights in computer software do not constitute section a export property.
microsoft,at.the tax court found that computer software is fundamentally different from film,tapes,and records in that it causes a computer to perform countless functions.id.the court also relied on temporary treasury regulation a t f,holding that this regulation conformed with the court interpretation of the statute.id.at.the reference in the regulation to master recording tapes,the court held,was meant to benefit the sound recording industry only.id.at.finally,the court rejected microsoft argument that the regulation was invalid.id.at.microsoft filed a timely appeal to this court.
the primary issue is whether computer software masters,sold for adaptation,reproduction,and distribution abroad,come within the phrase copyrights other than films,tapes,records,or similar reproductions,for commercial or home use,and thus qualify as export property under internal revenue code a b.the tax court held that similar reproductions in this section refers only to reproductions of motion pictures and sound recordings.microsoft argues that similar reproductions includes computer software because the entire parenthetical refers to the media to which copyrighted works are affixed.we review this issue of statutory construction,and the tax court construction of the tax code,de novo.leslie comm r of internal revenue,cir.
we begin our statutory interpretation by looking at the plain meaning of a b.our first step in interpreting a statute is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.robinson shell oil,d.when the text of a statute contains undefined terms,we construe those terms to have their ordinary meanings.fed.deposit ins.meyer,d.where the plain language of the statute is susceptible of more than one interpretation,we are left with the task of determining the more plausible interpretation of the language congress chose.united states hohri,d.
the statute at issue reads 
the term export property shall not include patents,inventions,models,designs,formulas,or processes whether or not patented,copyrights other than films,tapes,records,or similar reproductions,for commercial or home use,good will,trademarks,trade brands,franchises,or other like property 
a b.we must interpret the statute parenthetical phrase other than films,tapes,records,or similar reproductions,for commercial or home use.if computer software masters constitute similar reproductions to films,tapes,and records then computer software masters are to be considered export property under a.
dictionary definitions contemporary to the original enactment of a b clarify the meaning of the words used in the parenthetical.the relevant webster new world dictionary published in webster defines tape as a narrow strip or band of steel,paper,or a shortened form of magnetic tape.webster new world dictionary of the american language david guralnik,college ed.webster defines film as either a motion picture or a sheet or roll of a flexible cellulose material covered with a substance sensitive to light and used in taking photographs or making motion pictures.id.at.record is defined as something on which sound or visual images have been recorded esp.a thin,flat grooved disc for playing on a phonograph.id.at.thus,at the time congress adopted the language,the terms film and record,as well as tape,could properly refer to the media capable of holding content or the content itself.
words that can have more than one meaning are given content,however,by their surroundings whitman am.trucking ass ns,d citing fda brown williamson tobacco,d and jones united states,d.in deciding which of the relevant definitions to apply,we look to the words nearby.limited,comm r of internal revenue,cir.given this guidance,it makes sense for each specific term in the similar reproductions parenthetical to refer to media,rather than content.
though record and film each could potentially have been used as a synonym for specific content film for motion picture and record for sound recording,such a construction would render tape,which had a definition that more clearly referenced a medium and not the type of content stored,wholly out of place.moreover,if films,tapes,and records each referred to content in,tapes would have been mere surplusage as it is capable of storing both audio content,like records,and audiovisual content,like films.we are reluctant to treat statutory terms as mere surplusage.duncan walker,d citing babbitt sweet home chapter,communities for a great,d.thus,tapes as well as films and records must be considered in giving meaning to similar reproductions.
both microsoft and producers of master copies from the motion picture and sound recording industries store and distribute their products on similar and sometimes identical media,including magnetic media such as tapes and diskettes and optical media including compact discs cds and digital video discs dvds.because the computer software industry and the entertainment industry use the same or similar media on which to store and distribute their content,the reproductions of their copyrighted works are similar.thus,the plain meaning of the similar reproductions parenthetical is that computer software masters are similar reproductions to motion picture and sound masters,which the commissioner concedes are included in the parenthetical.
we have also considered whether there is any ambiguity in the plain meaning of the similar reproductions parenthetical.in doing so,we have examined that parenthetical in relation to the specific list of items excluded from export property under a b.see john united s
