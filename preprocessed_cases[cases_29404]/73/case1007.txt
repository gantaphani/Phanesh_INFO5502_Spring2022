facts and procedural history 
charles trantina served as an insurance agent for state farm insurance companies state farm in the phoenix area from until his retirement in.he operated his insurance agency as a sole proprietorship until.in,he incorporated the agency as trantina insurance agency,the corporation,an arizona corporation of which he was the sole shareholder.upon incorporation in,state farm and the corporation executed a corporation agent agreement corporate agreement,which lies at the center of the current dispute.
the corporate agreement governed all aspects of the corporation relationship with state farm.the corporate agreement imposed on the corporation,among other duties,the obligation to solicit insurance applications,collect premiums and other charges,service insurance policies,help with insurance claim processing,and deposit monies collected on behalf of state farm into a trust account.the corporate agreement required that the corporation principal business be the fulfillment of the agreement and that the corporation and its sales representatives sell insurance exclusively for state farm.state farm,in turn,took upon itself the obligation to assist the corporation with a portion of advertising costs as well as to provide the corporation with insurance manuals,forms,and records.
under the agreement,all of the manuals,forms,and records provided to the corporation by state farm remained the property of state farm.the corporate agreement also provided that all information relating to policyholder names,addresses,and ages,as well as information about policy details,such as expiration or renewal dates and the location of insured property,were trade secrets of state farm.the corporate agreement provided that all forms or other materials on which such information was recorded were the sole property of state farm.
state farm compensated the corporation for its services by paying commissions for generating or servicing policies,providing higher commissions for servicing policies that the corporation had generated.when trantina began his career as a state farm insurance agent in,he was assigned policies to service.when he retired and liquidated the corporation in,the corporation was servicing over policies,a large portion of which trantina himself had generated.
in addition to the regular commission payments,the corporate agreement required state farm to pay the corporation termination payments when the agreement terminated,payable monthly for five years.these payments were contingent upon the satisfaction of two conditions.first,the corporation was required to return to state farm,within ten days of the termination,all of state farm property,such as the forms,manuals,and other documents containing information concerning insurance policies and policyholders.satisfaction of this condition entitled the corporation to the first two monthly termination payments.
the remaining monthly termination payments required satisfaction of an additional condition the corporation,its president,and its licensed sales positions all held by required to comply with a agreement that prevented trantina,for a period of twelve months,from selling insurance competitive with state farm products to any of the customers whose policies he had serviced.compliance with both the first and second conditions entitled the corporation to receive the remainder of the monthly termination payments.
in,after serving as state farm insurance agent for years,trantina retired.he accordingly notified state farm that the corporate agreement would terminate on june.following termination of the agreement,the corporation returned all of state farm property within ten days as required by the agreement,and trantina complied with the provision,thus entitling the corporation to the termination payments.the corporation received the termination payments until its dissolution in march trantina,as the corporation sole shareholder,received the payments following dissolution.
in,trantina and his wife,linda trantina filed a joint tax return classifying the termination payments that trantina received from state farm as ordinary income.on april,they timely filed an amendment to their income tax return,seeking to reclassify the termination payments as a long term capital gain and thereby reduce their tax liability for.the trantinas accordingly claimed a refund for the tax year in the amount of plus interest.the irs denied their claim for a refund on june,and the trantinas timely filed suit for a refund in the federal district court for the district of arizona on december.both parties moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted summary judgment for the united states on may.
the trantinas advanced two claims for the refund in the district court.first,they claimed that the termination payments were long term capital gain because the payments,originally an asset of the corporation,were made to trantina after he exchanged his shares in the corporation for the assets of the corporation during the liquidation.second,the trantinas claimed that the payments are long term capital gains resulting from the sale or exchange of a capital corporate agreement longer than one year.see trantina united states,d.
the district court found that because the trantinas failed to present their first claim to the,the court was without jurisdiction to hear that claim.see id.at.the district court also granted summary judgment for the united states on the trantinas second claim,reasoning that the corporate agreement was not a capital asset and that,even if it was,no exchange or sale of the corporate agreement had occurred.see id.at.on appeal,the trantinas only challenge this second issue 
ii.classification of the termination payments 
no one disputes that the termination payments made to trantina constitute gross income to the trantinas and are,therefore,taxable.see a except as otherwise provided in this subtitle,gross income means all income from whatever source derived.however,as everyone who has attempted to navigate the labyrinth of the federal tax code knows,not all gross income is taxed at the same rate.the trantinas argue that the termination payments qualify as long term capital gains,which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.see id.h.the united states asserts that the termination payments are ordinary income.
a long term capital gain is defined as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than year,if and to the extent such gain is taken into account in computing gross income.the statute establishes three requirements that must be met to classify income as a long term capital gain the payments must arise from the sale or exchange,of a capital asset held longer than one year,and be given in consideration of this sale or exchange.see baker,at.
the trantinas argue that the termination payments satisfy this definition because the corporate agreement itself constituted a capital asset,and it was exchanged with state farm for the termination payments.the united states,in turn,insists that the termination payments do not meet the definition of long term capital gain because trantina and his corporation had no property rights under the corporate agreement beyond the contractual obligation to perform services and be compensated for those services.further,the government contends,even if the corporate agreement is deemed to be a capital asset,it was not sold or exchanged but instead was brought to an end on its own terms.we agree with the government and hold that the corporate agreement was not a capital asset.
the code defines capital asset as any property held by the taxpayer whether or not connected with his trade or business excluding eight categories of property not relevant in this case a.a literal reading of this broad statutory language would cause every conceivable property interest,even an employment contract,to fall within the category of capital asset,the termination of which would result in a capital gain or loss.see united states maginnis,cir furrer comm r,cir per curiam if all contracts granting rights could be considered capital assets,without inquiry into the nature of the rights granted,almost all ordinary income from salaries,wages or commissions could be transformed into capital gain.because of this problem,the supreme court has stated that not everything which can be called property in the ordinary sense and which is outside the statutory exclusions qualifies as a capital asset.comm r gillette motor,d.instead,the court has held that the term capital asset should be construed narrowly to afford treatment only in situations typically involving the realization of appreciation in value accrued over a substantial period of time,and thus to ameliorate the hardship of taxation of the entire gain in one year.id.accordingly,whether a particular property right qualifies as a capital asset depends on the nature of the property right that the taxpayer asserts.
the parties spend considerable time in the briefs discussing cases involving the question of whether a contractual right qualifies as a capital asset.these cases demonstrate that,when the property right asserted concerns the contractual right to perform a service and receive compensation for the service,a payment made to terminate the contract can not be considered a capital asset unless the contract confers something more than the right to perform services or receive compensation for services performed.see,furrer,at vaaler united states,cir t he courts have quite uniformly held that contracts for the performance of personal services are not capital assets and that the proceeds from their transfer or termination will not be accorded capital gains treatment but will be considered to be ordinary income.coal coke mcginnes,cir per curiam finding a contract giving the taxpayer an exclusive sales agency not to be a capital asset because it did not confer on the taxpayer some interest or estate in or encumbrance upon some property with which the contract is concerned united states dresser,cir finding that the exclusive right to practice a patent did constitute a capital asset nelson weaver realty comm r,cir finding sale of mortgage servicing contract along with files,ledgers,and records to be a capital asset dorman united states,cir finding that an option to become a full partner in a business venture constituted a capital asset brown comm r,cch,a payment in discharge of the right to receive commissions on policies,unlinked to the policies themselves by any proprietary interest,is simply a substitute for ordinary income.the question in the present case is thus whether the corporate agreement conferred on trantina some right or interest beyond the right to perform the services required by the agreement or to receive compensation for the services performed under the agreement.
we have addressed this issue,albeit in a slightly different context,previously.in furrer commissioner,the taxpayer,an insurance agent,successfully sued the insurance company for which he worked for breach of contract.at.the taxpayer argued that the resulting damages should be treated as capital gain and not as ordinary income because his contract rights under the agency agreement were in themselves capital assets.id.we rejected that argument,viewing the essential right under an insurance agency contract to be the right to earn commission income.id.at.we concluded that t his attempted transubstantiation of income into capital must fail because the essential capital asset,tangible or not present.id.
more recently,the seventh circuit faced essentially the same situation that confronts us.in baker commissioner,baker had received termination payments under an agency agreement with state farm that was nearly identical to the corporate agreement in this case.at.baker reported the termination payments that state farm made under the agreement as long term capital gain on his federal income tax return.id.at.the commissioner of internal revenue commissioner issued a notice of deficiency to baker,finding that the state farm termination payments constituted ordinary income,not capital gain.baker contested the ruling in the tax court,which found for the commissioner.id.
on appeal to the seventh circuit,baker contended that the termination payments were in consideration of the goodwill he established over his year career.id.at.the seventh circuit rejected his arguments and agreed with the tax court finding.citing a provision in baker agency agreement with state farm reserving to state farm all property rights over the policies and policyholder information,the court wrote that b ecause warren baker did not own any property related to the policies,he could not sell anything.id.as a result,the court found that baker had not sold or exchanged a capital asset his termination payments were therefore ordinary income.see id.at.
we adopt the reasoning of the seventh circuit.a precondition to realizing a capital gain is the ownership of a capital asset.yet under the express terms of trantina corporate agreement with state farm,trantina simply had no property that could be sold or exchanged.the corporate agreement contains a provision nearly identical to the one that the baker court found to be controlling.trantina corporate agreement states 
information regarding names,addresses,and ages of policyholders of the companies the description and location of insured property and expiration or renewal dates of state farm policies acquired or coming into the agent possession during the effective period of this agreement,or any prior agreement,except information and records of policyholders insured by the companies pursuant to any governmental or insurance industry plan or facility,are trade secrets wholly owned by the companies.all forms and other materials,whether furnished by state farm or purchased by the agent,upon which this information is recorded shall be the sole and exclusive property of the companies.
given this blanket reservation of all property rights to state farm,it is unclear exactly what trantina could have sold or exchanged.trantina could not sell back to state farm something that it already owned.
trantina attempts to distinguish baker by noting that baker argued that baker termination payments were made in consideration of the sale of goodwill,while trantina does not rest on this argument.the baker court did find that the termination payments could not be characterized as payments for goodwill.see baker,at.but the holding in baker extended beyond goodwill the baker court found that baker did not own anything under the agreement and therefore could not sell anything,not even goodwill.see id.at baker owned nothing.thus,he could sell no assets,including goodwill.
trantina attempts to avoid the plain language of the corporate agreement by characterizing the corporate agreement itself as a capital asset that was exchanged with state farm for the termination payments when trantina retired.on this theory,trantina had rights and interests in valuable assets,the managed insurance policies,which he asserts gave him some interest or estate in or encumbrance upon some property with which the contract is concerned.coal coke,at.
yet this characterization of the corporate agreement does not fit with the express terms of the agreement.as noted above,trantina did not have any property rights in the policies under the express terms of the agreement.the policies,including all identifying information which might have been taken or conveyed to another insurance agency,belonged to state farm,not trantina.furthermore,the corporate agreement expressly forbade trantina from transferring or assigning his interest in the agreement itself.section of the corporate agreement states that 
neither the agreement nor any interest thereunder can be sold,assigned,or pledged and no right in any sum du
