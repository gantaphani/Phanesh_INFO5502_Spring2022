in,david and suzanne hillman the hillmans received written notice from the commissioner of the united states internal revenue service the commissioner that a deficiency existed in the amount of federal income taxes they had paid for taxable years and.according to the notice,the hillmans still owed the government in federal income taxes for taxable year and in federal income taxes for taxable year.the hillmans contested the full amounts of these deficiencies by filing a timely petition for redetermination in the united states tax court the tax court.at the time the hillmans filed their petition,they were residents of bethesda,maryland.
the parties submitted this case to the tax court on the following stipulated facts.during taxable year,david hillman was the sole shareholder of southern management corporation smc,a corporation taxed under subchapter s of the internal revenue code irc during taxable year,david hillman owned percent of smc stock.
smc provided real estate management services to approximately ninety entities,including joint ventures,limited partnerships,and subchapter s corporations,which were involved in real estate rental activities at all times relevant to the issues in this appeal,david hillman owned,either directly or indirectly,interests in each of these entities the passthrough entities.the general partner of each limited partnership was either david hillman or an upper tier partnership or subchapter s corporation in which he owned an interest.
during taxable years and,the hillmans did not participate in the activities of the passthrough entities.the hillmans did,however,participate in the activities of smc by performing real estate management services smc had contracted to perform for the passthrough entities.indeed,david hillman materially participated in smc real estate management activity in excess of hours 
the hillmans reported as income the compensation paid to them for their real estate management services offered through smc for taxable years and.in computing their taxable income for and,the hillmans deducted the total amounts of the management fee expenses of the passthrough entities for taxable years and from the gross income they received during those years through smc for providing the management services that gave rise to the management fee expenses.the notice of deficiency disallowed this deduction,thus resulting in the claimed tax deficiencies at issue in this appeal.
on april,the tax court entered a final decision fully in favor of the hillmans.the tax court accompanied its final decision with a published opinion holding the hillmans properly deducted the management fee expenses of the passthrough entities from their related management fee income for purposes of lowering the amounts of their taxable income for taxable years and.the commissioner filed a timely appeal.we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to a.
in this appeal,we are presented with the following question of law may the hillmans legally deduct their passive management fee expenses from their related nonpassive management fee income for purposes of lowering their taxable income for taxable years and we review this question of law de novo.balkissoon commissioner,cir.
the commissioner insists this question is easily answered by applying the plain language of irc a which prohibits individuals,estates,trusts,closely held c corporations,and personal service corporations from deducting passive activity losses or passive activity credits from nonpassive gains in an effort to lower taxable income.a.specifically,irc a provides 
a disallowance.
in for any taxable year the taxpayer is described in paragraph,neither 
a the passive activity loss,nor 
b the passive activity credit,for the taxable year shall be allowed.
persons following are described in this paragraph 
a any individual,estate,or trust,
b any closely held c corporation,and 
c any personal service corporation.
id.for purposes of irc,the term passive activity is defined as an activity involving the conduct of a trade or business in which the taxpayer does not materially participate.id.c.with certain exceptions not relevant here,rental activity is a passive activity.id.c.also for purposes of irc,the term passive activity loss is defined as the amount if any by which a the aggregate losses from all passive activities for the taxable year,exceed b the aggregate income from all passive activities for such year.id.d.the commissioner points out that the somewhat harsh result of applying irc a in a or wash transaction is tempered by irc b,which provides that any loss or credit from an activity which is disallowed under subsection a shall be treated as a deduction or credit allocable to such activity in the next taxable year.id.b.
the hillmans do not dispute,nor could they,that straightforward application of the plain language of irc a prohibits them from deducting the management fee expenses of the passthrough entities for taxable years and from their related management fee income for those same respective years however,the hillmans take the position that the plain language of irc a should not so apply.the hillmans position is based upon their argument that,when irc l is read together with certain portions of irc legislative history,it is clear that congress directed the secretary of the treasury the secretary to issue a regulation excepting management fees resulting in no accretion of the taxpayer actual wealth from operation of irc a,and the secretary failure to comply with this direction does not prevent them from avoiding operation of irc a.the tax court reasoning in support of its ruling in favor of the hillmans essentially tracks this argument made by the hillmans.
irc l,relied upon by the hillmans,provides that the secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out provisions of irc,including regulations which provide that certain items of gross income will not be taken into account in determining income or loss from any activity and the treatment of expenses allocable to such income l.the following excerpt from the house conference report for the tax reform act of is the legislative history of irc upon which the hillmans rely 
further issue with respect to portfolio income arises where an individual receives interest income on debt of a passthrough entity in which he owns an interest.under certain circumstances,the interest may essentially be,and thus lack economic significance.for example,assume that a taxpayer charges of interest on a loan to an s corporation in which he is the sole shareholder.in form,the transaction could be viewed as giving rise to offsetting payments of interest income and passthrough interest expense,although in economic substance the taxpayer has paid the interest to himself.
under these circumstances,it is not appropriate to treat the transaction as giving rise both to portfolio interest income and to passive interest expense.rather,to the extent that a taxpayer receives interest income with respect to a loan to a passthrough entity in which he has an ownership interest,such income should be allowed to offset the interest expense passed through to the taxpayer from the activity for the same taxable year.
the conferees anticipate that treasury regulations will be issued to provide for the above result.such regulations may also,to the extent appropriate,identify other situations in which netting of the kind described above is appropriate with respect to a payment to a taxpayer by an entity in which he has an ownership interest.such netting should not,however,permit any passive deductions to offset nonpassive income except to the extent of the taxpayer allocable share of the specific payment at issue.
conf,at,cong.the secretary has promulgated no permanent regulations exempting items of income and expenses from operation of irc a,and has only issued one proposed regulation in this regard.that proposed regulation deals only with the interest situation specifically discussed in the just quoted legislative history of irc and the reverse of that situation,when a passthrough entity loans money to its owner.prop.reg.april.
