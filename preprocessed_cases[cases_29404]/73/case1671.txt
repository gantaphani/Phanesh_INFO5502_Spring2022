the county of los angeles assessed ad valorem property taxes on personal property allocated by a military defense contractor to the performance of its contracts with the united states government.the progress payment clause of the federal contracts states that title to property allocable or chargeable to the contracts vests in the federal government.the county interprets this to mean that the united states takes a lien or security interest in the contractor property.we disagree with the county interpretation.title means title.title does not mean lien.because the county can not tax property owned by the united states,it must refund the taxes paid by the contractor on property allocated to the performance of its military contracts.
