the question presented in these appeals is whether the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac are exempt from the payment of state and local taxes imposed on the transfer of real property in maryland and south carolina.fannie mae and freddie mac claim that they are exempt from such transfer taxes under c and e,respectively.counties in maryland and south carolina the counties,however,which collect transfer taxes,claim that those exemptions do not,as a matter of statutory interpretation,apply to state and local taxes relating to real property,including transfer taxes,and that,in any event,exempting fannie mae and freddie mac from state and local transfer taxes for real property would be unconstitutional as an infringement on the states taxing power.
the district courts in maryland and south carolina rejected the counties arguments,concluding that the general tax exemptions applicable to fannie mae and freddie mac,while not applicable to real property taxes,did cover real property transfer taxes,thus making a distinction between property taxes and transfer taxes.the courts also concluded that congress,in providing the tax exemptions to fannie mae and freddie mac,acted within its commerce clause power.
we agree with the district courts,as explained herein,and affirm.
congress created fannie mae during the great depression to provide banks with more capital for mortgage lending.see generally richard bartke,fannie mae and the secondary mortgage market,nw.its charter describes its purposes as follows 
the congress declares that the purposes of this subchapter are to establish secondary market facilities for residential mortgages,to provide that the operations thereof shall be financed by private capital to the maximum extent feasible,and to authorize such facilities to 
provide stability in the secondary market for residential mortgages 
respond appropriately to the private capital market 
provide ongoing assistance to the secondary market for residential mortgages by increasing the liquidity of mortgage investments and improving the distribution of investment capital available for residential mortgage financing 
promote access to mortgage credit throughout the nation by increasing the liquidity of mortgage investments and improving the distribution of investment capital available for residential mortgage financing and 
manage and liquidate federally owned mortgage portfolios in an orderly manner,with a minimum of adverse effect upon the residential mortgage market and minimum loss to the federal government.
while fannie mae was originally created as a government corporation,congress split it in,creating the government national mortgage association ginnie mae,which remains a government corporation,and privatizing fannie mae.
freddie mac was established by congress in as a private corporation to compete with fannie mae,and its charter describes similar purposes.see note.
fannie mae and freddie mac carry out their missions by purchasing mortgages originated by lenders,pooling the mortgages into investment instruments,and selling those securities to raise capital for further purchases.by providing capital to lenders,these activities promote access to mortgage credit throughout the nation and stabilize the secondary market for residential mortgages.
congress has exempted fannie mae and freddie mac generally from state and local taxes,except that any real property of either fannie mae or freddie mac shall be subject to state,territorial,county,municipal,or local taxation to the same extent as other real property is taxed.c as to fannie mae see also id.e as to freddie mac id.j as to the fhfa.
maryland and south carolina,as well as many other states,impose taxes on the ownership of real property,as well as excise taxes on the transfer of real property.
maryland property tax is imposed annually on owners of real property located in the state,based on the assessed value of the property.see,tax prop.a,a,a.in addition,maryland imposes a recordation tax on instrument s of writing,deeds,leases,and mortgages that are recorded with the clerk of a circuit court,as well as a transfer tax on the same instrument s of writing.see id.the amount of the recordation and transfer taxes are based on the consideration paid for the real property or the principal amount of debt secured.see id.maryland also authorizes counties to impose transfer taxes,which,for example,montgomery county has done.see id.montgomery county code et.
south carolina similarly imposes an annual tax on the ownership of real property located in the state,based on its assessed valuation.see ann.in addition,south carolina imposes recording fees for the privilege of recording deeds in which land is transferred to another person.id.a.as with maryland,the rate for the recording fees in south carolina is based on the consideration paid or to be paid for the real property or for the debts recorded.id.a.
in the course of their business,fannie mae and freddie mac acquired real property in both maryland and south carolina through foreclosures on mortgages that they owned or guaranteed.when selling these properties to third persons,they refused to pay the transfer taxes and recording fees,claiming to be exempt from them under c and e,respectively.the maryland and south carolina counties,which collect these taxes,disputed fannie mae and freddie mac claimed exemptions,contending that the exemptions did not cover state and local transfer taxes,including recording fees,insofar as they related to real property,and they commenced these actions one in maryland and two in south carolina for a declaratory judgment that fannie mae and freddie mac are liable for transfer taxes and recording fees and to recover as damages the taxes and fees that they refused to pay.the fhfa,as conservator of fannie mae and freddie mac,was also named a defendant in the maryland case and intervened as a defendant in the south carolina cases.
the south carolina district court consolidated the two actions pending there and certified the consolidated action as a class action,defining the class as all counties in south carolina.the court thereafter rejected the counties claims on the merits,concluding that the exclusion from the general tax exemptions covered only real property taxes and not transfer taxes.the court also rejected the south carolina counties claim that the tax exemptions were unconstitutional.the maryland district court did not reach the class action certification question but dismissed the maryland county claims as a matter of law,again concluding that the exclusion from the general tax exemptions did not apply and that the exemptions themselves were a constitutional exercise of congress commerce clause power.
these appeals followed,and we ordered that they be consolidated for our review.
the general tax exemptions for fannie mae and freddie mac exclude state and local taxes on their real property to the same extent as other real property is taxed.c id.e.the counties argue that real property,as used in the statutes,includes deeds to the property recorded by fannie mae and freddie mac because deeds are indispensable to ownership of real property they are the principal evidence of ownership and true title.the counties reason that such a construction follows from the concept that real property ownership is a bundle of sticks that includes the right to transfer title.consequently,by their account,a real property transfer tax is a tax on real property,which is excluded from the general tax exemptions provided for fannie mae and freddie mac.
thus,according to the counties,when a statute refers to a real property tax,it is also referring to transfer taxes.such a blur of the two taxes would mean analogously that any reference to a personal property tax a tax on the ownership of personal property must also be a reference to sales taxes imposed on the transfer of personal property.yet,every legal and common understanding distinguishes a property tax from a transfer or sales tax.
the supreme court made this very point clear when it stated that a property tax is levied upon the property itself,whereas a transfer tax is levied upon the transfer of property.united states wells fargo bank.the court explained 
a n exemption of property from all taxation ha s an understood meeting the property is exempt from direct taxation,but certain privileges of ownership,such as the right to transfer the property,can be taxed.underlying this doctrine is the distinction between an excise tax,which is levied upon the use or transfer of property even though it might be measured by the property value,and a tax levied upon the property itself.
id.at.thus,the exemption from a tax on real property was not an exemption from a tax on certain privileges of ownership,such as the right to transfer real property.id.
when that distinction is recognized,it becomes apparent that the exclusions allowing for the taxation of real property as other real property is taxed,c,e,undoubtedly refer to real property taxes imposed on the ownership of real property and not to transfer taxes imposed on the transfer of real property,on the sale of real property.
the supreme court applied the same distinction in pittman home owners loan.in pittman,the court considered whether maryland could impose a tax on the home owners loan corporation.that corporation was subject to a statutory tax exemption with a real property exclusion materially identical to the ones in the present case.see id.at.the court found that the corporation was exempt from the recordation tax,which necessarily meant that the real property exclusion did not apply to the recordation tax.id.at.
the transfer taxes in the present case are analogous to the recordation tax in pittman,and both are distinct from property taxes.see also fed.land bank bismarck lumber,obviously a tax upon the sale of building materials to be used on the real estate of a federal land bank is not a tax upon that real estate southern ry.watts,a privilege tax is not converted into a property tax because it is measured by the value of property.
moreover,the south carolina and maryland statutory schemes themselves confirm the divide between excise taxes and property taxes.both states,in addition to imposing a tax on the transfer of real property,impose a separate direct tax on real property,using the same subject to language used in the federal exemption statutes.compare,tax prop.a ll property located in maryland is subject to property tax emphasis added,and ann.all real property in south carolina shall be subject to taxation emphasis added,with e excluding from the general taxation exemption any real property subject to state or local taxation to the same extent according to its value as other real property is taxed emphasis added,and c similarly using subject to language.
in sum,we hold that the real property exclusions from the general tax exemptions of c and e do not include transfer and recordation taxes.accord dekalb cnty.fed.hous.fin.agency.lexis cir,cnty.of oakland fed.hous.fin.agency,cir.
the counties contend that,in any event,congress acted impermissibly in providing fannie mae and freddie mac with exemptions from state and local transfer taxes.disputing the district courts conclusion that the exemptions were justified under the commerce clause,the counties assert that the transfer taxes were assessed on local,intrastate activity the buying and selling of parcels of real estate,and therefore any efforts to regulate them were not justified by the commerce clause but instead amounted to nothing less than an infringement on the states sovereign power to tax a power indispensable to their existence.gibbons ogden,wheat,see also bode barrett,observing that the power of a state to tax is basic to its sovereignty dows city of chicago,wall,it is upon taxation that the several states chiefly rely to obtain the means to carry on their respective governments.
before addressing the counties commerce clause argument,we address the counties contention that we should review congress authority to exempt fannie mae and freddie mac from state and local taxes under the standard of review.they argue that the rights of the states to impose taxes are just as fundamental,from a constitutional standpoint,as the rights of individuals to due process and equal protection under the fifth and fourteenth amendments.the counties provide no authority for this position,though,candidly observing,the admitted absence of judicial standards for limiting congressional interference with state taxes is no proper reason to apply a wrong standard or not formulate a proper one.
we need not,however,formulate a new standard,as it is established that for a federal statute to pass constitutional muster under the commerce clause,there need only exist a rational basis for concluding that the regulated activities taken in the aggregate,substantially affect interstate commerce.gonzales raich,emphasis added see also hodel.surface mining reclamation ass n,the task of a court that is asked to determine whether a particular exercise of congressional power is valid under the commerce clause is relatively narrow.the court must defer to a congressional finding that a regulated activity affects interstate commerce,if there is any rational basis for such a finding united states gibert,cir i f a rational basis exist s for concluding that a regulated activity sufficiently affect s interstate commerce,then a challenge to congress power under the commerce clause to regulate that activity must fail alterations in original quoting united states lopez.
and this level of scrutiny is not altered because a regulation exempts an entity from state taxation.the counties analogy to the fifth and fourteenth amendments fails because there is no independent constitutional protection for the states right to tax.to be sure,congress must speak clearly when preempting a state traditional powers,including the power to tax.see dep t of revenue of or.acf.but congress intent to exempt fannie mae and freddie mac from state taxation in the present case could not be clearer the statutes provide that fannie mae and freddie mac shall be exempt from all taxation now or hereafter imposed by any state or by any county.c id.e.the supreme court has often recognized congress power to exempt entities from state taxation,but it has never indicated that such an exercise of power would be subject to strict scrutiny.see.dep t of revenue blaze constr,whether to exempt the government contractor from arizona transaction privilege tax rests with congress united states new mexico,if the tax immunity of federal contractors is to be expanded beyond its narrow constitutional limits,it is congress that must take responsibility for the decision united states city of detroit,t his is not to say that congress,acting within the proper scope of its power,can not confer tax immunity by statute where it does not exist constitutionally.and more particularly,in arizona public service snead,the court upheld a federal law invalidating a discriminatory new mexico tax on the transmission of electricity where congress had a rational basis for finding that the new mexico tax interfered with interstate commerce,and selected a reasonable method to eliminate that interference.id.at.while snead was a dormant commerce clause case,the court employment of the standard of review nonetheless undermines the counties claim that state taxes are deserving of heightened protection.
in the absence of a particular constitutional right that would trigger heightened scrutiny,we hold that a congressional exemption from state taxation under the commerce clause is subject to review.
on the merits,the counties contend that the commerce clause does not authorize congress to regulate local,intrastate activity,such as collecting taxes on the buying and selling of parcels of real estate,and therefore,they argue,the district courts erred in holding that congress could reasonably conclude that state and local taxation would interfere with the stated missions of fannie mae and freddie mac.see butts fed.mortg.ass n,dist.lexis,at may,congress created fannie mae and freddie mac to provide stability and competition in the national secondary mortgage market.congres
