we face with increasing frequency issues at the junction of internet technology and constitutional principles.this is another such case.
borders online,llc online,a delaware company,sold more than million in merchandise over the internet to california consumers in and.online website included a notice that any goods purchased from online could be returned to any borders books and music store borders store.under the policy of borders,the owner of borders stores,customers could exchange the items or receive a credit card refund.numerous borders stores are located all over california.borders,borders and online also engaged in incidental practices to benefit the borders brand.online and borders are affiliated through a common parent company but are distinct corporate entities.
the state board of equalization board determined that borders was online representative operating in the state for the purpose of selling online goods,and therefore online was required to collect and remit a use tax from its california customers for the period april,through september,the disputed period.in the matter of the petn.for redetermination under the sales and use tax law of borders online,transfer binder cal.tax rptr.cch,board borders opn.the primary questions posed by this appeal are whether borders activities on behalf of online were for the purpose of selling online goods and whether,through borders,online had a sufficient presence in the state to justify the imposition of the tax collection burden.the trial court,on summary judgment,ruled in favor of the board.online challenges the ruling on the merits and argues the case should have gone to trial.we conclude the trial court determination was correct,and affirm.
factual and procedural background 
online is a limited liability corporation formed under delaware law in with headquarters in michigan from april to september,online sold books,book accessories,magazines,compact discs,videotapes,and similar tangible goods over the internet to customers,including customers in california.it did not own or lease property in california during the disputed period and did not have any employees or bank accounts in the state.online employees located outside california received and processed all orders placed through online website.online neither collected tax from its california purchasers nor paid sales or use taxes to the board for its sales to california purchasers during the disputed period.
online was wholly owned by borders group.borders group,also owns borders,which,in turn,owns borders stores.numerous borders stores are located throughout california and in other states.borders stores sell merchandise that is comparable to the goods sold by online over the internet.receipts at borders stores sometimes contained the phrase visit us online at.although borders stores did not have facilities to assist customers wishing to place orders with online,borders employees were encouraged to refer customers to online.visitors to online website could access a link to borders website,which provided advertising and promotional information for borders stores,including a list of store locations.
two people who served on online board of directors also served on borders board of directors during the disputed period.all but two of the nine people who served as officers of online during the disputed period,including the two people who served as president in and,also served as officers of borders at some point during the disputed period.borders and online shared a similar logo.they also shared some financial and market data but did not intermingle their corporate assets.borders and online filed their tax returns on the combined report basis pursuant to revenue and taxation code section et.
online california sales increased each quarter during the disputed period 
from september,to august,online posted the following return policy on its website you may return items purchased at to any borders books and music store within days of the date the item was shipped.all returns must be accompanied by a valid packing slip your online receipt and shipping notification are not valid substitutes for a packing slip on returns to stores.gift items may be returned or exchanged if they are accompanied by a valid gift packing slip.you may not return opened music or video items,unless they are defective.any merchandise returned to borders pursuant to this policy was either absorbed into borders own inventory or disposed of.borders did not charge online for accepting returns of online merchandise.borders also accepted returns of saleable merchandise presented without a receipt including merchandise purchased from competitor retailers for store credit,provided that borders carried the returned items.however,exchanges or credit card refunds for returned items were routinely provided only to borders and online customers with receipts or packing slips.
on july,the board sent a letter to online stating the company was required to collect and remit use taxes on all sales to california purchasers because online affiliate borders acted as online agent by accepting return merchandise.section,subdivision a requires retailers engaged in business in this state to collect and pay a use tax.in stating its opinion that online was required to pay a use tax,the board relied on section,subdivision c c,which defines r etailer engaged in business in this state as a ny retailer having any representative,agent,salesperson,canvasser,independent contractor,or solicitor operating in this state under the authority of the retailer or its subsidiary for the purpose of selling,delivering,installing,assembling,or the taking of orders for any tangible personal property.the board reasoned that online was engaged in business in california because borders was acting as an agent by accepting return merchandise on behalf of online as defined in the company web site return policy.
online removed its return policy message from its website on august.the board continued to regard online as a retailer engaged in business in california,however,and again wrote to the company on october,stating online was required to collect and pay state use tax.on january,the board issued a notice of determination to online for unpaid use taxes,plus interest and penalties,for online sales to california purchasers during the disputed period.
online filed a petition for redetermination,which the board denied in a memorandum opinion.board borders,supra,cal.tax rptr.cch at.the board found that online was covered by section c because borders was online authorized representative in california for the purpose of accepting returns from online california customers,and the taking of returns constituted selling for purposes of the statute.board borders,at.in so ruling,the board held that selling includes all activities that are an integral part of making sales.id.at.the board reasoned that online favorable return policy was designed to induce potential customers who might otherwise not make an online purchase to place orders,and thus the policy was integral to selling in transactions.ibid.the board also ruled that online had a sufficient physical presence in california through borders to satisfy the commerce clause of the united states constitution.ibid.
on november,the board issued a notice of redetermination to online for unpaid use taxes,plus interest but not penalties for the company sales to california purchasers.online paid to the board and then timely submitted a claim for refund,which the board denied.after exhausting its administrative remedies,online filed a complaint in san francisco superior court seeking a refund.its complaint alleged it was not a california retailer and therefore was not required to pay taxes under state law and claimed the commerce clause prohibited imposing taxes on the company.
the board filed a motion for summary judgment,and the trial court granted the motion.the court held that online was covered by section c because of online policy providing for returns at borders stores,the imposition of a tax on online did not violate the commerce clause,and the fact that online return policy was not posted on its website during the entire disputed period did not affect the conclusion that online had a sufficient physical presence in california to support a finding of substantial nexus.the trial court entered judgment on november,and online timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
standards on summary judgment 
the purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties pleadings in order to determine whether,despite their allegations,trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar.summary judgment is proper only where there is no triable issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.there is a triable issue of material fact only if the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.aguilar,at,d.the party moving for summary judgment generally bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact if he carries his burden of production,he causes a shift,and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.ibid.thus,once a defendant has made a prima facie showing,the plaintiff must then set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists code civ,subd.p see also aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.to meet this burden,the plaintiff must produce admissible evidence.see lyons security pacific nat.bank th,d lyons promise to prove facts at a later date insufficient to oppose summary judgment compton city of santee th,d compton party opposing summary judgment must produce admissible evidence raising a triable issue of fact mere speculation and conjecture insufficient.
on appeal,we review the trial court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards that governed the trial court.zavala arce th,d.we consider all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion,except that which the court properly excluded,and the uncontradicted inferences the evidence reasonably supports.artiglio corning cal th,d.
online is subject to california use tax 
a use tax on interstate sales is a tax on the privilege of use of property by the buyer who purchases goods that would not otherwise be subject to a sales tax.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.taxation.california imposes a use tax on the storage,use,or other consumption in this state of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer for storage,use,or other consumption in this state.the tax is paid by the purchaser but is collected by the retailer,subd.a,subd.a a retailer that fails to collect the appropriate use taxes becomes indebted to the state for the amount owed.
both parties agree this case is governed by section c defining r etailer engaged in business in this state,ante,but disagree as to whether the statute applies to online.the question,then,is whether online had a representative or agent in california acting under the authority of online for the purpose of selling personal property.c.
borders acted under online authority as its agent 
the trial court found that online return policy posted on its website provided undisputed evidence confirm ing that borders was online authorized agent or representative for the purpose of accepting returns of online merchandise from california purchasers.it held this finding was supported by the fact that each borders store in the state would accept returns and provide a refund,store credit or exchange of online merchandise borders encouraged its store employees to refer customers to online website and receipts at borders stores sometimes invited patrons to visit us online at.underscoring omitted.the trial court concluded,borders practice of providing unique and preferential services to online purchasers by offering cash refunds to any purchaser of online merchandise who wanted one,when it could refuse to do so for customers of online competitors,indicates that borders provided such preferential services because it was online authorized agent or representative.
online claims the trial court erred in ruling as a matter of law that borders was online agent because issues of agency typically are questions of fact.it is true that t he existence of an agency relationship is usually a question of fact,unless the evidence is susceptible of but a single inference.citations.violette shoup th,d,italics added violette.here,the undisputed evidence is susceptible of but one borders was acting as online authorized agent or representative.
a representative is o ne who stands for or acts on behalf of another.black law dict.ed.an agent is one who represents another,called the principal,in dealings with third persons.scholastic book clubs,state bd.of equalization d.scholastic.an agency relationship may be implied based on conduct and circumstances.id.at.in scholastic,cited by the trial court,the appellant was an mail order book seller that had no physical presence in california.id.at.it mailed catalogs to teachers,who distributed offer sheets to students and then forwarded orders to the appellant.ibid.the appellant claimed,as online does here,it was not subject to california use tax because the teachers were not acting as its agents or representatives.id.at.the court disagreed and held the teachers were acting under the appellant authority,based on the fact that b y accepting the orders,the payment and shipping the merchandise,appellant clearly and unequivocally ratified the acts of the teachers and confirmed their authority as appellant agents or representatives.id.at.likewise here,there is no dispute either that online announced on its website that borders was authorized to accept online merchandise for return,or that borders would provide customers with an exchange,store credit,or a credit card credit.by accepting online merchandise for return,borders acted on behalf of online as its agent or representative in california.
online claims the trial court erred in holding borders was online agent because it failed to apply what it refers to as california test to review the agency issue.it insists an agency relationship exists only if the agent has power to alter legal relationships of the principal,the agent acts as the fiduciary of the principal,the principal can control the agent,and have considered the agent consents to act as the principal agent.while it is true courts consider these factors when considering agency issues in various contexts,there is no test in determining agency.online overstates its position in claiming the trial court erred by failing to apply such a test.
indeed,the cases online relies on to advocate the existence of the test were decided in other contexts,analyzed far different factual situations,and did not necessarily apply each of the four factors cited by online.michelson hamada th,d written agreements regarding billing and collection services created agency relationship between two doctors violette,supra,th at,d no agency relationship created between social acquaintances merely because one made suggestion to another paul ins.industrial underwriters ins.d.no agency relationship created when driver took car for a test drive alvarez felker d.relationship at issue was that of.
online also claims that although the trial court relied on a quotation from scholastic,it disregarded the test that was applied in that case.to the contrary,scholastic addressed only the appellant authority over the teachers who took orders because of their power and authority to solicit orders.scholastic,supra,d at fn.the court did not refer to a test but,instead,analyzed the particular facts of that case.id.at.
online claims it had no control over borders action but does not dispute that borders implemented the return policy posted on online website.online also notes there was no written agreement between online and borders,but t he creation of an agency relationship is not dependent upon the existence of a written agreement.scholastic,supra,d at.in fact,t he relationship may be implied based on conduct and circumstances citations,as well as by ratification.id.at.it therefore does not matter,as online claims,that borders did not have the subjective belief it was online agent.by accepting online merchandise under the terms of online return policy,borders was effectuating online policy,even if it was also borders own policy.the undisputed facts show borders acted as online agent or representative and therefore online meets the first part of section c s definition of r etailer engaged in business in this state,as a retailer having a representative or agent operating in this state 
online contends,however,that the trial court denied it an opportunity to present evidence that there was no agency relationship between online and borders during the period in controversy.in making this argument,instead of identifying genuine conflicts in the evidence presented to the trial court,online points to an absence of evidence and argues the trial court should not have granted summary judgment w ithout a f ully d eveloped r ecord.but online does not explain why it declined to present such evidence to the trial court in connection with its opposition after the board had shown that borders stores accepted returns of online merchandise and that borders referred customers to online.a party failure to offer necessary evidence in opposition to a motion for summary judgment is not a legitimate reason to attack the summary judgment on appeal.see lyons,supra,th at,d compton,supra,th at,d.
specifically,online claims there is no evidence regarding several issues of material fact relating to the agency analysis it argues there was no evidence regarding the extent of returns of online merchandise to borders during the disputed period,no evidence that borders employees ever referred customers to online website,and no evidence that online sales in california were benefited by the return policy or by the printing of visit us online at on customer receipts.again,however,online can not simply point to an absence of evidence to avoid summary judgment rather,once a defendant has made a prima facie showing,the plaintiff must then set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists code civ,subd.p aguilar,supra,cal th at,d,after burden shifts,party opposing summary judgment has burden of production to make prima facie case that triable issues of fact exist.this is especially true where,as here,for example,borders did not track the extent of returns of online merchandise,thereby making it impossible for the board to provide the evidence online claims should have been produced.thus,we conclude the trial court correctly determined borders acted as online agent for purposes of section c 
borders was selling for purposes of section c 
the trial court concluded that by providing refunds and exchanges to online customers pursuant to online return policy,borders was engaged in selling as that term is used in section c.the court reasoned that the term selling may properly be defined to include all activities that constitute an integral part of inducing sales.such a definition fairly captures the common understanding of this term.
the term selling is not defined in the statute.the board construed the term to include all activities that are an integral part of making sales,and concluded that this interpretation accords with its common usage.board borders,supra,cal.tax rptr.cch at.the board reasoned,when retailers that make offers of sale to potential customers in california authorize representatives to take returns,these retailers acknowledge that the taking of returns is an integral part of their selling efforts.such an acknowledgement comports with common sense because the provision of convenient and trustworthy return procedures can be crucial to an retailer ability to make sales.this is especially evident in the realm of.ibid.online,by contrast,proposes the term selling be narrowly defined as the act of making a sales transaction.
although this court independently determines the meaning of a statute,if an agency charged with administering the statute issues its own interpretation,we will give due consideration to that construction.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,yamaha.here,the board is responsible for administering the applicable statutes.the weight to be given the board interpretation depends upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.yamaha,at,d,italics omitted,quoting skidmore swift.
we think the board interpretation of the term selling is persuasive.the board appears to have thoroughly considered the meaning of the term,and its reasoning that the act of selling encompasses offering other inducements to purchase is consistent with at least one later pronouncement.board borders,supra,cal.tax rptr.cch at in the matter of the petn.for redetermination under the sales and use tax law of barnes,transfer binder cal.tax rptr.cch,bookstore distribution of discount coupon on behalf of affiliated internet retailer was integral to selling efforts and thus constituted selling.in contrast,online narrow interpretation would mean that even if a local representative were to provide dramatic incentives to california customers to purchase the retailer goods,no tax could be imposed unless the representative is actually involved in the solicitation of the sale or the sale transaction itself.we agree with the board that online return policy undoubtedly made purchasing merchandise on its website more attractive to california customers,as they would know that returning or exchanging any unwanted items would be far simpler than if they purchased items from an retailer with no presence in california.
online contends this conclusion is a theory of marketing without evidentiary support from the record and that,as a factual matter,the policy was meant to benefit borders,not online.it also claims there was no evidence in the record that the return policy actually induced customers to purchase from online.in effect,online is contending the board did not present a prima facie case that the policy was an integral part of online sales activities.we disagree.
the board concedes it bears the initial burden of demonstrating that online return policy was implemented for the purpose of selling goods in california.it argues,however,that it need not prove the buyers motives because it is the intent of the seller that is relevant.see c a ny retailer having any representative operating in this state for the purpose of selling property is a r etailer engaged in business in this state.the return policy manifestly was not put in place to maximize returns of online merchandise,and online does not contend otherwise.therefore,the board concludes,the only reasonable inference is that the policy was created for the purpose of inducing sales in california.this conclusion rests on the logical inferences that at least some online consumers will not place orders if the retailer does not provide a return policy worthy of confidence and therefore online ability to offer these potential customers convenient returns and exchanges at nearby reputable stores would assuredly help promote such confidence.board borders,supra,cal.tax rptr.cch at.further,with respect to customers who are not satisfied with their purchases,a n online retailer that offers convenient,local return and exchange options is much more likely to obtain repeat business from such purchasers.ibid.
we think these compelling inferences,drawn from the undisputed facts,are sufficient to present a prima facie case,shifting the burden to online to present evidence or to argue contrary inferences and thus create a triable issue of fact.online did not do so.instead,it merely argued that the board definition of selling was overbroad,and that borders actions on online behalf did not constitute selling.online now contends that the trial court denied it the opportunity to present evidence that its return policy was not a cause of sales increases in.it states that it planned to produce evidence at trial that would refute the board analysis and demonstrate the return policy was established for reasons unrelated to inducing sales,and asks us to refrain from deciding the case without a fully developed record.but the time to present such evidence was at the summary judgment motion.even assuming we would prefer a more fully developed record,we have no authority to remand the cause for further proceedings absent a finding of error.
as to the merits,online can not seriously dispute that its return policy made its website more appealing to potential customers.one of the documents online produced to the an information sheet prepared for borders online as an extension of the borders brand and touted the reciprocal benefits of if we do refer customers to,those interested in purchasing online will go to amazon or.additionally,well under of visitors to the site purchase online,but receive a message about the borders brand and will experience our active promotion of borders stores.as your store experience can attest to,customers come into borders looking for items they seen online.we think can complement borders stores business and vice versa.even if the return policy also benefited borders,that does not mean the policy was any less attractive to online customers.whatever the subjective intent of online or its individual customers,the board conclusion that online return policy is integral to making sales because of its attractiveness,convenience,and trustworthiness is persuasive,especially in the context of.yamaha,supra,cal th at,d.
our analysis is reinforced by the fact that online return policy contemplates that sales may take place pursuant to the policy.the legislature has defined s ale for purposes of the state use tax as including a ny transfer of title or possession,exchange,or barter,conditional or otherwise,in any manner or by any means whatsoever,of tangible personal property for a consideration,subd.a.borders was authorized to provide online customers with store credit that could be used for the future purchase of borders merchandise.borders also would exchange online merchandise for its own merchandise.either transaction certainly falls within the legislature definition of s ale under section,subdivision a.when considered in tandem with other techniques,such as borders employees referring customers to online and borders receipts printed with the message visit us online at,the board conclusion that borders was online representative for the purpose of selling online goods is a correct application of the law.
c.the trial court ruling is consistent with the commerce clause 
it is well settled that under the commerce clause,there must be a sufficient connection between a state and a retailer in order for the state to impose a use tax on the seller goods.scripto carson,d scripto upholding imposition of florida use tax on georgia company where jobbers in florida were responsible for soliciting and submitting orders.this nexus prevents states from otherwise imposing impermissible burdens on interstate commerce.id.at.see also quill north dakota,d quill.a tax passes constitutional muster only if it is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing state.quill,supra,at,quoting complete auto transit,brady,d.
in quill,the united states supreme court reversed an opinion of the north dakota supreme court that permitted a tax on a business with no physical presence in the state.quill,supra,at.confirming the rule articulated in nat.bellas hess of revenue,d bellas hess,the quill court held that a use tax is impermissible where a seller only connection with a particular state is orders placed and merchandise delivered through a common carrier or the united states mail a seller must have a physical presence in a state to satisfy the commerce clause.quill,supra,at.as the united states supreme court has observed,the crucial factor governing nexus is whether the activities performed in the state on behalf of the taxpayer are significantly associated with the taxpayer ability to establish and maintain a market in the state for the sales.tyler pipe industries of revenue,d tyler pipe sales representatives engaged in substantial activities in washington to help piping company business in that state.online does not dispute it established and maintained a robust market for sales in california.the question is whether the record satisfies the remainder of the test,that the activities performed by borders on its behalf were significantly associated with online ability to establish and maintain its california market.ibid.we conclude that they were 
as an initial matter,we address online position that a state has no authority to impose a tax collection duty on an retailer unless its representative is actually making sales transactions as was the case in scripto,tyler pipe and scholastic.online formulation of the test is too constricted.the pivotal question when testing a state taxing authority against the dormant commerce clause is not whether the foreign company has agents soliciting sales in the state.the question,rather,as articulated in tyler pipe,is whether the activities of the retailer representatives are significantly associated with its ability to establish and maintain a market in the state for the sales.tyler pipe,supra,at.while the cases assess a combination of activities that often include solicitation or sales,the analysis turns on the totality of the activities undertaken to maintain a successful market.thus,for example,in standard pressed steel.revenue,d,the supreme court upheld washington imposition of a tax on the gross receipts of an retailer from goods sold in the state to its principal customer boeing based upon the presence of a single employee who solicited no sales,but whose duty it was to consult with boeing regarding its anticipated needs and requirements for the seller goods and to follow up on any difficulties in the use of those goods.similarly,in town crier,department of revenue d,the court upheld illinois imposition of a tax on a wisconsin furniture retailer because the retailer had entered illinois on various occasions to deliver merchandise and install window dressings,and the retailer was garnering half of its gross sales from illinois customers.in reasoning similar to that of the board in this case,the court concluded by making deliveries into illinois in its own vehicles,plaintiff has established a regular presence in illinois that enhanced its ability to establish and maintain a market for its furniture sales by repeatedly making deliveries and performing installations in illinois,plaintiff presence was demonstrably more than slight.id.at and see of revenue care computer systems,retailer had one salesman in arizona approximately two days per year and provided an average of approximately days of training per year to arizona customers although cost of training was insignificant compared to cost of hardware and software shipped from out of state,court found sufficient presence to support retail transaction privilege tax.in contrast,courts have found insufficient presence where the seller sent technicians into the taxing state an average of three times about hours per year to perform electronic wiring for installing the device sold.in re appeal of intercard,intercard.these contacts were considered isolated,sporadic,and insufficient to establish a substantial nexus to kansas.id.at see also of revenue share international so d,mail order company displayed and sold wares at a seminar in florida,attended primarily by individuals from outside florida,three days per year insufficient nexus to tax goods sold in florida through mail order.
of particular interest is the elucidation of this issue by new york highest court in orvis tax tribunal,orvis.after conducting an review of commerce clause jurisprudence before and after quill,the court concluded that the supreme court in quill had reluctantly reaffirmed the bellas hess some physical presence
