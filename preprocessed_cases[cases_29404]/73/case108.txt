this is an appeal from a tax court determination unfavorable to the estate of ida abraham the estate,brought by her two daughters as administratrixes.applying a,the tax court concluded that the estate had underreported the taxes due because the decedent had an interest in certain property purportedly transferred to her children by gift and purchase,that the purchase of the decedent interests by the children were not bona fide sales for adequate and full consideration,and that the decedent retained rights in the income from the total property.estate of abraham comm r,cch.as a result,the court rejected the estate challenge to the irs determination of a tax deficiency,which,after a decrease for state tax credits not relevant here,came to.
we affirm the tax court.we consider both the specificity required in a notice of deficiency and the various requirements of a.
ida abraham suffered from alzheimer disease and had to be placed under guardianship.in,a massachusetts probate court entered a stipulated decree requiring the establishment of an estate plan for abraham.that action was taken in order to ensure that abraham financial needs would be met and to prevent her estate from being drained by the contentious litigation among her children.abraham died on june.
as part of the estate plan,three pieces of commercial property,which were owned by abraham and which generated steady rental income,were transferred to three family limited partnerships flps.abraham and her children were partners in those flps.between,when the flps were set up,and,when abraham died,she,through her guardian ad litem,transferred percentage interests of her share in the partnerships to her children and their families.upon her death,the estate included in her estate tax return only the percentage interests in the flps still held by her at her death and valued these interests by applying minority and lack of marketability discounts.as explained,the irs assessed a deficiency based on,and the tax court rejected the estate challenge.
establishment of the estate plan 
ida abraham and her husband,nicholas abraham,had four children nicholas abraham,richard abraham,donna cawley,and diana slater.nicholas,died on june,and litigation amongst the children over his estate followed.
among the assets abraham received from her husband were three pieces of commercial real estate located in tyngsboro and walpole,massachusetts,and in smithfield,rhode island.the walpole property was leased to a lumber yard,and the other properties were skating rinks leased to third parties.the leases on all of these properties were,triple net leases to third parties unrelated to the abraham family 
at some point during this period,abraham developed alzheimer disease.a massachusetts probate court placed her under guardianship on march.the probate court appointed her daughter,donna,as a permanent guardian of abraham estate and property.litigation and discord among the children,mainly between richard and the two sisters,continued.the feud was apparently over what amount was needed for abraham protection.the litigation was also draining abraham assets.in order to end this,on august,abraham children their respective counsel,and abraham legal guardians signed a stipulated court decree to establish an estate plan for abraham pursuant to an agreement.the decree set forth the expectation for the estate plan and for the responsibilities of the parties.there was a separate estate plan.the tax court later considered evidence about the decree on the issue of the understanding of the parties.
the decree provided for the placing of the three pieces of commercial real estate in flps and then apportioning out percentage interests in the flps to the children in order to reduce the estate tax liability upon abraham death.but the family also understood that the flps were a means to protect abraham financially.as donna testified at trial 
t he partnerships assured that abraham would be constantly protected.she would never want for anything.there would always be money there.and if there was money in her partnership fund,it had to come out of my partnership shares or my brother,but the protection was there for her as a guarantee that she would live status quo.
the decree provided that attorney david goldman would be named as a limited guardian ad litem with respect to abraham interests in the flps and would 
have the right to meet with the guardians of the person and the estate of ida abraham in order to ascertain her needs to determine any and all shortfall as between the funds generated by ida abraham segregated property and the income required for her from each of the separate limited partnerships.
for each flp,abraham would be made a general and limited partner,while the three children,richard,donna,and diana,would also receive limited partnership interests in their respective flps.the decree provided that each child,as a limited partner,would 
receive income from said family limited partnership either as the management fee gifts from ida abraham after deducting from the gross income of the partnership all fees,taxes,partnership administration expenses,reserve for expenses and monies needed in the discretion of the limited guardian ad litem for ida abraham support.
emphasis added.under the decree,although the later flp agreements are silent on the point,support for abraham came from the income of the overall partnerships.the three partnerships under the decree share equally the support of ida abraham insofar as the funds generated by ida abraham properties maintained by her do not provide sufficient funds for her adequate health,safety,welfare and comfort as determined by the limited guardian ad litem 
there were two mechanisms by which the children would increase their ownership share in the flps,thus ostensibly reducing abraham estate by gift or by purchase.the decree provided that annual gifts consisting of limited partnership interests in the three flps would be made in amounts not to exceed the then available annual gift tax exclusion for federal gift tax purposes to the three children and their families.the three children would also have the right to purchase from abraham additional limited partnership interests in their respective flps,with the proceeds from the sales held in a revocable trust for the benefit of ida abraham during her lifetime and utilized for her needs only if her other assets are insufficient to do so and then held for such child and his or her family upon the death of ida abraham.
finally,the decree provided that 
ida abraham living arrangements shall remain in accordance with the present arrangement and every effort will be made to maintain her in status quo.her segregated assets shall be maintained at a level established by the limited guardian ad litem in his sole discretion.
the decree thus gave the guardian ad litem power not to make gifts from abraham share if that would contravene maintaining the status quo as to abraham living conditions.
creation of the flps and the transfers of the underlying real estate 
the estate plan that was established essentially followed the plan agreed to by the parties in the decree,though there were some differences in the details.we omit discussion of details not pertinent to the appeal here.
in october,three separate flps,one for each of the three children embroiled in the litigation,were created the rma family limited partnership for richard rma flp,the das tyngsboro family limited partnership for diana das flp,and the dac tyngsboro family limited partnership for donna dac flp.the commercial real estate properties were placed in the flps instead of having abraham as the general partner,each flp had,as its respective general partner,a separate management company formed for this purpose.each management company,as corporate general partner,had only a interest in the respective flps,but each also had the exclusive right to manage the business of the partnership,including the authorization to dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the partnership without the consent of the limited partners.attorney goldman was the sole corporate officer of the general partner management companies for the dac and das flps.because richard refused to indemnify goldman,harold rubin,richard accountant,was put in charge of the general partner management company of the rma flp.rubin was also named abraham guardian ad litem with respect to richard interests in the partnership,but had to defer to goldman as abraham guardian ad litem,and rubin had no control whatsoever over abraham.
the partnership agreements did not specifically mention any obligation for abraham support as specified in the decree.the agreements provided that if cash were available for distribution to the partners,the cash should first be used to discharge debts and obligations of the partnership and management fees,then to fund reserves for working capital,improvements or replacements or contingencies,to the extent deemed reasonable by the general partner,and finally to the partners in proportion to their respective percentage interests.
the october transfers of the underlying real estate to the flps are referred to by the parties as the first set of transfers.the parties stipulate that at the time of the transfer of the tyngsboro property to the flps,the property value was,with the undivided interest in each flp valued at.abraham initially held a limited partnership interest in each of the dac and das flps.donna and diana each held a limited partnership interest in the respective flps.it does not appear from the record that donna or diana paid for their interests,but in the end that is immaterial 
in order to establish the value of the percentage interests in the partnerships as of the time the flps were set up,the children submitted to the tax court the valuation set out in a november,letter from attorney william kirchick,an estate planning lawyer chosen to draft abraham estate plan.in that letter,kirchick explained that each interest in the flps was valued at,but that he had applied a discount for minority interest and a discount for lack of marketability to arrive at the market value of for each interest.at trial,attorney kirchick was not qualified as an expert and did not testify,and there was no explanation in the letter for how he arrived at these discount percentages.at the end of the letter,attorney kirchick added the following disclaimer 
you should know that no representation is made that these discounts will hold up or that you will be entitled to the full amount of the annual exclusions claimed for the gifts made.each partnership and the assets thereof must be judged on their own merits,and it is not possible to ascertain with any degree of certainty what will pass muster with the internal revenue service.
that warning proved to be prophetic 
at trial,the commissioner objected to the introduction of this valuation letter into evidence.the tax court admitted the letter for the limited purpose of showing that the children relied on the given valuation.but the court did not consider it as evidence that the discounts were appropriate.
purchase of partnership interests by the children 
the transfers of interests in the flps subsequent to their formation are referred to by the parties as the second set of transfers.
in october of,diana and donna each wrote a check to abraham,and in exchange,abraham,through her guardian ad litem,transferred a limited partnership interest in the das flp to diana,and a limited partnership interest in the dac flp to donna 
attorney goldman only created one checking account for each flp,and in the same general account he deposited the income from the monthly rent generated by the underlying real estate and the money paid to abraham to purchase limited partnership interests.no effort was made to segregate income paid to abraham for the transfer of her shares from the income from her ownership interest.this was not in compliance with the court decree,which specified that the funds paid to abraham to purchase her limited partnership interests would be held in a revocable trust for her benefit.
on march,donna wrote out a check made payable to the dac flp,but not to abraham,drawn on an account in both donna and diana names.in exchange,donna received a limited partnership interest in the dac flp from goldman who held the shares for abraham.on the same day,donna also wrote out a check made payable to the das flp drawn on the same checking account that she and diana shared.in exchange,diana received a limited partnership interest in the das flp from goldman.
in march,donna and diana each purchased an additional interest in their respective flps by paying to the flps.
gifts to the children 
also,between and,goldman,as abraham guardian ad litem,made total gifts of interests in the das flp to diana and her family.during the same time,goldman made total gifts of interests in the dac flp to donna and her family between and,goldman made gifts from abraham share of interests in the rma flp to richard and his family 
operation of the flps 
each month between the creation of the flps and abraham death,donna,as guardian of abraham person,would send letters to goldman setting out the monthly shortfall in payment for abraham expenses and demanding that the three flps make up the shortfalls.the shortfall represents the extent to which abraham personal income from sources such as social security and an annuity could not cover her expenses.goldman occasionally sought documentation of certain expenses,but ultimately always found donna accounting in order.goldman would then divide the shortfall amount in three,and cause checks to be written to donna from the accounts of the three flps to pay the shortfall.
each month,goldman also paid out to donna,diana,and richard their percentage ownership share which also included the shares gifted to their families of the income from the flps.according to some early accounting records of the flps,the net income of the partnerships was computed by deducting from the gross income of the partnerships expenses such as administration fees and insurance.at least in these early accounting records,the payments from the partnerships to make up the shortfall in abraham expenses were not treated formally on the books as partnership expenses.there were no flp accounting records from later in the record.
donna testified at trial that it was her understanding that all of the partnership income from the flps would be available to pay abraham expenses regardless of the children ownership interests,and that goldman was obliged to use the overall partnership funds to make up the shortfall.goldman testified at trial that he acted as a fiduciary for abraham,and understood his first responsibility,as set out in the documents,and as he discussed with everyone,to be to use funds necessary to maintain abraham as is.goldman testified that he saw his duties and authority as guardian ad litem to originate in the court decree,and specifically in the sections of the decree which provided that partnership funds had to be reserved for abraham needs and that abraham living arrangements were to be maintained in status quo.although he acknowledged that he had various other fiduciary duties in so far as he also managed the general partner management companies for the flps,his view was that the reason he was appointed was to work on abraham behalf,period.
goldman also testified that he never paid either donna or diana more than their share of the partnership funds,and that during the whole time he acted as her guardian ad litem,he paid abraham monthly shortfalls out of the share of flp income attributable to abraham.he admitted,though,that if abraham needs had increased beyond the income generated by the share attributable to her,he would have put abraham in the top priority and used any money that was at his disposal to use to account for her.he also explained that if one of the flps lost its source of income,he would have used his discretionary power to make up the shortfall from funds in the other flps.although he did testify at one point that he did not think he could outright refuse to pay to diana and donna the income attributable to the flp interests they had purchased,he immediately amended his testimony to explain that it was his and the family understanding that all flp funds could be used to fulfill abraham needs and had he used the funds in this way,he would have been doing what the family would have wanted.
events following abraham death 
on june,abraham died.based on the calculations in a letter from michael lipof,a real estate consultant,the estate reported in its estate and transfer tax return that the fair market value of abraham interest in the rma flp was and the value of her interest in the flps was a combined 
during the three months after abraham death,attorney goldman disbursed to diana from the das flp and to donna from the dac flp.these amounts were not reported on the estate tax return.the commissioner does not seek to include these amounts in the gross estate.
the internal revenue service audited the estate tax return and determined a deficiency of plus interest.the notice of deficiency was issued on february.in the notice,for each flp,the value of each flp as reported by the estate was set aside,and the underlying value of the commercial real estate held by the flp was included as part of the gross estate the notice gave the following explanation for each flp 
it is determined that the transferred name of flp for less than adequate and full consideration in money or money worth and that the decedent,through the guardian,retained an interest in the asset.therefore,pursuant to,section,the fair market value of the asset is includable in the decedent gross estate.accordingly,the taxable estate is increased by fair market value of the underlying real estate.
the provision of the code pursuant to which the commissioner determined a deficiency provided,in relevant part 
a general value of the gross estate shall include the value of all property to the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer except in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money worth,by trust or otherwise,under which he has retained for his life or for any period not ascertainable without reference to his death or for any period which does not in fact end before his death 
the possession or enjoyment of,or the right to the income from,the property,or 
the right,either alone or in conjunction with any person,to designate the persons who shall possess or enjoy the property or the income therefrom.
the estate petitioned the tax court for a redetermination of the deficiency.trial in the tax court was held on october.the tax court issued a memorandum decision on february.see estate of abraham comm r,cch.
the tax court first determined that the burden of proof was on the estate,rejecting the estate argument that the notice of deficiency failed to give adequate description of the factual and legal bases for the deficiency determination.id.at.
the tax court found that it was the understanding of the children and the legal representatives that abraham was entitled to any and all funds generated from the partnerships for her support first.only after this could any excess be distributed in proportion of the partners supposed ownership interests.here,it is clear that at the time of the transfers,decedent explicitly retained the right to the income that the flps generated to the extent necessary to meet her needs.id.at emphasis in original.
the tax court further found that the initial sales by abraham of flp interests to donna and diana for each did not constitute bona fide sale s for adequate consideration within the meaning of a because the estate did not produce sufficient evidence to demonstrate the fair market value for the partnership interests on the dates of the transfers.id.at.in addition,in the case of the subsequent purchases,the money was paid to the flps,not to abraham,and thus,the court found,could not qualify as bona fide sales.id.accordingly,the tax court upheld the deficiency determination.the final determination of the deficiency,after credits for state estate,inheritance,legacy or succession taxes,was.
the estate timely appealed to this court.
the burden of proof 
the estate first argues that the tax court erred by placing the burden of proof on the estate instead of on the commissioner.we review the allocation of the burden of proof,a question of law,de novo.see trull volkswagen of,cir.
generally,the taxpayer bears the burden to refute by a preponderance of the evidence the commissioner determination of deficiency,which is presumed to be correct.see welch helvering.delaney comm r,cir a.but where the notice of deficiency fails to adequately describe the basis on which the commissioner relies to support a deficiency determination and the commissioner seeks to establish the deficiency on a basis not described in the notice,the burden shifts to the commissioner on that new basis.shea comm r of internal revenue,wl see a.a new theory that is presented to sustain a deficiency is treated as a new matter when it either alters the original deficiency or requires the presentation of different evidence.wayne bolt nut comm r,wl.but if the theory merely clarifies or develops the original determination,it is not a new matter in respect of which the commissioner bears the burden of proof.id.
the estate main argument is that the notice was latently ambiguous,overly broad and confusing and failed to specify all the elements of the commissioner argument that under,the flp interests were taxable to the estate.the estate argues that the notice should have described why the consideration was inadequate and the amount of consideration the government would consider adequate,as well as which of the alternative possession,enjoyment or right to income theories it is relying on alleging a taxable event has occurred pursuant to a.the estate also argues that the notice failed to explain how the commissioner valued the flp interests at the fair market values of the underlying real estate.therefore,the estate argues,the burden of proof on all of these new matters should have been placed on the commissioner 
acceptance of the estate arguments would amount to a requirement that the notice of deficiency be as detailed as trial briefs.there is no such requirement.the standard of specificity for notices of deficiency is much lower.in fact,if a deficiency notice is broadly worded and the commissioner later advances a theory not inconsistent with that language,the theory does not constitute new matter,and the burden of proof remains with the taxpayer.abatti comm r,cir see also shea,at.the commissioner did not seek to change the amount of the deficiency or advance a theory inconsistent with the language of the notice.
the estate relies for its burden shifting argument on cases with very different facts and which are easily distinguishable.see,estate of thompson comm r,cch,commissioner had the burden on the applicability of because the notice of deficiency discussed disallowance of minority and lack of marketability discounts but did not mention.shea,at commissioner had the burden on the applicability of b and california community property law because neither was explicitly or implicitly referenced in the notice of deficiency.here,the notice specifically named as the legal basis for the deficiency and explained the factual basis for the determination as being abraham retention of an interest in all the income from the flps through her guardian despite transfers of flp interests to her children without adequate consideration.
as to the valuation question,while the notice itself does not explain,why the commissioner wanted to include in the gross estate the total value of the underlying real estate,it is clear that the estate was never confused about the commissioner theory.the estate tax return included attachments in which the estate computed the value of the flp interests nominally held by abraham at the time of her death.the estate own computations began with,and then applied discounts to,the fair market value of the underlying real estate.this was logical since the only property held by the flps was the real estate and rental income generated by the real estate.the notice of deficiency cited and included in abraham gross estate the fair market value of the underlying real estate as reported by the estate.
read in context,the clear implication of the notice of deficiency was that the commissioner sought to include of the flps in the gross estate,and the commissioner valued the flps at the value of the underlying real estate,as the estate itself did in its computations.that the estate shared this understanding of the commissioner theory is shown by the estate petition to the tax court for a redetermination,in which it argued that the commissioner was wrong to have determined that the entire value of each flp was includable in the gross estate and also wrong to have valued the flps at the value of the underlying real estate.olsen helvering,cir looking at whether taxpayers were misled to determine adequacy of notice of deficiency.
the commissioner valuation is in fact based on the estate own appraisal.in such circumstances,t he valuation in the notice of deficiency is entitled to a presumption of correctness.estate of magnin comm r,cir.to the extent that any discounts may be appropriate due to the fact that the assets are in the form of flps,the burden was on the estate to show the appropriateness of such discounts.that burden was critical to the question of whether the transfers of flp interests were for adequate consideration in money or money worth,an aspect of the analysis also set out in the notice of deficiency.the notice of deficiency was adequate to provide notice to the estate,and the commissioner did not argue any new matter over which burden shifting to the commissioner would have been appropriate 
application of section to the flp interests transferred by abraham during her lifetime 
on the merits,the estate argues that the tax court erred in determining that under,of the flps were includable in abraham gross estate.the estate argues that the tax court erred because donna and diana purchases of percentage interests in the flps were bona fide sales for adequate consideration,and abraham did not retain a right to,or enjoy,the income from the percentage interests transferred as the result of an agreement between the parties.
we begin with the structure of.section is designed to capture in the decedent gross estate transfers that are essentially,transfers which leave the transferor a significant interest in or control over the property transferred during his lifetime.united states estate of grace,d.a transfer would be covered by if the transferor retained for his life the possession or enjoyment of,or the right to the income from,the property.but if such a transfer were a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money worth,would not apply id.
bona fide sale 
the estate argues that except for the outright gifts of flp interests,donna and diana paid adequate and full consideration and purchased their other percentage interests in the flps in bona fide sales so that it was error to include those interests in abraham gross estate.
the biggest hurdle in the way of the estate and the reason why it lost in the tax court is that it did not meet its burden to prove that donna and diana paid adequate consideration for their flp interests.the estate produced no admissible evidence concerning the adequacy of the discounted value of the flp percentage interests because the valuation letters from kirchick,on which the estate relies,were excluded from evidence for those purposes the estate does not challenge that evidentiary ruling by the tax court here.
attempting an end run,the estate now argues that the tax court erred as a matter of law because the tax court used the wrong test for what constituted adequate consideration.the estate argues that whether full and adequate consideration was paid should be measured by the value of the remainder interest of the flp percentages at the time of the transfers and not the fee simple value of the flp percentages at the time of the transfers.the estate argues that donna paid for of the dac flp,while the remainder value of that portion of the dac flp,computed according to the actuarial tables in irs regulations,was only.similarly,the estate argues,diana also overpaid for her interests in the das flp,as measured by the actuarial value of the remainder interest.the commissioner,unsurprisingly,disputes the accuracy of these computations.
but this dispute is beside the point.the estate relies on a series of cases in which the decedent sold the remainder interest in property for its actuarial value while retaining a life estate in the property,and the courts held in those cases that adequate and full consideration for purposes should be measured by what the decedents actually remainder not the fee value of the property as a whole.see,estate of magnin,at wheeler united states,cir estate of comm r,cir.but those cases are inapplicable to the facts here,where no evidence in the record suggests that the parties ever contemplated the transfers as sales by abraham of remainder interests in the flps.
in fact,the evidence in the record is all to the contrary.the estate argument here is directly in conflict with its position at trial,where it vigorously attempted to show that donna and diana purchased present fee interests in the flps.the documents memorializing the transfers of flp interests from abraham to her daughters do not speak of remainder interests,and the parties computed the amount of money paid by donna and diana for the flp interests in reliance on unsubstantiated minority and lack of marketability discounts,not on the actuarial value of the remainder interests in the flps.the estate in its appellate brief argues that t he transferee will not possess or enjoy the property until the death of the transferor,which is plainly untenable in view of the fact that donna and diana received monthly payments from the flps during abraham lifetime.
the interests that were transferred are best described as present interests in the flps subject to abraham interest in diverting all flp income for her needs,a power to be determined and exercised at the discretion of her guardian ad litem.when all the evidence in the record suggests that the transfers were not treated by anybody as sales of remainder interests in the flps,it is impossible for the transfers to qualify as bona fide sales of remainder interests for adequate and full consideration.
it should be noted that the commissioner did give the estate credit for the payments under,offsetting these payments from the full value of the underlying asset.see estate of abraham,cch at.
right and enjoyment 
the estate next argues that the tax court erred in holding that abraham retained the right to the income that the flps generated to the extent necessary to meet her needs.estate of abraham,cch at.the estate makes two intertwined arguments abraham did not retain a legally enforceable right within the meaning of,and there was no agreement that abraham would retain a interest in all the income from the flps to the extent necessary for her support.
in order for to apply,it is not necessary that the retain a legally enforceable interest in the property.see estate of maxwell comm r,cir guynn united states,cir.an interest retained pursuant to an understanding or arrangement comes within.guynn,at.the existence or nonexistence of such an understanding is determined from all of the facts and circumstances surrounding both the transfer itself and the subsequent use of the property.estate of harper comm r,cch.the finding by the tax court that such an understanding existed is reviewed for clear error.see estate of maxwell,at.as with other issues,the estate bears the burden which is especially onerous for transactions involving family members of proving that an implied agreement or understanding between abraham and her children did not exist.estate of reichardt comm r,wl.
we may dispose of the first part of the estate argument quickly.the tax court did not find that abraham retained a legally enforceable right to all the income from the flps.therefore the arguments that the tax court decision is in conflict with vested property interests of the children is irrelevant.
what the tax cour
