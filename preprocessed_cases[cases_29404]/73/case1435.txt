this is a suit for a refund of patent fees alleged to have been unlawfully exacted.the appellant,miguel figueroa figueroa,contends that the statutory patent fees imposed on him in and for filing his patent application and issuing his patent violated art.i,cl.of the united states constitution the patent clause,because the statute was designed to generate revenue to fund federal programs other than the united states patent and trademark office pto.figueroa also contends that the fees constituted an impermissible direct tax in violation of art.i,cl.the direct tax clauses.the court of federal claims granted summary judgment for the united states on the first claim and dismissed the second.we affirm.
background 
the principal issue in this appeal is whether congress may constitutionally impose patent fees in an amount above what is used to fund the pto.the pertinent facts are not in dispute.
congress has imposed fees on the grant of patent rights since the first patent act in.under the act,patent fees totaled roughly.stat.patent fees did not total more than until,when congress increased the statutory patent application fee to and the statutory patent issuance fee to a minimum of,stat.in,congress for the first time required periodic patent maintenance fees,stat.the legislation established the patent and trademark office appropriation account in the treasury and required that all patent fee revenues be credited to that account.id.that account continues in existence to this day.
in,congress set the patent application fee at,the patent issuance fee at,and the patent maintenance fees at due three years and six months after issuance,due seven years and six months after issuance,and due eleven years and six months after issuance,a b,stat.
in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of obra,congress imposed a percent surcharge on top of both patent application and issuance fees.a,stat.the surcharge expired at the end of fiscal year fy,stat.
for fy congress increased the statutory patent application fee to,increased the statutory patent issuance fee to,and increased patent maintenance fees to,and due at the previously established time intervals,a b,stat.for fy congress set patent application,issuance,and maintenance fees at their current levels for the application fee,for the issuance fee,and,and,respectively,for the maintenance fees,stat.the patent fee structure is set forth in 
failure to pay application or issuance fees is treated as an abandonment of the application,a,failure to pay required maintenance fees results in expiration of the patent,b.
the heart of this case concerns congress decision not to appropriate all of the fees collected to fund pto operations.between fy and fy congress in its appropriations bills had made patent fee revenue with the exception of surcharge revenue available to the pto until expended.see,stat.beginning in fy,congress limited the amount of patent fee revenue the pto was authorized to spend.see,b,stat.as a result,some patent fee revenue was not available to the pto.figueroa refers to congress withholdings of patent fee revenue as diversions of that revenue.
also beginning in fy congress enacted a series of rescissions of pto authority to spend revenues from patent fees and redirected the revenue to other purposes congress rescinded roughly million in fy for use in deficit reduction,stat,roughly million in fy to offset subsidies to the steel,coal,and oil industries,stat,roughly million in fy to offset spending on a variety of federal programs,appx.e a,stat,and roughly million in fy to offset appropriations for homeland security programs.a,stat.
between fy and fy,the pto collected roughly billion in total fee revenue including surcharge revenue while its operational costs only totaled around billion,for a surplus of approximately million.the court of federal claims found that from fy to the present,at least million in patent fee revenue has been directed to spending.
figueroa alleges that the following table represents the total amounts of diverted and rescinded patent fees for fys through numbers are in millions 
since fy,pto operations have been funded entirely by fee revenue.however,pto employee benefits,including pensions,health insurance,and life insurance,which are administered by the office of personnel management opm,have been funded from the general treasury 
figueroa filed a patent application on february,and paid the statutory application fees.on august,he filed a complaint in the court of federal claims,seeking to recover the fees paid,as well as declaratory and injunctive relief barring future allegedly illegal exactions of patent fees he alleged that the fees established by the patent fee statute exceeded congress power under the patent clause,constituted an unapportioned direct tax on intellectual property in contravention of the direct tax clauses,and constituted a taking under the fifth amendment.he argued that,as a consequence of congress allegedly unlawful diversions and rescissions of patent surcharge and patent fee revenue,the pto now is underfunded to the point that it can not keep up with the volume of patent applications.figueroa subsequently paid the patent issuance fee,and on november,was issued united states patent.the parties and the court of federal claims treated figueroa complaint as seeking recovery of the issuance fee as well the application fee.
the government moved to dismiss figueroa claims pursuant to rules of the court of federal claims b and b.the court judge bohdan futey held that figueroa had standing but dismissed figueroa direct tax claim for failure to state a claim pursuant to rule b,concluding that the patent fees were a condition for obtaining an intellectual property right rather than a tax on existing property.the court also rejected figueroa takings claim,relying on our holding in commonwealth edison united states,en banc,that the takings clause does not apply to legislation requiring the payment of money.the court denied the government motion to dismiss figueroa patent clause claim,construing it as a claim for an illegal exaction over which it had jurisdiction under the tucker act.figueroa and the government then filed for summary judgment on the patent clause claim.figueroa argued that the clause required that congress imposition of patent fees promote the progress of useful arts,and that increasing fees to fund programs violated this requirement.the court of federal claims granted summary judgment for the government.the court held that the patent clause preambular promotion language imposes an enforceable limit on congress authority and assumed that the diversions and rescissions of patent fee revenue were permanent and substantial,figueroa united states,but concluded that figueroa had failed to establish that there was no rational relation between congress use of the fee revenue and the promotion of the useful arts.
figueroa timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
we review the court of federal claims rule b dismissal and its grant of summary judgment without deference.moyer united states,alves united states.
in both the patent clause and direct tax claims,figueroa primary claim is that the patent fees he paid to the pto were unlawfully exacted because congress may only charge fees used to fund the pto he also alleges that congress unconstitutionally diverted patent fee revenue to fund programs.he therefore seeks a determination that congress excess fees were unconstitutional,a refund of patent fees he paid in and,and an injunction barring future diversions.
as a threshold matter,and as the supreme court recently reiterated,we have an obligation to assure ourselves of figueroa standing under article iii of the constitution.daimlerchrysler cuno,d.to establish standing,a plaintiff must show that he suffered an that is both fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant and likely redressable by a favorable judicial decision.id.at lujan defenders of wildlife,d allen wright,d.
figueroa suffered an from actually paying patent fees.this injury is both traceable to the challenged conduct of charging fees in excess of that required to fund the pto and redressable by a judicial award of a refund upon a finding that this conduct was unconstitutional.figueroa thus has standing to challenge the legality of the fees that he paid.but figueroa does not have standing to challenge the diversion of the fees once paid,except to the extent that the diversions are alleged to render the exaction of fees unconstitutional.
we proceed to consider figueroa claim that the fees he paid were unlawfully exacted.
figueroa contends that the patent fees that he paid in and exceeded congress power under the patent clause for two separate reasons first,he asserts that congress can not impose fees that exceed the cost of operating the pto and second,he claims that even if congress can do so,there is no rational relationship between the fees imposed and the costs of running the patent system.
the patent clause,art.i,cl.of the constitution,provides,in pertinent part 
that congress shall have the power t o promote the progress of science and useful arts,by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.
art.i,cl.the constitution also empowers congress to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers,and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the united states,art.i,cl.figueroa argues that the phrase to promote the progress of science and useful arts in the patent clause creates an independently enforceable substantive limitation on congress authority under the clause.
in eldred ashcroft,d,the supreme court addressed the scope of congress authority under article i,clause,as it relates to copyrights.the petitioner in eldred argued that the copyright term extension act which extended the duration of existing and future copyrights by years,exceeded congress authority under the clause.eldred,at.the petitioner contended that the statute extension of existing copyrights does not promote the progress of science,as contemplated by the preambular language of the copyright clause which identifies the sole end to which congress may legislate.id.at.the court assumed,without deciding,that the preambular language imposed a limitation on congress authority.however,the court rejected the petitioner contention that the extension of copyright terms was categorically beyond congress power under the clause,based on an unbroken congressional practice of enacting such extensions dating back to the first congress in.id.at.
the supreme court in eldred went on to consider whether there was a rational basis for the legislation.it upheld the challenged legislation,finding rational bases for the conclusion that it promotes the progress of science.id.these included making united states copyright law consistent with that of other nations,see id.at,encouraging copyright holders to invest in the restoration and public distribution of their works,id.at,and responding to increases in human longevity and the substantially increased commercial life of copyrighted works resulting from the rapid growth in communications media,id.at.
like the supreme court in eldred,we assume,without deciding,that the patent clause preambular language limits congressional authority to actions necessary and proper to promot ing the progress of science and useful arts,and that this limitation is judicially enforceable.unlike the court of federal claims,we do not read any decision of the supreme court or our court as being to the contrary 
we reject figueroa contention that the fees were categorically beyond congress power under the patent clause because congress under that clause can not impose fees that exceed the costs of operating the pto.
it is axiomatic that congress is constitutionally empowered to create,administer,and maintain a patent system.graham john deere,d.within the limits of the constitutional grant,the congress may implement the stated purpose of the framers by selecting the policy which in its judgment best effectuates the constitutional aim.id.it is well established that congress may set out conditions and tests for patentability.id patent fees are a condition on the grant of a patent right failure to pay the required fees results in denial of a patent,see also boyden comm r of patents.fees have been an accepted condition of patentability since the first patent statute was enacted in.stat.funding the patent system with patent fee revenue is clearly within congress authority.
contrary to figueroa argument,the patent clause does not limit fees that congress may impose to the amounts directly appropriated for operating the pto.the patent system that congress has established need not be,and is not,limited to the pto.united states ex rel.bernardin duell.c ongress may provide such instrumentalities in respect of securing to inventors the exclusive right to their discoveries as in its judgment will be best calculated to effect that object.indeed,we have previously explained that the constitution does not require even that there be a pto.constant advanced.thus,for example,in the process of construing the patent act provision,the supreme court in graham expressly recognized that the federal courts have a role in the administration of the patent system,insofar as courts share with the pto the task of enforcing the requirements for patentability.graham,at.moreover,congress may constitutionally impose fees for patent application and issuance to serve a purpose other than raising revenue.as the court recognized in eldred,congress may legitimately seek to advance other public policy goals related to the objectives of the patent clause by enacting legislation pursuant to the clause.see eldred,at.
we conclude that congress under the patent clause is not limited to enacting legislation to fund the pto.we thus turn to the second step in the eldred analysis whether the fees imposed satisfy the rational basis requirement.
in deciding whether the legislation was permissible under the patent clause,we accord great deference to congress policy determinations.graham,at.eldred,at.as the court reiterated in eldred,judicial review of legislation enacted pursuant to article i authorization is limited to determining whether congress actions were a rational exercise of the legislative authority conferred by the patent clause.eldred,at.the question thus is whether there is a rational relationship between the present level of patent fees and congress legitimate objectives under the patent clause.eldred,at.
figueroa argues that congress reason for enacting fees at their present desire to generate additional revenue to fund the fees irrational and therefore unconstitutional.we disagree.the question,rather,is whether there is a rational basis on which congress could conclude that the level of fees served legitimate congressional objectives.in the equal protection context,the supreme court has held that,for purposes of rational basis review,w here there are plausible reasons for congress action i t is constitutionally irrelevant whether this reasoning in fact underlay the legislative decision.retirement bd.fritz,d quoting flemming nestor,d.the same test applies in this context.in eldred,the supreme court,in conducting its rational basis review,did not limit itself to the policy justifications that congress articulated.see at.p rovid ing greater incentive for authors to create and disseminate their work in the united states,though not specifically articulated by congress,was a rational basis for the legislation.
under this standard it is clear that the fee legislation at issue here had a rational basis for at least three separate reasons,any one of which is sufficient to satisfy the constitutional requirement.first,it was rational for congress to impose the fees to fund the overall patent system.the costs of that system are not limited to the direct costs of operating the pto.the direct costs appropriated by congress for operating the pto do not include employee benefits costs for pto personnel,which are paid from general treasury funds under the commerce,justice,state,the judiciary,and related agencies appropriations category figueroa admits that those costs are substantial,averaging in excess of million per year for fys through.in addition,costs of executive oversight for the pto and other aspects of the patent system by the commerce department are not included in the pto appropriation finally,there are the costs of operating the federal court system,which provides a forum for resolving patent disputes,both on appeals from pto actions and in private infringement litigation.the appellant here has not even attempted to quantify these other costs of operating the patent system or made any effort to show that they are disproportionate to the revenue raised from patent fees that is not directly appropriated to the pto.
figueroa complains that the actual dollars collected were not used to fund the patent system.the patent clause imposes no traceability requirement.even if the particular revenues are not directly used for the system,the fees bear a rational relationship to the cost of running the patent system.
second,even if the fees collected exceeded these secondary costs of operating the patent system within any given year,congress also could have rationally concluded that increased patent fees were necessary to keep pace with the likely future costs of administering the pto and the patent system pto operating costs have increased by over million since fy alone.congress can not know in advance precisely how much patent fee revenue will be generated in any given fiscal year thus congress could rationally decide to set patent fees at a level high enough to ensure sufficient funding for the patent system even if congress knew that,in some years,fee revenue might exceed pto operating costs.indeed,because the costs of pto operations in issuing and maintaining patents are incurred over a number of years,congress could rationally conclude that patent fees should be set in amounts designed to provide sufficient revenue to carry over into subsequent fiscal years and offset future costs.even assuming the rescissions were permanent,the vast majority of diverted patent fee revenue remains available for later years.on at least one occasion,congress has appropriated funds from prior years to the pto,stat.
finally,even if fees exceeded the existing and predicted costs of operating the patent system,congress could also rationally decide to set fees above what is needed to meet the funding needs of the pto in order to deter the filing and prosecution of certain types of patent applications.the supreme court has recognized that congress may legitimately impose taxes or fees in order to discourage undesirable behavior.see dep t of revenue of kurth ranch,d cable television ass n,united states,d.
congress could rationally seek to discourage applications for patents that would later likely be found invalid.congress could also rationally seek to discourage patent applications for inventions where the patent is sought only for the sake of personal recognition and,congress could rationally decide to discourage patent applications from inventors who seek the patent only as a means of inhibiting innovation by competitors congress could also rationally conclude that increasing patent fees would discourage the filing of such applications because those applications lack commercial potential.
we conclude that a rational relationship exists between the fees established and the operation of the patent system,and thus that summary judgment for the government was appropriate on figueroa patent clause claim.in the light of our conclusion that the fees are constitutional under the patent clause,we need not address the government contention that,even if the patent clause imposes some substantive limitation on congress authority,it does not limit congress authority to impose patent fees because congress has plenary power to impose such fees under the general welfare and commerce clauses.
figueroa next contends that the pto assessment of patent fees amounted to an unconstitutional direct tax,and thus an unlawful exaction,insofar as those fees were used to fund programs.article i,section,clause of the constitution provides that direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union,according to their respective numbers.const.art.i,cl.the constitution also provides that n o capitation,or other direct,tax shall be laid,unless in the proportion to the census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken.id.art.i,cl.since patent fees are uniform for all patentees regardless of their state of residence,figueroa contends,they constitute an unapportioned direct tax in violation of article i,section,clause.
it is doubtful that the patent fees,paid for the privilege of securing a patent grant,should be viewed as taxes rather than payments for a privilege.see boyden,at one is privileged to seek the patent monopoly only upon compliance with the conditions which congress has imposed including the payment of fees required for the administration of the patent laws.however,we conclude that,even if patent fees constitute a tax on intellectual property,they are an excise tax rather than a direct tax and need not be apportioned.
figueroa argues that patent rights are personal property,and that the supreme court decision in pollock farmers loan trust.pollock i,established that unapportioned taxes levied on personal property may constitute unlawful direct taxes.we agree in both respects.however,in union electric united states,we examined pollock i and its successor case,pollock farmers loan trust.pollock ii,at length.we held that pollock i and pollock ii stand for the proposition that the only impermissible direct tax on personal property is a general tax on broad classes of personal property.at.
so too in union electric we held that a tax imposed upon the acquisition,ownership,or use of particular kinds of categories of property that falls short of being a general tax on the whole of an individual personal property is an excise tax which need not be apportioned.id.at.it follows that patent fees,to the extent they are a tax on patent rights,are an excise tax the fees are levied upon the acquisition and ownership of patent rights.patent rights are a particular kind of personal property.a tax on patents,therefore,is like other taxes on specific categories of personal property that the supreme court has sustained against direct tax challenges.examples include taxes on community property,fernandez wiener,gifts,bromley mccaughn,estate assets,trust eisner,mine production,stanton baltic mining,yachts,billings united states,stock sale contracts,thomas united states,proceeds from sugar refining,spreckels sugar ref.mcclain,proceeds from tobacco production,patton brady,legacies and distributive shares of personal property,knowlton moore,and carriages,hylton united states,dall.these taxes were upheld because they were carefully tailored tax es levied upon only one particular kind of personal property.union,at.the same is true here even if the fees may be fairly equated to a tax 
we conclude that figueroa direct tax claim was properly dismissed.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the decisions of the court of federal claims are affirmed.
although figueroa petition is not without merit,i conclude that he has not met the extremely heavy burden of establishing that congressional actions violate the constitution.it may be that additional data in support of his various arguments could shift the balance,but on the record before us,i agree that the judgment of the court of federal claims must be affirmed.however,i do not share the reasoning of the panel majority.i would affirm on the ground applied by the court of federal claims,ruling that congress is not acting irrationally.
the court of federal claims compared the amount of funds that were diverted from the pto,with the government very rough estimate of the additional costs that are paid out of general government funds,including the pto employee retirement expenses that are paid by opm,the costs to the department of commerce as the parent agency of the pto,the costs of judicial dealings with patent matters,of patent exclusion activities
