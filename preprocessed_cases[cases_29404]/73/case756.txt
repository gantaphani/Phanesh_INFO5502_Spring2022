the gustafsons married in and shortly thereafter opened a chiropractic clinic in lincoln,nebraska.mark gustafson,a licensed chiropractor,provided chiropractic services while salwa gustafson,a licensed nurse,acted as the clinic business manager.as of the time of trial,neither mark gustafson nor salwa gustafson had filed a personal federal income tax return since filing a joint return for the tax year.
on march,a grand jury issued a indictment naming mark gustafson and salwa gustafson as defendants in all five counts.counts i,ii,and iii charged the gustafsons with federal income tax evasion for the tax years,and,respectively.the indictment alleged that the gustafsons willfully attempted to evade income tax due by failing to file personal income tax returns,by failing to pay income tax,and by attempting to conceal their income from the internal revenue service irs by transferring ownership of assets to fraudulent trusts,encumbering assets,removing money to offshore accounts,and using multiple bank accounts.the indictment further alleged that in,after being notified that they were under investigation by the irs,the gustafsons filed abusive trust tax returns.counts iv and v charged the gustafsons with willful failure to file federal income tax returns for the tax years and,respectively.
at trial,the evidence established that the irs contacted the gustafsons on numerous occasions about their tax obligations.the irs first contacted the gustafsons in october,requesting tax returns for the years and.on june,the irs sent letters to the gustafsons indicating that the gustafsons had not filed tax returns for the years,and.on october,the irs sent additional letters to the gustafsons advising them that the irs would begin to contact third parties and issue summonses to obtain information in an attempt to establish the gustafsons income and expenses for the tax years.
the government introduced evidence showing that the gustafsons took a number of steps to hide their income from the irs.first,in march,shortly after they were first contacted by the irs regarding their tax deficiencies,the gustafsons began wiring money to an offshore bank account.between and,the gustafsons wired more than to offshore accounts.second,from to,the gustafsons changed the name of the chiropractic clinic four times.third,during that same period,salwa gustafson moved the clinic bank account to three different banks.fourth,the gustafsons began putting their money and assets into trusts.
the gustafsons defense at trial was that they had a belief that the payment of federal income tax was not compulsory.the gustafsons testified that they formed this belief after talking with other owners,attending seminars,and researching the issue in legal casebooks and treatises despite their having no legal training.the gustafsons presented documentary evidence that they claimed to have relied upon in forming their belief.
the jury convicted both mark gustafson and salwa gustafson of each of the five counts charged.the gustafsons appeal.
the gustafsons first challenge a number of the district court evidentiary rulings.we review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.spencer young,cir.even when an evidentiary ruling is improper,we will reverse a conviction on this basis only when the ruling affected substantial rights or had more than a slight influence on the verdict.united states ballew,cir,cert.denied,d.
at trial,the gustafsons sought to introduce materials upon which they purportedly relied in forming a belief that they were not required to file income tax returns these materials included a photocopy of the business trusts section of the legal treatise american jurisprudence,second edition defendants exhibit c documents defining terms set forth in titles and of the united states code and discussing supreme court decisions about persons over whom the federal government has jurisdiction defendants exhibits and letters to the gustafsons from the united states attorney for the southern district of ohio informing them that richard parris would be sentenced and that they had an opportunity to address the court on injury caused by parris crimes defendants exhibits,and and documents that mark gustafson provided the grand jury defendants exhibit.the district court excluded these documents as either not relevant or lacking in foundation.
the gustafsons contend that the excluded evidence was relevant and that the court erred by not admitting it.the gustafsons have not shown,however,how the excluded documents would have added new insight into the formation of their beliefs beyond the materials that were permitted into evidence.united states willis,cir.as in willis,the gustafsons had been permitted to explain the source of their beliefs and to introduce other exhibits on which they relied.id.the district court permitted the defense to read mark gustafson grand jury testimony into evidence.mark gustafson cited and summarized three cases that he contended supported his belief that he was not required to pay taxes.he stated that he and salwa gustafson had reviewed the law and that a provision of the code required the secretary of the treasury to inform them that taxes were owed.tr.at.he also testified that he and salwa gustafson studied the tax laws by reading books and articles on the internet.they also obtained information about tax law from a group called save a patriot.salwa gustafson testified at trial that she went with her husband to a seminar on tax laws presented by save a patriot.salwa then testified in detail about a number of conversations that she had with different people relating to how to structure the chiropractic clinic as a business trust to avoid the legal obligation to pay taxes.she testified that she and mark gustafson went to a law library to research tax law.she identified the american jurisprudence treatise on business trusts as something that they relied on in forming their belief that using business trusts to avoid paying taxes was legal.she further identified the documents offered as defendants exhibits a and b and explained that they helped form her belief that the united states did not have jurisdiction over her for purposes of taxing her.tr.at.
it was proper for the district court to exclude evidence having no relevance or probative value with respect to willfulness.cheek united states,d.to the extent that any of the excluded documents may have been relevant,they were cumulative,and the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying their admission.see.willis,at.moreover,the material interpreting statutes and legal opinions,as well as the legal opinions themselves,would have had a high potential to confuse the jury and conflict with the court responsibility to instruct on the law.willis,at.the district court gave the gustafsons the opportunity to explain how these legal materials affected their beliefs,and the court did not err in excluding the materials themselves.finally,we note that none of the district court evidentiary rulings affected the gustafsons substantial rights or could be said to have had more than a slight influence on the verdict.the evidence of the gustafsons guilt was substantial and we do not believe that the verdict would have been different had the documents been admitted.
the gustafsons next contend that the district court erred in instructing the jury by denying the gustafsons request for a particular instruction and including an instruction over their objection.we review the district court decision to give or deny an instruction for abuse of discretion,considering the court ruling in the context of the en
