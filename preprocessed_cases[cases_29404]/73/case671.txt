benjamin franklin said it in in this world,nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes.glen murphy,a chiropractor from the posh waukesha county wisconsin suburb of elm grove,did agree with the taxes part of franklin statement.inappropriately acting on that belief earned murphy an indictment for filing false income tax returns seven counts and willfully not filing any at all three counts.after being charged,he tried to game the system and drag out the proceeding as long as possible.but in the end,a jury found him guilty on all counts.the district court judge stadtmueller sentenced him to months in prison.murphy appeals,challenging his convictions on several grounds.
murphy starts with his primary argument the district court committed reversible error when it denied him counsel.he says the judge improperly forced him to choose between his fifth and sixth amendment rights when he insisted that murphy demonstrate his financial eligibility for appointed counsel and construed his refusal to do so as a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to an attorney.murphy also contends that the judge instructions to the jury inaccurately stated the law in several respects.
murphy problems began after he became a client of an accounting firm calling itself anderson ark associates aaa.aaa,from what we can tell,offered no legitimate services it instead specialized in tax fraud.murphy,himself no fan of taxes,turned to aaa in in an effort to dramatically lower his past and future income tax liability.aaa obliged,helping murphy set up a sham,partnership that took on huge,predetermined losses in sums perfectly tailored to eliminate murphy present and past tax liability.aaa also served as a conduit for murphy to direct money to offshore bank accounts under the guise of advertising expenses.as a grand finale,murphy did not even file income tax returns from,despite telling his bank that he had done so and even producing a completed form as part of a home refinancing application.in any event,he says he was a victim of aaa,which took him to the cleaners to the tune of.
the government has been prosecuting aaa,its proprietors,and its clients for several years,and many individual defendants have pled guilty to charges filed against them.but murphy apparently had his own strategy.during the months leading up to and including his trial,he employed a pattern of delay and misdirection that would make an nfl offensive coordinator jealous.
things got started on pearl harbor day in when murphy was charged with seven counts of filing false tax returns in violation of.in what was to become a familiar pattern,he made his initial court appearance without counsel but told a magistrate judge he was making efforts to find an attorney.although without counsel at this event,william burke,an experienced and savvy attorney from the federal defender service,appeared with murphy on an interim basis as sort of a friend of the court.the magistrate judge warned murphy of the dangers of proceeding without counsel and urged him to secure representation as soon as possible.murphy made no suggestion that he intended to seek counsel.
a short time later,murphy filed a notice seeking to fire burke,who had never been formally appointed to represent him in the first place.on february,murphy reappeared before the magistrate for a hearing regarding the conditions of his pretrial release.he again had no counsel.once again the magistrate judge implored him to secure representation as soon as possible once again murphy promised he was looking for a lawyer and made no mention of getting help.
on march,murphy appeared before district judge stadtmueller.he had no counsel but entered a rambling,incoherent statement into the record that began 
affidavit.denial that a corporation exists.equality under the law is paramount and mandatory by law.i,glen james clan murphy,a wisconsin national of the republic of wisconsin,a titled sovereign,am able to handle and represent me concerning all my affairs.in commerce when being forced to testify all my common law rights are reserved.
the government attorney,matthew jacobs,understandably confused as to whether murphy statement indicated his intention to waive counsel,told the court that his own conversations with murphy and some criminal defense attorneys in milwaukee indicated to him that murphy sought to retain an attorney.judge stadtmueller gave murphy yet another warning about proceeding alone and scheduled another appearance for days later,indicating to murphy that he would be expected to declare once and for all whether he wanted a lawyer.murphy said nothing about seeking appointed counsel.
meanwhile the grand jury returned a superseding indictment adding three counts of failure to file tax returns under,and murphy trial,originally scheduled for march,was delayed until september.still,the march continuation hearing went forward.murphy again appeared alone,and the judge again warned him.perhaps expecting this to happen,jacobs apparently took it upon himself to ask burke to join the proceedings and explore whether murphy might qualify for counsel.
burke told the court he was willing to meet with murphy and discuss his financial eligibility.he also suggested that the judge offer to seal any financial information that murphy would provide,which the judge agreed to do before giving murphy more days to undertake an accurate accounting of his financial position.
three days later,on march,murphy finally appeared with counsel burke.as burke explained to the judge 
the defendant spent a couple hours in our office going over his financial affairs,and appears at this getting certification from a bank,or getting a formal balance sheet,he appears to easily qualify for our services.his financial situation is,i would say,in a bit of a turmoil at the moment.now,that could turn around,and i am hopeful that it will,but at this point he is eligible by our review so far.i would advise the court that would be an ongoing review,but in the meantime we will provide representation.
the court approved burke appointment as murphy counsel and proceeded to set a trial date.
burke representation ostensibly lasted for a couple of months,though murphy continued to submit his own filings to the court.then,on july,burke filed a motion to withdraw in response to murphy belligerent conduct and demands upon burke to employ frivolous a challenge to the constitutionality of the federal tax a defense.burke reiterated that he believed murphy to be eligible for a lawyer but expressed some doubt as to whether he was willing to accept an attorney whose fees were to be paid by the government.the judge granted burke motion and directed him to see if another federal defender would be willing to accept an appointment as murphy counsel.
on july,murphy reappeared before the district court judge for a pretrial hearing.he was without counsel and moved for adjournment of both the pretrial hearing and the upcoming trial,now scheduled for september,until he could retain effective,competent assistance of counsel.he also denounced burke and the other lawyers from the federal defender service and expressed an unwillingness to cooperate with them.after promptly denying that motion,judge stadtmueller emphatically reiterated to murphy his need to obtain counsel and ordered him to do so prior to a july hearing.murphy arrogantly responded,i am here to challenge your jurisdiction.
needless to say,when july came,murphy again appeared without counsel.he asked for more time to seek representation.the judge denied the motion and expressed frustration that murphy had not made an effort to secure counsel,having declined to provide a pretrial services officer with a financial statement under oath that would confirm his eligibility.murphy responded that he had provided burke with some information.ultimately,however,he promised the judge that he would meet with pretrial services and provide the necessary financial information,which the judge ordered him to do immediately.murphy then met with pretrial services but declined to provide the information.
on september,days before trial,the judge held a hearing to consider anot
