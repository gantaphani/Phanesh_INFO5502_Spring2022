georg schaeffler schaeffler or schaeffler and associated entities schaeffler group collectively appellants appeal from magistrate judge gorenstein order denying a petition to quash an irs summons we conclude that i the privilege was not waived by appellants provision of documents to a consortium of banks consortium sharing a common legal interest in the tax treatment of a refinancing and corporate restructuring resulting from an acquisition originally financed by the consortium and ii the doctrine protects documents analyzing the tax treatment of the refinancing and restructuring prepared in anticipation of litigation with the irs.we therefore vacate and remand.
background 
the pertinent facts are not in dispute.
a the acquisition 
the schaeffler group is an automotive and industrial parts supplier incorporated in germany.schaeffler,a resident of dallas,texas,is an owner of the ultimate parent of the schaeffler group.this appeal arises from an attempt by the schaeffler group to acquire a minority interest in a german company,continental ag,through a tender offer for its stock.german law prohibits tender offers that seek less than all of a company shares.as a result,a partial offer can be accomplished only by setting an offering price estimated to result in the acquisition of the desired number of shares.this course was followed by the schaeffler group with regard to continental ag.
to finance the offer,the schaeffler group executed an euro loan agreement with a consortium of banks.on july,the offer was made with an acceptance period ending on september.because of german law,the timing of the offer was unlucky,to say the least.on september,two days before the end of the acceptance period,lehman brothers holding announced its bankruptcy,the stock market collapsed,and the economic crisis worsened.the market price of continental ag shares,already declining,fell accordingly.because german law prohibited the schaeffler group from withdrawing its tender offer,far more shareholders than expected or desired accepted the offer,leaving the schaeffler group the owner of nearly of outstanding continental ag shares.
these circumstances combined to threaten the schaeffler group solvency and ability to meet its payment obligations to the consortium.as a result,appellants and the consortium perceived an urgent need to refinance the acquisition debt and to restructure the schaeffler group.under united states law,because schaeffler is an owner of the ultimate parent of the schaeffler group,the tax consequences of his companies debt refinancing and restructuring substantially affected his personal tax liability to the irs.given the complex and novel refinancing and restructuring that ensued,appellants anticipated scrutiny by the irs.therefore,they retained ernst young ey and dentons llp dentons to advise on the federal tax implications of the transactions and possible future litigation with the irs.
as anticipated,the irs began an audit of appellants that led to the issuance of the summons at issue in this appeal.the summons sought all documents created by ernst young,including but not limited to legal opinions,analysis and appraisals,that were provided to parties outside appellants,that relate to the restructuring.the summons did not request documents prepared by dentons,appellants law firm,or those shared only among their counsel and ey.appellants produced several thousand documents in response to the information document request from the irs but sought to quash the demand for legal opinions.for example,appellants sought to withhold memoranda,such as an ey memorandum ey tax memo that identified potential tax consequences of the refinancing and restructuring,identified and analyzed possible irs challenges to the schaeffler group tax treatment of the transactions,and discussed in detail the relevant statutory provisions,treasury regulations,judicial decisions,and irs rulings.
b the district court ruling 
in denying the petition to quash,the district court held that appellants had waived their privilege by sharing the withheld documents with the consortium.the court noted that b y all accounts,the schaeffler group,ernst young,and dentons worked closely with the bank consortium not only in effectuating the refinancing and restructuring but also in analyzing the tax consequences of the continental ag acquisition.sp.app x at.the court held that the common legal interest or joint defense privilege exception to the waiver by disclosure rule did not apply in the court view,the consortium lack ed any common legal stake in schaeffler putative litigation with the irs,because it would not be named as a in the anticipated litigation and only the consortium economic interests,as opposed to its legal interests,were in jeopardy.sp.app x at.therefore,appellants and the consortium did not have a common legal interest and were not formulating a common legal strategy.accordingly,appellants privilege had been waived.sp.app x at internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court also rejected appellants claim that the documents in question were protected under the doctrine.it first ruled that protection had not been waived by the sharing of information with the consortium because the disclosure was in furtherance of schaeffler and the bank consortium common commercial desire to avoid schaeffler default and insolvency.sp.app x at.it reasoned that the common interests of appellants and the consortium were sufficiently strong as to not materially increase the likelihood of disclosure of protected information to an adversary.sp.app x at internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original.
however,the district court held that the ey tax memo and,presumably,other similar documents were not entitled to protection.after conducting an in camera review of the ey tax memo,the district court described it as containing i detailed legal analysis of the federal tax issues implicated,ii assert ions that there is no law clearly on point,iii language such as although not free from doubt,the better view is that,it may be argued,and it is not inconceivable that the irs could assert and iv arguments and that could be made by schaeffler and the irs with regard to the appropriate tax treatment of the refinancing and restructuring.sp.app x at.
the district court noted that the ey tax memo does not specifically refer to litigation by discussing what actions peculiar to the litigation process the parties might take or what settlement strategies might be considered.id.the court concluded that appellants would have engaged in the detailed and complex process of resolving the unusual tax issues even if they did not anticipate any litigation.sp.app x at.it reasoned that schaeffler is a rational businessperson who would have sought out the type of tax advice provided by ernst young about the transaction had he not been concerned about an audit or litigation with the irs.sp.app x at.because any sophisticated businessperson engaging in a complex financial transaction will naturally wish to obtain advice on the relevant tax laws so that the transaction can be structured in such a way as to receive the most favorable tax treatment possible,the court ruled that,given our assumption that schaeffler is a rational businessperson who routinely makes efforts to comply with the law,we find that,even had he not anticipated an audit or litigation with the irs,he still would have had to obtain the type of legal assistance provided by ernst young to carry out the refinancing and restructuring transactions in an appropriate manner.sp.app x at.
the court further stated that petitioners have presented no facts suggesting that ernst young would have acted any differently or given advice different in content or form had it known that no audit or litigation would ensue.sp.app x at.in support,the district court relied upon a treasury department circular and a treasury regulation regarding tax shelters that forbid tax practitioners from taking into account the possibility that a tax return will remain unaudited in providing tax advice to clients.sp.app x at.the court read this regulation to require ey to provide schaeffler with exactly the information contained in the ey tax memo,in exactly the same form,regardless of the likelihood of an irs audit.the court also relied on its view that the language of the ey tax memo did not indicate that the authors are describing any particular anticipated litigation,notwithstanding the document detailed discussion of legal strategies.sp.app x at.accordingly,the court ruled that the ey tax memo and related documents were not protected from disclosure under the doctrine.
discussion 
a waiver of the attorney client privilege 
we review the district court finding of waiver of the privilege for abuse of discretion.in re grand jury proceedings,cir.an abuse of discretion occurs when a district court i bases a decision on an error of law or ii makes a factual finding that is clearly erroneous or outside the range of permissible decisions.zervos.verizon,cir.
the irs summons seeks only those documents prepared by ey that were provided to parties outside the schaeffler group.app x at.there being no evidence indicating disclosure of some or all of the documents beyond the consortium,we need determine the effect of disclosure to the consortium.as noted,the district court held that appellants waived that privilege by sharing the contested documents with the consortium because the consortium interest was commercial rather than legal.
the purpose of the privilege is to enable attorneys to give informed legal advice to clients,which would be undermined if an attorney had to caution a client about revealing relevant circumstances lest the attorney later be compelled to disclose those circumstances.the privilege,and by extension the tax practitioner privilege,see note,supra,protects communications between a client and its attorney that are intended to be,and in fact were,kept confidential.a party that shares otherwise privileged communications with an outsider is deemed to waive the privilege by disabling itself from claiming that the communications were intended to be confidential.moreover,the purpose of the communications must be solely for the obtaining or providing of legal advice.united states mejia,cir.see in re john doe,cir.communications that are made for purposes of evaluating the commercial wisdom of various options as well as in getting or giving legal advice are not protected.see in re grand jury subpoena duces tecum dated,cir.
while the privilege is generally waived by voluntary disclosure of the communication to another party,the privilege is not waived by disclosure of communications to a party that is engaged in a common legal enterprise with the holder of the privilege.under united states schwimmer,cir,such disclosures remain privileged where a joint defense effort or strategy has been decided upon and undertaken by the parties and their respective counsel in the course of an ongoing common enterprise and multiple clients share a common interest about a legal matter.id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.the need to protect the free flow of information from client to attorney logically exists whenever multiple clients share a common interest about a legal matter.id.at citing daniel capra,the attorney client privilege in common representations,trial law,summer,at.
parties may share a common legal interest even if they are not parties in ongoing litigation.id.the serves to protect the confidentiality of communications passing from one party to the attorney for another party where a joint defense effort or strategy has been decided upon and undertaken by the parties and their respective counsel.id.at.i t is therefore unnecessary that there be actual litigation in progress for the common interest rule of the privilege to apply.id.at citations omitted.however,o nly those communications made in the course of an ongoing common enterprise and intended to further the enterprise are protected.id.at.the dispositive issue is,therefore,whether the consortium common interest with appellants was of a sufficient legal character to prevent a waiver by the sharing of those communications.we hold that it was.
the original relationship between the schaeffler group and the consortium arose before the economic crisis and the resultant oversubscription to the schaeffler group tender offer that necessitated the refinancing and restructuring.however,once the tender offer was made,the relationship was altered.because the tender offer could not be withdrawn under german law,the consortium and the schaeffler group were,respectively,locked into the loan and to the offering price.as a result of the oversubscription,the schaeffler group faced a threat of insolvency that would in turn cause a default on the consortium euros loan.the group and the consortium could avoid this mutual financial disaster by cooperating in securing a particular tax treatment of a refinancing and restructuring.securing that treatment would likely involve a legal encounter with the irs.both appellants and the consortium,therefore,had a strong common interest in the outcome of that legal encounter.
on this record,the nature and viability of the refinancing and restructuring had a commercial component and tax law component.of course,the final transaction had to fit the need of the schaeffler group to conduct its business efficiently.otherwise,the nature and viability of the transaction was driven by tax law,and both appellants and the consortium had a common interest in seeing that law applied in a particular way.the documents in question were all directed to the tax issues,a legal problem albeit with commercial consequences,namely the possible insolvency of the schaeffler group and its default on the consortium loan.appellants interest was in securing a refinancing.the consortium interest was in funding a refinancing that would protect its earlier investment and would itself be repaid,goals dependent on the resolution of legal tax issues.the fact that euros of sunken investment and any additional sums advanced in the refinancing were at stake does not render those legal issues commercial,and sharing communications relating to those legal issues is not a waiver of the privilege.
for example,when the possibility of default loomed,the consortium counsel became familiar with the schaeffler group organizational structure and advised it during negotiations to restructure the group and refinance its acquisition.the consortium needed access to confidential tax information and analyses to assess its credit exposure for potential tax liabilities of schaeffler.app x at.together,appellants and the consortium agreed that appellants should request an irs private letter ruling.with regard to issues not resolved by the letter ruling,they agreed to share certain core tax advice prepared by the tax advisors.app x at.this information was exchanged pursuant to the confidentiality agreement.
that this agreement,see note,supra,involved the pursuit of a common legal strategy was reflected in the undertaking of mutual obligations involving appellants and the consortium.the consortium agreed,subject to limitations not pertinent here,to permit schaeffler to pay up to million euros in personal tax liabilities before repaying the schaeffler group debt.it further agreed to extend him an additional line of credit to pay tax liabilities up to million euros.in return,schaeffler right to act unilaterally was restricted.he was required to give notice to the consortium of any material audit or investigation.the consortium also retained a right of refusal limiting schaeffler freedom of action with regard to the irs,paying taxes,suing for a refund,or settling.the communications regarding tax opinions were,therefore,made in the course of an ongoing common enterprise and intended to further the enterprise.schwimmer,at.
the government reliance on language in a number of cases from other circuits is misplaced.it is true that cases involving criminal prosecutions usually describe the definition of a common defense strategy according to the contours of a particular charging instrument.in the context of civil proceedings,however,these cases emphasized the need of the parties to identify a common legal inte
