this is a waiver and issue preclusion case.the issues before us are whether the government was required to accept ford motor company ford waiver of a statute of limitations defense in order for the waiver to take effect and whether the government is barred by issue preclusion from pursuing its claims for civil penalties pursuant to for ford alleged fraud.because we find that the government claims are not barred by the statute of limitations in or by our decision in ford iv,we vacate the court of international trade decision to dismiss counts i,ii,and iii of the government complaint.however,because the government was not deprived of any lawful duties by ford allegedly unlawful conduct as required by d,we affirm the court of international trade dismissal of count iv of the government complaint.
background 
this appeal derives from a dispute involving import duties at ford foreign trade subzone ftsz in louisville,kentucky.the relevant facts are set forth in one of our previous opinions in this case,ford motor united states,ford iv.ford louisville ftsz operated for three months,between november of and february of.during those three months,ford received eleven entries of engines and transmissions from abroad.the engines and transmissions could be used interchangeably for cars and trucks.the merchandise was incorporated into finished cars and trucks at ford assembly plant located within the louisville ftsz,and the finished cars and trucks were subsequently withdrawn for entry into the united states.
in and,the duty rate for engines and transmissions was ad valorem,the duty rate on finished imported cars was ad valorem,and the duty rate on finished imported trucks was ad valorem.by establishing its louisville ftsz,ford intended to take advantage of the duty differential between the unassembled car and truck parts and the assembled cars and trucks.under the duty rates in place when ford entered its merchandise,the optimal strategy for ford was to import engines and transmissions into its louisville ftsz and then separate the merchandise used for cars from the merchandise used for trucks.in order for ford to receive the benefit of the duty rates applicable to its ftsz,the regulations required ford to file customs form designating each part entering the louisville ftsz as either a car part or a truck part.after making the designations,ford could then pay duties on truck parts as they entered the ftsz at the duty rate of ad valorem,thereby avoiding the duty rate for assembled trucks.ford could also defer paying duties on car parts until the assembled car emerged from the plant,at which time ford could pay the duty rate for the assembled car of ad valorem,applying that rate to the car parts 
however,when ford filled out customs form,it incorrectly designated that each transmission and engine imported into the louisville ftsz was a part for an assembled car product.consequently,for all eleven entries,ford paid an estimated duty rate on the basis of the ad valorem rate for car parts.thus,to the extent that it meant to treat any of its entries as unassembled truck parts in order to receive the benefit of the duty rate as opposed to the duty rate,ford failed to pay duties for any truck parts,as required by the regulations.see.
ford reported its error to customs.in july of,customs concluded that the proper duty rate on the truck parts received at ford ftsz was the ad valorem duty rate applicable to assembled trucks.as a result,customs found that ford owed approximately million in additional duties.customs also referred ford error to its fraud investigation office.
in august of,pursuant to,customs initiated a civil fraud investigation,which continued until at least march of.on the basis of its ongoing fraud investigation,customs issued three extensions of the statutory liquidation deadline as permitted under b.pursuant to a,an entry of merchandise that customs does not liquidate within one year of the date of entry is deemed liquidated by operation of law at the rate of duty asserted by the importer at the time of entry unless customs properly extends the limitations period as provided by b.almost four years after ford eleventh entry,on december,customs liquidated the merchandise designated by ford as truck parts in its eleven entries at the duty rate of ad valorem,applicable to assembled trucks.
ford timely protested the liquidations,contending that because customs three liquidation extensions were not reasonable as required by b,the eleven entries of engines and transmissions were deemed liquidated by operation of law at the duty rate asserted on importation,ad valorem.customs denied ford protest,and ford timely paid the million in additional duties and initiated an action in the court of international trade,challenging the liquidations.see ford iv,at.
in ford iv,we reversed the court of international trade holding in favor of the government,which held that the government manner of conducting the fraud investigation and the length of the investigation were both reasonable.we reversed the court of international trade,holding that the liquidations were not properly extended under b because customs delay in pursuing the fraud investigation and its resulting delay in liquidating the entries were not reasonable.id.at.we found that customs fraud investigation had taken a total of months from august of until march of.we concluded that the long investigation was unreasonable in this case because the government did almost no substantive work during the first months of the months and because there were two periods of inactivity totaling months.id.at.moreover,we found that it was during the period of almost no activity that customs had issued all three extensions of liquidation under b.id.for these reasons,we held that customs delay was unreasonable and that customs had not properly extended the liquidation of ford eleven entries.id.as a result,we held that ford eleven entries were deemed liquidated under a and that customs was therefore required to return the million of additional duties to ford.id.at.
during the lengthy liquidation proceedings,ford drafted ten consecutive letters waiving the statute of limitations period in,which applies to government actions under.the first nine waiver letters were dated between november,and february.each waiver letter contained a signature line for customs to acknowledge receipt and acceptance of the waiver pursuant to treasury decision.customs signed the first nine waivers.in the tenth waiver letter,however,customs crossed out the words and acceptance and sent ford a letter explaining its new procedure to only acknowledge receipt of waivers.ford tenth waiver letter extended the statute of limitations for months until april.
on april,the government filed a action against ford in the court of international trade.counts i through iii of the government complaint sought civil penalties based on fraud,gross negligence,and negligence pursuant to c.count iv sought the restoration of lawful duties of which the united states has been deprived,in the amount of pursuant to d.ford filed a rule b motion to dismiss the government complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted based on the government failure to accept ford tenth waiver thereby letting the statute of limitations expire and issue preclusion in light of our decision in ford iv.
the court of international trade granted ford motion to dismiss,agreeing with ford on both grounds.united states ford motor,d.int l trade.the court of international trade held that the statute of limitations in had expired,and therefore,the government claims were extinguished as a matter of law.id.at.the court of international trade also held that notwithstanding the expiration of the statute of limitations,the government was still not entitled to a repayment of the million in duties under d because the government request matched the dollar amount that this court in ford iv ordered to be refunded to ford and because this court in ford iv had found that customs was not entitled to any additional duties beyond the duties assessed by the deemed liquidation statute,a.id.
