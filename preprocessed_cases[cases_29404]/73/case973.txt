these consolidated appeals concern the outstanding tax liabilities for sixteen taxpayers as we shall refer to the individual partners who invested in cattle partnerships operated by walter hoyt iii.their appeals are taken from the decision of the tax court holding that the commissioner of internal revenue did not abuse his discretion in rejecting taxpayers.in collection due process hearings taxpayers also challenged the imposition of interest under former c the tax court held that it lacked jurisdiction in proceedings to determine whether the partnerships transactions were tax motivated for purposes of c the effect was to leave standing the commissioner inclusion of c interest in his determination of outstanding liabilities.taxpayers appeal this decision as well.
we agree with the tax court disposition on the,and with its view that,under river city ranches commissioner,cir,whether transactions were tax motivated is a partnership item to be determined at proceedings.the problem in these cases is that the proceedings were completed and the judgment had become final before river city ranches announced this rule.as the tax court has jurisdiction in proceedings to determine issues relating to liability that the taxpayer has had no opportunity to contest,c b,we believe the court could decide whether the partnership transactions were tax motivated based on the record in the proceedings.we are as well situated as the tax court to undertake this review and,having done so,we conclude that the record of the proceedings shows that the partnerships transactions were in fact tax motivated.
accordingly,we affirm in part,vacate in part,and permit the commissioner to proceed with collection actions as determined by the notices of determination.
this is another in a growing line of cases arising out of the tangled tax liabilities of hoyt partnerships.see,keller comm r,cir hansen comm r,cir river city ranches,adams johnson,cir abelein united states,cir phillips comm r,cir.to make a long story short,hoyt organized,promoted,and operated more than cattle and partnerships from the through the.the cattle partnerships relevant to these appeals were touted as the lb tax shelter.taxpayers invested in one or more of them.
the commissioner sought to disallow tax benefits claimed by early partnerships,but lost in the tax court in.see bales comm r,cch.after bales,the commissioner began to conduct a professional headcount of the hoyt livestock.
upon receipt of notices of final partnership administrative adjustment fpaa,hoyt,who was the tax matters partner tmp for each of the partnerships,filed petitions with the tax court.hoyt and the commissioner settled a number of issues in a may,global settlement agreement that established a value for each cow and a formula for determining the actual number of cattle owned by each partnership the tax court determined adjustments in accordance with the agreement,and issued opinions in resolving disagreements between hoyt and the irs over allocation of the through settlement items to the individual partners.see shorthorn genetic eng g,comm r,cch sge.
meanwhile,the commissioner offered a variety of settlements to individual partners that waived penalties,including interest in some instances.when the irs sent notices of intent to levy,taxpayers requested a collection due process hearing before the office of appeals and submitted their own pursuant to c a iii.the standard offer was for taxpayers to pay all hoyt tax deficiencies for all years and regular interest accrued through april.the offers were based on grounds of public policy and equity,and eleven taxpayers also claimed doubt as to collectibility with special circumstances or economic hardship.
the commissioner settlement officers issued a notice of determination in each case rejecting the compromise offer and upholding collection.in response to the notices of determination,taxpayers petitioned the tax court to review whether the commissioner abused his discretion in sustaining the proposed collection action,and whether taxpayers are liable for the increased rate of interest on transactions under c.the tax court held that the settlement officers had not abused their discretion in rejecting taxpayers or in upholding the proposed levies.
those taxpayers who were subject to c penalties agreed to be treated as if they were in the same partnership as donald ertz,that is the durham engineering dge partnership for the relevant dge tax years,and,the commissioner sent fpaas in and,respectively,that noted the applicability of c.in the dge proceedings,the tax court applied the agreement to adjust dge reported depreciation expenses for from to and its qualified investment property from to dge depreciation expenses for were reduced from to.it also concluded that interest for transactions pursuant to c was an affected item that requires factual determinations to be made at the partner level and that it therefore lacked jurisdiction over the penalties.see dge comm r,at,dge comm r,at,in these proceedings,the tax court declined jurisdiction over the ertz taxpayers challenge to interest given that river city ranches had held that the character of a partnership transactions is a partnership item to be determined at the partnership level,and no findings had been made on the c issue at the proceeding in dge.
taxpayers timely appealed.
we review tax court decisions in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions tried without a jury.a fargo comm r,cir.therefore,review of factual findings is under the clearly erroneous standard and review of questions of law is de novo.fargo,at milenbach comm r,cir.like the tax court,our review of the decision by the commissioner whether to accept an is for an abuse of discretion.fargo,at.abuse of discretion occurs when a decision is based on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the facts.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we review factual findings underlying the imposition of a penalty under c for clear error,and the legal conclusions de novo.see keller,at wolf comm r,cir gainer comm r,cir.
congress authorized the secretary of the treasury to compromise any civil or criminal case arising under the internal revenue laws.a.the statute directs the secretary to ensure that taxpayers entering into a compromise have an adequate means to provide for basic living expenses.d.congress delegated authority to promulgate more detailed guidelines to the secretary.d.
the secretary regulations allow compromises for doubt as to liability which is not at issue here for doubt as to collectibility and to promote effective tax administration for economic hardship when collection of the normal amount would leave a taxpayer unable to afford basic living expenses,or where compelling public policy or equity reasons are shown and,due to exceptional circumstances,collection of the full amount of tax liability would undermine public confidence in the fairness of tax administration whether or not a similarly situated taxpayer may have paid his liability in full.b.the regulations constrain compromises to promote effective tax administration that is,compromises based on economic hardship and on grounds of public policy or equity to those that would not undermine compliance with the tax laws,b iii the determination whether to accept or reject an offer to compromise will be based upon consideration of all the facts and circumstances id.c.once a taxpayer establishes a ground for compromise,the determination whether to accept the offer is within the secretary discretion.id.
eleven taxpayers in these consolidated cases appeal the tax court ruling affirming denial of their based on doubt as to collectibility with special circumstances or economic hardship.
a doubt as to collectibility exists where the taxpayer assets and income are less than the full amount of the outstanding tax liability.b,c.a compromise based on economic hardship may be entered into when,even though the full liability could be collected,it would cause the taxpayer to be unable to pay his reasonable living expenses.see id,b i fargo,at noting the statute focus on basic expenses with an alleging economic hardship both types of offer trigger the same inquiry into how much of the tax liability can be paid while allowing the taxpayer to retain enough to pay for reasonable living expenses.b economic hardship means unable to pay his or her reasonable basic living expenses b,c i a determination of doubt as to collectibility will include a determination of ability to pay while permit ting taxpayers to retain sufficient funds to pay basic living expenses.
under irs guidelines,the commissioner may accept a doubt as to collectibility offer that is less than the taxpayer reasonable collection potential net equity plus future income plus other components of collectibility rcp if special circumstances are present,internal revenue manual.the factors the irs considers for a doubt as to collectibility with special circumstances offer are the same as for an economic hardship offer.
for each of the taxpayers,the commissioner rejected the offer because it was substantially lower than what the rcp calculation showed the taxpayer could afford to pay.taxpayers attack the commissioner denial of their offers on multiple grounds,but we see no basis to conclude the commissioner abused his discretion in any of these cases.
a number of taxpayers argue the commissioner should have factored into the rcp calculation higher future medical expenses andrews,barnes,carters,catlows,hubbarts,ertz,johnson,lindleys mcdonough,and smiths.we can not say the commissioner clearly erred in considering medical needs by relying on present medical expenses instead of estimating future increases.see fargo,at noting that taxpayers evidence of future medical needs was thin,ambiguous,and speculative c including as a factor in support of hardship that the taxpayer is incapable of earning a living because of a medical condition and it is reasonably foreseeable that financial resources will be exhausted providing for care and support.
some taxpayers fault the commissioner for computational mistakes,such as omitting transaction costs or not including a corresponding adjustment to housing expenses when treating the taxpayer equity in his home as fully collectible barnes,carters,catlows,claytons,ertz,hubbarts,johnson,lindleys,and mcdonough.the commissioner,however,caught and corrected those mistakes to a significant extent in the tax court.moreover,those relying on miscalculations fail to demonstrate that,allowing for the errors,their offers do not remain below their ability to pay.city of sausalito,cir noting the requirement in the administrative procedure act that due account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error by courts reviewing agency action quoting.for the same reason,to the extent ertz is correct that the commissioner treatment of his home equity and retirement account as fully collectible is inconsistent with c i example,he has not shown this error affected the commissioner determination that he could afford to pay more than his offer.
a few taxpayers attempt to undermine the commissioner determination based on evidence that was not part of the record before him andrews,carters,hubbarts,and johnson.however,our review is confined to the record at the time the commissioner decision was rendered.see robinette comm r,cir observing that appellate review is based on the administrative record already in existence,not some new record made initially in the reviewing court quoting camp pitts,d northcoast envtl.ctr.glickman,cir.
beyond this,taxpayers question whether the commissioner fully considered their special circumstances,allowed sufficient time to submit information in support of their offers,and provided an opportunity to respond before making a final determination.the commissioner is not required to perform an investigation,engage in formal proceedings,or respond to an offer with a.we believe the commissioner adequately considered each taxpayer offer given the record before him and within the framework established by the statute,regulations,and manual 
those taxpayers who sought compromise based on special circumstances or economic hardship but failed on those grounds,join the rest who claim that exceptional circumstances exist based on considerations of public policy and equity for accepting their.they point to two in particular that they were victims of hoyt fraud,and that the commissioner caused undue delays in resolving their individual tax liabilities.
a compromise to promote effective tax administration based on public policy or equity considerations will be justified only where,due to exceptional circumstances,collection of the full liability would undermine public confidence that the tax laws are being administered in a fair and equitable manner.id.b ii.no compromise to promote effective tax administration may be entered into if compromise of the liability would undermine compliance by taxpayers with the tax laws.id.b iii.
taxpayers argue that they were victimized by the hoyt operation,but no authority requires the commissioner to accept an simply because the taxpayer was a victim of fraud or misdeeds.the commissioner could certainly consider actions along with taxpayers own conduct and motivation for investing in the hoyt partnerships.however,we have never held that being victimized by a tax shelter scheme is alone sufficient to require compromise.indeed,we have upheld negligence penalties applied by the commissioner to hoyt partners,see hansen,at,and it would be anomalous to require a reduction in liability based on public policy or equity grounds in these cases.given all the facts and circumstances of taxpayers involvement in the hoyt partnerships,we can not say that the commissioner abused his discretion in rejecting their offers.it was reasonable for him to decide that collection of less than the full liability would undermine public confidence in administration of the tax laws,whereas accepting the offers could undermine compliance by taxpayers.see b ii,iii.
while it did take nearly twenty years to shut down hoyt operations and determine individual tax liabilities,the delay is not all that surprising given the complexity of these partnerships.the lengthy time required for the the unravel how the hoyt partnerships really worked is part of the risk assumed by those who chose to invest in them.taxpayers fault the irs,rather than the nature of the tefra proceedings,for the delay,maintaining that the irs failed to seek injunctive relief against hoyt when it knew enough to do so no later than waited until before seeking to revoke hoyt status as an enrolled agent when it could have done so earlier and dealt with hoyt as tmp instead of a settlement committee prior to the agreement that,among other things,waived the statute of limitations.but focusing on a few steps that the irs in hindsight might have taken sooner oversimplifies the saga that got with the commissioner early loss in bales.
taxpayers also submit that resolution of their tax liability took longer than the average amount of time it takes to conclude a tax shelter case.they suggest that delay should somehow be measured by the average time,which,they say,is in the range of ten years.however,there is no footing in the statutes or regulations for an arbitrary,or for requiring the commissioner to abate penalties and interest once an average amount of time for average shelters has passed.indeed,taxpayers cases are not that different from fargo,where the individual partners invested in partnerships more than twenty years prior to resolution of their tax liability in our court we rejected taxpayers similar argument there,that delays outside their control should not be held against them.fargo,at.although the irs may resolve longstanding cases by foregoing penalties and interest that have accumulated as a result of delay in determining the taxpayer liability no authority says that it must.congress advisedly left settlement decisions to the commissioner discretion.we conclude that the commissioner had discretion to find that full payment of the outstanding tax liabilities in these cases would encourage future investors to take care before investing in similar tax shelters,whereas less than full payment would discourage potential investors from researching and monitoring similar investments.
taxpayers further take issue with the commissioner reliance on the internal revenue manual,which gives an example of when an may be rejected that is quite close factually to their case but which,they contend,was legal error because the manual lacks the force of law under fargo in fargo,taxpayers relied on the manual in support of their position,and we held that the internal revenue manual does not have the force of law and does not confer rights on taxpayers.at.by this we did not mean to suggest that it is legal error for the commissioner to be guided by his own guidelines.nor are we persuaded by taxpayers argument that referencing the manual most analogous example deprived them of full consideration of the facts and circumstances surrounding their investment.as settlement officers are required by the regulations to do,c,the officers here did look at the facts and circumstances of each case but nevertheless found their decision in taxpayers cases was guided by the manual example.they did not err in doing so.
finally,taxpayers contend that the commissioner erred by failing to follow the factors that informed the court decision in fargo affirming the commissioner denial of an.the factors we identified there as cutting against taxpayers were 
taxpayers invested in tax shelters,and purely taxmotivated transactions are frowned upon by the code no evidence was presented to suggest that taxpayers were the subject of fraud or deception the delay that took place was due to tefra procedures and the inability of the tmps to negotiate quickly and the primary incentives created by requiring full payment are to encourage taxpayers to research future investments more carefully and to keep in better contact with financial agents such as tmps.
fargo,at footnotes omitted.these factors were neither intended as a mantra to be applied to each based on grounds of public policy or equity,nor as a minimum requirement for the proper exercise of the commissioner discretion.rather,we mentioned these facts as indicating why,at the very least,the commissioner did not abuse his discretion in not accepting the in that case.id.accordingly,the commissioner had no legal obligation explicitly to consider each of these factors before rejecting taxpayers.even so,as in fargo,there are a number of factors here that also cut against,not in favor of,taxpayers.taxpayers invested in a lb tax shelter which is frowned upon.while individual partners may have thought or hoped they were investing in a business that would make money,the program was marketed for its tax benefits.even considering hoyt fraud,investors in hoyt partnerships have been unable to avoid negligence penalties the time it took to resolve these cases was,as in fargo,explicable.also,the primary incentives created by requiring full payment are to encourage taxpayers to research future investments more carefully and to keep in better contact with financial agents such as tmps.fargo,at.finally,reducing the risks of participating in tax shelters would encourage more taxpayers to run those risks.
in sum,we conclude that the commissioner was not obliged by compelling considerations of public policy or equity to accept taxpayers.
we now turn to whether the commissioner may apply the interest penalty of c to the tax liability of the twelve ertz taxpayers.
tefra established a statutory scheme for separately determining the partnership tax liability and then the resulting liability of individual partners.under tefra,a partnership files an informational return describing the share of income and expenses attributable to its partners the individual partners then report their pro rata share of the partnership tax liability on their individual tax returns,see kaplan united states,cir.to assure uniformity,tefra intends that adjustments to a partnership tax return be completed in one consistent proceeding before individual partners are assessed for partnership items.ad global fund,llc ex rel.north hills holding,united states.thus,a partnership tax items,which determine the partners taxes,are litigated in partnership in the individual partners cases.river city ranches,at.tefra gives a court with jurisdiction over the proceedings jurisdiction to determine all partnership items of the partnership.f.
section c interest is an affected item,that is,a item that is affected by partnership items.a.the nature of a partnership transactions for purposes of c is a partnership item.river city ranches,at see a.once the agreement was reached,the tax court determined allocation issues at the partnership level.the difficulty here is that consistent with its own precedent the court held that c interest was an affected item requiring factual determinations at the partner level,therefore it was not within the court jurisdiction in the proceedings.this decision was not appealed,but ertz taxpayers did challenge c interest in the collection due process,or,proceedings.meanwhile,the tax court similar ruling at the proceedings in river city ranches was appealed.we reversed and remanded,holding that the tax the level of partnership jurisdiction to rule on the character of the partnerships transactions for purposes of c interest.river city ranches,at.in the wake of river city ranches,the parties asked the tax court in these cases to use the findings,or lack thereof,in the dge proceedings to determine whether their partnership transactions were tax motivated.the court declined to do so,believing that its prior decisions could not fairly be interpreted as making those findings or determinations.given this,and deferring to our decision in river city ranches that the character of a partnership transactions is a partnership item to be determined at the partnership level,the tax court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to determine dge partnership items,including whether its transactions were tax motivated.accordingly,it did not decide whether ertz taxpayers had substantial underpayments of tax resulting from transactions.the net result is that ertz taxpayers owe c interest without a court having specifically ruled on any aspect of that interest.
we must decide whether,in these circumstances,the tax court had jurisdiction in the proceedings to determine from findings that were made and from the record adduced in the proceedings,whether the partnership transactions were tax motivated or not.we conclude that the tax court in these proceedings had jurisdiction to review the decision and evidence in the proceedings for this limited purpose.
the tax court clearly has jurisdiction in a collection due process proceeding to consider issues relating to a taxpayer liability which the taxpayer has had no opportunity to dispute.see c b.this is true here of issues relating to ertz taxpayers liability for c interest.unless the tax court has jurisdiction to review the record,taxpayers will have no forum for disputing the imposition of penalties.while river city ranches recognized that jurisdiction lies in the proceeding to decide whether partnership transactions are tax motivated,we did not purport to revoke the tax court residual jurisdiction in a proceeding to entertain issues over which the taxpayer otherwise would have no review.as the commissioner included c interest in his notices of determination,we hold that the tax court had jurisdiction to consider ertz taxpayers challenge to the amount of their liability,including liability for additional interest penalties,that the commissioner determined.in exercising this jurisdiction the tax court should not be making an independent judgment at the partner level about whether partnership transactions were tax motivated,but rather should be reviewing the proceedings to determine whether the findings and the record there show the character of the partnerships transactions.
we agree with the tax court that no explicit findings were made on issues relevant to c interest in dge.however,we disagree that the court needed to stop at this point.rather,it could consider what was implicitly found as well.botany worsted mi
