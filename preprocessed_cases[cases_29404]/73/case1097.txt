william barstow,trustee of the bankruptcy estate of markair,markair,seeks to subordinate the proceeds of a judicial lien securing taxes owed to the united states internal revenue service irs.the trustee relies on b of the bankruptcy code,b,which subordinates tax liens to the claims of certain priority unsecured creditors.the bankruptcy court denied the trustee request to subordinate,and the district court affirmed.the trustee appeals and we,too,affirm.we hold that the term tax lien in b means a statutory tax lien and that the term does not embrace a judicial lien securing an underlying tax obligation.
factual and procedural history 
in june of,markair filed for bankruptcy under chapter.when the company filed its petition,it had an outstanding liability for air transportation excise taxes.however,the irs had not yet filed a notice of federal tax lien with respect to this liability and,accordingly,had no statutory tax lien.
thereafter,markair concluded that it had overpaid certain taxes and requested a refund.the irs asserted a right to offset the amount of the overpayment against the outstanding tax liabilities of markair and its parent corporation.
markair moved for an order in the bankruptcy court allowing it to use the overpayment to secure its obligations to the airline reporting corporation arc,a ticket clearinghouse used by travel agents.arc had threatened to stop clearing markair essentially would have shut down the airline markair posted a letter of credit in the amount of million.
to avoid an immediate shutdown of markair operations,the irs and markair compromised their positions and entered into an agreement with arc.the irs agreed to forego its offset claim and to allow a portion of the overpayment,million,to be deposited with the bankruptcy court as the arc collateral.markair agreed that the balance of the overpayment,approximately million,would be paid immediately to the irs.further,it agreed that any amount of the collateral remaining upon termination of the agreement with arc would be paid to the irs.
under the agreement,arc was given a first judicial lien position against the collateral,and the irs was given a second place judicial lien position.the bankruptcy court approved the compromise between the irs and markair and ordered that the protections afforded to the irs under the court order shall remain in full force and effect in the event that markair case is converted to another chapter under the code or reconverted to chapter or any subsequent case is filed by or against markair under the code.
markair failed to meet its obligations under the confirmed bankruptcy plan and,in april,filed a second chapter petition.markair soon ceased operations and,in november,the case was converted to one under chapter.arc then released its claim against the collateral,and the irs moved for distribution of the collateral pursuant to the parties agreement.the trustee opposed the request.pursuant to b,he sought to subordinate the irs lien so that he could pay administrative expenses and the claims of other priority creditors.
the bankruptcy court concluded that subordination under b was intended to apply to statutory tax liens,but not to the contractual type of lien involved in this case.the court first held that the text of the statute was sufficiently ambiguous to permit the court to explore legislative history for guidance as to congress intent.based on its analysis of the statute legislative history and text,the court then held that the subordination of tax liens in b applies only to statutory liens.accordingly,the irs was entitled to recover the full amount of its collateral,namely,the million deposit and accrued interest.
the trustee appealed,arguing that because the irs judicial lien secures an allowed claim for tax,it is a lien within the meaning of b and is subject to tax lien subordination.the district court rejected the trustee argument and affirmed for the reasons stated in the bankruptcy court decision.the trustee filed a timely notice of appeal.

discussion 
the parties dispute centers around b of the bankruptcy code,a provision that partially subordinates tax liens to the claims of a number of other parties,including some priority unsecured claimants.that subsection provides 
property in which the estate has an interest and that is subject to a lien that is not avoidable under this title and that secures an allowed claim for a tax,or proceeds of such property,shall be distributed 
first,to any holder of an allowed claim secured by a lien on such property that is not avoidable under this title and that is senior to such tax lien 
second,to any holder of a claim of a kind specified in section a,a,a,a,a,a,or a of this title,to the extent of the amount of such allowed tax claim that is secured by such tax lien 
third,to the holder of such tax lien,to any extent that such holder allowed tax claim that is secured by such tax lien exceeds any amount distributed under paragraph of this subsection 
fourth,to any holder of an allowed claim secured by a lien on such property that is not avoidable under this title and that is junior to such tax lien 
fifth,to the holder of such tax lien,to the extent that such holder allowed claim secured by such tax lien is not paid under paragraph of this subsection and 
sixth,to the estate.
b emphasis added.
the parties agree that the irs lien on the arc collateral is a judicial lien,which is defined in the bankruptcy code as a lien obtained by judgment,levy,sequestration,or other legal or equitable process or proceeding.we also agree with this characterization because the irs lien arose as a result of a legal proceeding.
however,the trustee and the irs advance markedly different views as to the significance of this characterization.the irs argues that b applies only to statutory tax liens and,therefore,that the statute does not require subordination of the irs claim.id.by contrast,the trustee argues that the statute applies to any kind of lien that secures an allowed claim for tax.accordingly,he claims that the irs lien is subordinated to unsecured priority claimants pursuant to b.
the trustee and the irs assert that their respective interpretations of b are mandated by the plain meaning of the statute text.see fdic county of orange in re county of orange,cir in construing a statute,we first consider its text.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.neither party is correct.although the text of the statute provides some support for the trustee interpretation,congress frequent use of the term tax lien in b interjects ambiguity.
widely acknowledged meaning of tax lien 
the term tax lien appears seven times in b.the statute does not define it.when a term is undefined,we usually apply its common meaning.see romine diversified collection,cir in the absence of statutory definition,a statutory term will be accorded its ordinary meaning.further,w ords with a fixed legal or judicially settled meaning,where the context so requires,must be presumed to have been used in that sense.huffman commissioner,cir.the irs argues that the phrase tax lien is a term of art with a widely accepted meaning in tax and bankruptcy statutory tax that congress must be deemed to be familiar with the established meaning.
the term tax lien does,in general,refer to statutory tax liens.the weight of the relevant case law so holds.see,in re khoe,a federal tax lien is neither a judicial lien nor a,nonpurchase money security interest.filipovits irs in re filipovits,wl,at,a tax lien is a statutory lien and it is not a judicial lien.robinson united states in re carolina resort motels,t he legislative history clearly indicates that tax liens are statutory liens.
similarly,a number of prominent secondary authorities note that the typical statutory lien is the tax lien.see,collier on bankruptcy,at ala
