discussion 
the focus of olen appeal is the assessor valuation of its property,which will be the subject of a lengthy discussion.other issues not directly related to the assessor valuation are individually addressed below.
olen raises a number of challenges to the county valuation of its property.in such cases,the standard of review depends upon which of two issues is raised by the appellant.where a taxpayer challenges the validity of the valuation method used by an assessor,the trial court must determine as a matter of law whether the challenged method of valuation is arbitrary,in excess of discretion,or in violation of the standards prescribed by law.citation.our review of such a question is de novo.citation.by contrast,where the taxpayer challenges the application of a valid valuation method,the trial court must review the record presented to the board to determine whether the board findings are supported by substantial evidence but may not independently weigh the evidence.citations.this court,too,reviews a challenge to application of a valuation method under the substantial evidence rule.citation.resource partners county of lake th,d.
the majority of olen contentions challenge the comparable sales approach.olen first contends the comparable sales approach should not have been used because the cost approach to valuation is the only approach available to value improvements.we disagree.
in general,tax assessors use three basic appraisal methods to determine the full value of property the market data or comparable sales method the income or capitalization method and the cost method.bret harte inn,city and county of san francisco cal d,witkin,summary of cal.law,ed.taxation.under the market data method the assessor examines and correlates the prices resulting in other transactions involving comparable properties citation the validity of this method rests upon the assumption that comparable properties have comparable full cash values.bret harte inn,city and county of san francisco,supra,cal d at.under the income method the assessor capitalizes the sum of future income attributable to the property,less an allowance for the risk of partial or no receipt of income citation.the income method rests upon the assumption that in an open market a willing buyer of the property would pay a willing seller an amount approximately equal to the present value of the future income to be derived from the property.ibid.the cost method uses the cost of property as a basis for valuation.citations.witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,taxation.
california code of regulations,title,section requires the assessor to consider one or more of the methods to arrive at the full value of the property.here,the assessor arrived at its valuation using all three methods of valuation.olen is not challenging the validity of the methods of valuation used by the assessor.rather,it challenges the application of the comparable sales approach to its case.therefore,the proper standard of review is sufficiency of the evidence.after a review of the record,we conclude the trial court judgment withstands review under this standard.
section of title of the california code of regulations provides when reliable market data are available with respect to a given real property,the preferred method of valuation is by reference to sales prices.in using sales prices of the appraisal subject or of comparable properties to value a property,the assessor shall a convert a noncash sale price to its cash equivalent by estimating the value in cash of any tangible or intangible property other than cash which the seller accepted in full or partial payment for the subject property and adding it to the cash portion of the sale price and by deducting from the nominal sale price any amount which the seller paid in lieu of interest to a lender who supplied the grantee with part or all of the purchase money.b when appraising an interest,convert the sale price of a property encumbered with a debt to which the property remained subject to its price equivalent by adding to the sale price of the seller equity the price for which it is estimated that such debt could have been sold under conditions at the time the sale price was negotiated and convert the sale price of a property encumbered with a lease to which the property remained subject to its price equivalent by deducting from the sale price of the seller equity the amount by which it is estimated that the lease enhanced that price or adding to the price of the seller equity the amount by which it is estimated that the lease depressed that price.c convert a sale to the valuation date of the subject property by adjusting it for any change in price level of this type of property that has occurred between the time the sale price was negotiated an the valuation date of the subject property.d make such allowances as he or she deems appropriate for differences between a comparable property at the time of sale and the subject property on the valuation date,in physical attributes of the properties,location of the properties,legally enforceable restrictions on the properties use,and the income and amenities which the properties are expected to produce.when the appraisal subject is land and the comparable property is land of smaller dimensions,and it is assumed that the subject property would be divided into comparable smaller parcels by a purchase,the assessor shall allow for the cost of subdivision,for the area required for streets and alleys,for selling expenses,for normal profit,and for interest charges during the period over which it is anticipated that the smaller properties will be marketed.
olen first contends the assessor failed to make the mandatory adjustments to the comparable sales approach.however,the assessor supplied the board with a chart listing items for which adjustments had been made and testified at length regarding each adjustment.nothing in the record supports olen contention to the contrary.
olen next argues the assessor analysis improperly compared sales of land with buildings to his project.he believes the value of the land is irrelevant because the land was purchased over years ago before the passage of proposition.however,w hen applied to real property,the words full value,full cash value,cash value,actual value and fair market value mean the price at which the unencumbered or unrestricted fee simple interest in the real property subject to any legally enforceable governmental restrictions would transfer for cash or its equivalent,tit.under these circumstances,the value of the land is relevant to comparable sales of improved land.further,the assessor provided documentary evidence and testimony subtracting the land value from the value of the building.thus,the board had ample evidence to consider the value of olen building project in isolation had it chosen to do so.
olen also argues the assessor improperly failed to convert noncash sales of the comparables used in its analysis to their cash equivalent.the assessor testified,sales under,all of these sales were either all cash sales or sales that had a down payment with a new loan.and under a cash equivalency analysis you would look to the loan to see if the loan is at or below or above market value.when they go on obtaining a new loan,i have yet to see a lender give a loan to somebody at or above market,excuse me,below or above market,a new loan by definition is at market value.so there is no cash equivalency necessary for these three sales.olen fails to explain how the assessor should have converted cash sales to their cash equivalent.
citing revenue and taxation code section,olen next claims the assessor failed to use sales near in time to the lien date.that section provides,when valuing property by comparison with sales of other properties,in order to be considered comparable,the sales shall be sufficiently near in time to the valuation date,and the properties sold shall be located sufficiently near the property being valued,and shall be sufficiently alike in respect to character,size,situation,usability,zoning or other legal restriction as to use unless rebutted pursuant to section,to make it clear that the properties sold and the properties being valued are comparable in value and that the cash equivalent price realized for the properties sold may fairly be considered as shedding light on the value of the property being valued.near in time to the valuation date does not include any sale more than days after the lien date.
the assessor used three comparable sales.the first occurred in september and involved a property in irvine.the second occurred in june and involved an anaheim property.the third sale involved property in laguna niguel and occurred in august.the lien date of the subject property is january.thus,none of the sales occurred more than days after the lien date.olen conceded this issue at the board hearing after the county representative explained the rule it,does say that and i just read it,i was not i missed the after,but clearly if it the year prior there has to be an adjustment made for that,but here it has been made.actually,the record reflects the assessor did make numerous adjustments to the comparable sales that account for variations between the properties at issue.
olen also argues the assessor failed to make adequate adjustments for differences in the physical attributes,location,income and amenities of the properties.again,the record does not support this assertion.california code of regulations,title,section provides that the assessor make such allowances as he or she deems appropriate for differences between a comparable property at the time of sale and the subject property on the valuation date in the present case,the variations in physical attributes,location,income and amenities of each sale were listed in the assessor documentation,and the documents demonstrate adjustments were made to equalize the respective values of the subject properties.by contrast,nothing in the record supports olen assertion the assessor valuation was somehow arbitrary,in excess of discretion,or in violation of the law.bret harte inn,city and county of san francisco,supra,cal d at.
olen also contends the assessor failed to apply mandatory adjustments regarding variances in the number of parking stalls between the properties and its building.the assessor used a parking ratio of in its comparative analysis.at the hearing,olen contended the city of brea mandates a parking ratio of and that the lower ratio reduced the value of its property.olen did not submit evidence to support this assertion.
in superior court,olen submitted a declaration from thomas pike,a real estate appraiser,who utilized a parking ratio of in analyzing three additional comparable sales.the superior court excluded evidence of the pike declaration on the ground it had not been submitted to the board.this declaration is now one of four documents submitted with olen motion to augment the record.
pursuant to california rules of court,rule a,at any time,on motion of a party or its own motion,the reviewing court may order the record augmented to include a any document filed or lodged in the case in superior court or b a certified agreed or settled oral proceedings not designated under rule.the pike declaration was filed with the superior court on october.nevertheless,the county opposes olen motion to augment the record with the pike declaration,arguing it was properly excluded by the trial court and is otherwise not relevant to the appeal.
olen motion to augment is not well taken with respect to the pike declaration.in reality,olen attempts to challenge on appeal the trial court evidentiary ruling,which should have been the subject of a timely objection below.instead,olen trial counsel agreed with the trial court ruling although we would like it to be considered as evidence,we recognize that we need to show extraordinary circumstances to be able to bring addition evidence at a hearing before the court that is reviewing something that was not placed before the board.counsel further agreed extraordinary circumstances were not shown in this case.therefore,the motion to augment is denied with respect to the pike declaration 
nevertheless,assuming this court considered the pike declaration,the trial court decision remains unassailable.e evidence can never be admitted merely to contradict the evidence the administrative agency relied on in making a decision or to raise a question regarding the wisdom of that decision.western states petroleum superior court cal th,d.with or without the pike declaration,the board decision is supported by substantial evidence.a mere conflict in evidence does not mandate reversal of a judgment otherwise supported by reasonable,competent evidence.
olen next states the assessor failed to make mandatory adjustments to its land value comparables.olen provides no citation to the record in support of this assertion.the entire argument relies on facts stated in the pike declaration but not provided to the board.nothing in the record supports olen argument,nor is it clear the admission of such evid
