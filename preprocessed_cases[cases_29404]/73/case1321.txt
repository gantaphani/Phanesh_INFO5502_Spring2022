through an elaborate scheme involving partnerships with a foreign bank operating in a jurisdiction,a diversified company generated over million worth of tax losses while incurring an actual loss of only million.the tax court found that because certain of the partnerships transactions lacked economic substance,they created no gains or losses for federal tax purposes.at the same time,the tax court declined to address the government alternative contention that both partnerships were shams for federal tax purposes.the partnerships,together with the company,now appeal,and the government.we vacate and remand to the tax court for reconsideration in light of our recent decision in asa investerings partnership commissioner,where we invalidated what appears to be a even shelter on the grounds that the entire partnership,not merely the specific transactions at issue,was a sham for federal tax purposes.
this case involves the legality of a tax shelter marketed by merrill lynch to a small number of corporations.designed for corporations anticipating large capital gains,the shelter takes advantage of certain internal revenue code provisions and related treasury department regulations that govern installment sales where the taxpayer lacks advance knowledge of the installment payments value.see temp.reg.c i.to build such a shelter,the merrill lynch client forms a partnership with a foreign corporation operating in a jurisdiction.this partnership then buys and immediately sells a debt instrument on an installment basis.although the transaction is basically a wash,generating hardly any economic gain or loss,merrill lynch lawyers interpretation of the relevant provisions allows the partnership to claim a massive tax gain,which is allocated to the foreign partner,and a massive tax loss,which the corporation keeps for itself.a detailed description of this shelter and the code provisions on which it depends appears in asa,at.in that case,we affirmed a tax court determination that another merrill lynch client that had adopted the shelter,had not entered into a bona fide partnership for federal tax purposes.id.at.
the facts of this case appear similar to those of asa.in,appellant brunswick corporation,a diversified manufacturer,decided to divest itself of certain business groups.because the sales would generate massive capital gains,merrill lynch proposed that brunswick generate compensatory paper losses by forming a partnership with a foreign bank.in an extensive memorandum,judith zelisko,an attorney and brunswick director of taxes,laid out step by step how merrill lynch proposal would generate sufficient capital losses to offset the capital gain which w ould be generated on the sale of certain divisions.saba comm r,cch.because of this document significance,we quote it in substantial part 
bc brunswick and an unrelated foreign partner fp would form a partnership no later than march,with bc contributing million in cash and the fp contributing million in cash.the partnership would have a fiscal of march since that would be the of the fp,the majority partner.
partnership buys a private placement note for million with the cash in the partnership and holds the note for one month.
before march,the partnership would sell the million private placement note for million in cash and contingent note with an assumed fair market value fmv of million.under this contingent note,payments would be made to the partnership over a period equal to a variable interest rate times a fixed notional principal 
the partnership would recognize gain on the sale of the private placement note calculated as follows 
bc share of the gain equals its ownership in the partnership for a taxable gain to bc of million in.
in april or later,until there has been some movement in the value of the contingent note bc buys of fp interest in the partnership for million,assuming that the fmv of the contingent note is still million.with this purchase,bc basis in its partnership interest is million calculated as follows 
the partnership distributes the contingent note to bc assuming a fmv of million.in addition,the partnership would distribute approximately million in cash to fp which is the equivalent cash distribution to fp given its percentage ownership.
bc sells the contingent note for cash.this sale of the contingent note by bc generates the capital loss.
after the sale of the note,bc tax basis in the partnership is zero and the partnership still has in cash.
in april,the partnership will be terminated.
id.at.the zelisko memorandum also notes that merrill lynch would earn a fee of of the tax savings that the fee would not be due if the tax law changed prior to implementation that l egal fees for bc and operating expenses of the partnership would be paid by bc and that the foreign partner would earn basis points on the fp equity investment.id.memorandum reminds zelisko superiors that t here can not have been any agreements,negotiations,or understandings of any kind among the partners or their representatives regarding the possible liquidation of the partnership or the assets to be distributed to each respective partner upon termination and liquidation of the partnership or the transactions described in steps and.id.
to execute the scheme,merrill lynch enlisted the same dutch bank,algemene bank netherlands,abn,that had served as the foreign partner in the shelter at issue in asa.see asa,at.merrill lynch drafted a credit proposal for abn that,like the zelisko memorandum,outlined the partnership investment steps,including the purchase of highly rated private placement notes ppns the sale of the ppns for cash and contingent notes and brunswick gradual of abn partnership interest.id.at.in a separate memorandum to abn,merrill lynch confirmed that abn will receive an upfront fee of around.id.previously,merrill lynch had assured abn that in these types of deals,it would face virtually no credit risk since the paper invested in would be of the highest credit quality and would have short term maturities,and that interest rate risk would be eliminated by a series of perfect hedges.legal and tax risk,merrill lynch assured abn,will be covered by opinions of legal and tax counsel.id.
because brunswick ultimately sold more assets than originally anticipated,it implemented the scheme outlined above on two separate occasions using two separate partnerships saba partnership and otrabanda investerings partnership.
saba partnership 
on february,brunswick contributed million,and abn contributed million to the newly formed saba partnership zelisko memorandum,step.id.at.saba fact,the very same million worth of ppns step.merrill lynch then began to negotiate the sale of the notes and,on march,transmitted a summary of terms to two potential buyers.on march,just prior to the close of saba first taxable year,saba sold the ppns,worth million,for an immediate cash payment of million and four indefinite debt instruments,known as libor london interbank offering rate notes,worth approximately million step.id.at.saba could have reduced its million loss by selling the ppns to a money market fund and then purchasing libor notes,but because such funds can not issue libor notes,saba eliminated them from consideration.id.saba could also have eliminated the loss by investing in libor notes directly instead of first purchasing,then immediately selling,ppns.id.at.
because libor varies,saba could not determine with certainty the aggregate selling price of the ppns and thus reported the sale as an installment sale.assuming it would receive payments over a period of six years year of sale plus five years of libor payments,saba calculated its annual basis at,yielding a massive tax gain of,ninety percent of which it allocated to abn,the foreign,partner.id.pleased with the result,brunswick of finance,william mcmanaman,prepared a foreign partnership tax update predicting that brunswick would ultimately realize capital losses of million from the saba deal and nearly million in its second,formed partnership,otrabanda.id.at.
in july,brunswick purchased of abn interest,giving brunswick a stake step.id.at.around the same time,it entered into a consulting a
