this estate tax claim for refund case presents an issue of first impression in this circuit it also spotlights the distinct split among the circuits on this issue.based upon our reading of ithaca trust united states,we conclude that the value of the deduction claimed by the estate as a claim against the estate under section a of the internal revenue code must be valued as of the date of the decedent death.a.events occurring after the decedent death that alter the value must be disregarded ithaca trust.at.
factual background 
reimbursement for transferee gift tax liability as a claim against the estate deduction under section a 
in consequence of life two certainties,the facts are undisputed.commissioner estate of hubert,d.they involve the complicated interplay between transferee gift taxes paid by the recipients of a gift and an estate tax deduction for their reimbursement by the estate of the decedent donor.a proper valuation of the transferee gift tax has a direct impact upon the amount of estate taxes ultimately owed by the estate.
elizabeth paramore and her husband were minority shareholders in steel,a family corporation located in alabama together they had two children,emmet and elizabeth the children donees,and seven grandchildren the grandchildren donees collectively the nine heirs.
in,the gifted all their stock to the nine heirs on the day of the gift,the nine heirs entered into a consent and supplemental stock purchase agreement,in which each of them agreed to contribute on a pro rata basis toward the payment of transferee or donee gift tax liability,if any.emmet held the shares in escrow until the agreement was signed by all.approximately nine months after the gifts were made,died.
gift tax returns were timely filed.she paid in gift taxes this amount was calculated based upon the stock values set forth in a company agreement,as amended in.the agreement created an option in other members of the family to buy stock in the family company at set prices.class a stock was valued at per share.class b voting stock was valued at per share.the did not have sufficient share ownership to change the option prices,as this required the consent of of the shareholders.
the government did not begin an audit of either or gift tax returns until july,nine months prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing gift tax liability against them personally.during the audit,the agent requested much information.much was supplied,well in advance of the statutory deadline at no point prior to the deadline did the government assert that either or had failed to pay the appropriate amount of gift tax owing with respect to the gifts.neither did the government request an extension of time in order to assess any additional gift tax due.when the statute of limitations expired,the government was barred from collecting any additional gift tax from either estate or.
nevertheless,the audit continued.in september,the examining agent requested that an expert valuation study be performed on the value of the class a and class b stocks.two months later,the nine heirs were advised that the government intended to assert transferee gift tax liability against them based upon its pending revaluation of the family company stock.two months after that,the government valuation report issued.the government appraiser stated in his report that,in his opinion,on the date of the gifts,the value of the class a nonvoting stock was per share,and the value of the class b voting stock was per share,a increase in each class.
two days before the statute of limitations to assert transferee gift tax liability against the nine heirs was to expire,the government issued statutory notices of deficiency asserting that owed an additional in gift taxes on the gifts,for which the nine heirs were liable.similar notices were issued on gifts at this point,was still living.
the grandchildren donees made partial transferee gift tax payments totaling.they then filed for a redetermination of transferee gift tax liability in tax court,contesting the government revaluation of stock and the government right to assert transferee gift tax liability against them.in april,the tax court found the grandchildren donees liable,although it did not determine the dollar amount of liability at that time 
the children donees made partial transferee gift tax payments totaling.instead of filing in tax court,the children donees first filed claims for refund with the government that were quickly disallowed thirteen days later.thereafter,they filed claim for refund actions in alabama federal district court,with assertions similar to those made by the grandchildren donees in tax court 
died in july.her estate tax return was timely filed in april.it reflected a negative taxable estate and no estate tax due the negative taxable estate resulted from the section a deduction of taken on schedule k for claims for reimbursement of transfer gift tax liability by donees of gifts.the amount of the deduction claimed by the estate was calculated using the government per share stock values 
shortly after it was filed,estate tax return was selected for audit.the most notable challenge by the government was to the amount of the schedule k deduction.
in april,more than nine months after death and more than a year after the action had been filed,the grandchildren donees and the government settled their tax court litigation.pursuant to the terms of the settlement,the parties agreed that the class a stock was to be finally valued at per share instead of and that the class b stock was to be finally valued at per share instead of 
a joint stipulation was submitted to the tax court.both sides agreed that the grandchildren donees had a total transferee gift tax liability of,plus interest.the tax court then entered final decisions in the seven consolidated grandchildren donee cases.the district court followed suit in the pending children donee cases.thereafter,the probate court entered an order holding that the claims of the nine heirs were now valid and enforceable,and the nine heirs received in reimbursement monies from the estate.
the estate then filed an amended estate tax return reducing the section a deduction for claims against the estate on schedule k from to.this changed the amount of estate tax due dramatically.once a negative figure,taxable estate swelled to,generating in estate taxes that were paid by the estate with the amended return.the estate then filed a claim for refund action in district court on the section a issue the government asserted three counterclaims pertinent to this appeal see parts infra.
attorneys fees paid prior to death by holder of power of attorney as an asset of the estate under section a 
son emmet,acting as for his mother during her life,paid to the chamberlain,hrdlicka law firm.this payment was made with funds.count one of the government counterclaim asserts that emmet did not have the authority to use his mother assets and that these fees benefitted certain of her donees and not.as a result the government contends that estate possesses a claim against emmet to recover these unauthorized transfers,and that her gross estate should be increased by the same amount.
in support of its motion for summary judgment,the government submitted durable power of attorney to the district court.its authorization powers are very broad however the power expressly prohibits the use of property to pay other debts the estate contends that the language contained in the power itself proves that emmet possessed the authority to act on his mother behalf.
during discovery,the government asked that the estate produce copies of legal fee invoices.the estate declined on the basis of privilege.
in strictly construing the power,the district court found that,without a proper accounting,there was insufficient evidence to prove that the monies were used to pay debts and not those of her son emmet.
attorneys fees paid after death as an administrative expense deduction under section a 
count three of the government counterclaim contends that in attorneys fees paid to the chamberlain,hrdlicka law firm after death were not incurred for the benefit of the estate and therefore were not properly deductible as administrative expenses under section a.in response,the estate submitted two affidavits of a chamberlain,hrdlicka law partner explaining what the firm accomplished in protecting interest.
during discovery,the government again requested that the estate produce copies of legal fee invoices.on the basis of privilege,the estate again declined.
the district court found that the estate had failed to substantiate the deduction for attorneys fees as,without itemized fee statements,it was unable to determine the reasonableness or propriety of the amount claimed.it found the affidavits insufficient and chided the estate for not availing itself of the opportunity to produce the invoices in camera.
interest expense deduction under section a 
count four of the government counterclaim asserted that the estate should not be allowed an administrative expense deduction of for interest paid on federal estate and state death tax liabilities until there was a final determination of liability and the estate agreed that it would not claim such interest as an income tax deduction.in an amended order,the district court found the interest deduction claimed by the estate ascertainable with reasonable certainty.based upon an arbitrary date,it calculated interest to be.
on appeal,the government now appears to concede the second parameter of its counterclaim.in addition,it will agree to a limited remand to the district court at the conclusion of litigation in order to finally determine the amount of interest accrued on any unpaid estate tax liability.the estate is in agreement.
ii.procedural background 
as stated,the estate filed a claim for refund with the government for in estate taxes,on the basis that it was entitled to the deduction with respect to nine heirs claims against the estate under section a.when the government failed to respond to the estate refund claim after the statutory waiting period of six months the estate filed this action in district court.the central issue was whether or not the estate should be entitled to such a large deduction.in its amended answer,the government claimed that the deduction should be zero.in addition,it asserted its three counterclaims.
following a hearing on the parties for summary judgment,the district court found in favor of the estate on the merits of the central issue,but reduced the value of the deduction from to,the amount of the reimbursement,based upon the per share stock values determined in the grandchildren donees tax court settlement and allowed by the probate court found in favor of the government as to the in attorneys fees paid prior to death,and increased the amount of the gross estate accordingly found in favor of the government as to the in attorneys fees paid after death and,by amended order,following a second hearing,determined the interest expense deduction to be.the estate now appeals from these two orders.
ii standard of review 
we review the district court grants of partial summary judgment and summary judgment de novo,reviewing all facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,and applying the same standard as the district court.wesson huntsman,cir citations omitted.a grant of summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.if the record presents factual issues,the court must not decide them it must deny the motion and proceed to trial.clemons dougherty county,cir.a grant of summary judgment may be upheld on any basis supported by the record.see fitzpatrick city of atlanta,cir.
iv.discussion 
section a claims against the.in general 
federal estate tax is imposed upon the taxable estate of a united states citizen or resident alien dying in the united states.the taxable estate is defined as the value of the gross estate minus deductions allowable by statute.for purposes of this appeal,the relevant deductions are found in subsection a of section for claims against the estate.a.the statute is silent regarding the date for valuing claims against the estate in general,the amounts that may be deducted as claims against a decedent estate are such only as represent personal obligations of the decedent existing at the time of his or her death,whether or not then matured.reg.however,the regulations go on to state that a deduction will be allowed for a claim against the estate even though its exact amount is not then known,provided it is ascertainable with reasonable certainty,and will be paid.reg.b.
contentions of the parties 
here there is no dispute that the estate is entitled to a deduction with respect to claims against the estate by the nine heirs for reimbursement of their transferee gift tax liability on the gifts of stock by as to the amount of the deduction,the estate argues that we must ignore the tax court settlement made by the grandchildren donees nine months after death and instead use the demand amount asserted by the government in its own statutory notices of deficiency.the government contends that the tax court settlement figure of,as found by the district court and approved by the probate court,is the proper amount of the deduction as it represents the actual amount of taxes ultimately paid.
the split among the circuits 
how do we value this deduction for a claim against the estate do we take a valuation snapshot on the day died or,do we consider events occurring after her death,such as the tax court settlement between the grandchildren donees and the government these questions reflect the dilemma where a valid,enforceable claim may exist at the time of the decedent death,but subsequent events may relieve the estate of all or a portion of its liability for the claim in this context,two distinct and irreconcilable lines of cases have been spawned.
there are those circuits that strictly follow the supreme court decision in ithaca trust united states,and its general rule that events must not be considered in valuing the amount of the deduction,as t he estate so far as may be is settled as of the date of the testator death.and,there are those that follow the eighth circuit decision in jacobs commissioner,cir,cert.denied,and its approach that events must be considered,as t he claims which congress intended to be deducted were actual claims,not theoretical ones.
we prefer to follow the analysis used by the supreme court in ithaca trust.at in ithaca trust,the decedent bequeathed property to charity and reserved a life estate in his spouse.the widow died six months after her husband died,but before his estate tax return was filed.
the question presented was whether the charitable deduction should be calculated using the actuarial value of the widow life expectancy at the date of her husband death a decrease in value,or calculated by using the actual and known date of her death an increase in value.the supreme court concluded that the charitable deduction had to be valued based on the wife probable life expectancy as of her husband date of death rather than the known fact that she died only six months after her husband.
cited many times,justice holmes,writing for a unanimous court,reasoned 
the first impression is that it is absurd to resort to statistical probabilities when you know the fact.but this is due to inaccurate thinking.the estate so far as may be is settled as of the date of the testator death the tax is on the act of the testator not on the receipt of property by the legatees therefore,the value of the thing to be taxed must be estimated as of the time when the act is done.but the value of property at a given time depends upon the relative intensity of the social desire for it at that time,expressed in the money that it would bring in the market like all values,as the word is used by the law,it depends largely on more or less certain prophecies of the future,and the value is no less real at that time if later the prophecy turns out false than when it comes out true tempting as it is to correct uncertain probabilities by the now certain fact,we are of opinion that it can not be done,but that the value of the wife life interest must be estimated by the mortality tables.
we therefore align ourselves with the more persuasive and opinions of those circuits that follow ithaca trust our case is very similar to estate of smith commissioner,cir and estate of mcmorris commissioner,cir.
in the estate of smith case,exxon corporation sued smith to recoup an alleged overpayment of oil and gas lease royalties.in november,smith died,while exxon motion for summary judgment was pending.three months later the district court granted summary judgment for exxon and referred the calculation of damages to a special master.exxon claimed it was owed by the estate.estate of smith,at.
smith estate tax return was filed in july,eight months after her death,five months after the summary judgment in exxon favor,yet before the final calculation of damages by the special master.her estate tax return included a section a deduction of for exxon demand claim against the estate.in march,fifteen months after smith death and nine months after her estate tax return had been filed,the estate settled with exxon for,an amount equal to only of the section a deduction claimed originally.id.
the government assessed a deficiency against the estate,arguing that the section a deduction should be limited to the amount actually paid.relying on ithaca trust,the fifth circuit held that the settlement event could not be considered in determining the amount of the deduction 
w e hold that the claim generating the estate tax deduction under section a must be valued as of the date of the death of the decedent and thus must appraised sic on information known or available up to but not after that date.we therefore vacate and remand with instructions to the tax court that it admit and consider evidence of facts and occurrences that are relevant to the value of exxon claim,without admitting or considering facts and occurrences such as the estate settlement with exxon,which occurred some fifteen months after decedent death.
similarly,in estate of mcmorris,mcmorris died in owning shares of stock in nw transport service.the stock was listed on mcmorris estate tax return at an appraised value of per share at the date of his death.the shares passed to mcmorris,and this price per share value became her basis in the stock.mcmorris then entered into an agreement with nw transport to redeem the stock for per share,payable over months at ten percent interest.estate of mcmorris,at.
mcmorris died in.on her federal estate tax return,her estate claimed section a deductions of for her federal individual income taxes,and for her state individual income taxes.both tax liabilities resulted largely from the gain generated by the nw transport stock redemption.id.in,the government issued a notice of deficiency to mcmorris estate,claiming that the value of the nw transport stock was per share,not the per share claimed on his estate tax return.mcmorris estate contested the determination and,in,after lengthy negotiations,the parties settled,meeting almost halfway at per share.this value then became the new basis for the stock redeemed by mcmorris.due to her increased basis,the taxable gain generated by the redemption was eliminated and she realized a loss.id.
in january,mcmorris estate filed an amended individual federal income tax return seeking a refund of it did not,however,file an amended estate tax return decreasing the amount of the section a deduction originally claimed for federal and state income taxes.
by this time,mcmorris estate was already embroiled in tax court litigation with the government on unrelated issues.the estate filing of an amended income tax return,but not an amended estate tax return,caused the government to react.it filed an amended answer in tax court,claiming that the estate was no longer entitled to such a large section a deduction as the tax liabilities upon which it was based were now subject to a refund.the government argued that the deductions should reflect the per share stock value reached in the settlement between mcmorris estate and the government,not the per share appraised value at mcmorris date of date.the tax court agreed.id.at.
relying upon ithaca trust,the tenth circuit reversed the tax court and held that the settlement event could not be considered in determining the amount of the deduction.it remanded with directions to vacate the determination of the estate tax deficiency at issue based on the settlement value and to recalculate any remaining unrelated deficiencies owing.id.at emphasis added.as the estate of mcmorris date of death value was already established,the section a deduction stood as originally filed it was unnecessary for the tenth circuit to request a recalculation upon remand.id.
by contrast,in estate of smith,the date of death value was not established when the fifth circuit chose to follow ithaca trust and disregard events.estate of smith,at.the date of death value was unknown.the amount claimed by smith estate to be the date of death value was only the litigation demand amount being made by exxon at her date of death.it was therefore necessary for the fifth circuit to request a recalculation upon remand.id.
we face a similar situation here.we conclude that the section a deduction should be the value at date of death.we still,however,do not know what that value is.as in estate of smith,it is not necessarily the amount of the demand being made by the government at death.like the fifth circuit,we must remand this case to the district court for a recalculation of the deduction.id see also estate of van horne commissioner,cir date of death valuation for spousal support obligation propstra united states,cir date of death valuation for encumbered real estate where as a matter of law,when claims are for sums certain and are legally enforceable as of the date of death,events are not relevant in computing the permissible deduction.
the proper valuation in this case 
based upon the foregoing discussion,we find that the district court erred when it considered the tax court settlement amount of determined some nine months after death in calculating the value of the estate section a deduction.yet,conversely,we find that no case holds that the value at the date of death is the demand amount,being made here by the government at the date of death.see,estate of smith,at.we therefore vacate the opinion of the district court on this issue and remand for evidentiary hearing on valuation.
on remand,the district court is instructed neither to admit nor consider evidence of occurrences when determining the date of death value of the section a deduction.id.at.it will be incumbent on each party to supply the district court with relevant evidence of facts and occurrences supporting the date of death value of the deduction as advocated by that party.id.the district court will then,by using informed judgment,reasonableness and common sense,weighing all relevant facts and evaluating their aggregate significance,determine a sound valuation see revenue ruling,rul.
attorneys fees paid before death pursuant to durable power of attorney 
alabama law construes powers of attorney strictly.see lamb scott,so d.it restricts powers of attorney to express grants of authority and those incidental grants of authority that are necessary to carry out the express grants.id.at.under this agency relationship,the holder of the power of attorney promises to use it for the sole benefit of the donor of the power.id.the agent is not permitted to profit from this special agency relationship.see lisenby simms,so d.
here when the estate declined to produce copies of legal fee invoices on the basis of privilege,the district court found a proper accounting lacking.in its findings,it determined that the estate had failed to produce sufficient evidence proving that the in attorneys fees paid by emmet pursuant to his mother power of attorney before her death were for her benefit and not his.
after an extensive review of the record,we find that the estate may no
