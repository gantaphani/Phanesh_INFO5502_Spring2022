the people appeal from an order of the superior court granting the petitions of cheryl ann chavez and gilbert frank chavez for writs of habeas corpus.petitioners had been sentenced to prison in for,among other things,four counts of filing false tax returns.at the time they were sentenced,section called for punishment in state prison for not more than three years.the trial court interpreted that language as calling for indeterminate sentencing and sentenced petitioners accordingly.
in the legislature changed the sentencing language of section to read imprisoned in the state prison.stats,ch.this revision made certain that the prescribed sentence would be interpreted as coming within the determinate sentencing law dsl,et in the habeas corpus proceedings petitioners argued that the amended statute should be applied retroactively to them,presumably because it would reduce their punishment.the superior court issued the writ.for reasons we shall explain,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
the district attorney filed an information charging petitioners with crimes arising from allegations that cheryl chavez had embezzled over million from her employer.the information included seven counts grand theft,subd.a,count as to cheryl chavez only,possession of stolen property,count,filing false tax returns former,subd.a counts,and failure to file a tax return,a misdemeanor,count.counts and carried an enhancement allegation that the loss was greater than million,subd.d.
petitioners were convicted on all counts.they were each sentenced to a total of seven years for the applicable principal count plus four consecutive indeterminate terms of not more than three years for counts through.
by the end of the legislature passed senate bill sb,changing the punishment authorized by section to imprisonment in the state prison.stats,ch.this change means that a violation of section is now punishable by a determinate term of months,two years,or three years,subd.a.
under indeterminate sentencing,the maximum term for one violation of section as it read in was three years.under the revised law prescribing determinate sentencing the maximum is also three years.however,application of the terms is very different.under indeterminate sentencing,the actual terms and eligibility for parole are determined by the board of prison terms.when convicted of multiple counts,the offender may or may not be required to serve the maximum term for each count when consecutive sentences are imposed.thus,the maximum term for four violations of section under indeterminate sentencing would be years.
in contrast,under determinate sentencing,when a defendant is convicted of more than one felony and is to receive consecutive sentences,the sentence is calculated by taking the time for the principal term and adding the middle term for each consecutive offense,subd.a.here,since the terms for the four violations of section were consecutive subordinate terms,the maximum time for all four counts would be no more than the product of four times the middle term,or two years and eight months.
the district attorney points out that under indeterminate sentencing an offender is theoretically eligible for parole on the first day of incarceration so that determinate sentencing does not necessarily lessen the punishment.although it is theoretically possible that petitioners could have served less time under indeterminate sentencing,it is undisputed that the reverse is actually true.it is our understanding that both petitioners have already completed their determinate base terms and if determinate sentencing had applied to the subordinate terms they would have been released from prison by now.apparently,they are both still incarcerated.therefore,regardless of what their indeterminate terms theoretically could have been,in this case petitioners have been punished more harshly under the old law.indeed,according to their attorneys,if petitioners are resentenced under the amendment they will be released from prison.
petitioners sought relief by petitioning the superior court for a writ of habeas corpus.after extensive briefing,the superior court granted the petitions and ordered that petitioners sentences for counts through be vacated and the matter set for resentencing.the people filed a timely notice of appeal.the superior court granted the people request to stay its order pending appeal.this court denied gilbert chavez motion for bail or release on his own recognizance but granted the matter calendar preference.
the question before us is whether the legislature intended the period of incarceration provided by the amendment to section to apply retroactively and if so,whether the new sentence may apply to petitioners even though the judgment against them was final before the amendment was operative.
discussion 
penal code section states no part of the penal code is retroactive,unless expressly so declared.penal code section embodies the general rule that when there is nothing to indicate the contrary it will be presumed that the legislature intended a statute to operate prospectively and not retroactively.that rule of construction,however,is not a straitjacket.where the legislature has not set forth in so many words what it intended,the rule of construction should not be followed blindly in complete disregard of factors that may give a clue to the legislative intent.it is to be applied only after,considering all pertinent factors,it is determined that it is impossible to ascertain the legislative intent.in re estrada cal d,estrada.in the absence of an express declaration,a statute may apply retroactively if there is a clear and compelling implication that the legislature intended such a result.people grant cal th,d,quoting people hayes cal d.various extrinsic aids,including the history of the statute,committee reports and staff bill reports may be used to determine the intent of the legislature,and such aids are especially helpful where the wording of the statute is unclear.kaiser foundation health plan,lifeguard,th,d.decastro west chodorow burns,superior court th,d and see southern cal.gas public utilities com.cal d.
since the amendment at issue here contains no express declaration as to whether or not it is to apply retroactively,we must ascertain whether there is a clear and compelling implication that the legislature so intended.this is a pure question of law to which we apply our independent review.burnsed state bd.of control d,fn.
legislative history of section former section 
former section now section made it a crime to file a false personal income tax return the crime has always been punishable by a fine or imprisonment or both.prior to,incarceration for the crime was set as the indeterminate term of not more than years.stats,ch.
effective july,california repealed its indeterminate sentence law and the dsl became operative.stats,ch.the dsl replaced the vast majority of indeterminate felony sentences with determinate terms.those crimes that remained subject to indeterminate sentencing were primarily those carrying life sentences and some minor felonies that called for punishment of not more than a year and a day.see in re monigold d.among the many sentences that were changed by the law was former section,which was amended to read,imprisoned in the state prison,reflecting a determinate term of months,two years,or three years.stats,ch.
in the legislature passed senate bill sb.senate bill was a voluminous piece of legislation that provided for extensive reforms of public education and included various financial provisions to fund them.the bill also revised portions of california tax law to make various technical changes to the state tax laws to conform them,in part,to certain changes in the federal law made by other federal enactments.sb reg.sess.ch,legis.counsel.in all,the bill consisted of separate sections affecting over different provisions from the education code,the government code,the revenue and taxation code,and the unemployment insurance code.stats,ch.
section was one of the tax sections that sb revised to conform to federal law.prior to its amendment in,former section prohibited only the filing of a false tax return.see stats,ch.the analogous federal statute prohibited other wrongful acts,such as aiding in the preparation of a false return,concealing taxable goods,and the like.in addition,it provided for a larger fine than its state counterpart and it fixed the time for imprisonment at not more than years.sb changed former section to criminalize the additional acts listed in the federal law.it also increased the fine and changed the term of incarceration from imprisoned in state prison to the term prescribed by the federal law,not more than three years.stats,ch,and see.the legislative history is entirely silent on the subject of the prison term.
in former section was renumbered as section.the new statute retained the sentence described as not more than years.stats,ch.
sb was introduced in at the urging of the california district attorneys association.senate committee on public safety,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may.the bill was said to be needed to correct technical and grammatical errors in penal provisions in various codes.id.at.the legislative history includes the following analysis often times,as bills move through the legislative process and become law,errors in drafting are overlooked and subsequently codified.this cleanup bill makes numerous,nonsubstantive changes to clarify and update specific provisions of the california codes.id.at.similar language stressing the technical,nonsubstantive aspect of the bill changes appears throughout the legislative history.among the revisions proposed was an amendment returning the sentencing language of section to the phrase in state prison that had been inserted when the dsl was enacted in.
as sb was working its way through the senate committees,the fourth district court of appeal filed its opinion in people hagen th,d hagen.the defendants in hagen had been convicted of violating former section and were originally sentenced as if the statute called for determinate sentencing.after the trial court received a letter from the department of corrections,the court resentenced the defendants to indeterminate terms.the hagens appealed from this order arguing that the phrase not more than three years was a single term of imprisonment as contemplated by penal code section,subdivision a,which would make it a determinate sentence.hagen,which was the first judicial decision interpreting the sentencing portion of former section,held that the language not more than three years demanded indeterminate sentencing and could not be treated as an equivalent determinate term.hagen,supra,th at,d.as support for its conclusion hagen cited the version of the california judges benchbook,which counseled that certain lesser crimes retained the not more than language of indeterminate sentencing and that such sentences were to be treated as indeterminate,citing cal.judges benchbook criminal posttrial proceedings cjer felony sentencing.the only statute hagen cited as an example of other indeterminate terms was an uncodified initiative measure passed in former.
hagen came to the attention of the legislature and was cited as one of the reasons why section should be revised 
with the exception of life terms,california prison terms are specified determinate terms however,an anomalous punishment provision in the revenue and tax code provides that a person who submits a false income tax return shall receive a prison term of up to years.a recent appellate decision confirmed that such provisions are indeterminate terms and that a sentencing court could not impose what it believed was a roughly equivalent determinate term,such as years.people hagen th,d other codes include such punishment provisions.
under existing law,there is no provision for the department of corrections or the board of prison terms to determine when a person should be released from prison for a indeterminate sentence.there are no provisions for setting when such a prisoner would be eligible for parole.without conversion of these anomalous indeterminate sentencing provisions,the department of corrections and the parole board would be forced to create a whole new procedure for handling a very few number of cases.com.on public safety,analysis of bill,supra.
sb was signed into law and the amendment to section became operative january.stats,ch.
the legislature intended to apply the determinate sentence retroactively 
the gist of the people argument on appeal is that the amendment intentionally returned the sentence for tax fraud to an indeterminate term of not more than three years.as we understand the argument,this intentional change signals the legislature purpose to have the amendment operate long enough and consistently enough to convey to the public an understanding that the heavier penalty,the indeterminate term will apply during the period it is in effect.in re pedro cal th,d.the argument requires that we determine the legislative intent of both the and amendments.
we begin with the amendment.although a substantial change in the language of a statute by an amendment indicates an intention to change its meaning,a mere change in phraseology,incident to a revision of the statute,does not result in a change of meaning unless the intent to make such a change clearly appears.decastro west chodorow burns,superior court,supra,th at,d.
in passing sb in the legislature clearly intended to change the law.however,it is absurd to presume that one of the intended changes was to retreat from determinate sentencing for the crime of tax fraud.rather,the surrounding circumstances suggest the change was unintentional.changing to an indeterminate term for a sentence would represent a dramatic divergence from the recently enacted dsl.for years prior to california had an indeterminate sentencing law.see way superior court d.way.the enactment of the dsl in marked a sea change in sentencing policy,subd.a in re stanworth cal d.there is no dispute that in the legislature intended that the crime of tax fraud should be punished with a determinate sentence.the people offer no explanation for why,just six years after completely overhauling the state sentencing scheme,the legislature might have decided to retreat from determinate sentencing for this single crime.if the change to not more than three years was truly meant to return the sentence to an indeterminate term,the change was sufficiently anomalous under california penal laws at the time that it seems unlikely the legislature would have passed it without any comment whatsoever.
it is far more likely that sb incongruous and unexplained reversion to indeterminate sentencing was the result of the drafters attempt to track the federal language as closely as possible.with the exception of the amount of the fine and references to state law,the amendment to former section repeats the federal law verbatim,including the use of the phrase not more than three years to describe the term of incarceration.if one is not looking for it,the distinction between a provision calling for imprisonment in state prison and one calling for imprisonment for not more than three years may not be very apparent.certainly,the distinction is not apparent from the words alone.
our suspicion that the amendment was indeed a drafting error is strengthened by the fact that sb was not focused upon penal laws but was a voluminous bill devoted in large part to educational reforms that required the simultaneous amendment of hundreds of code sections.such circumstances can create a dangerous potential for drafting errors.people alexander d.given the legislative history and the surrounding circumstances we are convinced the amendment was a drafting error and was not enacted for any deterrent purpose.
turning to sb,it is clear the legislature intended the amendment to section to correct the language to ensure that its sentencing provision would conform to existing determinate sentencing structure.although hagen was filed shortly after sb was introduced,the controversy over the interpretation of the statute clearly preceded the legislative enactment and prompted the legislature to make the correction.an amendment enacted soon after controversies arise as to
