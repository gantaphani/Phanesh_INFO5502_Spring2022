background 
in may,the napa county superior court found that reynolds,a resident of san diego,had standing to bring the public trust suit based on allegations that the city failed to comply with state law requiring it,as the of a dam creating the kimball reservoir,to allow sufficient water to bypass the dam to support downstream fisheries.see national audubon society superior court cal d fish.in the summer of,fishery and hydrology experts investigated the issue,and unsuccessful settlement talks followed in the fall.in may,reynolds filed a motion for summary adjudication of the public trust cause of action and one week later the city published a draft water bypass plan,which was adopted by the city council in august.prior to a scheduled trial date,the court granted the city motion to dismiss the public trust cause of action as moot in light of the adopted bypass plan and entered judgment for the city.that judgment is the subject of a related appeal reynolds city of calistoga,consolidated with on july.
reynolds alleges that he urged the city to use funds raised by a napa county sales tax measure a funds to restore the upper napa river riparian environment as part of a settlement of the public trust suit,but was told that all available funds had been expended on other projects.reynolds concluded the city had used measure a funds for a particular purpose the mount washington water tank project,hereafter water tank project not permissible under the terms of the voter initiative that had approved the sales tax.
in june,reynolds filed the complaint in the tax suit challenging alleged misuse of measure a funds.as subsequently amended,the complaint named several defendants the city,the city mayor,four city council members,and the napa county flood protection and watershed improvement authority authority collectively defendants and alleged that the water tank project,proposed by the city and approved by the authority as a project to be funded by measure a funds,was not an authorized use of such funds,which he contends were to be used exclusively for flood protection and watershed improvement.reynolds asserted a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty,which was founded on allegations that a ll property under the care and control of a county is held in trust by the county for the people of the entire state,and that the defendants were trustees of such property thereby owing a fiduciary duty to plaintiff and all citizens of the state and more specifically were trustees of the money collected and deposited pursuant to measure a who owe a fiduciary duty to all citizens including plaintiff to insure that special tax funds are spent lawfully.he alleged that defendants violated their fiduciary duty to the people of the state of california by allowing the water tank project to be funded with measure a funds.reynolds sought a declaratory judgment that measure a funds were not properly spent on the water tank project,an order enjoining use of measure a funds on the project,and an order directing the defendants to repay measure a funds already spent on the project 
reynolds alleged standing to bring the action on three grounds as a payer of sales tax in napa county as a public trust beneficiary interested in having measure a funding applied to the restoration of the upper napa river riparian habitat where kimball reservoir is located and because the question to be decided by this complaint is one of a public right sought to be enforced by a citizen interested in having the law executed where the duty in question is related to measure a.italics added.
defendants demurred to the complaint in part on the ground that reynolds lacked standing.they argued that taxpayer standing could not be based on payment of sales tax that public trust standing was inapplicable because reynolds was not asserting a claim of harm to the public trust and that the allegations did not support the narrow circumstances in which public right standing is recognized.defendants also asserted laches as a defense.
the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,ruling plaintiff does not have standing as a tax payer because sales tax is levied against businesses rather than individuals.he does not have standing under the public trust doctrine because he is not asserting a public trust claim.lastly,he does not have standing under the public right doctrine because the claim for improper spending of tax revenue within napa county does not rise to such a level.
reynolds filed a motion for reconsideration he submitted evidence that he held a lien interest in real property a june deed of trust with assignment of rents that secured a million loan and argued he therefore had a real,personal and direct interest in the subject matter of the first amended complaint.he also argued that the purpose of measure a was to bestow a benefit on all citizens of the state,not merely local residents because its stated purpose was to provide protection,save lives,protect property,restore the napa river,napa creek,and other tributaries,maintain napa county economic vitality,and enhance riparian environments,and s uch waterways are part of the public trust misappropriation of funds intended for the benefit of the public trust gives standing to any citizen to hold the responsible governmental entities and elected officials to account for their malfeasance.
the trial court denied the motion and entered judgment for the defendants plaintiff has not offered any new evidence or law that could not have been offered,in the exercise of reasonable diligence,prior to the court issuing its ruling denying the underlying demurrer on the ground plaintiff lacked standing.even if plaintiff had satisfied the procedural requirements of code of civil procedure section,the court would nevertheless deny the motion.having a lien interest on a property located in napa county does not confer taxpayer standing on plaintiff.moreover,the gravamen of this complaint is that d efendants misspent taxpayer funds.plaintiff can not obtain standing simply by characterizing his claims as one s for a violation of the public trust doctrine.plaintiff provides no authority for the extension of the public trust doctrine in the manner he proposes herein.lastly,even if the complaint could be considered as including a claim for violation of the public trust for which plaintiff had standing,the claim would nevertheless be barred by laches,as a matter of law,based on plaintiff unreasonable and prejudicial delay in bringing the claims.the court entered judgment for the defendants on july.reynolds filed a notice of appeal from the judgment.
