this case is before us on appeal from a judgment of the tax court.in the proceeding below,the tax court held that appellee,the estate of frank branson,had underpaid its estate taxes and owed a deficiency of.the tax court further held that appellee need not pay the full amount of the deficiency.rather,the estate could,under the doctrine of equitable recoupment,credit a income tax overpayment against the estate tax deficiency and pay only the remainder.
the commissioner of internal revenue commissioner appeals the tax court application of equitable recoupment to reduce the estate tax deficiency.the commissioner argues,first,that the tax court has no jurisdiction to apply equitable recoupment.in the alternative,the commissioner contends that equitable recoupment is not available on the facts of this case.
we hold that the tax court did not exceed its limited jurisdictional grant when it considered the affirmative defense of equitable recoupment.we also affirm the tax court application of that doctrine in this case.
frank branson decedent died in november.his daughter,mary march,was named the executor and residuary beneficiary of his estate.as such,she assumed full individual liability for any additional taxes owed by the estate.
the estate contained stock in two separate closely held corporations willits stock and savings stock.on the estate tax return,filed in,the willits stock was valued at per share and the savings stock at per share.the executor was authorized to sell a certain portion of this stock shares of willits stock and shares of savings stock in order to pay applicable estate taxes.the willits stock sold for per share and the savings stock sold for per share,considerably higher than their reported value.
under a,the declared value of the stock was used as a basis for determining the gain from their sale consistent with this statutory requirement,the difference between the stock reported value and its sale value approximately was reported as a capital gain on the estate tax return.the estate did not pay taxes on this gain,but rather distributed it immediately to march,the residuary beneficiary.march then declared this money as a capital gain on her income tax return.under,march was also required to use the stock value declared on the estate tax return for the purpose of determining her capital gain from the sale.consequently,she declared a capital gain of approximately,and paid the taxes due.
in,the commissioner determined a deficiency on appellee estate tax return.the basis of this deficiency was the commissioner conclusion that the willits and savings stocks were worth substantially more than the estate declared.after appellee contested the commissioner notice of deficiency,the tax court concluded that the willits stock was worth per share and the savings stock was worth per share.the revaluation of the stock led to an estate tax deficiency.since,pursuant to,the same valuation was used to determine march income tax liability,it necessarily followed that march had overpaid her income taxes in 
both the commissioner and the estate agree that the revaluation of the estate stock led to both an estate tax deficiency and an income tax overpayment in the tax year.the ultimate determination of the existence and amount of the estate tax deficiency was decided by the tax court in july,long after the statute of limitations had run on a claim for refund of the income tax overpayment.however,the initial notice of estate tax deficiency was issued in march,over a year before the statute of limitations for a refund of the overpaid income tax had run.
march,however,failed to file a refund claim for her income tax overpayment within the applicable limitations period.instead,she asked that her income tax overpayment be credited against the estate tax deficiency adjudicated in the tax court.the tax court agreed and this appeal followed.

jurisdiction 
in deciding whether the tax court has jurisdiction to apply the doctrine of equitable recoupment in this circumstance,we start by stating certain principles that are and not in dispute.first,the tax court,like any federal court,is a court of limited jurisdiction.federal courts possess only that power authorized by constitution and statute.kokkonen guardian life ins.of,d.the statute conferring subject matter jurisdiction on the tax court is title of the united states code.the tax court jurisdiction is defined and limited by title and it may not use general equitable powers to expand its jurisdictional grant beyond this limited congressional authorization.it may exercise its authority only within its statutorily defined sphere.comm r mccoy,d tax court lacks general equitable powers kelley comm r,cir tax court is an article i court designed to handle cases of a specialized nature.
within that sphere,however,the tax court exercises its judicial power in much the same way as the federal district courts exercise theirs.freytag comm r,d.this includes the authority to apply the full range of equitable principles generally granted to courts that possess judicial powers.even if the tax court does not have general equitable powers,it can apply equitable principles and exercise equitable powers within its own jurisdictional competence.estate of ashman comm r,cir see also kelley,at tax court has equitable power to reform agreements between taxpayer and irs buchine comm r,cir holding that the tax court had the authority to apply the equitable principle of reformation to a case over which it had jurisdiction.
having set forth that which is not in dispute,we come to the issue at the heart of this appeal.does the tax court statutory grant of authority prevent it from applying the equitable doctrine of recoupment when redetermining an estate tax deficiency we find the answer to be no.consequently,we hold that where,as here,the tax court has jurisdiction to redetermine an estate tax deficiency,it may exercise its equitable powers to recoup an income tax overpayment from the same tax year if all the criteria for an equitable recoupment claim are otherwise satisfied.
we first proceed to a brief description of the principles and purposes underlying the doctrine of equitable recoupment.we then examine the statutory authority delimiting the tax court jurisdiction.finding no conflict between the two,we affirm the tax court exercise of jurisdiction and proceed to determine whether recoupment was properly granted on the facts of this case.
equitable recoupment 
generally,a party who has paid a tax that was not owed may sue for a refund under.refund suits,however,are subject to a strict statute of limitations.b b no credit or refund is allowed if taxpayer fails to file a refund claim or seek a redetermination in tax court within three years of when return was filed see also,comm r lundy,d.in some circumstances,a taxpayer may be time barred from seeking a refund of an erroneous tax,but the irs can still bring a timely suit for payment of the correct tax.in this limited circumstance,the doctrine of equitable recoupment may be raised as a defense to the statute of limitations.it is designed to protect a party from paying twice on a single obligation.bull united states.

because equitable recoupment has the potential to completely override the statute of limitations,the party raising an equitable recoupment claim must satisfy several criteria.first,the same transaction,item or taxable event must be subject to two taxes.second,the taxes must be inconsistent in that the tax code authorizes only a single tax.see bull,at.same funds can not be taxed both as an asset of the estate and income to the estate dalm,at.single item can not be subject to both gift tax and income tax.third,the tax sought to be recouped must be time barred.stone white.kolom united states,cir overruled on other grounds,dalm,d.fourth,there must be an identity of interest between the parties paying the duplicative tax.stone.trustee who paid erroneous tax has sufficient identity of interest with beneficiary who owed tax deficiency.

tax court jurisdiction 
in the present case,the tax court had jurisdiction to determine the estate tax deficiency.its jurisdiction was invoked in the usual way contemplated by the tax code.first,the taxpayer estimated the value of closely held stock owned by the estate.this estimated value was included in the corpus of the estate and estate taxes were calculated based on the total value of the estate.a portion of the stock was then sold and the proceeds were used to pay taxes.the difference between the estimated value and the sale value of the stock was declared as a capital gain and distributed to march,the residuary beneficiary.the commissioner,upon examination of the estate tax return,determined a deficiency and sent notice of such to the taxpayer pursuant to.the taxpayer timely petitioned for redetermination of that deficiency in the tax court under.jurisdiction over the estate tax deficiency was therefore proper.
in redetermining the estate tax deficiency over which it had jurisdiction,the tax court was required to value the closed corporation stocks held by the estate.the valuation of those stocks affected not only the tax liability of the estate,but also the tax liability of the estate beneficiary to whom the gain from the stock sale was distributed.the tax court single determination that the stocks were undervalued led inexorably to the conclusion that appellee had both underpaid its estate taxes and overpaid its income taxes.the two taxes were inextricably intertwined because they were both based on the valuation of the same willits and savings stock.
the estate,consequently,raised the undisputed fact of the income tax overpayment as an affirmative defense to the finding of an estate tax deficiency.the tax court,having original jurisdiction to redetermine the estate tax deficiency,concluded that it also had jurisdiction to give effect to this affirmative defense and reduce the judgment accordingly.the tax court viewed its actions as only considering such facts with relation to the share value included in both corpus and income so that this item may be examined in all its aspects,as is necessary to correctly redetermine the amount of the estate tax deficiency now before us.see naftel comm r,wl jurisdiction to determine a deficiency extends to the entire subject matter of the correct tax for the taxable year bartels comm r,wl deficiency jurisdiction confers authority to consider defense of recoupment.
if this case had arisen in the district court,which shares with the tax court jurisdiction over federal tax cases,there is no question that appellee could have raised the defense of equitable recoupment to reduce the estate tax deficiency.dalm,at.equitable recoupment defense may be raised in timely refund suit parker united states,cir considering merits of equitable recoupment defense raised in the district court.
as noted above,the tax court,within its specialized jurisdiction,operates pretty indistinguishably from a federal district court.flight attendants against ual offset faauo comm r,cir citing freytag,supra,at.the commissioner argues,however,that the presumed equivalence in the authority of the two courts does not apply in this circumstance.to rebut this presumption,however,the commissioner must find specific support in the provisions of the tax code,for we are in agreement with the seventh circuit that the overlap between the district courts jurisdiction over refund suits and the tax court jurisdiction over deficiency suits makes it anomalous and confusing to multiply distinctions between the doctrines applied by the two types of court.faauo,at.
more than simply anomalous,such a distinction would,in practice,work substantial prejudice against less affluent taxpayers.this is so because,although a taxpayer has a choice of fora in which he or she may dispute a notice of deficiency,only in the tax court may the taxpayer contest the commissioner determination without first paying the amount in dispute.flora united states,d taxpayers must pay assessment before bringing refund suit in district court,but may appeal the deficiency to the tax court without paying a cent.for this reason,the tax court is the preferred forum for taxpayers who dispute a tax assessment.the tax code,moreover,encourages the concentration of tax disputes in the tax court,rather than the district court,by offering finality to litigants who elect to bring their claims in this specialized forum.woods comm r,wl the combined effect of e,a,and is to channel tax litigation in the tax court,to make our decisions binding,and to preclude relitigation of the same issues in another forum.
a limitation on the equitable doctrines available in the tax court would undermine both the taxpayer ability to choose to litigate in the tax court and the government effort to channel litigation into this forum.in bokum comm r,cir,the eleventh circuit refused to impose such a limit on the tax court jurisdiction.in rejecting the commissioner contention that the tax court lacks jurisdiction to entertain a defense based on equitable estoppel,that court held 
if the tax court lacked authority to entertain a claim of equitable estoppel,taxpayers with such a claim would no longer have a choice of fora for their tax issues.they would effectively be forced to pay their taxes and sue for a refund,submitting all of their claims to the district courts thus,taxpayers would essentially be denied the right to challenge deficiencies in the tax court if they wanted to assert an equitable estoppel claim.this would be an unfair choice to pose to taxpayers,and would undermine the purpose of the tax court.we therefore conclude that the tax court did have jurisdiction over the bokums equitable estoppel claim.
bokum,at.the same unfair choice results from restricting the tax court jurisdiction over equitable recoupment claims.
we recognize,of course,that neither anomalous nor unfair results can negate express statutory directives.lundy,at.distinction between rules that apply in tax court as opposed to district court are compelled by statutory language.particularly where the tax code is at issue,it is the dictates of statute,not of conscience that must control.there exists no statute or principle in tax law that requires either,for example,a decennial or lifetime adjustment of taxes requiring either refunds or additional taxes as a result of a harmonious and consistent application of taxes throughout the selected time frame.harrah united states,cir.we turn,therefore,to the tax code in search of some congressional indication that equitable recoupment is beyond the jurisdiction of the tax court.we find none.
statutory provisions 
for the proposition that the tax court lacks jurisdiction to consider an equitable recoupment defense,the commissioner directs us to sections b and b of the tax code.the commissioner argues that,taken together,these sections explicitly confer on the tax court jurisdiction to do no more than determine the amount of the deficiency before it.mueller comm r,at.
in carrying out this function,the commissioner argues,the tax court may not determine a deficiency or overpayment for any tax not presented by an irs notice of deficiency and disputed by the taxpayer.because an equitable recoupment defense inherently requires the tax court to determine that the tax was overpaid,b and b put equitable recoupment beyond the jurisdiction of the tax court.
we disagree with the commissioner assessment of these statutory provisions and find nothing in the cited statutes that prevents the tax court from considering the defense of equitable recoupment in this case.first,section b,entitled jurisdiction over other years and quarters,can not limit the tax court jurisdiction in this case because appellee estate tax deficiency and consequent income tax overpayment were both paid in the same tax year.in addition,b,by its terms,applies only when the tax court is engaged in a redetermination of an income or gift tax deficiency.it is simply not applicable where,as here,the tax court jurisdiction is invoked to redetermine an estate tax deficiency.we therefore find that b does not bar the application of equitable recoupment in this case.
nor does section b prevent the tax court from using appellee income tax overpayment to reduce its estate tax deficiency.that section of the code provides that when the tax court has jurisdiction to determine a deficiency,it also has jurisdiction to determine an overpayment of income tax for the same taxable year and order that any overpayment be credited or refunded to the taxpayer.b.in other words,where the jurisdiction of the tax court is properly invoked as it was here,section b gives the tax court exclusive jurisdiction to determine not only whether the deficiency was correct,but also whether a taxpayer claim that he has overpaid is correct.naftel,at.
we have previously observed that b read together with the exclusivity provisions of the code,see e gives the tax court jurisdiction to decide the entire gamut of possible issues that control the determination of the amount of tax liability for the year in question.russell united states,cir.it is this authority that the tax court exercised in the present case.it did not determine that there was an income tax overpayment in a prior undertaking forbidden by b.such a determination was not required because equitable recoupment is,in essence,a defense to the statute of limitations raised as part of the estate tax deficiency proceeding.see bull,at.r ecoupment is in the nature of a defense such a defense is never barred by the statute of limitations so long as the main action itself is timely.
after an examination of the relevant sections of the tax code,w e are given no reason to suppose that statutes of limitations are intended to be administered differently in the tax court than in the federal district courts faauo,at.the tax court therefore had jurisdiction to examine the estate tax deficiency in all its aspects so as to correctly redetermine the amount of the deficiency for the tax year.rothensies storage battery,at 
gooch milling 
we also reject the commissioner contention that our reading of the tax code is foreclosed by the supreme court decision in commissioner gooch milling elevator.in gooch milling,an audit of respondent company books revealed an erroneous valuation of its inventory.because of this error,respondent had overpaid its income taxes for.the same erroneous valuation of the same inventory led the commissioner to determine that gooch milling had also underpaid its taxes for respondent was barred by the statute of limitations from seeking a refund of its overpayment.the commissioner,however,was not barred from issuing a notice of deficiency for the underpayment.respondent appealed this notice to the board of tax appeals the precursor of the tax court,arguing that the overpayment should be applied as an offset or recoupment against the deficiency.gooch milling,at.
the court held that the board of tax appeals had no jurisdiction to credit the overpayment against the deficiency.in reaching this conclusion,the court relied primarily on section g of the internal revenue code of later amended and redesignated as section b of the present code.the court held that the legislative grant of jurisdiction presently codified in section b confined the board to a determination of the amount of deficiency or overpayment for the particular tax year as to which the commissioner determines a deficiency and as to which the taxpayer seeks a review of the deficiency assessment.id.that section specifically prohibited the board from determining whether a tax for a previous tax year had been overpaid.because respondent equitable recoupment defense necessarily involved a determination of whether there was an overpayment during the fiscal year,the board was without jurisdiction to give effect to this defense.id.
the commissioner argues that gooch milling stands for the broad proposition that the tax court is without jurisdiction to apply the doctrine of equitable recoupment.just as the board of tax appeals could not offset a overpayment against a deficiency in gooch milling,the commissioner argues that the tax court may not offset march income tax overpayment against a separate estate tax deficiency.
gooch milling is distinguishable from the present appeal for several reasons.first,gooch milling involved an appeal from the board of tax appeals,an administrative agency of the executive branch,rather than the tax court,an article i court.the tax court authority to apply equitable doctrines,see supra,differentiates it from its predecessor,the board of tax appeals,which was held not to be a court and to have no equitable powers.toscano comm r,cir.of more importance is that the facts of gooch milling differ from those in this case.in gooch milling,the taxpayer sought to recoup a prior year income tax overpayment against a separate income tax deficiency.in this case,the taxpayer seeks to apply an income tax overpayment against an estate tax deficiency,both of which occurred in the same year.
these differences are significant because,as noted above,b only prohibits the tax court from determining whether taxes in other years have been overpaid or underpaid.it says nothing about determining overpayments of other taxes from the same year.a careful reading of the gooch milling opinion,and of the relevant statute show s that it actually considered only the question of recoupment based on an overpayment in a year other than the year in dispute.dalm,at.stevens,dissenting.moreover,this section of the code applies only when the tax court is determining a deficiency in income or gift taxes.it does not apply in estate tax cases.our holding today,affirming the tax court exercise of equitable recoupment jurisdiction in this case,is not foreclosed by gooch milling.
recoupment 
having concluded that the tax court had jurisdiction to consider an equitable recoupment defense,we must also determine whether the tax court erred in using march income tax overpayment to satisfy the estate tax deficiency in this case.as noted above,a party raising an equitable recoupment defense must satisfy four criteria in the present case,the commissioner concedes that refund of the income tax overpayment is,and,further concedes that there is an identity of interest between the estate beneficiary and the estate subject to the estate tax deficiency.the commissioner argues,however,that the two taxes do not satisfy the same transaction test and,therefore,were not treated inconsistently under the code.
we hold that the tax court properly applied the doctrine in this case.
same transaction,item or taxable event 
in arguing that the estate tax and income tax at issue in this appeal were not a single transaction,the commissioner relies on rothensies storage battery.in rothensies,the supreme court refused to allow recoupment of overpaid excise taxes to satisfy an income tax deficiency.in that case,the excise taxes had been paid ove
