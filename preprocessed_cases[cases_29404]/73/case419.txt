in,guangdong borrowed million from gitic.the loan agreement provided for a term.gitic was listed as the sole lending party.
on its forms,corporation income tax returns,for,and,guangdong claimed deductions for interest payments made during those years.guangdong attached form,information return of a corporation or a foreign corporation engaged in a trade or business,to its tax return,but not to its or returns.in its form,guangdong stated that gxe principally conducted its business in and filed its income tax returns as a resident of hong kong.guangdong reported that it paid gxe of interest in on its million loan.
in a letter,guangdong provided its accountant with information on interest payments in response to an internal revenue service irs form,information document request.the letter stated that with respect to the loan from gxe,guangdong had paid in interest in and in interest in,and with respect to the gitic loan,guangdong had paid in interest in and in interest in.
in,guangdong filed a form,amended corporation income tax return,for,and.guangdong attached a form for each of the years at issue.the amended form indicated that guangdong had received an additional million loan from gxe in.the and forms reported that guangdong maintained the million loan balance with gxe through.the forms stated that guangdong had paid interest to gxe of,and,for the years,and,respectively.none of the forms indicated that guangdong made interest payments to gitic.
on the advice of its president,lawrence wong wong,guangdong never filed a form,annual withholding tax return for source income of foreign persons,or a form,foreign person source income subject to withholding,for any of the years in issue.wong had worked as a certified public accountant and a financial manager before joining guangdong in.
in,the irs issued a notice of deficiency to guangdong,in which the irs determined that guangdong was liable for withholding tax deficiencies and additions to tax for,and.the notice stated that guangdong had made interest payments to gxe in the amount of,and for the years,and,respectively.those numbers corresponded to the amounts guangdong reported in its forms for,and.based on these reported interest payments,the irs determined that guangdong had unpaid withholding tax liabilities of for,for,and for.the irs also determined that guangdong was liable for additions to tax of for,for,and for for failing to file forms.finally,the irs determined that guangdong was liable for an addition to tax of for failure to timely pay the amount owed for its return.

ii.discussion 
on appeal,guangdong raises three arguments the tax court erred when it assigned guangdong the burden of proof in determining that the commissioner determinations are erroneous it was not required to withhold tax on loan payments to gxe because the china agreement exempted guangdong from the usual requirement to withhold tax on such payments and it should not be liable for additions to tax because its failure to file a tax return was excused by its reliance on advice from its president.
we review a tax court findings of fact for clear error and issues of law de novo.green comm r,cir.we review its discretionary rulings for abuse of discretion.bilski comm r,cir.in this case,we affirm all the tax court rulings.
burden of proof 
the commissioner determinations with respect to a taxpayer withholding tax liabilities and additions to tax are presumed correct,and the taxpayer bears the burden of proving that these determinations are erroneous.welch helvering.payne comm r,cir.if a taxpayer establishes that an assessment is arbitrary and erroneous,the burden then shifts to the government to prove the correct amount of taxes owed.caracci comm r,cir.
guangdong argues that the commissioner notice of deficiency was arbitrary and erroneous because it grouped together loans from both gxe and gitic in determining guangdong tax deficiency therefore,the burden of proof shifts to the government.while the commissioner did incorrectly include interest paid to gitic in its notice,as the tax court noted,nothing in the record indicates that the determination was arbitrary.indeed,the commissioner based its determinations on the information guangdong itself reported in its forms.the commissioner did not act arbitrarily when it relied on information provided to it by guangdong under penalties of perjury.therefore,the tax court correctly found that the burden of proof remained with guangdong.
