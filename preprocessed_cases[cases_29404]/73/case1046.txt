after he was unsuccessfully prosecuted on charges involving an illegal gambling operation,james conrad,a veteran police officer,brought a federal tort claims act ftca action against the federal government alleging false arrest,false imprisonment,abuse of process,and malicious prosecution.conrad now appeals a summary judgment in favor of the government and a judgment on the merits in favor of the government.finding no reversible error,we affirm.
conrad appeal assigns error to three rulings by the district court the summary judgment extinguishing his false imprisonment claim,the findings of fact supporting the judgment that dismissed his malicious prosecution claim,and the judgment dismissing his malicious prosecution claim.
factual and procedural background 
during the course of a combined investigation by the internal revenue service irs and the fresno county sheriff department,conrad became a suspect in an alleged illegal gambling operation at a fresno bar and grill known as the elbow room.during the ten months of the investigation,investigating officers came to believe that conrad had employed his knowledge of,and access to,state and local police information services to learn that an undercover investigator,who was also an officer in a neighboring city police department,had infiltrated the elbow room gambling operation.the investigators also came to believe that conrad had blown the cover of their undercover man,rendering him useless,and the investigation compromised.
in due course,irs agent linda osuna,working with sheriff deputies and an assistant united states attorney ausa,prepared a page affidavit and obtained from a federal magistrate judge search and arrest warrants.conrad was among those arrested.the arrests were accomplished on a wednesday afternoon.federal magistrate judges at that time conducted arraignments in fresno only on mondays,wednesdays,and fridays,at.the arresting officers and the ausa in charge of the investigation made no effort to arrange a special arraignment for conrad.accordingly,he was not arraigned until the following friday at the usual time.this hour delay in taking conrad before a magistrate judge became the central issue in conrad civil action,and in this appeal.
agent osuna testified before the grand jury that later indicted conrad.the indictment charged conducting,and aiding and abetting,an illegal gambling business in violation of conspiracy to operate an illegal gambling business in violation of,and conspiracy to obstruct an agency investigation in violation of.
agent osuna also testified at conrad criminal trial.after the government rested,conrad and his filed a federal rule of criminal procedure motion for judgment of acquittal with respect to counts one and two of the indictment.the district court granted the motion because the government had failed to introduce any evidence that,for thirty consecutive days,the gambling operation had five members.see b ii iii.following the acquittal on counts one and two,the ausa dismissed count three.on march,conrad was exonerated.
on july,conrad filed a claim with the irs seeking damages for agent osuna handling of his criminal case.the irs denied conrad claim on october.having let the statute of limitations run on any bivens claim he might have filed,conrad commenced this action against the government under the ftca.he named agent osuna as a defendant in her official capacity.he sought damages for false arrest false imprisonment abuse of process and malicious prosecution.he did not sue the ausa,who was protected by prosecutorial immunity.
as a basis for his false arrest claim,conrad alleged that agent osuna knowingly lied in the affidavit she presented to the magistrate judge who issued his arrest warrant.conrad further alleged that the false arrest led to his false imprisonment and,alternatively,that he was falsely imprisoned because agent osuna failed to present him to a magistrate judge the same day he was arrested.conrad abuse of process claim was also premised on agent osuna alleged lies.conrad further alleged that agent osuna abused process by continuing to lie throughout her grand jury testimony and trial testimony.conrad malicious prosecution claim was premised on the same facts as those he alleged in support of his abuse of process claim.
ii.the civil action 
before trial,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the government with respect to the false arrest and abuse of process claims.the district court also granted that part of the government motion for summary judgment relating to conrad first theory of false imprisonment that the alleged lies leading to the false arrest also established false imprisonment.initially,however,the district court did not grant the government summary judgment motion on conrad second theory of false imprisonment that the delay in presenting conrad to a magistrate judge for arraignment established false imprisonment.the latter question was resolved,in the government favor,when the district court determined that the delay in taking conrad to a magistrate judge was protected by the discretionary function exception to the ftca.accordingly,both theories of conrad false imprisonment claim were disposed of on summary judgment.only conrad malicious prosecution claim remained to be tried.
the district court held a bench trial.seven witnesses,including conrad and agent osuna,testified.conrad malicious prosecution claim turned on whether agent osuna lied in her affidavit,lied to the magistrate judge,and lied in her grand jury testimony.the district court made findings of fact that agent osuna did not knowingly lie in her affidavit lie to the magistrate judge or lie in her grand jury testimony.the district court did find that there were mistakes both in agent osuna affidavit and in her testimony before the grand jury.however,the district court found that those mistakes were honest and that there was no proof that agent osuna intentionally misrepresented the truth because of malice towards conrad.the district court then entered judgment for the government and against conrad.
iii.issues on appeal 
as noted,conrad challenges three rulings the order granting the government summary judgment with respect to his second theory of false imprisonment the findings of fact supporting the judgment in favor of the government on the malicious prosecution claim and the judgment in favor of the government on the malicious prosecution claim.
claim of false imprisonment 
the united states can be sued only to the extent that it has waived its sovereign immunity.reed united states dep t of interior,cir.the ftca grants such a waiver and authorizes suits against the 
united states for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.
there are,however,a number of exceptions to this broad waiver of sovereign immunity.berkovitz united states,d.the exception relevant to the present case is the discretionary function exception,which maintains the united states sovereign immunity for a ny claim based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the government,whether or not the discretion involved is abused.a.the discretionary function exception marks the boundary between congress willingness to impose tort liability on the united states and the desire to protect certain from judicial.see berkovitz,at.
in assessing whether the discretionary function exception applies to a particular case,we look to the nature of the conduct,rather than the status of the actor,and assess the conduct in two ways.id.at.quoting united states varig airlines,d.first,the question is whether the action taken by the government employee is a matter of judgment.id.c onduct can not be discretionary unless it involves an element of judgment or choice.t
