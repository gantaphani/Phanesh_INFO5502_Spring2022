this matter involves the use of an accounting rule,in a complex area of regulation addressing the rates charged by local telephone exchange carriers for access to their networks.its resolution,however,is relatively straightforward because,at its core,petitioners challenge can not overcome the broad delegation of power congress has given the federal communications commission fcc or commission to suspend petitioners rates and determine whether they are just and reasonable.petitioners contend that the fcc unreasonably required their and tariffs to comply with the rule years after those tariffs were filed.but congress has expressly authorized the fcc to do what petitioners urge it can not suspend petitioners tariffs upon their filing,subject petitioners to an accounting order to track revenue earned under the tariffs,and determine at a later date whether petitioners tariffs contain just and reasonable rates.a.we conclude that the commission reasonably applied its authority,see global naps,fcc,under a in rejecting petitioners suspended tariffs for failing to apply.
significant background is needed to understand the issue before us.prior to september,local telephone companies local exchange carriers or lecs were subject to regulation in setting prices for interstate carriers to access their local telephone networks.annual access tariff filings annual access tariff filings,wl the tariff order.as we explained in national rural telecom ass fcc,
r regulation is based directly on cost.firms so regulated can charge rates no higher than necessary to obtain sufficient revenue to cover their costs and achieve a fair return on equity.as one virtue of perfect competition is that it drives prices down to cost,regulation seems on its face a promising way to regulate natural monopolies,in principle roughly duplicating the benefits of competition.
id.at quotation marks and internal citations omitted.under regulation,if an lec earned more than was permitted by the regulated rate,the company was required to refund those to its ratepayers.price cap regulation of local exch.carriers,wl proposed july,nprm.the commission required lecs to treat refund payments as adjustments to the period in which the overearnings occurred,rather than to the period in which the refund is paid.id.thus,lecs the amount of any refund for prior excess earnings into the total earnings used to compute the rate of return for the current earnings period.tariff order,at.the reason for requiring was simple for regulation to work,a current earnings period needed to reflect current earnings and not be distorted by refunds paid in the current period for past overcharges.provide d a clear picture of current earnings for the reporting period by allowing the commission to determine whether an access category being adjusted through a refund is earning above its adjusted maximum rate of return in the monitoring period.amendment of part,interstate rate of return prescription.
in september,the commission replaced regulation for the largest lecs with price cap regulation.tariff order,at.under the price cap regime,the regulator sets a maximum price,and the firm selects rates at or below the cap.because cost savings do not trigger reductions in the cap,the firm has a powerful profit incentive to reduce costs.rural telecom,at.price cap regulation is intended to provide better incentives to the carriers than rate of return regulation,because the carriers have an opportunity to earn greater profits if they succeed in reducing costs and becoming more efficient.bell atl.fcc.the commission had to address three basic questions in setting up price cap regulation what initial price caps should be how to address inflation in future years and how to account for the lecs future efficiency and innovation.the commission answered the first question by cho osing existing rates,the second question by selecting an escalator based on general price inflation,and the third by providing for an annual percentage reduction to the price caps for expected savings from innovation and other economies.rural telecom,at citing policy and rules concerning rates for dominant carriers,second report and order,wl lec price cap order.at issue here is this third determination the percentage reduction applied to price cap indices pcis annually,known as a productivity factor or.
the commission sought to create a productivity factor that would generate lower rates for customers while offering lecs a fair opportunity to earn higher profits.lec price cap order,at.but the commission believed that it would be difficult to determine a single,productivity offset that will be perfectly accurate for the industry as a whole or for individual lecs or market conditions at a given time.id.accordingly,the commission adopted two mechanisms to prevent an imperfect productivity factor,one that does not accurately represent efficiency gains or losses from distorting customer rates or the lecs profits.under its sharing plan mechanism,the commission required participating lecs to share their earnings above a certain level with their interstate access customers by lowering their price caps in the following year.lec price cap order,at.price cap lecs were allowed to choose one of two,which would dictate how much their rates would be lowered and the extent of their sharing obligation.specifically,
a price cap lec opting for an of percent and earning a rate of return above percent was required to share half of earnings above percent and all earnings above percent with its access customers.lec price cap order,at.for lecs that elected a more challenging percent,percent sharing began for rates of return above percent,and percent sharing began at rates of return above percent.lec price cap order,at.
tariff order,at thus,an lec that selected a percent would initially have to cut rates more than a competitor that selected a percent,but could keep a greater percentage of its earnings.alternatively,a adjustment mechanism permitted price cap lecs earning less than percent in a particular year to adjust their pcis and rates upward in the following year to a level that would have allowed them to achieve an earnings rate of at least percent for the year in which they.id.at.
sharing and adjustments were first applied to the lecs access tariffs.some lecs had to lower their price caps based upon earnings,while others were permitted to increase price caps for.one year later,those adjustments raised an issue not addressed by the commission in promulgating its price cap plan what effect should the adjustments made to price caps based upon over or from have in calculating the rates of return for and thereby determining the rates to be charged for in calculating the rates to be charged for,lecs had to determine whether to add back the adjustment made to rates for in calculating the rate of return for,as occurred prior to price cap regulation or to calculate the rate of return for without considering the effect of sharing or adjustments made because of earnings from.perhaps not surprisingly,lecs that could achieve higher rates for by applying chose to apply,and lecs that could achieve higher rates for by not applying chose not to apply.thus,each lec took the position on that would allow it to maximize its price caps for.see id.at.
this selective use of an accounting rule by the lecs did not go unnoticed by the commission.the commission initiated a rulemaking regarding,proposing that its price cap regime include a specific rule mandating.see nprm,at.soon thereafter,noting that the issue was unresolved and pending in the rulemaking proceeding,the commission suspended tariffs for one day,issued an accounting order,and set for investigation all access tariffs for carriers that benefitted from a adjustment or were subject to sharing for.when price cap lecs filed tariffs,the commission suspended those rates as well,issued an accounting order,and broadened the scope of the investigation to include tariffs.
a.the rulemaking.
in the nprm,the commission indicated that no commenters in the lec price cap rulemaking or in the subsequent reconsideration proceeding discussed the details of rate of return calculations,or requested that it eliminate from the rate of return calculations of the lec price cap plan.id.at.the commission,h owever,recognize d that this issue was neither expressly discussed in the lec price cap orders nor clearly addressed in its rules.id.at.the commission believe d that continue d to be an appropriate and indeed probably necessary component of the backstop.id.at.because t he amounts of sharing or lower formula adjustment implemented in one year relate to productivity performance in a prior year,unless occurs,the relationship between rate of return and productivity growth becomes hidden.id.furthermore,an unadjusted rate of return effectively the amount of the backstop adjustment,once in the base year and then again in the tariff year.id.at.finally,without,the commission believed that the effective rate of return for lecs over time could fall outside the range of returns it judged to be reasonable.id.at.
after receiving and addressing comments,the commission adopted a new regulation that explicitly required under its price cap rules.see price cap regulation of local exch.carriers,the rulemaking order.the rulemaking order noted that the commission price cap rules had not specif ied the manner in which these sharing and adjustments should be treated by the lecs in computing their interstate earnings for the year in which the sharing or adjustment is effected,id.at,and indicated that in adopting the lec price cap order,the commission did not state that it intended to eliminate the requirement under regulation that carriers subtract revenues reflecting earnings for purposes of calculating current year earnings,id.at.according to the commission,the issue of how to treat these adjustments did not arise until,the first year that price caps would be based upon prices that were previously subjected to adjustments.see id.at.absent explicit guidance on from the commission in the price cap context,the commission noted again that lecs had taken divergent approaches on whether to apply this accounting rule.see id.at.after a lengthy analysis,the commission concluded that adding back a sharing adjustment ensures that the earnings thresholds applied to determine price cap lecs sharing obligations are those the commission intended when it adopted the price cap plan,id.at,and that adding back any adjustment was also necessary for essentially the same reason,see id.at.
several parties petitioned for review of the rulemaking order in this court,arguing that the requirement is arbitrary and capricious because it requires carriers to recognize phantom earnings and because it requires carriers to share more than the original price cap rules intended.bell,at.we rejected those arguments and held that the commission reasonably applied,noting that provides useful information about the carrier productivity because it reflects what the carrier could have earned but for the sharing obligation.id.at.the commission also reasonably determined that resulted in the right level of sharing,and was a necessary part of the sharing mechanism.id.we also rejected petitioners argument that adopting an rule would result in retroactive rulemaking.we noted that t he sharing rules do not regulate past transactions they regulate future rates and the rule does not change the past legal consequences of carriers decisions to choose the percent rather than the percent because t he state of the law has never been clear,and the issue has been disputed since it first arose in,meaning that the rule does not upset reasonable reliance interests.id.at.
b.the and tariff suspension proceedings.
five days after initiating notice and comment proceedings,the commission entered its order suspending and opening an investigation of tariffs for lecs that benefitted from a adjustment or were subject to sharing in,annual access tariff filings,wl common carrier bureau,and,as noted,took the same approach to tariffs,annual access tariff filings,wl common carrier bureau.for both matters the and investigations,the commission entered an accounting order,so that the lecs access charges for and could be tracked and refunds could be ordered if those tariffs were found to be unlawful.
both suspension orders noted the commission pending rulemaking on the issue,but did not specify any timetable for when the and investigations would be completed.even after the rulemaking order was released in,and after this court in bell atlantic rejected in the challenges of various lecs to the rulemaking order,the commission was silent about the and investigations.finally,in,the commission issued an order seeking comments to refresh a record that,due to passage of time and several mergers and acquisitions among the interested parties,may have now grown stale.further comment requested on the appropriate treatment of sharing and adjustments,wl.on july,pursuant to its authority under a to determine whether a regulated tariff contained just and reasonable rates,see b,the commission released an order determining that tariffs of lecs which were subject to a sharing or adjustment in were just and reasonable if they applied,and that tariffs of lecs which were subject to a sharing or adjustment in were not just and reasonable if they had not applied.tariff order,at.the commission reached the same determination with respect to tariffs.id.the commission left open the question of refunds for any overcharges that resulted from the imposition of unjust and unreasonable rates,concluding that it would hold further proceedings on the scope of any refunds.see id.at after reviewing the recalculations and refund plans submitted in response to this order,and replies received on these recalculations and refund plans,we will,as appropriate,approve,disapprove,or order modification of the filed recalculations and refund plans.two lecs that participated in the proceedings that led to the tariff order,verizon communications and its various subsidiaries verizon and bellsouth corporation bellsouth,filed these timely petitions for review of the tariff order.
even where the parties assure us that we have jurisdiction over a case,we have an independent obligation to be certain.midwest indep.transmission.operator,ferc,citing steel citizens for a better env t,d.petitioners assert that we have jurisdiction to review their challenge to the tariff order pursuant to a and,which the government does not dispute.section a provides that review shall be sought through the general petition process prescribed in.am.catholic educ.programming,fcc.section of the judicial review act confers on the court of appeals exclusive jurisdiction to enjoin,set aside,suspend in whole or in part,or to determine the validity of all final orders of the federal communications commission made reviewable by section a of title.am.ass of paging carriers fcc,quoting emphasis added.
as a applies only to final orders,am.catholic,at emphasis in original,some discussion is needed regarding our jurisdiction to review the tariff order when that order contemplates further proceedings regarding refunds that petitioners may or may not have to,when that order does not appear to be final.u nder a principle of finality,when a tribunal elects to resolve the issue of liability in a particular action while reserving its determination of damages on that liability,that decision generally is not considered final for purposes of judicial review.verizon.fcc.this basic understanding of finality is the norm not only in civil litigation,but also in the administrative context,at least where the relevant statute does not embrace a view of finality.id.although the tariff order determined that petitioners and tariffs were unlawful,the commission made clear that proceedings would continue regarding what refunds would occur,what liability petitioners would have.
as we recognized in verizon,however,this norm of finality may be supplanted by statute.id.at holding,despite the pendency of future proceedings to determine damages,the commission determination that lecs had imposed unreasonable charges was final action subject to review per b.the same is true here the tariff order completed the commission hearing and decision regarding the lawfulness of the lec tariffs,id.a,making it a final order over which we may exercise jurisdiction under a c any order concluding a hearing under this section shall be a final order and may be appealed under section a of this title.thus,we have jurisdiction to review the lecs challenge to the commission lawfulness conclusion in the tariff order.
section b of the communications act the act,b,provides that charges for interstate or foreign communications shall be just and reasonable.see bell,at.section a of the act,a,directs that w henever there is filed with the commission any new or revised charge,the commission may investigate the lawfulness of the charge and immediately suspend the operation of such charge for a period of up to five months beyond the time when the charge would otherwise go into effect.if the commission hearing has not been concluded,the act allows the the proposed new or revised charge to go into effect after five months,but the commission may require a carrier to keep accurate account of all amounts received under the potentially unlawful charge,order an accounting.id.in determining whether a new or revised charge is lawful under a,the act provides that the burden of proof shall be upon the carrier.id.
section b also authorizes the commission to prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary in the public interest to carry out the provisions of this chapter.the commission did just that in when promulgating its rule through the rulemaking order.concerned that w ithout,the of backstop adjustments could effectively permit earnings outside the range of reasonableness we designated,nprm,at,the commission concluded that the adjustment is a necessary element of the sharing and adjustment mechanisms.rulemaking order,at.the commission expressly relied upon,inter alia,its authority under and in promulgating its rule.id.at.after it did so in,carriers knew with certainty that rates in future tariffs would have to be calculated with in order to be considered just and reasonable under both statutes.
with respect to petitioners suspended and tariffs,the commission acted pursuant to those very same statutes in attempting to determine whether just and reasonable rates can be achieved pursuant to the requirements of section of the act and the lec price cap order if is not required.tariff order,at citing.thus,the commission applied the same statutes and just and reasonable statutory standard that it applied in promulgating its regulation.petitioners recognize,as they must,that this court in bell atlantic resolved a myriad of challenges to the reasonableness of the concept 
petitioners claim that the requirement is arbitrary and capricious because it requires carriers to recognize phantom earnings and because it requires carriers to share more than the original price cap rules intended.neither of these objections strikes us as persuasive.
the commission uses earnings as a proxy for measuring a carrier productivity the rule maintains the link between productivity and earnings.that the carrier did not actually earn the amount is beside the point.the amount provides useful information about the carrier productivity because it reflects what the carrier could have earned but for the sharing obligation.
the commission recognized that the carrier would have to continue sharing year after year,but thought this made sense.as the commission saw it,the rule does not create a ripple effect.it erases the ripple effect of the sharing mechanism the commission found that resulted in the right level of sharing,and that it was a necessary part of the sharing mechanism.petitioners offer no basis for overturning that decision.they simply argue that the requirement requires them to share too much.the commission reasonably decided otherwise.
at.of bell atlantic,petitioners make no challenge to the concept of they do not argue that is inherently unreasonable,nor do they contend that it is in any way arbitrary in light of other aspects of the commission price cap system of regulation.instead,petitioners present a narrow challenge,contending that the commission refusal to accept their and tariffs absent meant that the commission impermissibly applie d the rule retroactively.
petitioners discuss the rulemaking order throughout their brief.petitioners central claim is that the commission decision to require during these tariff suspension proceedings has the same effect as retroactively applying the rulemaking order.in petitioners view,the rulemaking order conceded that the commission was changing the applicable law the fcc understanding that it was creating a new legal obligation in is fundamentally incompatible with its newfound and opportunistic belief that was always required under the requirement of section.
the petitioners resort to the rulemaking in making their retroactivity argument is,in large measure,a red herring.while petitioners view the commission examination of whether was required for just and reasonable rates under section as newfound and opportunistic,the communications act requires the fcc to determine whether petitioners have met their burden of showing that the and tariffs contained just and reasonable rates.see b all charges shall be just and reasonable,and any such charge that is unjust or unreasonable is declared to be unlawful id.a whenever there is filed with the commission any new or revised charge,the commission may enter upon a hearing concerning the lawfulness thereof t he burden of proof to show that the new or revised charge,or proposed charge,is just and reasonable shall be upon the carrier.because the commission did not resolve the and tariff proceedings in a manner modeling administrative nimbleness,issuing the tariff order eleven years after those proceedings began,it is true that petitioners had the benefit of seeing that the commission would eventually promulgate a legislative rule that,according to the commission,clarif ied whether regulation required.see rulemaking order,at.but agencies routinely adopt rules through notice and comment that are consistent with their prior administrative proceedings.indeed,an agency acting consistently with its prior actions is generally what makes an agency action not arbitrary,although such an action may still be unlawful for other reasons.treasury employees union fed.labor relations,the authority failure to follow its own precedent without explanation is the very essence of arbitrariness.williams field servs.group,ferc,because ferc decision is consistent with its precedent and,we uphold it.petitioners argument that the commission retroactively employed an accounting concept in rejecting their tariffs under turns not upon the commission later consistent rulemaking proceeding,but upon whether the commission lawfully acted within the scope of in rejecting petitioners tariffs,without raising retroactivity concerns.
suspension,accounting,and refunds under a.
petitioners argue that applying to their suspended tariffs impose s new substantive obligations that had not previously existed,penalizes lecs for reasonable choices they made without any rule or agency guidance as to whether was required,and impermissibly results in finding the and tariffs unlawful even though they did not violate some legal rule in place at the relevant time.these retroactivity arguments ignore the elephant in the room the suspension,accounting,and refund process authorized by a,pursuant to which the commission acted,and its place in the ratemaking process.
as we have previously summarized 
under section of the act,carriers initiate the ratemaking process by filing tariffs which may take effect after prescribed notice periods.the fcc may reject a tariff outright if it is patently unlawful.alternatively,the commission may set the rates for investigation and hearing.a.
in addition,the commission may suspend the effective date of a filed tariff for a period of up to five months.after the period has elapsed,the rates become effective,and a customer is obliged to pay at the designated rate.in the event the rates are later found unlawful,the commission may require the carrier to effect a re
