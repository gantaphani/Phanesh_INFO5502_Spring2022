background 
antidumping duty determinations,liquidation instructions,and liquidation 
this appeal requires careful distinction between the different challenges that an importer may bring against the united states in connection with the determination and assessment of antidumping duties.accordingly,a brief review of the relevant legal framework is useful before we approach shinyei case.
to protect domestic industries from unfair competition by imported products,united states law imposes a duty on dumped goods,that is,goods sold in this country at a price lower than they sell for in their home market.united states.if commerce determines that a particular good is being dumped,and if the international trade commission also determines that the dumping has injured or threatens to injure a domestic industry,then commerce issues an antidumping order,imposing a duty on the good equal to the difference between the foreign market value of the good and its united states price.zenith elecs.united states.
when an importer enters goods covered by an antidumping order,the importer generally must make a cash deposit of estimated antidumping duties.see a.the final amount owed by the importer is not fixed,however,until the entry is liquidated.see liquidation means the final computation or ascertainment of the duties not including vessel repair duties or drawback accruing on an entry.the final amount may vary from the amount deposited,because an interested party may request an administrative review of commerce antidumping order before liquidation occurs.see see also consol.bearings united states.certain interested parties may also challenge commerce antidumping duty determinations in the court of international trade,and liquidation may be enjoined pending the outcome of an administrative review and litigation.see c.
typically,once commerce has finished its administrative review determination and once any litigation under section has concluded,commerce will send instructions to the united states bureau of customs and border protection customs to liquidate the entries made during the period of review covered by the determination.because the tariff act provides that the final determination shall be the basis for the assessment of antidumping duties on entries of merchandise covered by the determination,a c,commerce liquidation instructions must correctly reflect the final administrative review determination so that the determination is the basis for the assessment at liquidation if commerce instructions are inaccurate or incorrect,customs will liquidate the entries according to the improper instructions and the determination will not be the basis for the assessment of duties.i,at.if an importer believes that the liquidation instructions issued by commerce to customs do not correctly reflect the final determination,the importer may challenge those instructions in the court of international trade under the administrative procedure act apa.see consol.bearings,at.
once customs receives liquidation instructions from unless liquidation is will actually liquidate the entries made during the review period covered by commerce determination,collect ing any increased duties due or refund ing any excess of the estimated duties deposited on entry.wolff shoe united states.by statute,customs must complete liquidation of an entry within certain time limits.if customs fails to do so,the entry is deemed liquidated,liquidated by operation of law,at the amount of duties deposited upon entry,without any increase or decrease from the estimated duties.id.citing.an importer who believes that customs has erred in liquidating the importer entries for example,by collecting higher duties than were actually due may file an administrative protest with customs after liquidation.see.if customs denies the protest,the importer may contest the denial in the court of international trade.see a.
keeping in mind this framework,and the distinctions between and among a challenge to commerce antidumping duty determination under,a challenge to commerce liquidation instructions under the apa,and a challenge to customs denial of a liquidation protest brought under and,we now turn to shinyei case.
relevant facts and procedural history 
a detailed discussion of the facts giving rise to this litigation and leading up to shinyei first appeal appears in our opinion in i,at.we presume familiarity with that opinion,but briefly review this earlier history before turning to subsequent developments.
shinyei enters ball bearings from japan 
commerce issued an antidumping order on ball bearings from japan in.antidumping duty orders ball bearings,cylindrical roller bearings,and spherical plain bearings,and parts thereof from japan.may.during the second administrative review period,from may,to april,shinyei imported and entered ball bearings from japan,making about entries and paying antidumping duty deposits at the rate of ad valorem.
in,commerce published final results of the review for the second administrative review period,which ordinarily would have been followed by liquidation of the entries made during that period.antifriction bearings other than tapered roller bearings and parts thereof from france et final results of antidumping duty administrative reviews.june.but commerce review results were challenged by importers not including shinyei in the court of international trade,and that court preliminarily enjoined liquidation of entries made during the second administrative review period including shinyei entries pending a final court decision.see fed.mogul united states.int l trade july,issuing a preliminary injunction.
a final court decision did not come until,when we affirmed commerce review results as they had been amended in the interim.see torrington united states.on february,commerce published notice of the final torrington decision and of the review results amended review results in the federal register.antifriction bearings other than tapered roller bearings and parts thereof from france,et amended final results of antidumping duty administrative reviews.also in,commerce issued instructions to customs to liquidate entries made during the review period at the final antidumping rates set by the amended review results the liquidation instructions.
because these final antidumping duty rates were substantially lower than the ad valorem rate at which shinyei had deposited duties in,shinyei stood to receive a refund for each of its entries that customs would liquidate pursuant to commerce liquidation instructions.but for reasons that are not,exactly what happened and why are the very questions of the merits that the court of international trade has twice declined to liquidation instructions covered some but not all of shinyei entries of ball bearings,and customs actually liquidated only those entries covered by the liquidation instructions.as discussed below,the remaining entries were deemed,were liquidated by operation of august of,though at that time it may not have been clear that deemed liquidation had occurred.
shinyei files suit in the court of international trade 
on march,shinyei filed suit against the united states in the court of international trade in case the case,asserting two claims in the alternative.in one claim,shinyei challenged commerce liquidation instructions under the apa,alleging that by failing to include all of shinyei entries in those instructions,commerce had acted contrary to the requirement of a c that commerce antidumping duty determination shall be the basis for the assessment of antidumping duties on entries of merchandise covered by the determination.in the alternative claim,shinyei challenged customs failure to actually liquidate,alleging that commerce liquidation instructions had indeed covered all of shinyei entries from the period,and seeking a writ of mandamus to direct customs to actually liquidate the disputed entries at the relatively low final antidumping rates.
on august,while shinyei case was pending,commerce issued clean up liquidation instructions to customs,directing customs to liquidate any remaining unliquidated entries of ball bearings from the review period at the deposit rate.customs then actually liquidated shinyei remaining entries from that period,at the deposit rate,per the clean up instructions.in response,shinyei filed an amended complaint in the case,withdrawing its request for a writ of mandamus to force liquidation,but maintaining its claim that commerce had erred,and seeking reliquidation at the final antidumping rates.shinyei also filed protests of the actual liquidations with customs under a customs later denied many of those protests,and shinyei sought judicial review in the court of international trade in case,and collectively,the cases.
the court of international trade dismisses shinyei case 
in,the united states moved to dismiss shinyei complaint in the case.the united states argued that because customs had actually liquidated shinyei entries under the clean up instructions,the actual liquidation was final and conclusive,and prevented the court from assuming or maintaining jurisdiction over shinyei apa claim.alternatively,the united states argued,shinyei entries were deemed liquidated,pursuant to d,on august,months after commerce published notice of the amended review the deemed liquidation was final and conclusive,precluding judicial review of shinyei apa claim.
on february,the court of international trade granted the united states motion to dismiss.shinyei of am.united states,d i.relying on cases interpreting our holding in zenith radio united states,the court held that shinyei claim and the relief requested became moot as a result of customs actual liquidation of the entries at issue,depriving the court of subject matter jurisdiction.i,d at.notably,the court of international trade did not consider the united states argument about deemed liquidations.see i,d at the court does not reach the issue of deemed liquidations of the entries at issue since both defendant and shinyei agree that the entries at issue were in fact liquidated.
we reverse and remand for further proceedings 
shinyei appealed the court of international trade dismissal of the case for lack of jurisdiction,and on january,we reversed.see i,at.we reviewed our earlier statement in zenith radio that once liquidation occurs,a subsequent decision by the trial court on the merits of zenith challenge to commerce determination of a duty rate under section of the tariff act can have no effect on the dumping duties assessed on zenith entries,at,and we explained that this holding was explicitly based on the liquidation and injunction provisions in section.i,at 
here,since shinyei did not challenge commerce duty determination under section of the tariff act,but rather challenged commerce liquidation instructions as inconsistent with an antidumping duty determination that shinyei conceded to be correct,we explained that our holding in zenith radio was simply inapplicable.see id.a challenge to commerce instructions on the ground that they do not correctly implement the published,amended administrative review results,is not an action defined under section of the tariff act quoting consol.bearings,at see also mukand int l,united states,o ur recent decision in i makes clear that the effect of liquidation under the injunction and liquidation provisions of section does not divest the court of international trade of section i jurisdiction over an otherwise proper action for reliquidation.
we held in i that despite customs actual liquidation of shinyei entries pursuant to commerce instructions,the court of international trade retained jurisdiction over shinyei case under i,the court jurisdictional provision,covering challenges to commerce administration and enforcement of duty laws.at.we also held that shinyei had a cause of action under the apa and that nothing in the trade laws precluded the relief requested by shinyei for commerce alleged instructions from commerce to customs to reliquidate shinyei entries.remanding the case,we wrote that t he court of international trade must reach the merits of shinyei case to determine if shinyei is indeed entitled to the requested relief.id.at.
notably,we declined to reach the issue of deemed liquidation,because the trial court had not decided the issue and because the parties concede d that the subject entries were actually liquidated.id.at.also of note,we explained that because shinyei filed the case before actual liquidation of its entries,the trial court was incorrect to refer to shinyei as a party who sleep s on their rights and permit s liquidation to occur.id.at quoting i,d at.
the court of international trade consolidates and again dismisses 
on remand,the court of international trade consolidated shinyei case with shinyei three cases.the united states defended against the consolidated case on the previously adjudicated by either the trial court or this shinyei entries were deemed liquidated on august,and that this deemed liquidation was final and conclusive,precluding shinyei from thereafter claiming commerce or customs error in connection with the liquidated entries.in may of,shinyei filed a motion for partial summary judgment to dispose of this defense,agreeing that its entries were deemed liquidated in before they were actually liquidated beginning in,but arguing that the deemed liquidation was no more final or conclusive than an actual liquidation as against shinyei claims.the united states opposed shinyei motion and filed a for summary judgment on the basis of the defense.
on april,the court of international trade ruled on the for summary judgment,denying shinyei motion and granting summary judgment to the united states.shinyei of am.united states,d,ii.despite having previously declined to consider the issue and instead having held the actual liquidations effective,the court now changed course,holding that because shinyei entries were deemed liquidated by operation of law,the final duty owed by shinyei was the rate and amount of duty deposited at the time of entry or withdrawal from warehouse,not the rate of duty determined by the administrative review.id.at emphasis in original.concluding that the deemed liquidation was final,the court held that the deemed liquidation statute thus precluded review of shinyei apa claim regarding commerce liquidation instructions.
the court also dismissed shinyei claims of customs error,on the ground that shinyei failed to file a timely administrative protest of the august,deemed liquidation.over shinyei objection that customs was required to give shinyei notice of the deemed liquidation before the time to protest would commence,the court held that no such notice was required because i n the instant matter,customs was not aware of the deemed liquidation,and thereby could not post notice in the bulletin.id.further,in contrast to our statement in i that shinyei had not slept on its rights,the court of international trade noted on remand that it was particularly troubled by shinyei delay in seeking relief.ii,d at.the court explained that in its view,commerce february,announcement of the amended review results,published in the federal register,effectively put shinyei on notice that its entries would be deemed liquidated in six months at the deposit rate unless shinyei took action first.therefore,the court wrote,shinyei could have sought mandamus before august,to compel liquidation at the amended final review rates.id.
finally,the court of international trade granted summary judgment to the united states on a counterclaim,filed by the united states in one of the cases,seeking recovery of a refund customs had given shinyei upon granting one of shinyei protests in part.the court explained that because the entries in question had already been liquidated by operation of law,and at the duty rate deposited at the time of entry,over two years before customs had mistakenly actually liquidated the entries customs had erred in granting the refund to shinyei,and a s such,the government is entitled to recover the refund plus interest.id.at.

discussion 
standard of review 
we review the court of international trade grant of summary judgment de novo,including by deciding de novo the proper interpretation of governing statutes and regulations.orlando food united states,nec solutions am,united states.here,the court summary judgment depended on its holdings that,where an importer entry has been deemed liquidated under d,this statute precludes judicial review of the importer claim under the apa that commerce earlier liquidation instructions failed to comply with a c,and customs is not obligated to give the importer notice of the deemed liquidation if customs is not aware of the deemed liquidation.we review each of these holdings without deference,and explain why each was incorrect.
deemed liquidation and commerce error 
judicial review under the apa is precluded if any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.in i,we held that the liquidation of shinyei entries did not preclude judicial review of shinyei claim under the apa,because the tariff act does not expressly or impliedly forbid the relief sought by shinyei for erroneous liquidation,reliquidation of the subject entries at the lower rate so shinyei can receive a refund of the overpaid duties.at,explaining that reliquidation is the of the duties or drawback accruing on an entry.we acknowledged that the tariff act does not explicitly provide for this relief,but wrote that w e reject the united states suggestion that the statute silence as to reliquidation in the context of commerce error can be construed as a prohibition of reliquidation in such cases.i,at.
although in i we assumed that shinyei entries had been actually liquidated pursuant to commerce instructions,and we therefore did not consider the section of the tariff act concerning deemed liquidation,we now hold that nothing in the statute forbids the court of international trade from ordering reliquidation as a remedy for commerce failure to comply with a c in its liquidation instructions to customs.
the statute,was enacted in.see,a,stat.the prior law had been that customs might delay liquidation as long as it pleased,and with or without a formal suspension notice.ambassador div.of florsheim shoe united states.in ambassador,we noted that congress enacted the statute because of the uncertainty importers were being kept in,often for years,as to whether they might face further exactions,or when the refunds to which they might be entitled would be paid.wolff shoe,at internal citations omitted.thus,as we have explained,t he primary purpose of section was to increase certainty in the customs process for importers,surety companies,and other third parties with a potential liability relating to a customs transaction.int l trading united states,quoting united states.
here,the parties agree that shinyei entries were deemed liquidated in under subsection d of the deemed liquidation statute,which applies after liquidation has been suspended pending litigation.in this subsection read as follows.
except as provided in section a a,when a suspension required by statute or court order is removed,the customs service shall liquidate the entry within months after receiving notice of the removal from the department of commerce,other agency,or a court with jurisdiction over the entry.any entry not liquidated by the customs service within months after receiving such notice shall be treated as having been liquidated at the rate of duty,value,quantity,and amount of duty asserted at the time of entry by the importer of record.
this statute does not discuss reliquidation of an entry deemed is neither expressly provided for nor expressly prohibited.yet the court of international trade held that judicial review of shinyei apa claim was precluded by this section,reasoning that w hen courts have determined that entries were deemed liquidated under d,they have previously set aside customs actual liquidation and have treated the deemed liquidation as being final,and citing four cases in support of this proposition.ii,d at.
the cases relied on by the court of international trade,however,do not hold or suggest that entries deemed liquidated under section d may never be reliquidated,even where the deemed liquidation resulted from commerce error in issuing liquidation instructions.rather,these cases hold only that when an entry is deemed liquidated,the duty rate is the deposit rate,and customs may not recover additional duties from the importer thereafter.see nec solutions,at b ecause customs did not liquidate within six months,the entries should have been deemed liquidated,and thus nec is entitled to a refund of any additional duties imposed int l trading,at affirming holding of deemed liquidation itc the importer contend s that the entries should be deemed liquidated at the deposit rate.united states cherry hill textiles,in cases in which a liquidation has become final,the government can not seek to recover additional duties simply by making a new liquidation of the original entry.am.int l,united states,d,because customs did not liquidate the four entries at issue in this action within six months from the date customs received notice of the removal of the suspension of liquidation,the entries liquidated by operation of d at the zero rate of antidumping duty asserted by plaintiff at the time of entry,and plaintiff,therefore,is entitled to a refund skf usa,united states,s ection d mandates deemed liquidation at the cash deposit rate regardless of whether the cash deposit rate is higher or lower than the rate instructed by commerce.
indeed,we recently confirmed that u nder the statutory tariff scheme enacted by congress,the character of a deemed liquidation is procedural not substantive.koyo of united states.the deposit rate is the correct rate of duty assessed for a deemed liquidation under the procedures of d,but if it is adverse to the party being assessed the duties because it is contrary to the final review results then it is unlawful and has no substantive effect.id.at 
although the koyo case concerned a claim of customs error rather than commerce error,this core a deemed liquidation is unlawful and of no substantive effect if it is contrary to final review equally applicable in the context of shinyei apa claim.assuming that shinyei entries were covered by the amended review results,their deemed liquidation at the deposit rate was unlawful because that liquidation was contrary to the amended review results,which set forth lower duty rates than the deposit rate.see i,at if shinyei entries were indeed covered by the amended review results,as it claims,there was presumably an error somewhere in the process.if there was an error in the instruction process,then shinyei is entitled to a judgment ordering reliquidation pursuant to new,correct instructions.nothing in the statute forbids this relief on the facts as alleged.thus,regardless of whether the disputed entries
