in this case,we consider what statute of limitations applies when a county or city fails to act upon a claim for refund of property taxes within six months and the taxpayer elects under revenue and taxation code section,subdivision b to consider the claim rejected and bring an action in superior court.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the applicable statute of limitations is the period set forth in revenue and taxation code section,subdivision a,rather than the general statute of limitations set forth in code of civil procedure section applied by the court of appeal.
we also consider when the applicable statute of limitations begins to run.the court of appeal held that the limitations period begins to run on the first day the taxpayer could consider the claim rejected,six months after the claim for refund was filed.we disagree.as explained below,the limitations period begins to run when the county or city rejects the claim for refund in whole or in part or,if the public entity fails to act within six months,when the claimant elects to consider the claim rejected and bring an action for a tax refund.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeal.
on november,plaintiff geneva towers limited partnership submitted a claim for a refund of property taxes to defendant city and county of san francisco,asserting the assessed value of the apartment building it owned was too high and seeking a partial refund of the property taxes it paid for the tax years through.
more than seven years later,on january,plaintiff filed an action for a tax refund in superior court.in an amended complaint,plaintiff alleged that after it acquired the property in august,the of the city and county of san francisco set a new base year value for the property of.following hearings before the assessment appeals board,the base year value was reduced to.plaintiff apparently believed the assessed value should have been reduced further and alleged that it paid the taxes in dispute and filed a claim for refund pursuant to section of the revenue and taxation code,but no refund had been paid.the amended complaint does not state whether or when plaintiff claim for refund was denied.
defendant demurred,claiming that the action was barred by the statute of limitations,both under revenue and taxation code section,subdivision a,which provides that an action for a tax refund shall be commenced within six months from and after the date that the board of supervisors or city council rejects a claim for refund in whole or in part,and under code of civil procedure section,which provides that an action for which a limitation period is not otherwise provided,must be commenced within four years after the cause of action shall have accrued.
the superior court sustained defendant demurrer without leave to amend on the ground that the action was barred by the statute of limitations set forth in revenue and taxation code section,subdivision a.the court of appeal affirmed the judgment but disagreed with the trial court reasoning,holding instead that the action was barred by the statute of limitations set forth in code of civil procedure section which,according to the court of appeal,began to run on the first day plaintiff could have considered the claim rejected,six months after the claim for refund was filed.we granted review.
discussion 
revenue and taxation code section,subdivision a establishes a statute of limitations for an action for a property tax refund,stating that such an action shall be commenced within six months from and after the date that the board of supervisors or city council rejects a claim for refund in whole or in part.subdivision b of that statute establishes a different period,providing that if the board of supervisors or city council fails to mail notice of its action on a claim for refund within six months after the claim is filed,the claimant may,prior to mailing of notice by the board of supervisors or city council of its action on the claim,consider the claim rejected and bring an action under this article,subd.b.the statute thus permits,but does not require,a claimant to deem its claim denied if the county or city fails to give notice of its action within six months of the filing of the claim.estate of moore d.
section,subdivision b does not establish any limitation period within which the claimant must deem the claim denied if not acted upon.we agree with the court of appeal,therefore,that the present claim was not automatically deemed denied six months after it was filed,and the statute of limitations contained in section,subdivision a,which commences upon the board denial of a claim,was not triggered at that time.we disagree,however,with the court of appeal holding that the statute of limitations set forth in code of civil procedure section applies and begins to run six months after the claim was filed if the county or city fails to act upon a claim for refund within that time.
code of civil procedure section states an action for relief not hereinbefore provided for must be commenced within four years after the cause of action shall have accrued.it is a catchall provision that provides a statute of limitations in situations where no specific limitations period applies.stoll superior court th,d witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions.the legislature has specified the limitations applicable to a wide variety of actions,and then to rebut the possible inference that actions not therein specifically described are to be regarded as exempt from limitations,it has specified a limitation upon an action for relief not hereinbefore provided for bogart george porter,cal.
the court of appeal applied the catchall provision of code of civil procedure section in the present case because it concluded that the period set forth in section,subdivision a did not apply to lawsuits in which the claimant had considered the claim rejected under subdivision b of that statute.we disagree.
the statute of limitations set forth in section,subdivision a applies to all actions against cities and counties for property tax refunds.such actions are governed by section,which authorizes a taxpayer to bring an action to recover a tax which the board of supervisors of the county or the city council of the city has refused to refund on a claim filed pursuant to this chapter.the statute of limitation set forth in section,subdivision a applies to a n action brought under this article an action for a property tax refund is brought under that article whether the claim was rejected or the claimant elected to consider the claim rejected under section,subdivision b.section,subdivision a thus provides a specific statute of limitations for all actions for property tax refunds.accordingly,the catchall provision of code of civil procedure section does not apply.and the statute of limitations imposed by section,subdivision a,begins to run on the date that the board of supervisors or city council rejects a claim for refund in whole or in part.
accordingly,we reject defendant contention that the statute of limitations in the present case began to run six months after the claim was filed.see signal oil gas bradbury d.inasmuch as the question of the illegality of the taxes is in dispute,rejection of the claims must be made by the board before suit to recover can be maintained.it is true that under subdivision b of section,the claimant may consider the claim rejected and bring an action italics added if the board of supervisors or city council fails to mail notice of its action on a claim for refund within six months after the claim is filed,but the claimant is not required to do so.unless the claimant chooses to consider the claim rejected and files suit,the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the public entity denies the claim for refund.bunker county of orange th,d.
a considerable time ago,we confronted these same issues in the context of a similar statutory scheme.in bank of ukiah shoemake cal,we examined former code of civil procedure section stats,ch,amends.to codes,repealed by stats,ch,see now,which stated that the refusal or neglect to indorse or reject a claim against a decedent estate within days may,at the option of the claimant,be deemed equivalent to a rejection on the tenth day.former code of civil procedure section established the statute of limitations for rejected claims,stating when a claim is rejected,the holder must bring suit within three months after the date of its rejection stats,ch,amends.to codes repealed by stats,ch.we held in bank of ukiah that this period began to run only when the claim actually was rejected,and not when the claimant deemed the claim rejected the court is of opinion that the rejection referred to in section of the code of civil procedure,from the date of which the time for bringing an action on a rejected claim begins to run,is an actual rejection of the claim by the personal representative of a deceased person,and that it has no reference to the refusal by or neglect of the personal representative to indorse on the presented claim a refusal or rejection for ten days after the claim has been presented to him this clause permitting the claimant to deem a claim rejected after ten days is inserted only to enable the claimant to bring his action after the lapse of the tenth day if he so elect,on the occurrence of such neglect or refusal.but the period in which the action is barred does not commence to run in any event until after the actual rejection of the claim by an indorsement to that effect.it does not appear from the complaint that the claim has ever been actually rejected.we therefore think the action was commenced in time though it was brought more than three months after the deemed rejection.bank of ukiah,supra,cal.at.
in cowgill dinwiddie cal,we examined the same statutes at issue in bank of ukiah and observed that former code of civil procedure section permitted,but did not require,a claimant to consider a claim rejected if the claim was not indorsed as allowed within days if not so indorsed within ten days the refusal or neglect may at the option of the claimant be deemed equivalent to a rejection on the tenth day.as this is optional with the claimant,he need not so deem it unless he chooses.citation.a claimant may well suppose in many instances that his demand,although not allowed within ten days,will ultimately be approved,and hence that an action to establish its validity will be unnecessary.cowgill,supra,cal.at.the court in cowgill agreed with the contention that when the executor fails to avail himself of his privilege to accept or reject a claim in ten days after presentation,that the claimant may at any time thereafter elect to regard such as rejection,and it is only when he does so that the bar provided for by section is set in motion.id.at.
this result was just,the court explained,because t he representative of the estate always has it in his power to set the statute in motion by an early rejection of claims presented to him.if he fails to do so,it would seem hardly just to a claimant,who has not exercised his option at the end of ten days,to consider the claim rejected,to hold him to have set the statute in motion as of that date,when he afterwards brings an action on the claim.cowgill dinwiddie,supra,cal.at.
the court made clear that if a claim is not acted upon within days,a claimant may elect to consider a claim rejected at any time a claimant,who has not elected to consider his claim rejected upon the tenth day after presentation,may subsequently thereto,and at any time before official action by the executor or administrator thereon,elect at his option to consider his claim as rejected,and may,under section,bring an action thereon within three months thereafter cowgill dinwiddie,supra,cal.at,hinkel crowson.
in smith county of san mateo d,the court of appeal examined former political code section,which applied to claims against a county and provided if the board of supervisors refuse or neglect to allow or reject a claim or demand for ninety days after the same has been filed with the clerk,such refusal or neglect may,at the option of the claimant,be deemed equivalent to a final action and rejection on the ninetieth day,and a claimant dissatisfied with the rejection of his claim or demand,or with the amount allowed him on his account,may sue the county therefor at any time within six months after the final action of the board,but not afterward smith,supra,d at.the plaintiff filed a claim on september.ninety days after that date was december,and six months from that date was june.the plaintiff filed his complaint on june.the court of appeal held the complaint was timely filed,rejecting the defendant argument that the plaintiff election to treat the county failure to act as a rejection is necessarily an election to treat it as a rejection on the ninetieth day and that the six months time within which suit may be brought commences to run on the ninetieth day.id.at.relying upon our decisions in bank of ukiah and cowgill dinwiddie,the court of appeal observed that in both of these cases the court draws a distinction between actual rejection and deemed rejection and assumes that the deemed rejection took place at the date when the claimant exercised his option.smith,supra,d at.
but the court of appeal in state of pub.health imperial d,disagreed with the holding in smith county of san mateo,and adopted a different interpretation of former political code section.the court of appeal distinguished our decisions in bank of ukiah and cowgill dinwiddie on the basis that the language of former code of civil procedure section,which was at issue in those cases,differed significantly from the language of former political code section.the court noted that former political code section not only provides that a claimant may deem the failure of the board to act on a claim,presented as required by law,as equivalent to a final action and rejection on the ninetieth day,but it then further specifically provides that if dissatisfied the claimant may sue the county thereon at any time within six months after the final action of the board,but not afterward.state of pub.health imperial,supra,d at.the court concluded that this language clearly and unambiguously gave the claimant only one option to consider the claim denied on the day no option is given him to consider the claim as having been rejected at any earlier or later date.ibid.
the basis used by the court of appeal in imperial to distinguish our holdings in bank of ukiah and cowgill dinwiddie does not apply in the present case.unlike former political code section at issue in imperial,which stated that a deemed rejection of a claim was equivalent to a final action and rejection on the ninetieth day state of publ.health imperial,supra,d,italics added,the statute at issue here contains no such language and states instead that the claimant may,prior to mailing of notice by the board of supervisors or city council of its action on the claim,consider the claim rejected and bring an action under this article,subd.b.accordingly,the decision in state of pub.health imperial,supra,d,has no bearing on the resolution of the present case.
also instructive is the decision in hochfelder county of los angeles d.on may,hochfelder filed a claim for damages with the los angeles county board of supervisors.nearly a year later,the board denied the claim on april.hochfelder filed suit less than a month later on may.the county asserted the suit was barred by the statute of limitations imposed by code of civil procedure section and government code section because the claim had been denied by operation of law days after it was filed under former government code section,which stated if the board refuses or neglects to allow or reject a claim for days after it is filed with the clerk,the claimant may treat the refusal or neglect as final action and rejection on the ninetieth day.stats,ch,repealed by stats,ch.
los angeles county reasoned that hochfelder claim had been denied by operation of law on the day after it was filed and the county subsequent formal rejection of the claim was a nugatory act.the court of appeal rejected this argument,noting that the statute permits the claimant to treat the board failure to act within days as a rejection of the claim,b
