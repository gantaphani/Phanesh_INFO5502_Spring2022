the commissioner of internal revenue commissioner appeals the decision of the united states tax court joseph robert goeke,holding that the diebold foundation,diebold,could not be held liable as a transferee of a transferee under.as an initial matter,we conclude that the standard of review for mixed questions of law and fact in a case on review from the tax court is the same as that for a case on review after a bench trial from the district court de novo to the extent that the alleged error is in the misunderstanding of a legal standard and clear error to the extent the alleged error is in a factual determination.see a.on the merits,we hold that the two requirements of transferee status and liability are separate and independent inquiries,one procedural and governed by federal law,and the other substantive and governed by state law.we further hold that,under the new york uniform fraudulent conveyance act,the applicable state statute,the series of transactions at issue collapse based upon the constructive knowledge of the parties involved.the case is remanded to the tax court to determine in the first instance whether diebold is a transferee of a transferee under and whether the statute of limitations of c,which applies transferee of transferee liability,or the statute of limitations of e a,which applies to collection when substantial omissions are made from the report of gross income,governs.we thus vacate the decision of the tax court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
this case involves shareholders who owned stock in a c corporation c corp,which in turn held appreciated property.upon the disposition of appreciated property,taxpayers generally owe tax on the property gain that is,the difference between the amount realized from the disposition of the property and its adjusted basis.h.a c corp,a corporation governed by subchapter c of the internal revenue code,eisenberg comm r,cir,is treated as a separate legal entity for tax purposes.c corps are also subject to tax on gain.see.
when shareholders who own stock in a c corp that in turn holds appreciated property wish to dispose of the c corp,they can do so through one of two transactions an asset sale or a stock sale.in an asset sale,the shareholders cause the c corp to sell the appreciated property triggering the gain tax,and then distribute the remaining proceeds to the shareholders in a stock sale,the shareholders sell the c corp stock to a third party.the c corp continues to own the appreciated assets and the gain tax is not triggered.in other words,in an asset sale,because c corps are treated as separate legal entities for tax purposes,subject to corporate tax independent of any capital gain taxes assessed against the earning shareholders,a c corp sale of its assets imposes an additional tax liability.while the c corp,and not the shareholders,pays this tax liability,such payment nonetheless reduces the amount of cash available for distribution to those shareholders.
in the case of a stock sale,the assets remain owned by the c corp and the tax on the gain is not triggered.buyers would generally prefer to purchase the assets directly and receive a new basis equal to the purchase price,thus eliminating the gain.sellers generally disfavor the sale of assets because of the attendant tax liability and would prefer to sell the stock and move the tax liability on to the purchaser.however,the seller preferred transaction merely pushes the tax liability down the line at any point when the shareholders of the c corp including new owners who purchased the shares in a stock sale wish to sell the assets,the gain tax will be triggered.because of this accompanying tax liability,a stock sale will generally merit a lower sale price than an asset sale.
midco transactions or intermediary transactions are structured to allow the parties to have it both ways letting the seller engage in a stock sale and the buyer engage in an asset purchase.in such a transaction,the selling shareholders sell their c corp stock to an intermediary entity or midco at a purchase price that does not discount for the gain tax liability,as a stock sale to the ultimate purchaser would.the midco then sells the assets of the c corp to the buyer,who gets a purchase price basis in the assets.the midco keeps the difference between the asset sale price and the stock purchase price as its fee.the midco willingness to allow both buyer and seller to avoid the tax consequences inherent in holding appreciated assets in a c corp is based on a claimed status or supposed tax attributes,such as losses,that allow it to absorb the gain tax liability.see notice.if these tax attributes of the midco prove to be artificial,then the tax liability created by the gain on the sold assets still needs to be paid.in many instances,the midco is a newly formed entity created for the sole purpose of facilitating such a transaction,without other income or assets and thus likely to be.the irs must then seek payment from the other parties involved in the transaction in order to satisfy the tax liability the transaction was created to avoid.
double d ranch,double d,a personal holding company,taxed as a c corp,had two shareholders the dorothy diebold marital trust marital trust and the diebold foundation diebold new york together,the shareholders.the trustees of the marital trust were the bessemer trust company bessemer,operating primarily through its senior vice president,austin power,dorothy diebold,and andrew bisset,diebold attorney and personal advisor.the directors of diebold new york were diebold,bisset,and the three adult diebold children.diebold new york held slightly more than of the shares of double d the rest were held by the marital trust.double d owned assets worth approximately million,including million in cash,million in real property,and million in publicly traded securities.included in these securities holdings were approximately million in shares of american home products corporation ahp stock the rest of the portfolio was made up of diversified holdings.the ahp stock,other securities,and the real property a farm in connecticut all had substantial gain,such that the sale of the assets would have triggered a tax liability of approximately million.
by,diebold and her three children were anxious for her to begin making cash gifts to them,but the marital trust was insufficiently liquid for her to make such gifts.the other trustees,power of bessemer and bisset,explained to diebold that the best way to make such gifts would be to sell the shares of double power knew that liquidating the assets of double d would incur the substantial tax consequences discussed above because of the low tax basis of the assets.power discussed with a whole network of people,for months,whether there were potential purchase r s for a corporation like double power engaged senior staff members at bessemer as well as lawyers in other trust companies,identifying the illiquidity of the trust and the attendant tax consequences as a problem,and asking,what the possible solution how do we sell this among those with whom power consulted was richard leder,an attorney at chadbourne parke and bessemer principal outside tax counsel.identifying the steep tax liability inherent in the assets held by double d,leder testified,it was generally known in that profession that there were some people,who for whatever reason,whatever their tax activities are,were able to make very favorable offers to sellers with stock with appreciated assets with the corporation having appreciated assets.leder directed power to one of these people in the form of harry zelnick of river run financial advisors,llc river run.power also sought out stephen baxley,a managing director at bessemer,who referred him to craig hoffman at fortrend international llc fortrend.
the trustees of the marital trust and the directors of diebold new york each decided that their respective entity would sell all of its double d stock.power was primarily responsible for implementing the decision to sell double on may,power,baxley,leder,and two other attorneys,acting as representatives of the shareholders,met with zelnick of river run and ari bergmann,a principal at sentinel advisors,llc sentinel,a small investment banking firm specializing in structuring economic transactions to solve specific corporate or estate or accounting issues.at this meeting,the shareholder representatives,zelnick,and bergmann discussed methods for valuing double d ahp stock and alternatives for dealing with the connecticut farm property whether to distribute that asset out of the corporation or to leave it in the corporation for the buyer to sell.they also discussed the possibility of leaving the shareholders with an option to buy the farm.sentinel gave the shareholders a slideshow presentation of the possibilities for selling and valuing double d,which bergmann subsequently sent to the shareholder representatives for their reference shortly after this meeting,dudley diebold,one of diebold adult children who was a director of diebold new york,founded toplands farm,llc toplands farm to purchase the connecticut farm property from double 
several days after the meeting with river run and sentinel,the shareholder representatives met with craig hoffman and howard teig of fortrend to discuss the sale of double d.according to leder,tax attorney to the bessemer trust,he was familiar with fortrend because he had represented a seller of stock in another transaction where the buyer had arranged to have fortrend participate in the purchase.fortrend provided bessemer with a firm profile that detailed its strategy entitled the buy assets transaction.identifying the tax liabilities endemic to selling a corporation with appreciated assets,fortrend presented its expertise as follows we are working with various clients who may be willing to buy the stock from the seller and then cause the target corporation to sell its net assets to the ultimate buyer.these clients have certain tax attributes that enable them to absorb the tax gain inherent in the assets.
the shareholder representatives chose to pursue the transaction with sentinel instead of with fortrend,and sentinel sent them an initial term sheet,laying out the preliminary details of the transaction,on june.sentinel intended to use a newly formed entity,shap acquisition corporation ii shap ii,specifically created to carry out the transaction.power informed the shareholders that sentinel would purchase all of the shares of double d,from both the marital trust and from diebold new york,for a price that works out to of the market value of the corporation assets.had the shareholders sold the assets directly,the tax liability would have caused the shareholders to realize an amount that worked out to approximately of the assets market value,a clear reduction from that negotiated with shap ii.on june,diebold approved of the sale and directed power to go forward with it.on june,shap ii and the shareholders executed a letter of intent and term sheet specifying that shap ii would purchase all issued and outstanding double d stock for cash in an amount equal to the value of double d assets minus a discount of of the gain 
sentinel intended to purchase the double d stock through shap ii with financing from rabobank.even prior to taking ownership of the double d stock,sentinel planned on having shap ii immediately sell double d securities portfolio,as it intended to use the proceeds of that sale to repay the loan from rabobank.rabobank provided financing on the condition that shap ii enter into a fixed price contract to sell the securities,with the purchase price to be paid directly to rabobank,pursuant to an irrevocable payment instruction.rabobank understood that the loan would be outstanding for not more than five business days,as that was the longest settlement period for the securities to be liquidated.sentinel determined that the securities would be sold to morgan stanley.
while it is not clear that the shareholders knew the details behind sentinel financing plan,the shareholder representatives did indeed have notice that shap ii planned to sell double d securities to morgan stanley,based upon the draft of the stock purchase agreement drawn up to execute the stock sale between the marital trust and diebold new york,on the one hand,and shap ii,on the other,which indicated that certain limitations within the agreement would not apply to sale arrangements shap ii already had with morgan stanley,held the selling shareholders liable for any costs incurred upon termination in connection with arrangements for the sale of the securities by double d following the closing,and indicated that the agreement prohibition on assignments of rights would not apply to shap ii assigning its rights to morgan stanley as collateral security for shap ii obligation to deliver the securities to morgan stanley following the closing for purposes of resale.these specific provisions were altered by the shareholders attorneys from chadbourne to make them far more general and to delete the references to morgan stanley.in their review of the purchasing agreement,the chadbourne lawyers also added further detailed provisions dealing with tax matters.these alterations included changing the responsibility of the selling shareholders for all taxes with respect to any tax period ending on or before the closing date,to making shap ii,the purchaser,liable for all taxes related to sale of double d assets,regardless of the date of the taxable period.the added provisions also made shap ii liable to the selling shareholders for related tax refunds and specified that any sale or other disposition of assets by double d that is consummated after the acquisition of the shares by shap ii shall be treated as occurring after the period ending on the closing date.
after these negotiations,shap ii and the shareholders executed their stock purchase agreement on june,setting a closing date of july.the agreement also required shap ii to cause double d to execute an option agreement on the connecticut farm immediately after the closing.this agreement was structured as one between double d and toplands farm,dudley diebold entity,giving toplands the option to purchase the farm for million.also on june,shap ii and morgan stanley entered into a contract wherein shap ii agreed to sell the securities held by double d to morgan stanley after the closing date.this agreement mandated the use of the exact same valuation method for the securities as did the agreement between shap ii and the selling shareholders.the agreement between morgan stanley and shap ii was slated to be executed on july,the same day for which the closing between shap ii and the shareholders was originally scheduled.
on june,dudley diebold,acting as manager of toplands farm,executed the option agreement to purchase double d connecticut real estate.the agreement,which was to then be executed by double d immediately after the closing,gave toplands farm the right to purchase through july.at the same time,dudley diebold executed an occupancy agreement that set forth terms allowing toplands farm to take possession of the property on july,including requirements that it maintain liability insurance and take responsibility for all utilities and taxes beginning on that date.
the closing between shap ii and double d was delayed from july,to july.as the closing did not occur as originally scheduled,shap ii could not transfer the securities to morgan stanley on july,as mandated by the agreement between shap ii and morgan stanley.by its terms,shap ii agreement with morgan stanley obligated shap ii to deliver equivalent securities or their cash equivalent to morgan stanley in the event the double d transaction did not occur on july.as it turned out,however,morgan stanley did not require this from shap ii.power contacted tim morris,the head of bessemer investment department,who contacted john mack,a very senior officer at morgan stanley.following morris call to mack,morgan stanley backed off from demanding securities or their cash equivalent from shap ii.shap ii and double d then closed,a day delayed from the originally set date.morgan stanley backed off by agreeing to change its settlement date with shap ii to july,the first business day after the july,closing date.thus,the two agreements one between double d and shap ii and the other between shap ii and morgan stanley were both amended to change their closing dates and the date on which the price for all shares would be set from july to july,while keeping the average pricing mechanism for the ahp shares the same as it had been in the original agreements.
on july,both parties to the stock sale of double d took steps to carry out the transaction.the selling shareholders opened an account at rabobank for the receipt of double d cash holdings.the marital trust,diebold new york,and bessemer executed an agreement with rabobank in which the bank agreed to waive any of its possible rights against the account.under such an agreement,rabobank could not apply any of the money from that account to satisfy shap ii obligation to pay its loan to the bank.also on july,in executing the closing,rabobank credited over million to shap ii account per the loan agreement,and shap ii paid million to the shareholders,with further adjustments to be paid shortly thereafter.the shareholders transferred their stock shares to shap ii,and bessemer wired double d cash holdings from the account at bessemer to the newly created account at rabobank.
on the same day,double d instructed bank of new york to transfer the securities in double d account to morgan stanley on july.this was an irrevocable transfer agreement between bessemer,double d,and shap ii to transfer custody of double d assets to shap ii morgan stanley account and to not honor any other request or instruction which would cause bessemer to be unable to make such a transfer.shap ii also directed morgan stanley to transfer over million into its loan account at rabobank on july and irrevocably instructed rabobank to its loan obligation with any amounts transferred into that account.
on july,bessemer and bank of new york delivered the securities in double d accounts to shap ii morgan stanley accounts.as to these transferred securities,which represented approximately of the total value of double d securities,morgan stanley recorded a trade date of july,and,with the exception of one security,a settlement date of july.also on july,morgan stanley wired over million from shap ii morgan stanley account to shap ii loan account at rabobank,and bessemer wired the funds transferred by shap ii pursuant to the closing to the marital trust and diebold new york,in proportion to the amount of stock in double d each owned.on july and,shap ii paid the shareholders the additional purchase price adjustments,bringing the total amount paid by shap ii to approximately million.bessemer distributed these funds to the marital trust and diebold new york on july.bessemer made an additional distribution of million to the selling shareholders on november.
also pursuant to the closing on july,the option agreement regarding the sale of the connecticut real estate was executed.toplands farm paid for the option to purchase.subsequently,toplands farm made a down payment to shap ii for the farm on july,and paid the purchase price in full on august.
the transaction described above had the form of a midco transaction with shap ii in the role of the midco.the shareholders sold the double d stock for approximately million in cash.morgan stanley and toplands farm purchased,respectively,double d securities and real property.shap ii received approximately million from the asset sale.because it claimed losses sufficient to offset the gain,it did not pay any tax on this amount.after paying back its loan to rabobank,it retained a profit of approximately million.
pursuant to a dissolution,effective on january,diebold new york distributed all of its assets in equal shares to three foundations,each one headed by one of the adult diebold children the diebold foundation diebold,appellee in the instant case,the salus mundi foundation,and the ceres foundation.these transfers,of approximately million each,were not made in exchange for any property or to satisfy an existing debt.on march and april,bessemer distributed an additional million from the escrow account used for the sale of double d to the marital trust and to each of the successor foundations of diebold new york.
the parties to this midco transaction all filed tax returns.the shareholders filed timely returns reflecting their sale of double d stock.double d filed a corporate return for a short taxable year,beginning july,and ending july,and dissolved.double d asset sales were not included in this return.on its tax return for the taxable year ending june,shap ii filed a consolidated return with double d,on which it reported all of double d gain from its asset sales.on this return,shap ii claimed sufficient losses to offset the gain,resulting in no net tax liability 
on march,the irs issued a notice of deficiency against double d,determining a deficiency of income tax,penalties,and interest of approximately million for its july,taxable year.the deficiency resulted from the irs determination that the shareholders sale of double d stock was,in substance,actually an asset sale followed by a liquidating distribution to the shareholders.double d did not contest this assessment,but the irs was unable to find any double d assets from which to collect the liability.
deciding that any additional efforts to collect from double d would be futile,the commissioner attempted to collect from the shareholders as transferees of double section of the internal revenue code authorizes the assessment of liability against both a transferees of a taxpayer who owes income tax and b transferees of transferees.a a i,c.on august,the irs issued a notice of transferee liability against diebold as a transferee of double d.the tax court determined that she was not liable because the marital trust was the actual double d shareholder,and the court saw no reason to ignore its separate existence.diebold comm r,cch,at.on july,the irs issued separate notices of transferee liability against each foundation for the approximately million each received from diebold new york the commissioner asserted that diebold new york was a transferee of double d and that the three successor foundations were,in turn,transferees of diebold new york.the foundations contested the notices of deficiency before the tax court,who consolidated their petitions for briefing and decision.the parties agreed to use the same evidence,including trial testimony,that was used in the earlier diebold comm r,cch.the tax court found in favor of the petitioners,holding in a memorandum opinion that diebold new york was not liable as a transferee of double d,and thus that diebold and the other successor foundations were not liable as transferees of a transferee.following its memorandum opinion,the tax court entered separate decisions in favor of each foundation.the irs now appeals.
discussion 
in an appeal from the tax court,it is without dispute in this circuit that we review legal conclusions de novo and findings of fact for clear error.robinson knife comm r,cir.while we have previously held the standard of review for mixed questions of law and fact to be one for clear error,see wright comm r,cir,all courts of appeals are to review the decisions of the tax court in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions tried without a jury.a.our case law enunciating the standard of review for mixed questions of law and fact in an appeal from the tax court is in direct tension with this statutory mandate.following a civil bench trial,we review a district court findings of fact for clear error,and its conclusions of law de novo resolutions of mixed questions of fact and law are reviewed de novo to the extent that the alleged error is based on the misunderstanding of a legal standard,and for clear error to the extent that the alleged error is based on a factual determination.macwade kelly,cir.two recent panels of our court have recognized this contradiction between our case law and a but did not resolve the tension,as they determined that under either standard of review the outcome in the particular case would be the same.scheidelman comm r,cir robinson knife,at.in the instant case,the standard of review affects the outcome,so our court can avoid the question no longer.
the standard that mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard when we review a decision of the tax court was established in this circuit jurisprudence in bausch lomb comm r,cir.bausch lomb imported the standard from the seventh circuit,which,in eli lilly comm r,cir,held the clearly erroneous standard to be applicable.eli lilly in turn relied upon another seventh circuit case,standard office.united states,cir,a tax case on review from the district court.none of these decisions mention a,which has been a part of the internal revenue code since.in standard office building,the seventh circuit indicated that one of the open questions in the appeal was the kind of mixed question of fact and law that,in this circuit at least,is governed by the standard.id.emphasis added.that court then cited a handful of cases from their circuit that stated this standard from cases reviewing the decision of a district court.at citing mucha king,cir review from the northern district of illinois noting that i n particular,the second circuit had long adhered to the view that the mixed question of law and fact at issue in the particular case is not subject to the standard and wright united states,cir review from the central district of illinois.the seventh circuit uses the clearly erroneous standard of review for mixed questions of law and fact when reviewing both decisions of the tax court and those of the district courts.its standard is thus not in tension with a,unlike this court.
quoting eli lilly approvingly,in bausch lomb,this court indicated,we are unaware of any decision discussing the standard that governs appellate review of a tax court determination.bausch lomb,at quoting eli lilly,at.it was certainly the case that no decision at that time discussed the standard for such appellate review,but the statute which governs our court review of tax court decisions set out a mandatory standard,tied to the level of review in appeals on review from a district court.a.once imported from the seventh circuit,this standard for mixed questions of law and fact,which stands at odds with our standard for such review of district court decisions,was propagated again in merrill lynch comm r,cir citing bausch lomb,at,and again in wright,at cir citing merrill lynch,at bausch lomb,at.these three cases make up the bulk,if not the entirety,of the citations for this standard in subsequent decisions of this court.see wilmington partners comm r,app x,cir summary order citing wright scheidelman,at citing wright,merrill lynch,and bausch lomb robinson knife,at same wright,at citing merrill lynch and bausch lomb.
we now conclude that this standard of review was adopted in error as all article iii courts,with the exception of the supreme court,are solely creatures of statute,see const.art.iii,the statute must be determinative in this case.moreover,there is no reason to review the tax court under a different standard than a district court,as its relationship to us is that of a district court to a court of appeals.scheidelman,at internal quotation marks omitted.we hold that the tax court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error,but that mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed de novo,to the extent that the alleged error is in the misunderstanding of a legal standard.see a macwade,at.having clarified the standard of review applicable to decisions of the tax court,we now turn to the merits of the instant case.
title,section of the united states code provides that the irs may assess tax against the transferee of assets of a taxpayer who owes income tax.a a i.the section provides that the tax liability will be assessed,paid,and collected in the same manner and subject to the same provisions and limitations as in the case of the taxes with respect to which the liabilities were incurred and allows for the collection of t he liability,at law or in equity,of a transferee of property of a taxpayer.id.a transferee includes a donee,heir,legatee,devisee,or distributee.id.h.
the supreme court has long held that this section neither creates nor defines a substantive liability but provides merely a new procedure by which the government may collect taxes.comm r stern,discussing the predecessor transferee liability statute under the internal revenue code of.although the provision with respect to transferees is not expansive in its terms,the irs may assess transferee liability under against a party only if two distinct prongs are met the party must be a transferee under and the party must be subject to liability at law or in equity.rowen comm r,cir discussing predecessor statute.under the first prong of,we look to federal tax law to determine whether the party in question is a transferee.id.at.the second prong,whether the party is liable at law or in equity,is determined by the applicable state law,stern,at,here,the new york uniform fraudulent conveyance act nyufca,n.debt.cred.law.specifically,section of the nyufca establishes liability for a transferee if the transferor makes a conveyance,without fair consideration,that renders the transferor insolvent.see debt.cred.law united states mccombs,cir.the parties do not dispute the application of this test,but contest the relationship between the two prongs and their application to this particular case.
the commissioner urges that these two prongs are not independent that a court must first make a determination as to whether the party in question is a transferee,looking to the federal tax law doctrine of substance over form to recharacterize the transaction,and that if a court recharacterizes the transaction,when it proceeds to the second prong to make the determination of state law liability,it must assess liability with respect to the recharacterized transaction.under this formulation,the order in which the two prongs are assessed is critical to the determination of the case.in contrast,diebold argues that the two prongs of are independent even if the court uses federal law to recharacterize the transaction under the first prong and determines the party in question is a transferee,it must look separately to state law under the second prong to determine whether to recharacterize the transaction when analyzing liability.under this formulation,if a court has determined that one of the two prongs does not apply to the party at issue whether they are a transferee or whether they are liable it need not consider the other prong of.
the tax court accepted diebold understanding of the framework and stated that t he law of the state where the transfer occurred controls the characterization of the transaction.under the nyufca,a party seeking to recharacterize a transaction must show that the transferee had actual or constructive knowledge of the entire scheme that renders its exchange with the debtor fraudulent.hbe leasing frank,cir.applying hbe leasing,the tax court found that the shareholders did not have actual or constructive knowledge of the entire series of transactions.therefore,it respected the form of the transaction between the shareholders and shap ii as a stock sale.according to the tax court,because there was no conveyance from double d to diebold new york under of the nyufca,diebold new york was under no liability in law or equity,and thus the successor foundations were not liable as transferees of a transferee.in making this determination,the tax court did not address federal law,but concluded that because there was no state law liability,it was immaterial to the outcome of the case if diebold was a transferee under the terms of.
the first and the fourth circuits have both recently addressed the relationship between the transferee prong and the liability prong of.see frank sawyer trust of may comm r,cir starnes comm r,cir.both of these circuits concluded that the two prongs of are independent and that the tax court did not err by only addressing the liability prong.frank sawyer,at starnes,at.we now join the first and fourth circuits in their interpretations of.
in stern,the supreme court recognized that the predecessor statute to neither creates nor defines a substantive liability but provides merely a new procedure by which the government may collect taxes.stern,at.the statute was enacted in order to do away with the procedural differences between collecting taxes from one who was originally liable and from someone who received property from the original tax ower.id.at.the procedures in place prior to the enactment of predecessor statute depended upon state statutory or case law and proved unduly cumbersome.id.the statute was not enacted to expand the government reach as creditor in collecting taxes.rather,t he government substantive rights in this case are precisely those which other creditors would have under state law.id.at.as such,does not place the government in a better position than any other creditor under state law.this symmetry of rights contemplated under the statute must lead to the conclusion that the requirements of are indeed independent.if we accepted the commissioner argument that state law liability is assessed based upon the transaction as recharacterized by federal tax law,we would be placing the irs in a substantially different position than ordinary creditors under state law.starnes,at.under the interpretation urged by the commissioner,the irs would be able to collapse the transaction based upon federal law,thus transforming it into a conveyance under the applicable state statute,while an ordinary creditor would be required to collapse the transaction under state law which may require,as it does in this case,a different showing in order to collect from a transferee.this distinction demonstrates that the position urged by the irs imports federal law into the substantive determination of liability,in contravention of long settled law that is only a procedural statute,creating no new liability.stern,at.
in the instant case,if there was not a conveyance under the nyufca,a determination that is necessarily made under state law,id.at,then it is of no moment whether or not the selling shareholders were transferees as defined by federal law namely,h.as the first circuit recently noted in frank sawyer,if the trust was not a transferee of the companies for purposes of massachusetts fraudulent transfer law,then whether or not it was a transferee for purposes of is irrelevant.frank sawyer,at.the same formulation is true in the instant case if diebold new york did not receive a conveyance from double d for purposes of the nyufca,then whether or not it was a transferee for purposes of is irrelevant.id.having determined that the two prongs of are independent requirements,one procedural and governed by federal law,the other substantive and governed by state law,starnes,at,we now turn to the tax court assessment of liability under new york state law.
the nyufca defines a conveyance as every payment of money,assignment,release,transfer,lease,mortgage or pledge of tangible or intangible property,and also the creation of any lien or incumbrance.debt.cred.law.it further establishes liability for a transferee if the transferor,without regard to his actual intent,makes a conveyance,without fair consideration,that renders the transferor insolvent.see n.debt.cred.law mccombs,at.if double d had sold its assets and liquidated the proceeds to its shareholders without retaining sufficient funds to pay the tax liability on the assets gains,this would be a clear case of a fraudulent conveyance under.however,due to the midco form of this transaction,double d did not actually make a conveyance to the shareholders.if the form of the transaction is respected,is inapplicable.
it is well established that multilateral transactions may under appropriate circumstances be collapsed and treated as phases of a single transaction for analysis under the ufca.hbe leasing,at citing orr kinderhill,cir.hbe leasing describes a paradigmatic scheme under this collapsing doctrine as one in which 
one transferee gives fair value to the debtor in exchange for the debtor property,and the debtor then gratuitously transfers the proceeds of the first exchange to a second transferee.the first transferee thereby receives the debtor property,and the second transferee receives the consideration,while the debtor retains nothing.
id.such a transaction can be collapsed if two elements are met.first,in accordance with the foregoing paradigm,the consideration received from the first transferee must be reconveyed by the party owing the liability for less than fair consideration or with an actual intent to defraud creditors.id.second,the transferee in the leg of the transaction sought to be voided must have actual or constructive knowledge of the entire scheme that renders her exchange with the debtor fraudulent.id here,it is clear that the first element is met.though the transaction in the instant case has an additional wrinkle namely,an additional party who serves as the conduit for the transfers,shap ii it is still the case that one transferee received double d property,another transferee the shareholders received the consideration for these assets,and double d was left with nothing,neither its assets nor the value of them.therefore,in order for there to be liability against the selling shareholders and their successor entities,the shareholders must have actual or constructive knowledge of the entire scheme that renders the exchange with double d fraudulent.id.
while under an application of to a single transaction,the intent of the parties is irrelevant,the knowledge and intent of the parties becomes relevant when a court is urged to treat multiple business deals as a single transaction.id.at in re corcoran,raggi.here,the commissioner urges the court to consider the sale of double d stock to shap ii,the sale of double d assets by shap ii to morgan stanley and toplands farm,and the distribution of funds to the selling double d shareholders as a single transaction such that a conveyance occurred for purposes of.if the transactions are collapsed,they will be treated as though double d sold all of its assets and made a liquidating distribution to the shareholders.under this collapsed transaction,double d will have transferred all of its assets to the marital trust and diebold new york receiving nothing,much less fair consideration,in exchange.
therefore,we must now assess whether the shareholders had actual or constructive knowledge of the entire scheme.the tax court concluded they did not.this assessment is a mixed question of law and fact,assessing whether based upon the facts as determined by the tax court,the shareholders had constructive or actual knowledge as a matter of law.therefore,we review de novo the tax court determination that the shareholders did not have constructive knowledge,but review for clear error the factual findings that underpin the determination.
