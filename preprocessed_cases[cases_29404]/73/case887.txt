the irs appeals the united states tax court decision that the salus mundi foundation was not liable under for the unpaid tax liability arising from the sale of appreciated assets held by double d ranch.
we conclude that the two requirements of transferee status under federal law and substantive liability under state law are separate and independent inquiries.therefore,the irs can not rely on federal law to recharacterize the series of transactions for purposes of the state law inquiry.
the second circuit addressed the same factual and legal issues in diebold foundation,comm r,cir.we adopt the reasoning of that opinion on the state law inquiry and conclude that the double d shareholders had constructive knowledge of the fraudulent tax avoidance scheme at issue.accordingly,we collapse the series of transactions and conclude that the shareholders made a fraudulent conveyance under the new york uniform fraudulent conveyance act and that the state law liability prong of was therefore satisfied.
we remand to the tax court to determine in the first instance salus mundi status as a transferee of a transferee under the federal law inquiry of and whether the irs assessed liability within the applicable limitations period.
factual and procedural history 
background on the diebold family and double d ranch.
richard diebold was a major shareholder of american home products corporation ahp,a publicly traded corporation.in,he formed double d ranch,as a personal holding company for investment assets,including shares of ahp,other marketable securities,and real estate.richard diebold was married to dorothy diebold,and they had three children.
when richard diebold died in,ownership of all the stock of double d was transferred to the dorothy diebold marital trust.the marital trust had three cotrustees dorothy diebold the bessemer trust and andrew bisset,dorothy diebold personal attorney.austin power,was a senior vice president at bessemer trust who served as counsel and primary account manager for the marital trust.
in dorothy diebold was years old and anxious to make cash gifts to her children.power explained to her that the marital trust was insufficiently liquid to make such gifts,but she would be able to make cash gifts if she were to sell the shares of double d.after this explanation,she was anxious for bessemer to proceed with the sale of the double d ranch,and the other trustees agreed.
as part of the decision to sell double d,the marital trust transferred of the double d shares to the diebold foundation,a charitable foundation incorporated by richard diebold in in new york.in its directors were dorothy diebold,bisset,and dorothy diebold three adult children.each of the three adult children intended to organize their own foundations,one of which became the salus mundi foundation.the directors of the diebold foundation planned to sell the shares of double d and distribute the money to the children foundations.
power was given primary responsibility by the double d shareholders to sell the shares of double 
double d built in gain tax liability and the use of intermediary transactions 
in,double d assets were valued at approximately million,including approximately million of ahp stock,million of other marketable securities,and million of real estate in a connecticut farm the adjusted tax bases of these assets were nominal or low.if double d simply sold its assets,it would be taxed on the gain of those assets,the difference between the selling price of the assets and their adjusted tax bases.see h.sale of double d assets would have triggered tax liability of approximately million.
another option was to sell shares of double d.in that case,double d would continue to own the appreciated assets,and the gain tax would not be triggered.see diebold,comm r,cir discussing generally the issue of appreciated assets and the use of intermediary transactions to avoid tax liability.but with a stock sale,the assets would retain their low tax bases,and the gain tax liability would be triggered if double d new owners ever sold the assets.id.for this reason,a potential buyer of double d shares would demand a substantially lower price to account for the gain tax liability.id.
an intermediary transaction tax shelter,also known as a midco transaction,is a financial arrangement designed to allow a seller to have the benefits of a stock sale and the buyer to have the benefits of an asset purchase with both seller and buyer avoiding the gain tax liability.id.the shareholders sell their shares in a corporation to an intermediary entity at a purchase price that does not discount for the gain tax liability the intermediary then sells the assets of the corporation to the buyer,who gets a purchase price basis in the assets.id.the intermediary keeps the difference between the asset sale price and the stock purchase price as its fee.id.
the intermediary attempts to avoid the gain tax liability by claiming tax attributes,such as losses,that if legitimate would allow the intermediary to absorb the liability.see also notice,notice.if the intermediary tax attributes turn out to be artificial,then the gain tax liability of the sold assets remains outstanding.diebold,f d at.the irs may seek to collect from the intermediary,but the intermediary is often a newly formed entity without other assets and is thus likely to be.id.the irs may then seek payment from the other parties to the transaction.id.
double d meetings with potential purchasers 
power recognized double d gain tax liability as a problem and reached out to a whole network of people,for months to try to find a solution that maximized the purchase price for double power consulted richard leder,bessemer principal outside tax counsel.leder testified that it was generally known to in that profession that there were some people,who for whatever reason,whatever their tax activities are,were able to make very favorable offers to sellers with stock with appreciated assets with the corporation having appreciated assets.leder directed power to one of these people,harry zelnick of river run financial advisors,llc,as a potential purchaser for double another managing director at bessemer referred power to fortrend international llc.
on may,power,leder,and other representatives of the double d shareholders met and discussed the potential sale of double d with zelnick and ari bergman,a principal at sentinel advisors llc,a small investment banking firm that specialized in structuring economic transactions to solve specific corporate and estate or accounting issues.on may,bessemer received the written summaries of the strategies discussed,including an executive summary that discussed efficiently liquidating the portfolio and indicated that sentinel advisors has performed comprehensive portfolio and liquidity analysis on your holdings and would like to present several different benchmark alternatives for evaluating the liquidation of a large equity portfolio.
on june,power and other double d representatives met with fortrend.fortrend representatives presented a strategy entitled buy assets transaction,described as working with various clients who may be willing to buy the stock from the seller and then cause the target corporation to sell its net assets to the ultimate buyer.these clients have certain tax attributes that enable them to absorb the tax gain inherent in the assets.
stock purchase agreement between double d and sentinel 
the double d representatives decided to sell to sentinel.sentinel agreed to a cash purchase of all shares of double d at a price equal to the fair market value of double d assets minus a discount of of the gain.power sent dorothy diebold a letter seeking her approval in which he stated that the arrangement works out to of the market value of double d assets.if double d had sold its assets directly,the gain tax liability would have resulted in the shareholders realizing only about of the market value.
in the initial term sheet that sentinel sent to bessemer,the purchaser of double d was listed as xyz corporation,a special purpose entity.this placeholder eventually became shap acquisition corporation ii shap,a new entity which sentinel created specifically to facilitate the liquidation of double d assets.
rabobank,a bank based in the netherlands,provided a day loan to shap on the condition that shap enter into a fixed price contract to sell the marketable securities,with the purchase price to be paid directly to rabobank pursuant to an irrevocable payment instruction.rabobank anticipated the loan to shap to be outstanding for not more than business days because five days was the longest settlement period for these securities that will be liquidated.shap entered into a fixed price contract to sell the securities to morgan stanley.
on june,a draft stock purchase agreement was sent to power and other double d representatives.the draft contained several references to shap arrangements with morgan stanley,including a section entitled parties in interest which provided that purchaser shap may assign its rights and interests under this agreement to morgan stanley as collateral security for shap obligation to deliver the securities to morgan stanley following the closing for purposes of resale securities was defined to mean the securities owned by double d as of the closing date.
one of the lawyers for the double d shareholders deleted all references to morgan stanley in the draft stock purchase agreement.the lawyers also added language specifically disclaiming the shareholders responsibility for any tax liabilities arising from the sale of double d assets purchasers shap,not sellers double d shareholders,shall be responsible for all taxes regardless of taxable period,arising from any sale or disposition of any of the securities or the farm.another added provision provided that any sale or other disposition by double d that is consummated after the acquisition of the shares by shap shall be treated as occurring after the period ending on the closing date.
following these negotiations,the double d shareholders and shap executed the stock purchase agreement on june,with a closing date of july.also on june,shap and morgan stanley entered into a contract for shap to sell the securities held by double d to morgan stanley on july.the agreement between shap and morgan stanley referenced the agreement between shap and the double d shareholders and mandated the use of the same valuation method for the securities.
the stock purchase agreement also required shap to cause double d to execute an option agreement on the connecticut farm immediately after the closing,giving toplands farm,a llc created by dudley diebold,one of the adult diebold children,the option to purchase the farm for million.the option agreement was signed by dudley diebold on june.on june,dudley diebold also executed an occupancy agreement that set forth the terms for toplands to take possession of the property on july.
closing of the stock purchase agreement and sale of double d assets 
the closing of the stock sale between the double d shareholders and shap was delayed from july to july.power testified that the delay was due to morgan stanley seeking custody control over some of the double d ranch assets prior to the closing.power further testified that t here was no way we the double d shareholders were going to part with any of the double d ranch assets prior to the closing,prior to basically delivering the shares against the cash purchase price.
because of the delay,shap was unable to deliver the securities held by double d to morgan stanley on july as mandated by their agreement.the terms of that agreement provided that shap irrevocably agree s that,in the event that the stock purchase agreement closing does not occur on the stock purchase agreement closing date,shap remain s obligated to deliver to morgan stanley i shares fungible with,in all respects,the shares or ii the amount of cash equivalent but morgan stanley did not require shap to comply with this provision instead morgan stanley backed down after bessemer intervened.power testified that 
i spoke with tim morris who was the head of the bessemer investment department,and i said,somehow or other morgan stanley is trying to throw a monkey wrench into our double d ranch closing.and it my understanding that morris made a call to one of the persons,the senior people he knew at morgan stanley,and at some point shortly after that,they backed off and we closed as we were planning to do,but a day delayed.
after bessemer intervention,the two agreements were amended the closing date of the stock purchase agreement between the double d shareholders and shap was changed to july,and the settlement date of the agreement between shap and morgan stanley to deliver double d securities was changed to july.
the planned transactions then went forward.on july,the double d shareholders sold their shares to shap.immediately after the closing on july,the new president of double d countersigned the option and occupancy agreements with toplands farm.on july,double d securities were transferred to morgan stanley.morgan stanley recorded a trade date of july and a settlement date of july or july for one security.later in july and august,toplands farm exercised its option and paid shap million for the connecticut farm.
shap ultimately paid the double d shareholders approximately million and received about million from its sale of double d assets.because shap claimed losses sufficient to the tax liability,it did not pay any tax on its sale of double d assets.after repayment of its rabobank loan,shap retained profits of about million.
the million paid to the double d shareholders was distributed proportionally to the marital trust and the diebold foundation.pursuant to a plan of dissolution effective january,the diebold foundation distributed all of its assets in equal shares to the three foundations formed by the diebold children the salus mundi foundation,the ceres foundation,and the diebold foundation.these transfers,of approximately million each,were not made in exchange for any property or in satisfaction of any existing debt.
tax filings and irs collection efforts 
all of the parties to this intermediary transaction filed tax returns.the double d shareholders filed returns that reflected the sale of their shares to shap on july.on march,double d filed a corporate return for a short taxable year of july,and indicated that it was filing its final return.this return did not report the sale of securities to morgan stanley or the sale of the connecticut farm to toplands farm.shap filed a consolidated return with shap holdings,the new name for double d for the taxable year ending june.on this return,shap reported the sale of double d assets and the resulting gain,but shap also claimed losses sufficient to offset the gain and reported no net tax liability.the tax court later determined that these losses were artificial losses resulting from a tax shelter known as a son of boss transaction.see desmet comm r,cir a typical son of boss scheme uses a series of contrived steps in a partnership interest to generate artificial tax losses designed to offset income from other transactions.internal quotation marks omitted.
on march,the irs issued a notice of income tax liability against double d for the july,taxable year,assessing a deficiency of approximately million plus penalties and interest.the irs determined that the sale of double d stock on july by the double d shareholders was,in substance,actually a sale of double d assets followed by a liquidating distribution to the shareholders.double d did not contest this assessment,but the irs was unable to find any assets of double d from which to collect the liability.
deciding that further efforts to collect from double d would be futile,the irs attempted to collect from the double d shareholders as transferees of double d pursuant to.
tax court proceedings 
on august,the irs issued a notice of transferee liability against dorothy diebold as a transferee of double dorothy diebold contested the assessment.after a trial,the tax court determined that she was not liable because the marital trust was the actual double d shareholder,and the tax court chose not to disregard its separate existence.diebold commissioner,t.cch,wl,at.the irs
