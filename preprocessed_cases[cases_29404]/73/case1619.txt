on april,the county denied the claims for refund relating to the properties assessed during the fiscal tax year on the ground the claims did not meet the provisions in the revenue and taxation code for granting a refund.the denial letter advised raytheon and directv that,under section,they had six months from the april,denial of their claim or until october,to commence an action in the superior court seeking judicial review of this denial.
the parties stipulation waiving any statute of limitations defense to a refund action in superior court 
because the county april,denial of the refund claims for the tax fiscal year did not address all of hughes pending claims,on september,just prior to the october,deadline to file a refund action in superior court,raytheon and directv as successors to hughes,on the one hand,and the county,on the other hand,entered into a stipulation waiving any statute of limitations defense in any action challenging the county denial of the refund claims.the stipulation provided,the parties recognize that many of the issues involved in the claim s for refund which have been denied may be rendered moot or changed substantially by further actions of the aab regarding the applications for changed assessments that are still pending before the aab on related rulings or determinations.moreover,depending on the aab action in those pending appeals,the possibility exists that additional claims for refund may be filed.therefore,in order to avoid piecemeal litigation of the issues involved in the through audit and the assessor issuance of escape assessments,to minimize costs and attorney fees and to conserve judicial resources,the parties stipulate and agree as follows in consideration of hughes agreement not to bring an immediate suit for refund on the rejected claim s for refund,the county of los angeles agrees not to assert as a defense either expressly or implicitly in any subsequent action between the parties,and waives the right to rely upon all statutes of limitation,including but not limited to,revenue and taxation code,and,with respect to the time for commencing an action in which hughes seeks a refund of tax based on the grounds asserted in the claim s for refund that were denied by the county on april.the stipulation further provided the waiver of the limitations defense would expire six months after the date the county rejected the last of hughes remaining claims for refund in whole or in part.
the instant action in the los angeles county superior court 
on september,within six months of the county resolution of the last of hughes applications for refund on march,raytheon and directv filed the instant action in the los angeles county superior court.the complaint states three causes of action for a refund,each asserting the assessed value of one of the affected parcels for the fiscal tax year was excessive and raytheon or directv is entitled to a tax refund.
on november,the county demurred to the complaint,alleging the action was because it was not filed within six months of the aab denial of the refund claims,as required by section,subdivision a.raytheon and directv filed an opposition,which argued the complaint specifically alleged the september,stipulation extended its time to file the action.the trial court overruled the demurrer and scheduled the case for trial.
on april,in anticipation of trial,the parties entered into a stipulation of facts and issues to be adjudicated,which identified the following issues to be decided in a bench trial whether,upon the county issuance in june of the escape assessments at locations and,raytheon became statutorily entitled pursuant to sections,subdivision b,and,subdivision e,to file an application for reduction in assessment with respect to assessments levied in the fiscal tax year for parcel numbers and and whether,upon the issuance in june of an escape assessment at location,directv became entitled pursuant to sections,subdivision b,and,subdivision b,to file an application for reduction in assessment with respect to parcel number.the stipulation provided that,if raytheon and directv prevailed on their contention they were entitled to file an application for reduction in assessments with respect to the affected parcels,the court shall remand this matter to the aab for a valuation hearing with respect to all three parcels.

contentions

discussion 
standard of review 
this case,presented to the trial court on stipulated facts,concerns issues of statutory interpretation and thus presents only questions of law.accordingly,our review is de novo.ghirardo antonioli cal th,d,placer county local agency formation com.nevada county local agency formation com.th,d.
overview of the governing statutes and regulations and the effect of the issuance of the escape assessments 
in california all real property and business personal property is taxable in proportion to its full value unless specifically exempted.cal,art.xiii.administration of this real and personal property tax is governed by statutes enacted by the legislature see,and regulations promulgated by the state board of equalization see,regs.
in accordance with the governing statutes and administrative regulations,each year each county assessor is required,on or before july,to compile and index the property tax roll,a list of taxable real and personal property located in the county and their assessed values.a taxpayer who wishes to challenge the assessment has two possible administrative remedies the taxpayer may petition the board for a reduction in an assessment pursuant to section alternatively,or sometimes in addition to a section application for a reduction in assessment,the taxpayer may file a claim for tax refund pursuant to section,subd.b see also northrop grumman county of los angeles th,d a taxpayer who challenges the imposition of a property tax has two administrative remedies available.one remedy is to apply for an assessment reduction an assessment appeal under section.the other remedy is to file a claim for a refund under section et.
ordinarily,once an assessment issues the taxpayer has only a limited time to challenge the assessment,either by application for reduction in assessment or claim for refund otherwise the assessment is final.however,that limited time is extended if during an audit the assessor discovers property that has escaped assessment for a particular tax year and thereafter issues an escape assessment directed to that property pursuant to section in that circumstance the taxpayer may file an administrative appeal and challenge the assessment not only with respect to the property that had escaped assessment,but also as to all personal and real property of the assessee assessed at the location during the same tax year,subd.b,subd.e see also regs.tit,subd.a if the result of an audit discloses property subject to an escape assessment for any year covered by the audit,then pursuant to section of the revenue and taxation code,an application may be filed for review,equalization,and adjustment of the original assessment of all property of the assessee at the location of the profession,trade,or business for that year,except any property that has previously been equalized for the year in question.
raytheon and directv have standing to pursue their refund claims 
the county contends the trial court erred in concluding raytheon and directv have standing to appeal the assessment of parcels they do not own but only occupy as tenants.it acknowledges that an appeal from the issuance of an escape assessment authorizes a review of all the property of the assessee,subd.b see also,subd.e same not just the property that was the subject of the escape assessment.however,the county argues the affected parcels are not property of the actually belong to hughes lessors,or more particularly,the legal owners of the parcels 
principles of statutory construction require that we interpret a statute to effectuate the legislature intent.flannery prentice cal th,d,people craft cal d.to determine this intent,we initially examine the language of the statute,giving the words their plain and ordinary meaning.hassan mercy american river hospital cal th,d.however,we do not consider statutes in isolation but rather read every statute with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.people pieters cal d,quoting clean air constituency california state air resources bd.cal d.
here,the statutory scheme is clear that,as a tenant under a lease that exceeds years on two of the affected properties,hughes or its successor in interest,raytheon is the beneficial owner of the property for property tax purposes.see,subd.c t he creation of a leasehold interest in taxable real property for a term of years or more including renewal options effects a change of ownership for property tax purposes,tit,subd.a a the creation of a leasehold interest in real property for a term of years or more constitutes change in ownership of such real property gottschalk county of merced d.the term of years chosen by the legislature to effect a change of ownership is not an arbitrary or unreasonable figure.years was felt to be the length of term generally required for lease financing by institutional lenders and,therefore,approximately equivalent to a fee.as such,hughes has standing to seek a reassessment of parcels and following issuance of an escape assessment directed to property at the two locations.
on all the affected parcels,moreover,hughes was the party assessed and paid all the property taxes pursuant to the express terms of the applicable leases.as the entity that was assessed and paid the tax,hughes is,at minimum,a party affected with standing to file both an application for reduction in assessment and a refund claim.see,subd.a a reduction in an assessment on the local roll shall not be made unless the party affected or his or her agent makes or files with the county board a verified,written application showing the facts claimed to require the reduction and the applicant opinion of the full value of the property,italics added,subd.f person seeking refund must attest he,she or it is either the owner of the property or the person affected,a person having a direct economic interest in the payment of the taxes on that property person who paid the tax may bring refund action in superior court following city or county denial of refund claim,tit,subd.g person affected or party affected is any person or entity having a direct economic interest in the payment of property taxes on the property for the valuation date that is the subject of the proceedings under this subchapter,including the property owner or a lessee required by the property lease to pay the property taxes,italics added.
