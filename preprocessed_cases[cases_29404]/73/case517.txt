may was the registered agent,majority shareholder,sole director,and president of maranatha financial group,a financial advisory firm in dayton,ohio.testimony at trial from numerous employees revealed that may kept a tight control on who could open the company mail.specifically,no one but may himself could open any mail that appeared to originate from banks,government agencies,or law firms.as part of this strict control over company correspondence,may instructed maranatha accountant to withhold the proper amount from employees paychecks but never authorized the accountant to write any checks to transfer these funds to the internal revenue service irs.no one other than may had the authority to sign checks for the company.when tax authorities commenced investigating maranatha activities in march,they discovered that the corporation had never filed either an income tax return or an employment tax return.the irs further determined that may had failed to withhold taxes from his own paycheck but nonetheless had stated on his personal tax form that such funds had been withheld and paid to the government.
as the irs investigation into maranatha activities intensified,may decided to close maranatha.on friday,december,maranatha effectively ceased operations.the next monday,december,usa financial opened in dayton.usa financial opened its offices in a new building but maintained almost exactly the same employees as maranatha.the new firm provided the same financial planning services as its predecessor and used the same copyrighted documents that maranatha had employed in its financial planning programs.may required employees to send daily sales reports for usa financial to his home.however,managers instructed employees that in the event anyone should call usa financial and ask to speak to mark may,the employees should respond mark who or otherwise indicate that no one by that name worked there.craig herl,who had served as a junior executive at maranatha,was the titular president of usa financial.employees at usa financial realized that despite the new letterhead,may was the boss.trial tr.at.
on april,a federal grand jury charged may with two counts of willfully evading his personal income tax liability for calendar years and,in violation of,and four counts of willfully failing to account for and pay over payroll taxes for the quarters ending april,july,and october,as well as january,in violation of.may entered a plea of not guilty on all counts and proceeded to trial.a jury convicted may of all six counts of the indictment on september.the district court conducted the original sentencing hearing on december.may made numerous objections to the sentencing and restitution calculations found in the presentence investigation report psr.the district court rejected may challenges and imposed a sentence of months incarceration with three years of supervised release afterward and ordered may to pay in restitution.may appealed to this court,and a unanimous panel affirmed may convictions but vacated the sentence so that the district court could resentence may in light of the supreme court decision in united states booker,d.united states may,cir.we specifically refused to rule on any of may assignments of error in regard to his sentence and instead urge d may to present those to the district court on remand.id.at.
on january,the district court held may resentencing hearing.both in his motions and at the hearing itself,may objected to the calculations contained within the psr.may objected to the grouping of the section and section offenses together,the calculation of the amount of taxes may evaded,the application of the sophisticated concealment enhancement under united states sentencing guidelines section and the enhancement for abuse of a position of trust under section.the district court rejected each of these challenges.on counts one through five,the court sentenced may to concurrent sixty month terms.on count six,the district court sentenced may to a consecutive term of six months for a total sentence of months.may counsel stated that he objected to the proposed restitution terms found in the psr but was not ready to argue those points at the sentencing hearing.the district court allowed may attorney to file a motion to reopen the judgment within ten days of the sentencing hearing to address these concerns.the government did not object to this procedure but did request that the district court place on the record that the restitution is being applied as a condition of supervised release to clear up the legal issue.resentencing tr.at.the district court so stated.
in his motion to reopen the judgment,may alleged three assignments of error as to the restitution calculations.the district court rejected these arguments and ordered may to pay in restitution as a condition of supervised release.the district court further ordered the defendant to pay on the outstanding balance owed to the ohio attorney general,to refrain from having any association with the financial services industry,in any capacity whatsoever,except as a consumer,and to file,within the first months of supervision,amended tax returns for all relevant years as additional conditions of supervised release.amended judg.at.may timely filed his notice of appeal.
pursuant to a december,order of this court,the parties were directed to file letter briefs addressing the question of whether may december release from prison rendered any of his issues on appeal moot.the government responded on december,and argued that may release rendered all issues except those concerning restitution and supervised release moot.govt.let.at.may responded on january,and citing to our decision in united states maken,cir,argued that all of may assignments of error remain extant.def.let.at.
in maken,we held that e ven when an appellant has been released from custody,his case is not moot so long as the appeal potentially implicates the length of the appellant supervised release term.id.at citation omitted.maken,like may,appealed from a conviction for tax evasion under.id.at.section of the united states sentencing guidelines governs may term of supervised release.the section provides that the district court may sentence may to at least two years but not more than three years of supervised release.a.the district court sentenced may to three years of supervised release.because on any remand,the district court would be free to reduce may term of supervised release from three to two years,we hold that none of may issues on appeal are moot.maken,at noting that this is especially the case.
may first argues that the district court erred by increasing his offense level by two levels for abus ing a position of public or private trust under section of the sentencing guidelines.may asserts that even taking everything the government says as true concerning his level of control over maranatha and usa financial,his conduct did not warrant application of the enhancement.may further warns that accepting the government argument would mean that anyone who failed to pay taxes would suffer the enhancement.at oral argument,the government clarified that its primary assertion is that the victim in this case is the irs and that may was in a position of trust the irs as defined by the guidelines.the government further cited the recent holding of the third circuit in united states lombardo,app x cir,to support its contention that the enhancement is applicable under these facts.
we review de novo the district court determination that the defendant occupied a position of trust for the purpose of the sentencing guidelines.united states tribble,cir citations omitted.section of the guidelines instructs that the term public or private trust is characterized by professional or managerial discretion.these individuals are subject to significantly less supervision than employees whose responsibilities are primarily in nature.id.a court should only apply the enhancement if the position of trust contributed in some significant way to facilitating the commission or concealment of the offense.id.consequently,while the enhancement would be proper as to a bank executive fraudulent loan scheme,it would not be appropriate in the case of an embezzlement or theft by an ordinary bank teller.id.
our case law has also constrained the circumstances under which the enhancement can apply.in united states white,cir,we held that t he enhancement may only be applied where the defendant abused a position of trust with the victim of his charged conduct.emphasis added.t he level of discretion accorded an employee is to be the decisive factor in determining whether his position was one that can be characterized as a trust position.tribble,at.however,district courts must be aware that the term trust as used in the guidelines is a term of art rather than the ordinary dictionary concept of trust.united states ragland,cir.
while the government did not concede that the irs was the only victim of may scheme within the meaning of the sentencing guidelines,it was correct to make that line of argument its primary focus.in ragland,we considered the application of the enhancement to an analogous set of facts.ragland was a bank teller convicted of embezzling customers funds meant for deposit.at.after reviewing the text of section,we held that the bank,not the depositors,was the actual victim in the case.id.at.the application of the enhancement by the district court was therefore improper.id.at.we advised that the application was to apply where the defendant crimes had undermine d faith in one fellow man.id.simply put,the enhancement was not meant to apply to every person who handles another property.id.at.
the facts of may conviction for failing to account for and pay over payroll taxes align with ragland.the money deducted from the employees paychecks was meant for the irs just as the customers deposits were meant for the victim bank.id.at.thus,the irs,not the employees,is the victim of may section offense.the question then becomes whether may held a position of trust in relation to the government.may role would appear to be more like that of a bank only duty was to collect the money and pass it along to the government,as a teller only job is to collect depositors money and pass it along to the than that of a bank executive.see ragland,at united states guidry,cir finding in the context of a prosecution that the defendant did not occupy a position of trust the government.may had no discretion.the law simply required may to collect the payroll taxes from his employees and transfer the funds to the irs.tribble,at noting that the level of discretion afforded the defendant is the decisive factor.
the government citation to the third circuit decision in lombardo is inapposite.while it is true that the third circuit affirmed the application of a section enhancement in the case of a defendant convicted of failing to pay over payroll taxes,it did so in the face of a completely different argument.at.lombardo argued before the third circuit that applying the enhancement to a conviction for failing to pay over payroll taxes was always impermissible double counting because the government had to prove the defendant abused a position of trust to gain a conviction under section.id.the third circuit rejected lombardo argument.may does not argue before us that the government had to prove an abuse of trust to gain a conviction under section.instead,may argument is the mirror opposite of lombardo there is not an abuse of trust at all because may was not in a position of trust relative to the irs.the third circuit did not perform any analysis as to who the actual victim was and where the defendant stood in relation to the victim because lombardo did not raise that issue on appeal.see id.the tenth circuit has faced the same issue before us today squarely and agrees with the conclusion that we have reached.see guidry,at.because may was not in a position of trust relative to the irs,we hold that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence under section of the sentencing guidelines.
may second assignment of error is that the district court erred by impermissibly double counting the amount of the tax loss to determine the proper offense level under the guidelines.the government readily admits that the district court double counted the tax loss but argues that the sentencing guidelines and our prior case law require such double counting.when reviewing the district court application of the sentencing guidelines,we review the district court factual findings for clear error and mixed questions of law and fact de novo.united states davidson,cir.
the amount may alleges the district court impermissibly double counted comes from the aggregation of the tax losses caused by may evasion of his personal income tax liability and his failure to account for and pay over payroll taxes in his role as president of maranatha financial.in his role as maranatha president,may had maranatha accountant list the amount of may personal income tax liability on his corporate salary as deducted from his paycheck for payroll tax purposes.no amount of money was actually withheld from may corporate paycheck.nonetheless,may listed the payroll tax amounts supposedly deducted on his personal income tax forms and then used those phantom tax payments to reduce his remaining income tax liability.the issue of double counting arises because may only owed the amounts in question as tax once.may could either deduct the tax payments from his paycheck and pay them as payroll taxes or he could wait and pay them as a part of his personal income tax return.despite the fact that the taxes were only owed once,the government contends that the sentencing guidelines demand that we count the tax loss twice,once for the payroll tax loss calculation and once for the personal income tax evasion calculation.
section of the sentencing guidelines provides that i n the case of counts grouped together the offense level applicable to a group is the offense level corresponding to the aggregated quantity,determined in accordance with chapter two.b.turning to chapter two,the application notes require that i f the offense involves both individual and corporate tax returns,the tax loss is the aggregate tax loss from the offenses taken together.in united states cseplo,cir,we sought to construe these two provisions with regard to a defendant who stood convicted of willfully underreporting his corporation income and willfully attempting to evade his own income taxes we determined that the plain language of required the tax losses associated with each charge to be aggregated.id.at.the government asserts that because the same guideline sections are applicable to may offenses,the district court properly aggregated the total losses for may convictions under.
despite the initial appeal of the government argument,the facts of may case differ from those we and other circuits have previously decided.cseplo involved a scheme whereby the defendant skimmed money from a corporation he owned and converted the money to his own uses.at.see also united states patti,cir adopting cseplo in the context of a defendant who willfully underreported corporate income and defrauded the united states government united states spencer,cir holding that aggregation is appropriate where defendant skimmed money from the corporation to supplement his legitimately approved salary therefore,in cseplo the government was legitimately entitled to the tax twice.the money was subject to taxation as corporate income and then subject to taxation again on the individual level as
