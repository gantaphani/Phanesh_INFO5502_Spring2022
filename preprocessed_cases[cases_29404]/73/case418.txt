searcy and elizabeth ferguson appeal from a decision of the tax court in a redetermination proceeding that denied two tax deductions,found the fergusons liable for penalties for late filing of a return and substantially understating income,and concluded that it had no jurisdiction to consider whether certain tax debts had been discharged in bankruptcy.we affirm.
the fergusons filed a joint tax return for in december of,approximately two months beyond the extended deadline they had received upon earlier request.the internal revenue service irs determined that the fergusons owed additional tax and sent a notice of deficiency.the fergusons filed a timely petition in the united states tax court for redetermination of their tax.searcy ferguson had petitioned for bankruptcy in and was discharged in.the tax court thereafter held that the commissioner assessment of the deficiency was correct and that the fergusons were liable for a deficiency of,a late filing penalty of,and a underpayment penalty of.the fergusons contended that all tax liability has been discharged in the bankruptcy proceedings,but the tax court concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to resolve that question in a redetermination proceeding 
the fergusons have pursued an appeal to this court.additional facts will be discussed in considering each of the fergusons contentions.
the fergusons assert that they were entitled to a deduction on their return for loss of farm property.the property consisted of three tracts of land near vernon,texas that searcy ferguson had purchased and later used as collateral for a loan from herring national bank.when searcy ferguson filed for bankruptcy in,an automatic stay went into effect,but in,the bankruptcy court lifted the stay,and herring bank foreclosed on the vernon property.
the fergusons contended that the bankruptcy estate trustee had abandoned the vernon property in and that they were therefore entitled to deduct the value of the lien as a loss for that tax year.searcy ferguson had initially filed for bankruptcy under chapter,but in his petition was involuntarily converted to a chapter proceeding.this conversion,the fergusons contend,amounted to an abandonment of the vernon tracts to herring bank.the tax court found that the property was not abandoned by the trustee in.
the parties stipulated in the tax court that the bankruptcy court did not lift the stay as to the vernon property until,and herring bank foreclosed that same year,not in.the commissioner correctly points out that the conversion of bankruptcy proceedings in did not cause the taxpayers to realize any loss or gain in that year.additionally,the trustee did not abandon any property of the estate until,after the vernon property had been sold at a foreclosure sale.the fergusons were not entitled to the deduction that they claimed.
searcy ferguson was married to elizabeth robertson smith prior to his marriage to elizabeth ferguson,and he and smith owned real property in southampton,new york.as part of their divorce agreement,smith was awarded the southampton property.the divorce agreement included an indemnity provision in which searcy ferguson and smith agreed to indemnify each other for claims deriving from this property.shortly before the divorce became final,searcy ferguson encumbered the southampton property by using it as security for loans he obtained from union bank trust of dallas.following the divorce,union bank agreed with smith that its liens on the southampton property were improper because they violated an injunction in the divorce proceeding and released the liens.searcy ferguson subsequently repaid the loans from union bank and unsuccessfully sued smith for violation of the indemnification agreement.searcy and elizabeth ferguson then claimed a deduction on their tax return for the union bank loan repayment amount as an ordinary business bad debt loss.
the tax court correctly determined that this debt was nonbusiness debt within the meaning of d,and that a worthless nonbusiness bad debt must be treated as a capital loss,not a deduction 
in,the fergusons filed a request to extend their tax filing date for six months,to october.this request was granted.at some point prior to that deadline,the fergusons were involved in other litigation and surrendered some or all of their property and tax records in response to a subpoena in that litigation.the fergusons regained possession of their records during.they filed their tax return on december,nearly two months past the extended filing deadline.the irs calculated a late filing penalty.the fergusons challenged that penalty before the tax court,claiming their delay was reasonably caused by the absence of their records in response to a subpoena.the tax court affirmed the penalty.
we review the tax court findings regarding the existence of reasonable cause for the untimely filing of a tax return for clear error section a of the internal revenue code provides for a late filing penalty per month,up to total unless the delay was due to reasonable cause reasonable cause is defined by regulation if the taxpayer exercised ordinary business care and prudence and was nevertheless unable to file the return within the prescribed time,then the delay is due to a reasonable cause.under the tax court precedent,unavailability to the taxpayer of information or records does not necessarily establish reasonable cause for failure to file timely a tax return,because even without full information,a taxpayer is required to file timely based upon the best information available and to file thereafter an amended return if necessary.
searcy ferguson testified that he did not have his records for several months because of a subpoena,but there is no evidence of specific dates the records were unavailable or of whether all or only a part of the fergusons records were out of their control.nor was there an explanation why the fergusons did not retain or acquire copies of their records to complete their return on time.the tax court held that the facts in the record did not constitute reasonable cause because the fergusons could have filed a timely return with what information they did have and could later have filed an amended return once their records were returned.the tax court did not commit clear error in upholding the late filing penalty.
because the irs believed the fergusons had taken improper deductions on their tax return regarding the vernon and southampton properties,and other deductions not at issue here,it found that the fergusons had their income significantly and were liable for an penalty allowed by sections a and b of the internal revenue code before the tax court,the fergusons challenged this penalty,arguing they had acted in good faith,with full disclosure,and had reasonable cause for their.the tax court disagreed,finding no evidence that would exculpate the fergusons from the penalty,and held that the fergusons were liable.
on appeal,the fergusons challenge the amount of the deficiency on which the penalty was calculated.the fergusons believe their penalty was calculated from a base tax amount.this was the amount initially alleged by the irs in the original notice of deficiency.however,in the tax court final decision,the base tax liability was,and the underpayment penalty was,which is of the base tax liability.the tax court did not err in this regard.
finally,we consider the fergusons argument that the tax court erred in concluding that it did not have jurisdiction in a redetermination proceeding pursuant to and to determine whether the taxpayers tax liability was discharged in bankruptcy.all parties agree that in other proceedings that might be initiated pursuant to,regarding levy on property to satisfy unpaid taxes,the tax court would have jurisdiction in an from an irs office of appeals ruling to resolve whether tax liability had been discharged in bankruptcy the question before us is whether the tax court had the authority to consider the discharge issue in redetermining a deficiency under and.the jurisdiction of the tax court is a question of law that we review de novo 
the general grant of jurisdiction to the tax court is establis
