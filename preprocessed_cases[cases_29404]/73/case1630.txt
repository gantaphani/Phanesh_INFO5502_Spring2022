plaintiff and appellant lorraine steinhart steinhart appeals a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining without leave of a demurrer interposed by defendant and respondent county of los angeles the county to steinhart original complaint.
in this action for refund of real estate taxes paid,the essential issue presented is whether steinhart acquisition of a life estate in real property upon the death of her sister constituted a change of ownership so as to trigger a reassessment.
we conclude the conveyance of a life estate to steinhart was not a transfer substantially equal to the value of the fee interest.therefore,there was no change in ownership for purposes of proposition.
accordingly,the judgment of dismissal is reversed with directions to reinstate the complaint.
factual and procedural background 
the county reassessed the subject real property upon steinhart acquisition of a life estate therein steinhart paid the increased taxes and thereafter unsuccessfully sought a refund.
during her lifetime,steinhart sister,esther helfrick,created a living trust into which she transferred the subject real property in sherman oaks,california.under the terms of the trust,if steinhart were to survive helfrick,steinhart would have the right to occupy and use the residential property,for so long as she lives.helfrick died on march.at that time,steinhart,who was then years old,became the life tenant of the property.
prior to helfrick death,the property assessed value was with total taxes of.after helfrick death,the county reassessed the property and raised the valuation by,to a new assessed value of.the county issued a prorated supplemental tax bill for the tax year in the amount of.in subsequent years,the county sent property tax bills as follows and,which bills were paid by steinhart.
on july,steinhart filed a claim of refund of property taxes with the county,seeking a refund of.steinhart asserted a change in ownership for purposes of proposition,as defined in section,did not occur upon helfrick death.therefore,the property should not have been reassessed in the tax year and the assessment in the subsequent years could not be increased by more than percent per year,pursuant to proposition.
on march,the sent steinhart five letters relating to the various tax years and tax bills in issue.each letter stated your claim s was reviewed by the assessor.based on your documentation you submitted,they determined that your claim does not meet the provisions in the revenue and taxation code for granting a refund.for this reason,your claim s for refund is denied effective march.section of the state of california revenue and taxation code allows you six months from the effective date of denial of your claim s to commence an action in the superior court to seek judicial review of this denial.italics added.
in addition,on march,the county notified steinhart of its determination that t he real property transfer is a change in ownership,as defined by law,and the reappraisal of the property will stand.this notice included the following provision notice this notice is your record of our action on your request for investigation.it is your responsibility to pay all billed tax installments.disputes involving the assessed value of your property should be formally addressed to the assessment appeals board at.italics added.
steinhart did not pursue the matter with the assessment appeals board.
steinhart complaint for recovery of real estate taxes paid and declaratory relief.
on august,within six months of the march,denial of steinhart refund claim,steinhart filed suit against the county for recovery of real estate taxes paid and declaratory relief.the action was filed as a limited civil.
steinhart alleged the county erred in denying her claim for refund because her acquisition of a life estate did not constitute a change in ownership within the meaning of proposition.by way of relief,steinhart sought recovery of excess real property taxes she paid on the subject property for the fiscal years in issue,as well as a declaration that pursuant to the terms of the trust instrument,no change of ownership occurred as of the date of decedent death,and hence,defendants were not legally authorized to tax the residence based on a reevaluation of the property as of the date of decedent death.
steinhart appended to her complaint various exhibits including copies of the trust instrument property tax bills for the fiscal years,and cancelled checks showing her payment of said bills her claim for refund and the county denial thereof.
proceedings.
the county filed a demurrer,asserting the pleading failed to state a cause of action because steinhart failed to exhaust her administrative remedies before filing suit and transfer of a life estate to a nonspouse third party constitutes a change of ownership under section,so as to preclude steinhart from claiming no change in ownership occurred.
at the hearing on the demurrer,the trial court on its own motion ruled that as a limited civil court it lacked jurisdiction over an action for declaratory relief and reclassified the action as an unlimited civil case.
after the case was reclassified and transferred,the county again filed a demurrer on three grounds the action was barred by steinhart failure to exhaust her administrative remedies transfer of a life estate to a nonspouse third party constitutes a change of ownership under section and a court does not have authority to issue declaratory relief invalidating a property tax assessment because such an order would in effect prevent or enjoin the collection of a tax.
in opposition,steinhart contended a taxpayer is not required to exhaust administrative remedies where there are no issues of fact to be determined,and in any event,the county was estopped to assert the exhaustion requirement because its notice of rejection advised steinhart she had six months to file suit to seek judicial review of the denial.further,there was no change in ownership within the meaning of section because in view of steinhart remaining life expectancy of years,the value of the life estate was substantially less than the value of the fee interest lastly,her action was not barred by section because it did not seek to enjoin the collection of tax but merely a refund of taxes paid,and only a judicial declaration in aid of obtaining a refund.
on march,the matter came on for hearing.the trial court sustained the county demurrer to the original complaint without leave to amend and dismissed the action.
steinhart filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment of dismissal.
contentions 
steinhart contends she was not required to exhaust administrative remedies because the complained of reassessment was a nullity as a matter of law and no factual questions existed regarding the valuation of the property,and in any event,the county is estopped to assert the exhaustion requirement pursuant to section,the transfer of a life estate pursuant to the terms of a living trust does not constitute a change of ownership upon which a reassessment can be based and her lawsuit,seeking a refund of previously paid real property taxes as well as declaratory relief,is not barred by section because it does not seek to enjoin or prevent the collection of property taxes.

procedural issues.
exhaustion of administrative remedies.
the county contends steinhart action is barred by her failure to exhaust administrative remedies before the assessment appeals board.the argument is unpersuasive because there was no factual question regarding the valuation of the property which the board might have resolved in steinhart favor so as to make further litigation unnecessary.stenocord city of san francisco cal d.rather,the determination that an assessable change in ownership occurred under section is a pure question of law which we review de novo.reilly city and county of san francisco th,d.
further,futility is an exception to the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine.mckee olive d.exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required if it can be positively stated what the administrative agency ruling will be in a particular case.gantner mattern california com.cal d,george arakelian farms,agricultural labor relations bd.cal d.here,at the trial court level and on appeal,the county continues to assert that as a matter of law,the transfer to steinhart of a life estate from her late sister constitutes a change in ownership.in view of the county unyielding position on this legal issue,an administrative challenge by steinhart certainly would have been futile.therefore,the county exhaustion argument is meritless.
steinhart suit is not barred by section prohibition of actions to prevent or enjoin the collection of taxes.
we reject the county argument that steinhart complaint is barred by section.that section provides n o injunction or writ of mandate or other legal or equitable process shall issue in any suit,action,or proceeding in any court against any county,municipality,or district,or any officer thereof,to prevent or enjoin the collection of property taxes sought to be collected.
here,steinhart is not suing to enjoin the collection of taxes she already has paid the real property taxes for the years in issue and is suing for a refund of taxes paid.steinhart sought a judicial declaration only in aid of obtaining a refund,a ruling from the court to the effect that no change in ownership occurred and therefore the county was not authorized to reassess the subject real property.
we now turn to the merits of the appeal.
overview of proposition and statutory scheme.
proposition,adopted by the voters at the june primary election,added article xiii a to the california constitution.amador valley joint union high sch.dist.state bd.of equalization cal d,amador valley.it changed the system of assessing real property from one based on current value to one based on value at the time of acquisition.id.at.
the essence of proposition is its provision that all real property in the state shall be taxed at an ad valorem rate not to exceed percent of its full cash value.cal,art.xiii a,subd.a.the full cash value means the county assessor valuation of real property as shown on the tax bill under full cash value or,thereafter,the appraised value of real property when purchased or newly constructed,or when a change in ownership has occurred after the assessment,subd.a.pacific southwest realty county of los angeles cal th,d,italics added pacific southwest.
because proposition did not explicate the meaning of change in ownership citations,it fell to the legislature to define the phrase the main effort to create consistent and uniform guidelines to implement proposition undefined change in ownership provision was undertaken by a panel that included legislative and board staff,county assessors,trade associations,and lawyers in the public and private sectors.the panel work culminated in the report of the task force on property tax administration hereafter task force report,which was submitted to the assembly committee on revenue and taxation on january.pacific southwest,supra,cal th at,d.
the task force recommendations resulted in the enactment of the revenue and taxation code provisions now before us.the legislature adopted some of the recommendations verbatim or with nonsubstantive technical revisions,and others with rather minor changes.the report key test was adopted verbatim and is now codified as section pacific southwest,supra,cal th at,d.
section governing test pacific southwest,supra,cal th at,d,contains three elements a change in ownership means a transfer of a present interest in real property,including the beneficial use thereof,the value of which is substantially equal to the value of the fee interest,italics added.the legislature intended for section to contain the overarching definition of a change in ownership for reassessment purposes.pacific southwest,supra,at,d.
thus,section sets forth the general rule as to what constitutes a change in ownership.pacific southwest,supra,cal th at,d.section contains various statutory examples of transfers which are included within a change of ownership,while section enumerates transfers which are excluded from a change of ownership,pacific southwest,supra,at,d.
with respect to life estates,section states in pertinent part that a change in ownership includes a ny vesting of the right to possession or enjoyment of a remainder or reversionary interest that occurs upon the termination of a life estate,subd.g,italics added.also,section provides a change in ownership does not include a ny transfer by an instrument whose terms reserve to the transferor an estate for years or an estate for life.however,the termination of such an estate for years or estate for life shall constitute a change in ownership,subd.e,italics added.
thus,the statutory scheme does not expressly address the fact situation presented in the instant case,namely,whether steinhart acquisition of a life estate in real property upon the death of her sister constituted a change of ownership.however,the supreme court analysis in pacific southwest with respect to the third prong of section readily resolves the issue before this court.
pacific southwest discussion of the third prong of section,requiring the value of the interest transferred be substantially equal to the value of the fee interest,is dispositive.
in pacific southwest,the plaintiff sold an office building complex in fee simple to a purchaser,metropolitan life,for million.the seller simultaneously acquired from the buyer a leasehold interest in one building for years,including consecutive renewal options of years each,and a leasehold interest in the other building for months,including a renewal option.the leaseback applied to percent of the property.the county assessor ultimately concluded the sale and leaseback had resulted in a change of ownership of the whole parcel and raised the valuation to million.plaintiff paid tax bills pursuant to the increased valuation and then sued for a refund.pacific southwest,supra,cal th at,d.plaintiff contended there had been no change in ownership within the meaning of proposition because the transaction failed to satisfy any of the three parts of section test.pacific southwest,supra,at,d.
pacific southwest held the first prong of section was satisfied because a transfer of a present interest in real property had occurred.the entire fee was transferred to metropolitan life the simultaneous creation of a different interest in plaintiff will not defeat the first prong of section.pacific southwest,supra,cal th at,d.
pacific southwest further held the transaction met the second prong of section,requiring a transfer of the beneficial interest in the real property.w hen metropolitan life purchased the property in fee simple absolute it acquired its beneficial use during the lease term.metropolitan life decision to exercise its beneficial interest by exacting rent from plaintiff rather than acquiring physical control of the demised premises does not alter the character of the transaction.pacific southwest,supra,cal th at,d.
most importantly for our purposes,pacific southwest held the third prong of section was satisfied because the value of the interest transferred was substantially equal to the valu
