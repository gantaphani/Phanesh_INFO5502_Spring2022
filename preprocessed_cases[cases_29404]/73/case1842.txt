we have before us an appeal from a final judgment validating a proposed bond issue from the circuit court of the first judicial circuit,in and for escambia county,florida.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.upon consideration of appellee escambia county motion for rehearing,we withdraw our revised opinion,filed on september,and substitute the following opinion.we affirm the circuit court final judgment.
factual and procedural background 
on may,escambia county county adopted ordinance ordinance.the ordinance establishes the southwest escambia improvement district district in the southwest portion of the county,running to the peninsula known as perdido key.the ordinance also establishes the southwest escambia improvement trust fund trust fund,which will be used to finance or refinance infrastructure improvements in the district,and authorizes the use of tax increment financing to fund the trust fund.in conjunction with the adoption of the ordinance,the county adopted resolution resolution on may,authorizing the county to issue bonds not exceeding for the district.the stated purpose of these bonds is to finance a project in the district to improve economic development within that area and alleviate traffic congestion.the bonds are to reach maturity no later than the year after revenues are first deposited into the trust fund.
the ordinance provides that the bonds are to be payable out of revenues pledged to and received by the county and deposited to its southwest escambia improvement trust fund.ordinance.the ordinance requires the county to appropriate to the trust fund by february of each year an amount equal to the tax increment so long as any applicable indebtedness is outstanding.id.the funds equaling the tax increment that are placed into the trust are known as tax increment revenues.id.
the resolution employs the term trust fund revenues,which are the moneys other than supplemental revenues deposited in the trust fund pursuant to the provisions of the ordinance.resolution art.i,may.the resolution provides that the bonds shall be repaid from pledged funds,which are the funds deposited in the trust fund including the trust fund revenues and the supplemental revenues.id.art.iii.the resolution does require that if necessary,the county shall appropriate in its annual budget valorem revenues if available as supplemental revenues sufficient to secure the indebtedness in each fiscal year.however,the resolution expressly states that the county does not covenant to maintain any services or programs now provided which generate valorem tax revenues.id.m.
the ordinance and the resolution dictate that the bonds do not pledge the full faith and credit or taxing power of the county,the state,or any political divisions thereof.section of the ordinance states as follows 
the revenue bonds and notes of every issue under this part are payable out of revenues pledged to and received by the county and deposited to its southwest escambia improvement trust fund.the lien created by such bonds,notes or other forms of indebtedness shall not attach until the revenues referred to herein are deposited in the southwest escambia improvement trust fund at the times,and to the extent that,such tax increment revenues accrue.the holders of such bonds,notes or other forms of indebtedness have no right to require the imposition of any tax or the establishment of any rate of taxation in order to obtain the amounts necessary to pay and retire such bonds,notes or other forms of indebtedness.
revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this part shall not be deemed to constitute a pledge of the faith and credit of the county or the state or any political subdivision thereof,but shall be payable solely from the revenues provided therefor.
ordinance.section i of the resolution reiterates that the bonds are payable solely from the pledged funds and shall not constitute an indebtedness,liability,general or moral obligation,or a pledge of the faith,credit or taxing power of the issuer,the state,or any political subdivision thereof.section adds that no bondholder 
shall ever have the right to compel the exercise of the ad valorem taxing power of the issuer,the state or any political subdivision thereof,or taxation in any form of any real or personal property therein,or the application of any funds of the issuer,the state or any political subdivision thereof other than the pledged funds as provided in this resolution.
section explains that the bonds shall not constitute a lien upon any property owned by or situated within the corporate territory of the issuer,but shall constitute a lien only on the pledged funds.accordingly,no lien created by the bonds shall attach until the revenues are deposited in the trust fund.finally,the resolution includes a finding that t he estimated pledged funds will be sufficient to pay all principal of and interest on the bonds.resolution art.i,h.
on may,the county filed a complaint for validation in the escambia county circuit court,seeking validation of the bond issuance.the state attorney promptly filed his answer,and gregory strand intervened pursuant to section,florida statutes.strand argued that the bond issuance was distinguishable from the bond issuance approved by this court in state miami beach redevelopment agency,so d,and therefore required a referendum pursuant to the requirement of article vii,section of the florida constitution 
on august,the circuit court entered the final judgment validating the bond issuance.the circuit court concluded that the county had the authority to issue the bonds and that the bonds were not subject to referendum pursuant to article vii,section.the circuit court cited to our decisions in miami beach and penn florida defense finance accounting service center authority,so d.strand,the intervenor,appeals that final judgment.
ii.standard of review 
in city of gainesville state,so d,this court explained the scope of a bond validation proceeding as follows 
we have previously explained the scope of a bond validation proceeding c ourts should determine if a public body has the authority to issue the subject bonds determine if the purpose of the obligation is legal and ensure that the authorization of the obligation complies with the requirements of law.state city of port orange,so d.

iii.analysis 
strand raises three issues in his appeal a whether the circuit court abused its discretion in denying his motion for continuance b whether the circuit court final judgment is supported by competent,substantial evidence and c whether the bonds required a referendum pursuant to the requirement of article vii,section of the florida constitution.
denial of continuance 
on june,the day before the bond validation hearing,strand filed a motion for a continuance,asserting that his counsel did not learn of the bond validation hearing until june.a continuance is within the discretion of the trial judge and will not be reversed absent a clear showing of abuse.see perlow,so d,lebron state,so d.we find that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying strand motion for a continuance.
section,florida statutes,provides that notice of a bond validation hearing shall be effectuated by publishing notice in a newspaper published in the territory to be affected by the issuance of the bonds for two consecutive weeks,commencing not less than twenty days before the date of the hearing.the record establishes that the notice was published more than one month prior to the june,validation hearing,on may,and again on may,in the pensacola news journal.the record also establishes that notice of intent to adopt the ordinance was published on april.thus,the county provided sufficient notice.furthermore,strand has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by the denial of his motion for a continuance.strand motion asserted that his counsel needed additional time to investigate factual issues of notice and legal issues.as discussed above,proper notice was provided,and accordingly,strand was not prejudiced by any inability to pursue the issue of notice before the circuit court.as for legal issues,strand was permitted to make an oral argument at the hearing and to then file a legal memorandum outlining his legal arguments following the hearing.this opportunity to file a legal memorandum ensured that strand arguments could be fully presented to the circuit court before the entry of the final judgment on august.
given the adequacy of the notice provided and the circuit court accommodation that ensured that strand arguments could be heard,we find that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying strand motion.
competent,substantial evidence 
strand argues that the circuit court adoption of the county proposed final judgment was an improper delegation of its authority to make independent findings of fact under perlow.we find this contention is without merit.in perlow,we did not hold that a trial court adoption of a proposed final judgment verbatim is improper per se,but rather,we held that w hile a trial judge may request a proposed final judgment from either or both parties,the opposing party must be given an opportunity to comment or object prior to entry of an order by the court.so d at.in the instant case,unlike in perlow,the circuit court adoption of the proposed final judgment does not lead to the appearance of impropriety.rather than ruling within hours of the hearing as occurred in perlow,the circuit court in this case deliberated for six weeks before adopting the county proposed order.although the trial court did not specifically ask strand for a proposed final judgment,the circuit court reserved judgment until receiving legal memoranda from the parties,thereby giving strand an opportunity to object and to propose a final order.thus,strand was afforded a meaningful opportunity to review the county proposed final judgment,make objections,and make his own proposals.therefore,the circuit court adoption of the county proposed final judgment was not improper.
strand next argues that the findings of fact contained in the circuit court final judgment are not supported by competent,substantial evidence in the record.specifically,strand challenges the circuit court findings that the district project is necessary and serves a public purpose that there is a sufficient nexus between the property within the district and the benefits of the project to be financed by the bonds and that the public improvements to be financed by the revenue bonds are necessary.strand argument is without merit.
in this case,the county offered into evidence the ordinance and the resolution,and presented testimony concerning the purpose of the project and the tax increment financing mechanism.in its final judgment,the circuit court relied primarily on the legislative findings contained in the ordinance and the resolution.this court has held that legislative declarations of public purpose are presumed valid and should be considered correct unless patently erroneous.boschen city of clearwater,so d,quoting state housing fin.auth.of pinellas county,so d.the findings in the ordinance and the resolution must be accorded great deference by the trial court,and strand has not demonstrated the findings to be clearly erroneous.moreover,this court has recognized that the admission of a resolution may be sufficient evidence justifying a bond validation.in rianhard port of palm beach district,so d,this court explained 
appellants question the fact that plans and specifications of the proposed improvements were not offered in evidence by appellee.
we think the introduction of the supporting resolution in evidence is all that was necessary to justify validation.in state of florida manatee county port authority,so d,we approved as sufficient evidence to justify validation of revenue certificates similar to those in this case only the introduction of the supporting resolution covering that issue.nor did we there find it necessary that detailed plans and specifications of the proposed improvements to be undertaken from the funds of the proposed revenue certificates be submitted in evidence.
likewise in this case,the legislative findings are competent,substantial evidence sufficient to support the final judgment.
legal authority to issue bonds without a referendum 
the circuit court determined that the bonds could be validated without the referendum required by article vii,section,florida constitution,because the bonds to be issued under the ordinance and the resolution do not constitute an indebtedness,liability,or pledge of the faith,credit,or taxing power of the county.on appeal,strand argues that the bonds should not have been validated because the county did not comply with the community redevelopment act,chapter,florida statutes.the county responds that chapter does not apply to the county issuance of the bonds.rather,the county intends to issue the bonds based upon the powers granted to the county by section,florida statutes we agree with the county.we find that this issue is controlled by our decision in penn,in which we previously affirmed the escambia county circuit court validation of bonds issued under a similar tax ordinance and resolution and issuance structure 
strand further argues,as the appellant in penn contended,that this financing mechanism violates article vii,section of the florida constitution,which requires a referendum for bonds payable from ad valorem taxation and maturing more than twelve months after issuance.we rejected this argument in penn because we found the financing mechanism in that case indistinguishable from the financing mechanism that we approved in miami beach.likewise,we find that the financing mechanism in the instant case is not distinguishable from that which we approved in the miami beach case.thus,we reject strand argument that the bonds in this case require a referendum.
on rehearing,strand argues,and the dissenters to our present opinion agree,that we should recede from our decision in miami beach.in miami beach,we reviewed a judgment of the circuit court for dade county which validated bonds issued pursuant to sections and,florida statutes,which authorized the issuance of bonds utilizing tax increment financing to finance redevelopment projects.
in miami beach,the opponents of the bond issuance contended that the bonds were payable from ad valorem taxation and therefore required a referendum.the opponents maintained that the bonds were payable from ad valorem taxation because the required contributions of dade county and the city of miami beach to the repayment fund were to be derived from taxes levied on the real property in the redevelopment area.in response,the miami beach redevelopment agency agency argued that the bonds did not come within the referendum requirement because there was no pledge of the ad valorem taxing power of the county and city.miami beach,so d at.in its brief,the agency maintained that t he crux of the matter is that there is no pledge of the ad valorem taxing power to which bondholders may look,and which they may legally enforce,as a source of funds to pay the bonds.answer brief to initial brief of appellant at,state miami beach redev.agency,so d.
in our miami beach opinion,we decided the issue in favor of the agency stating 
the agency contends in effect that where there is no direct pledge of ad valorem tax revenues,but merely a requirement of an annual appropriation from any available funds,the referendum provision of article vii,section is not involved.we agree with this view 
so d at.we thereafter delineated the history of judicial precedents which led to our conclusion and held 
the bonds in the instant case are payable from a trust fund,and the fund will receive revenue from two sources.one source is the money the agency receives from sales,leases,and charges for the use of,redeveloped property.this source is analogous to revenues generated by a utility or facility.the other source is the money to be contributed each year by the county and city,measured by the tax increment.the source of this revenue is not limited to any specific governmental revenue.that the statutory duty to make the annual contributions would become a contractual duty,part of the obligation of the bonds,does not mean,however,that these bonds are payable from ad valorem taxation,in the constitutional sense of the term.
the agency notes that even though the money the county and city will use to make the contributions may come from ad valorem tax revenues,we have indicated this does not bring the bonds within the referendum requirement.tucker underdown,so d.in that case,county bonds previously issued without referendum to finance a solid waste disposal system had been validated as payable from user charges,giving bondholders no power to compel the levy of ad valorem taxes for operating expenses or debt service.the subsequent lawsuit concerned whether the county had violated the covenants of the earlier bond issue by levying and spending ad valorem taxes for these purposes.the court held that it had not.
tucker underdown supports the argument that there is nothing in the constitution to prevent a county or city from using ad valorem tax revenues where they are required to compute and set aside a prescribed amount,when available,for a discreet sic purpose.the purpose of the constitutional limitation is unaffected by the legal commitment the taxing power of the governmental units is unimpaired.what is critical to the constitutionality of the bonds is that,after the sale of bonds,a bondholder would have no right,if the redevelopment trust fund were insufficient to meet the bond obligations and the available resources of the county or city were insufficient to allow for the promised contributions,to compel by judicial action the levy of ad valorem taxation.under the statute authorizing this bond financing the governing bodies are not obliged nor can they be compelled to levy any ad valorem taxes in any year.the only obligation is to appropriate a sum equal to any tax increment generated in a particular year from the ordinary,general levy of ad valorem taxes otherwise made in the city and county that year.issuance of these bonds without approval of the voters of dade county and the city of miami beach,consequently,does not transgress article vii,section.
miami beach,so d at emphasis added.two members of the court dissented from this conclusion.in his concurring in part and dissenting in part opinion,justice boyd specifically expressed the view that the promised annual contributions to the trust fund based on the tax increment revenues constituted a pledge by the county and the city of their general revenue and made the bonds general obligation bonds,which were payable from ad valorem taxation.id.at boyd,concurring in part and dissenting in part.thus,the arguments advocated here by strand and the present dissenters were previously advanced in miami beach and rejected by this court.
in,we reinforced our holding in miami beach in our decision in state school board of sarasota county,so d.we stated 
regarding the bonds validity,the issue presented is whether a referendum is required by article vii,section of the florida constitution.we conclude that because these obligations are not supported by the pledge of ad valorem taxation,they are not payable from ad valorem taxation within the meaning of article vii,section,and referendum approval is not required.
in state miami beach redevelopment agency,so d,we interpreted the words payable from ad valorem taxation in article vii,section and held that a referendum is not required when there is no direct pledge of the ad valorem taxing power.we noted that although contributions may come from ad valorem tax revenues what is critical to the constitutionality of the bonds is that,after the sale of the bonds,a bondholder would have no right,if funds were insufficient to meet the bond obligations to compel by judicial action the levy of ad valorem taxation t he governing bodies are not obliged nor can they be compelled to levy any ad valorem taxes in any year.id.at.the agreements here,as in miami beach,although supported in part by ad valorem revenues,expressly provide that neither the bondholders nor anyone else can compel use of the ad valorem taxing power to service the bonds.
id.at footnote omitted alterations in original.again,the majority decision was met by a dissent,which maintained that the financing mechanism employed in those cases were equivalent to issuing bonds and pledging ad valorem taxation to support them.again,the dissenters view was rejected by the court.
as referenced earlier,we affirmed the validation of a bond issuance in escambia county in penn on the basis of our decision in miami beach.we also relied on miami beach in affirming a bond validation in state inland protection financing,so d.
we have stated that we are committed to the doctrine of stare decisis.women health counseling services,state,so d.in that case,we pointed out that the doctrine of stare decisis,or the obligation of a court to abide by its own precedent,is grounded on the need for stability in the law and has been a fundamental tenet of jurisprudence for centuries.id.we observed that the doctrine was memorialized by this court a century and a half ago in tyson mattair.we then set forth the questions to be considered when asked to recede from precedent,expressly stating that the presumption in favor of precedent is strong.the questions to be asked are 
has the prior decision proved unworkable due to reliance on an impractical legal fiction can the rule of law announced in the decision be reversed without serious injustice to those who have relied on it and without serious disruption in the stability of the law and have the factual premises underlying the decision changed so drastically as to leave the decision central holding utterly without legal justification 
women health,so d at.in the instant case,we do not find that the answers to these questions overcome the presumption in favor of stare decisis.
in answer to the first question,we have not been presented with evidence showing that the miami beach decision has proven unworkable due to reliance on a legal fiction.rather,we find that the holding of the majority in miami beach was scrutinized and tested by the dissenters in miami beach and later in the school board of sarasota county decision,and determined by the court majority to be developed from seasoned historic precedent.
in answer to several questions,we conclude that for the past years there has been widespread reliance upon the miami beach decision in the issuance of bond financing by local government authorities,including school boards,enabling the financing of many public works that have enhanced the quality of life in our state.tax increment financing and the undergirding principles of our miami beach decision have been inextricably woven into the financial fabric of our state.we conclude that receding from the precedent of miami beach would cause serious disruption to the governmental authorities that have relied upon that precedent for planning public works that are in various stages of development and approval.
finally,we do not find that any changes have occurred since the miami beach decision that affect that decision.there have in fact been no changes which would affect our construction of the applicability of article vii,section,to bond issues using the tax increment financing structure determined to be valid in miami vii,section of the florida constitution has not been amended.the constitutional revision commission which met in and proposed nine revisions to other sections of the florida constitution but did not propose any revision to the constitution that would change the holding of miami beach.see.constitution revision comm n,nine proposed revisions for the ballot.dep t of revenue city of gainesville,so d,this determination relating to the term municipal or public purpose is consistent with the principle that the legislature is presumed to have adopted prior judicial constructions of a law unless a contrary intention is expressed,florida dep t of children families,so d,which is equally applicable on the constitutional level.see generally coastal.police benev.ass williams,so d,stating that rules governing statutory construction are generally applicable to construction of constitutional provisions.
alternatively,stand contends that if we do not recede from miami beach and its progeny,we should find that it does not control the decision in this case.strand argues that,instead,this case should be controlled by this court decision in county of volusia state,so d.in that case,we affirmed the volusia county circuit court denial of validation of a bond issue in part because the circuit court found that volusia county pledge of all legally available revenues other than ad valorem taxes would have the effect of requiring the levy of increased ad valorem taxation so that,under article vii,section,the bonds could not be issued without a referendum.in county of volusia,we specifically affirmed the circuit court,holding 
that which may not be done directly may not be done indirectly.see,state halifax hospital district,so d.while the county has not directly pledged ad valorem taxes to the payment of the bonds,its pledge of all other available revenues,together with its promise to do all things necessary to continue to receive the various revenues,will inevitably lead to higher ad valorem taxes during the life of the bonds,which amounts to the same thing.we find in this case that the pledge of all available revenues,together with a promise to maintain the programs entitling the county to receive the various revenues,will have a substantial impact on the future exercise of ad valorem taxing power and brings this case within the rule of halifax hospital district.the taxpayers of volusia county must have an opportunity to vote on the bond issue.
so d at.in the present case,the county argues that county of volusia is distinguishable because section m of the resolution expressly does not covenant to maintain any services or programs now provided or maintained by the county which generate valorem revenues.the county further points out that we approved a similar financing mechanism in murphy city of port lucie,so d.
we agree that as in city of port lucie,the instant ordinance and resolution differ from those in county of volusia in that valorem revenues here are to be used only as a supplemental source of funding in the event that the trust fund revenues are insufficient for debt service and in that the county expressly does not covenant to maintain services or programs for the purpose of generating income to repay the bonds.see city of port lucie,so d at 
iv.conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,we affirm the final judgment of validation of the escambia county circuit court.
it is so ordered.
in my view,the decision of escambia county to issue bonds to fund a project without first obtaining approval through a constitutionally mandated referendum is contrary to the clear and plain words of article vii,section of the florida constitution here,without consulting the electorate,the county seeks to pledge years worth of ad valorem tax revenue as the primary funding source for a typical capital project.conversely,article vii,section was clearly designed to address the expanding capital needs of local government,but was tempered by the inclusion of democratic control with regard to the decision to finance capital projects with debt payable from ad valorem taxation.art.vii.const in this context,the majority avoidance of this clear command perpetuates and expands a distortion of our fundamental organic law,leads us far beyond our prior precedent,and denies the voters of this state their constitutional right to determine whether their local governments should issue debt that is payable from ad valorem taxation,as that phrase is understood through its usual and obvious meaning.city of jacksonville cont l can,so,the words and terms of a constitution are to be interpreted in their most usual and obvious meaning the presumption is in favor of the natural and popular meaning in which the words are usually understood by the people who have adopted them.with regard to typical capital projects,such as escambia county plan,the constitution unmistakably communicates that entities of local government are required to use a referendum to obtain voter approval when a pledge of ad valorem tax revenue or ad valorem taxing authority is a source of payment for relevant forms of debt.see art.vii.const.
i write separately in this context to emphasize two additional points that,in my view,demonstrate the violence that expansion of the legal fiction of state miami beach redevelopment agency,so d,visits upon the plain text and manifest intent of article vii,section.first,much of our case law in this area has been opaque and counterintuitive due to its complete divorce from the text of this constitutional provision.cont l can,so.at constitutions import the utmost discrimination in the use of language,that which the words declare is the meaning of the instrument.emphasis supplied.here,the court should not expand prior decisions from different contexts to advance a movement away from the text of article vii,section.the decision of the majority to do so today is contrary to a primary tenet of constitutional interpretation begin with the plain and clear meaning of the text.the original decision of this court on september,which receded from the fundamentally erroneous pledge of taxing power only premise of miami beach within the context of typical capital projects,road construction,was a proper return to the constitutional mandate.see strand escambia county.weekly,as revised,no,so d.relatedly,the motions for rehearing and clarification filed by escambia county and the amici have not added anything of substance to the cogent legal analysis contained within this court unanimous,decision to recede from the flawed premise of miami beach.instead,these motions have impermissibly used rehearing as a means to reargue and attack the merits of this court decision,which we have previously considered and determined,brennan state,so d,motions for rehearing may only be used to apprise a court of the points of law or fact that the court has overlooked or misapprehended.quoting.a jacobs wainwright,so d,a motion for rehearing shall not reargue the merits of the court order.nothing has changed in this case and nothing has been overlooked the county and the amici calling for rehearing have simply pandered,postured,and expressed a desire to thwart the democratic voice of florida citizens contrary to the text of the florida constitution.
second,article vii,section of the florida constitution pledging credit further undermines application of the pledge of taxing power only premise of miami beach in the context presented here.this separate,distinct constitutional provision demonstrates that the framers of our constitution were aware of,and intended a textual distinction between,an entity of local government giv ing,lend ing or us ing its taxing power or credit,as addressed in that constitutional provision,and an entity of local government issuing bonds,certificates of indebtedness or any form of tax anticipation certificates,payable from ad valorem taxation,as addressed in article vii,section.emphasis supplied.if the framers had truly intended for article vii,sections and to each only address pledges of the taxing power of local government,then these constitutional drafters would have used similar language in section however,they did not do so.thus,the faulty premise of miami beach accomplishes that which we are proscribed from doing as judicial officers who have sworn to support,protect,and defend our state constitution it amends article vii,section through judicial fiat by removing and rendering meaningless the phrase payable from ad valorem taxation and replacing it with materially different language drawn from a separate,distinct constitutional provision,article vii,section,burnsed seaboard coastline,so d,it is a fundamental rule of construction of our c onstitution that a construction which renders superfluous,meaningless or inoperative any o
