in this case,compaq computer corporation engaged in a foreign stock transaction involving the purchase and resale of american depository receipts adrs.the tax court held that because the adr transaction lacked economic substance,the transaction should be disregarded for federal income tax purposes,wl.the eighth circuit recently decided the same question and concluded as a matter of law that adr transactions of the sort at issue here have economic substance and a business purpose.we agree with the eighth circuit conclusion and reverse.
background 
the facts are stated in the opinion of the tax court and are set out only briefly here.an adr is a trading unit,issued by a trust,that represents ownership of stock in a foreign corporation.foreign stocks are customarily traded on stock exchanges using adrs.an adr transaction of the kind at issue in this case begins with the purchase of adrs with the settlement date at a time when the purchaser is entitled to a declared is,before or on the record date of the dividend.the transaction ends with the immediate resale of the same adr with the settlement date at a time when the purchaser is no longer entitled to the declared is,after the record date.in the terminology of the market,the adr is purchased cum dividend and resold ex dividend.
securities corporation,an investment firm specializing in arbitrage transactions,proposed to compaq that compaq engage in an adr transaction.compaq assistant treasurer,james tempesta,and treasurer,john foster,had a meeting with to discuss this possibility.after a discussion among tempesta,foster,and compaq chief financial officer,darryl white,it was decided to go forward with an adr transaction.tempesta did not perform a analysis before agreeing to the transaction.his investigation of the transaction and of was limited to telephoning a reference and reviewing a spreadsheet analyzing the transaction.
the securities chosen for the transaction were adr shares of royal dutch petroleum company.compaq knew little or nothing about royal dutch other than generally available market information.without involving compaq,chose both the sizes and prices of the trades and the identity of the company that would sell the adrs to compaq.
on september,acting on compaq behalf,bought ten million royal dutch adrs from the designated seller,which was another client of.immediately sold the adrs back to the seller.the trades were made in separate new york stock exchange nyse floor purchase transactions and corresponding resale about adrs each and were all completed in a little over an hour.any trader on the floor was able to break up any of these transactions by taking part or all of the trade but none,it appears,did.because the trades were completed at market prices,no trader had an incentive to break up the transaction.the aggregate purchase price was about million,cum dividend.the aggregate resale price was about million,ex dividend.commissions,margin account interest,and fees were about million.pursuant to special nyse settlement terms,the purchase trades were formally settled on september.pursuant to regular nyse terms,the resale trades were settled on september.compaq used a margin account with bear stearns,a well known securities brokerage firm.compaq was the shareholder of record of the adrs on the dividend record date and was therefore entitled to a gross dividend of about million.about million in netherlands tax was withheld from compaq dividend by royal dutch and paid to the netherlands government.the net dividend,about million,was paid directly to compaq.
on its income tax return,compaq reported about million in capital losses on the purchases and resales,about million in gross dividend income,and a foreign tax credit of about million for the netherlands tax withheld from the gross dividend.compaq used the capital loss to offset part of a capital gain of about million that compaq had realized in from the sale of stock in another company.
the commissioner sent a notice of deficiency to compaq for its federal income taxes that cited,among other things,the royal dutch transaction.compaq filed a petition in the tax court for redetermination of the deficiencies and of an penalty for negligence asserted for under internal revenue code.concluding that the transaction should be disregarded for income tax purposes,the court upheld the deficiencies and the negligence penalty.the court disallowed the gross dividend income,the foreign tax credit,and the capital losses reported by compaq on its tax return.compaq then argued that it should at least be allowed to deduct the out of pocket,margin account interest,and it had incurred in the course of the transaction,but the court held that the expenses could not be deducted.compaq appealed.
standard of review 
this court reviews the tax court conclusions of law de novo and its factual findings for clear error.see frank lyon united states,d chamberlain comm r,cir.the tax court determinations of mixed questions of law and fact are subject to de novo review.see jones comm r,cir.in particular,legal conclusion s that transactions are shams in substance are reviewed de novo.killingsworth comm r,cir.see frank lyon,at.at the general characterization of a transaction for tax purposes is a question of law subject to review.the particular facts from which the characterization is to be made are not so subject.this is true even though the tax court has characterized some of its determinations as ultimate findings of fact.at.see ratanasen cal.dep t of human,cir.
discussion 
w here there is a genuine transaction with economic substance which is compelled or encouraged by business or regulatory realities,is imbued with considerations,and is not shaped solely by features that have meaningless labels attached,the government should honor the allocation of rights and duties effectuated by the parties.frank lyon,at.at.see holladay comm r,cir.unit b t he existence of a tax benefit resulting from a transaction does not automatically make it a sham as long as the transaction is imbued with considerations,cited in merryman comm r,cir.the government has stipulated that aside from its contention that the royal dutch transaction lacked economic substance,it has no objection to how compaq chose to report its tax benefits and liabilities concerning the transaction.
in rice toyota world,comm r,cir,the court held that after frank lyon,it is appropriate for a court to engage in a inquiry to determine whether a transaction has economic substance or is a sham that should not be recognized for income tax purposes.to treat a transaction as a sham,the court must find that the taxpayer was motivated by no business purposes other than obtaining tax benefits in entering the transaction,and that the transaction has no economic substance because no reasonable possibility of a profit exists.id.at emphasis added.see id.s uch a test properly gives effect to the mandate of the court in frank lyon that a transaction can not be treated as a sham unless the transaction is shaped solely by tax avoidance considerations.emphasis added.other courts have said that business purpose and reasonable possibility of profit are merely factors to be considered in determining whether a transaction is a sham.see,acm partnership comm r,cir t hese distinct aspects of the economic sham inquiry do not constitute discrete prongs of a rigid analysis,but rather represent related factors both of which inform the analysis of whether the transaction had sufficient substance,apart from its tax consequences,to be respected for tax purposes.citation omitted james comm r,cir.because we conclude that the adr transaction in this case had both economic substance and a business purpose,we do not need to decide today which of these views to adopt.
the tax court reasoned that compaq adr transaction had neither economic substance nor a business purpose.the court first concluded that compaq had no reasonable opportunity for profit apart from the income tax consequences of the transaction.the court reached this conclusion by employing a curious method of calculation in computing what it called compaq net cash flow from the transaction,the court assessed neither the transaction profitability nor its profitability.instead,the court assessed profitability by looking at the transaction after netherlands tax had been imposed but before considering income tax consequences.the court subtracted compaq million in capital losses,not from the million gross dividend,but from the million net dividend the court then ignored the million foreign tax credit that compaq claimed corresponding to the million netherlands tax.put otherwise,in determining whether the adr transaction was profitable,the court treated the netherlands tax as a cost of the transaction,but did not treat the corresponding tax credit as a benefit of the transaction.the result of this half,half calculation was a net loss figure of roughly million.
the court rejected compaq argument that it had a profit prior to the assessment of tax.
compaq used tax reporting strategies to give the illusion of profit,while simultaneously claiming a tax credit in an amount nearly million that far exceeds the tax of attributed to the alleged profit,and thus is available to offset tax on unrelated transactions by reporting the gross amount of the dividend,when only the net amount was received,petitioner created a fictional million profit as a predicate for a million tax credit.
at.the court said that the intention and effect of the transaction were to capture a tax credit,not substantive ownership of royal dutch adrs,and that the transaction had been arranged so as to minimize the risks associated with it.see id.at.
as for compaq business purpose,the tax court concluded that compaq was motivated only by the expected tax benefits of the adr transaction.among other things,the court said,compaq had not engaged in a businesslike evaluation of the transaction.see id.at.
the tax court decision is in conflict with ies,united states,cir in ies,the court held as a matter of law that an adr transaction identical to this one was not a sham transaction for income tax purposes undertaking the inquiry set out in rice toyota world,at,the court declined to decide whether a transaction would be a sham if either economic substance or business purpose,but not both,was present.see ies,at.instead,the court concluded that both economic substance and business purpose were present in the transaction before it.
turning first to economic substance,the court rejected the argument that the taxpayer purchased only the right to the net dividend,not the gross dividend.t he economic benefit to ies was the amount of the gross dividend,before the foreign taxes were paid.ies was the legal owner of the adrs on the record date.as such,it was legally entitled to retain the benefits of ownership,that is,the dividends due on the record date.id.at.the court said that the part of the gross dividend withheld as taxes by the dutch government was as much income to the taxpayer as the net dividend remaining after taxes.the court relied on the venerable principle,articulated in old colony trust comm r,that t he discharge by a third person of an obligation to him is equivalent to receipt by the person taxed.in old colony trust,the supreme court held that when an employer pays an employee income taxes,the payment of the taxes constitutes income to the employee.similarly,in diedrich comm r,d,the court held that when a donor of a gift of property conditions the gift on the donee paying the gift tax owed by the donor on the gift,the donee payment of the donor gift tax obligation constituted income to the donor.
the ies court saw no reason why the old colony trust principle should not apply to the payment of foreign tax by withholding.the foreign corporation withholding and payment of the tax on ies behalf is no different from an employer withholding and paying to the government income taxes for an employee the full amount before taxes are paid is considered income to the employee.ies,at.when the full amount of the gross dividend was counted as income to the taxpayer,the transaction resulted in a profit to the taxpayer.see id.
as for business purpose,the court said that a taxpayer subjective intent to avoid taxes will not by itself determine whether there was a business purpose to a transaction.id.at.compare holladay,at.the court rejected the government argument that because the adr transaction carried no risk of loss,it was a sham.the court noted that some risk,minimal though it may have been,attended the transaction.that the taxpayer had tried to reduce the risks did not make it a sham.we are not prepared to say that a transaction should be tagged a sham for tax purposes merely because it does not involve excessive risk.ies disinclination to accept any more risk than necessary in these circumstances strikes us as an exercise of good business judgment consistent with a subjective intent to treat the adr trades as transactions.ies,at.
the court further noted that the adr transactions had not been conducted by alter egos or by straw entities created by the taxpayer simply for the purpose of facilitating the transactions.instead,a ll of the parties involved were entities separate and apart from ies,doing legitimate business before ies started trading adrs and as far as we know continuing such legitimate business after that time.id.each individual adr trade was an arm length transaction.see id.at.
we agree with the ies court and conclude that the tax court erred as a matter of law by disregarding the gross amount of the royal dutch dividend and thus ignoring compaq profit on the adr transaction.we add the following comments.
first,as to economic substance the commissioner does not explain why the old colony trust principle does not apply here.that the tax was imposed by the netherlands rather than by the united states,or that it was withheld rather than paid at the end of the tax year,is irrelevant to how the part of the dividend corresponding to the tax should be treated for income tax purposes.income is income regardless of the timing or origin of the tax.see old colony trust,at.at it is immaterial that the taxes were directly paid over to the government by the taxpayer employer,rather than by the taxpayer.riggs comm r,in calculating his united states tax liability,the lender must include in gross income the interest payment he receives from the borrower and the brazilian tax paid on his behalf by the borrower to the brazilian tax collector.reading bates united states,fed.cl,the indemnification agreement at issue results in taxable income to plaintiff because it contractually discharges plaintiff egyptian tax obligation.because compaq was entitled to payment of the dividend as of the record date,compaq was liable for payment of tax on the dividend accordingly,the payment of compaq netherlands tax obligation by royal dutch was income to compaq.see at million payment to netherlands represent ed withholding amounts for dividends paid to residents under treaty between and netherlands ies,at,reg.f the person by whom tax is considered paid for purposes of the foreign tax credit provisions of the revenue code is the person on whom foreign law imposes legal liability for such tax,even if another person,a withholding agent remits such tax.reg.f i tax is considered paid by the taxpayer even if another party to a direct or indirect transaction with the taxpayer agrees,as a part of the transaction,to assume the taxpayer foreign tax liability.indeed,the commissioner admitted in this case that according to generally accepted accounting principles,the entire amount of compaq gross dividend must be reported as income.if the million had been paid to the united states whether by withholding or at the end of the tax year instead of the netherlands,there would have been no argument that this money was not income to compaq.it follows that the gross royal dutch dividend,not the dividend net of netherlands tax,should have been used to compute compaq profit.
the tax court also erred by failing to include compaq million tax credit when it calculated compaq profit.at.this omission taints the court conclusion that the net economic loss from the transaction after tax was about million.if the effects of tax law,
