opinion of the court 
the government has been trying to collect unpaid taxes assessed against gary cardaci,and,to that end,it sought the judicial sale of the home he owns in new jersey with his wife,beverly.the united states district court for the district of new jersey concluded that a forced sale would be inequitable and instead ordered that cardaci make monthly rent payments to the government.unhappy with that outcome,the government has appealed.the cardacis,who should have been delighted with the decision,have filed a cross appeal to challenge both the requirement to pay rent and the monthly rental amount.even though no sale was ordered,the cardacis also question the authority of the district court to order a sale.we confirm the district court authority to consider whether the cardacis property should be subject to a forced sale but will vacate and remand for recalculation of and cardacis respective interests in the property and reconsideration of the equitable factors weighing for and against a sale 
background 
factual background 
cardaci was the owner of holly beach construction company holly beach or the company.in and,the business began to fail,and,in an effort to shore it up,cardaci used approximately in taxes withheld from the wages of his employees to pay suppliers and wages rather than payroll taxes.during that period,cardaci took approximately in salary from holly beach.he used that income to support his family,including making mortgage payments and paying private school tuition for one of his sons.
the company eventually folded and cardaci tried unsuccessfully to start other businesses.he has not had a regular income since.on top of those financial frustrations,he also has medical problems that limit his employment options.since,beverly cardaci has been the primary wage earner in the family.she earns about a year as a public school teacher.
the cardacis own property in cape may county,new jersey,that they purchased in as their home.they claim no dependents now,but two of their adult children live in the house with them at least part of each year.their son garrett lives there full time with his wife and three children.garrett earns approximately a year.he emerged from bankruptcy a year and a half before the bench trial in this case.he and his wife do not pay rent.another son,robert,lives in the house during the summer while he does seasonal work.he earns just under a year.
the cardacis house has been their marital domicile continuously since they bought it,and the only mortgage on the property was paid in full in.cardaci made the majority of the monthly mortgage payments from through,but,after that,cardaci was the sole payor.the district court determined that the house has a fair market value of.if the house were put to a forced sale,the government would set the minimum bid at percent of the assessed value,which is.
at the time of the district court order,cardaci was and cardaci was.neither party submitted evidence of the cardacis life expectancies,so the district court,using the social security administration actuarial life table,calculated the expectancies on the assumption that they were the same.
procedural background 
in august,the government brought this action to reduce to judgment federal tax assessments against cardaci and to force the sale of the cardaci home it sought to collect half of the proceeds to pay for cardaci tax liability and to distribute the remainder to cardaci.upon the government motion for summary judgment,the district court,recognizing that cardaci owed plus interest and that the government had a valid lien on the cardaci property,granted partial summary judgment to that effect.the court also held that the suit was timely because an assessment was first made in,and the suit was brought within years of that assessment.the court did not,however,grant summary judgment with regard to the request to foreclose on the property.
instead,the district court determined that it had limited discretion to order an alternative remedy instead of a foreclosure sale.united states cardaci,no.civ.jbs,wl,at.it noted that federal law does authorize such a sale and that new jersey state law treats marital property as at least occasionally subject to partition,so the court recognized that it could order a sale of the property,despite cardaci interest in the property and her objection to foreclosure.but it decided that additional factual development at a trial would be needed before it could properly weigh the equities and determine whether foreclosure was proper.
after a bench trial,the court issued a judgment based on its consideration of the equitable factors set out in the supreme court decision in united states rodgers.the district court examined the extent to which the g overnment financial interests would be prejudiced if it were relegated to a forced sale of the partial interest actually liable for the delinquent taxes whether cardaci had a legally recognized expectation that the separate property would not be subject to forced sale by the delinquent taxpayer or his or her creditors the likely prejudice to cardaci in personal dislocation costs and practical undercompensation and the relative character and value of the and liable interests held in the property.rodgers,at.it also considered additional equitable factors such as the impact a forced sale would have on other parties.ultimately,the court concluded that it would be inequitable to force the sale of the property.
that conclusion was based in some measure on the court method of valuing and cardacis respective interests in their home.in calculating those interests,the court refused to find them equal.it determined that cardaci interest in the property,in the event of a forced sale,would be percent,because she owns an undivided interest in the whole of the property,plus a right of survivorship.cardaci,wl,at.using life estate interest tables published by the health care financing administration in the new jersey medicaid manual,the court decided that cardaci life estate interest was worth approximately percent of the value of her interest in the property.the court then added that life estate value percent times the fifty percent value of her interest,to equal percent of the value of the property to her survivorship interest and concluded that she had an percent interest in the value of the property,leaving the government to recover only fourteen percent of the proceeds from a forced sale based on that calculation and consideration of the equitable factors from rodgers,the court found that t he equities of this case warrant the exercise of the court very limited discretion not to order a sale.id.at citation omitted.it therefore fixed an imputed monthly rental value of for the property and ordered cardaci to pay half of that value to the irs each month 
shortly after the final judgment was entered,the cardacis filed a motion for reconsideration under fed.civ.e.they argued that the imputed rental value was inaccurate and,in support,submitted declarations from two different realtors.concluding that such evidence should have been presented at trial,the district court refused to reconsider its original judgment.
cardaci quickly defaulted on his monthly payment obligation.he also failed to set up an automatic debit payment system as required by the district court,and he failed to provide proof of homeowner insurance up to the balance of the tax obligation,as likewise required.he has not made any of the required payments and has not sought a stay of execution of judgment during the pendency of this appeal.
the government filed a timely notice of appeal,as did the cardacis 
ii.discussion 
authority of the district court to order a sale 
at the outset,we address the cardacis argument that the district court lacked the authority to even consider ordering a sale of marital property held in tenancy by the entirety.it is undisputed that,under new jersey law,that is the character of the cardacis ownership interest.it seems obvious,then,that they have rights that qualify as property subject to the federal tax lien statute.but the cardacis argue that their property is not subject to a foreclosure sale because it is protected by a new jersey statute.
there are at least two flaws with their argument.first,that particular new jersey statute is not applicable to the cardacis.it was updated nearly thirty years ago by an amendment effective january,that includes the following language this act shall take effect on the day after enactment and shall be applicable to all tenancies by entireties which are created on or after the effective date of this act.laws.therefore,by its terms,the statute applies only to tenancies by the entirety created on or after april.the cardacis purchased the property at issue in.thus,the amended and more protective version of the new jersey statute does not apply,and we are required to consider the present matter under principles without reference to.freda commercial tr.of.
the second and more fundamental flaw in the cardacis argument is that,regardless of the applicability of new jersey statutory or common law,state law must give way to the supremacy of federal law.in united states craft,the supreme court made clear that s tate law determines only which sticks are in a person bundle of property rights.whether those sticks qualify as property for purposes of the federal tax lien statute is a question of federal law.craft,at.under federal law,an interest in entireties property constitute s property or rights to property for the purposes of the federal tax lien statute.id.at.exemptions are swept aside by the supremacy clause of the constitution,which is as potent in its application to innocent bystanders as in its application to delinquent debtors.rodgers,at.therefore,the district court was correct to hold that the marital home constitutes property subject to the federal tax lien statute.craft,at see also popky united states,cir.holding that rights to marital property are property for federal tax purposes when they include the right to use the property,to receive income produced by it,and to exclude others from it quoting craft,at.
analysis of the rodgers factors 
since the cardacis marital home is fair game under federal tax law,it can indeed be disposed of by a forced sale under c.but that statutory subsection provides that a court may decree a sale of such property,the word may necessarily implying a degree of discretion.c emphasis added.in united states rodgers,the supreme court said as much,concluding that does not require a district court to authorize a forced sale under absolutely all circumstances,and that some limited room is left in the statute for the exercise of reasoned discretion.at.rodgers directs that courts must order a sale of the property to satisfy a tax lien,unless,in light of common sense or special circumstances,it determines that a sale would be inequitable.id.at.that determination is to be guided by four factors.id.at.
first,a court should consider the extent to which the g overnment financial interests would be prejudiced if it were relegated to a forced sale of the partial interest actually liable for the delinquent taxes.id.at.second,a court should consider whether the third party with a separate interest in the property would,in the normal course of events leaving aside and eminent domain proceedings,of course,have a legally recognized expectation that that separate property would not be subject to forced sale by the delinquent taxpayer or his or her creditors.id.at.third,a court should consider the likely prejudice to the third party,both in personal dislocation costs and in practical undercompensation.id.at.fourth,a court should consider the relative character and value of the nonliable and liable interests held in the property.id.those factors come with the caution that,because they do not constitute an exhaustive list,they should not be used as a mechanical checklist to the exclusion of common sense and consideration of special circumstances.id.at the same time,however,the limited discretion accorded by should be exercised rigorously and sparingly,keeping in mind the g overnment paramount interest in prompt and certain collection of delinquent taxes.id.
the government argues that the district court here abused its discretion in analyzing the rodgers factors and then erred in concluding that the cardacis home should not be sold.we agree that the district court erred in its analysis of the rodgers factors but will decline the government invitation to definitively reweigh the factors ourselves,and,instead,we will remand for the district court to recalculate the cardacis property interests and again engage in a thorough analysis of the equitable factors set forth in rodgers.to assist in that process,we make the following observations 
the prejudice to the government resulting from a partial sale 
the first rodgers factor directs a court to consider the extent to which the g overnment financial interests would be prejudiced if it were relegated to a forced sale of the partial interest actually liable for the delinquent taxes.id.at.in this case,the district court concluded that that factor weighed in the government favor only slightly because a sale of cardaci interest would provide little value,while requiring cardaci to pay rental payments to the government was likely to produce much greater collection of taxes to the g overnment compared with the amount likely to be obtained from a foreclosure sale of the entire property.cardaci,wl,at.we agree with that evaluation of what might be gained by trying to sell cardaci interest in the home,but taking into account what might be gained from rental payments was not a sound approach in considering this factor.the focus should solely be on determining whether the government would be adequately compensated by a partial sale of the taxpayer interest or whether a sale of the entire property is necessary to vindicate the government interest.rental payments are not the equivalent of a partial sale and are not relevant to the contrast between a partial and a total sale.
an analysis of the first factor boils down to the idea that,the higher the expected market price of a partial interest,the less the prejudice,and the less weighty the g overnment interest in going ahead with a sale of the entire property.rodgers,at.when there is no market for a partial interest in the property,this factor will weigh significantly in favor of a forced sale.see id.because there is no real market for one spouse interest in a marital home held in a tenancy by the entirety the sale of which would leave the purchaser as a tenant in common with the remaining spouse,this factor weighs in favor of a forced sale of the cardaci home.
the party legally recognized expectation in the property 
the second factor directs a court to consider whether the third party with a separate interest in the property would,in the normal course of events,have a legally recognized expectation that that separate property would not be subject to forced sale by the delinquent taxpayer or his or her creditors.id.consideration of that expectation requires reference to the protections afforded by state law.see id.at looking to the protections afforded by texas homestead laws.the district court found that,because new jersey law provides special protection for a spouse interest in marital property,cardaci would have expected that her property would be free from foreclosure based on her husband tax obligations.according to the government,however,when the district court looked to new jersey state law,it relied upon a statute that is facially inapplicable and gave short shrift to the unusually weak protections provided by the new jersey tenancy by the entirety.opening br.at.
in determining the effect of new jersey law on cardaci expectations,the court relied,in part,on of new jersey statutory code.but,as already noted,that law is only applicable to tenancies by entireties which are created on or after the effective date of th e act,namely january.laws.the cardacis property was purchased ten years earlier,in.therefore,the government is correct that is inapplicable and,on remand,the district court should consider the present matter under principles without reference to it.freda,at.
the government also takes issue with what it characterizes as the district court failure to recognize that new jersey provides weak protections for marital property held in a tenancy by the entirety.the expectation of the nonliable spouse is a matter of degree,because state laws afford varying levels of protection.rodgers,at.in freda commercial trust of new jersey,the new jersey supreme court declined to follow precedent from pennsylvania,florida,and georgia because the protections for spouses under new jersey common law are not as strong.at.unlike in those states,spouses in new jersey own separate interests that can be reached by their individual creditors,so that the interest of one tenant by the entirety is subject to liens on that tenant interest.id.nonetheless,the freda court also recognized that t enancies by the entirety survive as a means of protecting marital assets during coverture and as security for one spouse on the death of the other,and such protection is particularly compelling when the asset is the family home.id.at citation omitted.
the most recent case from the new jersey supreme court addressing common law rights and the protection of a person property from a spouse creditors although rendered in the context of partition seemed to focus on the equities,without announcing a clear legal right.the court said that,when the creditor interest in the marital dwelling is weighed against that of the debtor family,equitable principles persuade us that the creditor should not,as of right,be granted partition at the cost of dispossessing the family of its home.newman chase.
consideration of the legally recognized expectations of the nonliable spouse is thus amenable to considerations of degree.rodgers,at.it seems here that it may not weigh as fully against a forced sale as it would in a more protective state,but it also may not weigh in favor of a sale either,as new jersey law may still discourage selling a family home to pay a creditor,depending on the equities.see newman,at.on remand,the district court must,of course,rely on applicable new jersey law in discerning the strength of cardaci legally recognized expectations,given the facts of this case.
the likely prejudice to the third party 
the third factor directs a court to consider the likely prejudice to the third party,both in personal dislocation costs and in practical undercompensation.rodgers,at.the district court focused its inquiry on the first aspect of this factor personal dislocation costs.it concluded that the factor is neutral because,while cardaci would face dislocation costs,the costs were no greater than in any other foreclosure sale.we agree that there are no special dislocation costs to consider here.but it is problematic that the court did not then address the practical undercompensation cardaci might suffer in the event of a forced sale.
the supreme court recognized in rodgers that financial compensation may not always be a completely adequate substitute for a roof over one head.id.at.that is particularly true when the market value of the property in question would be less than the price demanded by the market for a lifetime interest in an equivalent home.id.and,because any calculation of the cash value of a survivorship interest must of necessity be based on actuarial statistics,it will unavoidably undercompensate persons who end up living longer than the average.id.therefore,to the extent that a forced sale of the entire property undercompensates the spouse for the value of her life estate and the potential that she lives longer than expected,this factor will weigh against a forced sale.how strongly this factor weighs against a forced sale,however,will depend on how great the risk of undercompensation is,given the particular circumstances.
in order to determine whether an innocent spouse will be adequately compensated by a fair distribution of the proceeds from a forced sale,a court must first determine the amount that the spouse would receive from such a sale.although the district court here did not consider the practical undercompensation to cardaci,it did determine the amount it thought she would receive from a sale because that calculation was also necessary to the fourth factor.it said cardaci interest in the property was worth percent of the property market value,after adopting the mathematical reasoning proposed by the cardacis.to recapitulate,the court first recognized that the cardacis survivorship rights are of equal value percent of the property.cardaci,wl,at.it then,in effect,found cardaci life estate to be worth percent of the value of her interest in the property.because cardaci has only a interest in the property,that percent was divided by two to get to percent of the value of the whole property.since cardaci also had a fifty percent interest in survivorship,the court added that fifty percent to the percent value of the life estate to find that she had an percent total interest in the value of the property the court did not include cardaci interest in a life estate in its calculations,saying only that,a s to the nonliable spouse,cardaci,there is an extinguishment of her valuable right of life tenancy in that home and her right to withhold consent to sale of her home,for which the g overnment owes just compensation as a taking.see also id.at a forced sale would extinguish property rights presently held by the spouse,for which she must be compensated.
the government argues that,based on our decision in popky united states,cir,the district court should have determined that each spouse had a fifty percent interest in the home,without any consideration of their respective life expectancies and future interests in the home.the cardacis oppose that method of calculation and instead defend the calculation of the district court.neither position is correct,but the district court overarching concern about cardaci being fully and fairly compensated is sound and should be weighed under the third factor.
contrary to the government argument,popky is not controlling.in that case,the marital property at issue had already been liquidated.popky,at.we concluded that the interest of each spouse in the resulting cash was an equal fifty percent.id.at.even though the cash itself was still held by the spouses as entirety tenants under pennsylvania law,id.at,there can be no life estate in cash as there can in real property as a result,there was no need to turn to actuarial tables.id.at.
in this case,however,real property and a life estate interest in that property are indeed at stake.to simply apply the same rule used for liquidated property held as cash would be to ignore a critical interest in the life estate,and controlling supreme court precedent.rodgers,at stating that any calculation of the cash value of a homestead interest must of necessity be based on actuarial statistics.the cardacis were counting on being able to live in their home all of their lives,regardless of which spouse may outlive the other.the same could not be said for the popkys,who were looking only at a stack of cash.see id.recognizing that in practical terms financial compensation may not always be a completely adequate substitute for a roof over one head.the popky rule is thus inapplicable under these circumstances.
although popky simple rule does not control,we can not agree with the district court calculation of the cardacis respective interests in the marital home.in a tenancy by the entirety,each spouse has a concurrent interest in the present value of the property,in a life estate,and in a right of survivorship.see freda,at.but because both the probability of obtaining the property upon the death of one spouse and the value of the life estate depend on life expectancy,any calculation of the cash value of those interests must of necessity be based on actuarial statistics.rodgers,at.that is a logical rule.to give one admittedly extreme example,it stands to reason that a healthy wife would have a greater interest in a life estate than would her ailing husband.while each spouse would have the same rights to the home,the measurable property value that they would be likely to receive from the pro
