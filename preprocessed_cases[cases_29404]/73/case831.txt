a jury convicted donald fletcher of one count of conspiracy to defraud the united states,see,and two counts of aiding and assisting in the preparation or presentation of false income tax returns,see.the district court sentenced fletcher to months in prison.fletcher appeals his convictions,arguing that the evidence was insufficient,that the government introduced evidence outside the scope of the indictment,that the district court erred in admitting evidence of prior civil adjudications resulting from fletcher past provision of tax services,and that the indictment was insufficient.fletcher also appeals his sentence,contending that the district court abused its discretion in departing upward based on the prior civil adjudications.we affirm.
this case arises out of fletcher involvement in james otis company jo c,a california company that provided tax consultation,tax preparation,and audit representation services to taxpayers in arkansas.the essence of the charges was that fletcher conspired with william webber,deborah rogers,and ryan rogers to prevent the internal revenue service irs from determining jo c clients income and tax liabilities,and induced taxpayers to file false tax returns with the irs.webber,rogers,and rogers all pleaded guilty shortly before trial,leaving fletcher as the sole defendant.a brief outline of the scheme follows.
after rogers had recruited a sufficient number of prospective clients in arkansas,fletcher would travel to arkansas and conduct seminars promoting jo c tax services.during the seminars,fletcher advocated reducing or eliminating tax liability by converting what appeared to be ordinary personal expenditures into tax deductible business expenses.following these seminars,fletcher and rogers together,or rogers alone,met with individual prospective clients.if persuaded to use jo c services,the clients signed a jo c participation agreement that fletcher designed.clients agreed to pay jo c either of their gross income or an amount equal to half of the tax savings that resulted from jo c services savings often generated by amending previous years returns to create larger tax refunds.and rogers provided tax consultation and audit representation services to the arkansas clients,while webber supervised and assisted a staff in preparing tax returns and audit documentation for them.
jo c furnished the arkansas clients with tax data organizers,more commonly referred to as workbooks,to record income and business expenses for tax purposes.the arkansas clients,on the basis of advice received through jo c,recorded ordinary personal expenditures as tax deductible business expenses.for example,one client who operated a day care center deducted veterinary and food costs for her family pets as security and rodent control expenses.a doctor and his wife deducted as a business travel expense a wholly personal trip to las vegas to get married that same couple deducted as a security expense in health care costs incurred for the heart condition of the wife,old german shepherd.a dentist deducted in wages allegedly paid to his minor children,when no such wages were in fact paid.at times,the tax preparers themselves inflated the clients expenses.for example,one client workbook estimate of in farm expenses was increased to on his tax return.
ultimately,jo c clients tax returns prompted an investigation and audits by the irs.when informed of the investigation,fletcher instructed his colleagues and clients to delay the audit process for as long as possible.and rogers also advised clients that,if asked by the irs who prepared the tax returns,they should respond that they prepared the returns themselves.generally,the tax preparers did not sign the amended returns or signed them illegibly in order to avoid a connection between the preparer and the return.during the audit process,fletcher encouraged the fabrication of,and webber and and rogers fabricated,records to support the arkansas clients deductions by,for example,creating phony invoices for professional services or false calendar entries for business meetings.
fletcher argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions.on appeal from a conviction,we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,giving the government the benefit of all reasonable inferences.united states peterson,cir,cert.denied,d.we will reverse the conviction only if we can conclude from the evidence that a reasonable fact finder must have entertained a reasonable doubt about the government proof concerning one of the essential elements of the crime.united states mccarthy,cir,cert.denied,d and,d.
fletcher was charged under the portion of that proscribes conspiracies to defraud the united states by impairing,obstructing,or defeating the lawful function of any department of the g overnment.united states derezinski,cir quoting haas henkel.alteration in derezinski.in particular,the indictment alleged a conspiracy to defraud the irs in the function of assessing and collecting taxes,commonly known as a klein conspiracy.see united states ervasti,cir united states klein,cir,cert.denied,d.to convict a defendant of a klein conspiracy,the government must show the existence of an agreement to defraud the irs and an overt act by one of the conspirators in furtherance of the agreement objectives.see united states zimmerman,cir per curiam see also united states furkin,cir united states alston,cir united states shoup,cir united states vogt,cir,cert.denied,d.fletcher contends that the government failed to prove the existence of,and his knowing participation in,any conspiracy to defraud the irs.we believe that the evidence demonstrates otherwise.
although fletcher and every other individual working with jo c considered themselves to be independent contractors,testimony at trial suggested that fletcher controlled jo becky mears,who performed administrative work for jo c,testified that there was no distinction between fletcher and jo barbara nofrey,who performed administrative work for fletcher and webber,testified that fletcher was the head honcho and controlled jo c.nofrey further testified that fletcher directed jo c to pay webber for the tax return preparation work and that fletcher was webber boss.webber testified that fletcher brought in the funds,allocated how money would be spent,and decided how the business would work.webber also testified that,despite webber concern that amended returns had a high audit rate,fletcher insisted that webber prepare amended returns because they would provide for consistent income to jo 
a videotape of fletcher seminar promoting jo c tax services and related trust services reflects that rogers introduced fletcher as the head of our tax service department out of california.fletcher repeatedly used the term we in describing jo c services at the seminar,explaining,for example,w e do tax workbooks where we will show you based on a workbook,before you do your tax returns what the numbers really should be.this is consistent with nofrey testimony that fletcher met with at least one unidentified arkansas client and,using tax software on his laptop computer,prepared draft tax returns,taking information from the client in order to get an idea what their potential expenses could or should be to make their refunds come out to be a certain dollar amount.
also during the seminar,fletcher stated we can help you.you can get your tax money back.you can make sure you do pay any more for the next twenty years.fletcher explained,the whole secret that we talking about is to convert personal expenses into business expenses and the businesses that are reimbursing your expenses are totally deductible because,they not persons driving cars or having meals or living in houses and therefore,all the stuff that was deductible yesterday is deductible.fletcher also told the prospective clients that jo c knew of secret provisions hidden in the internal revenue code,provisions accountants and attorneys were not trained in,and that his method was not taught at business schools such as harvard and stanford.although rogers delivered much of the advice that was rendered directly to taxpayers,that advice,as taxpayers described it at trial,was entirely consistent with fletcher comments during the seminar about deducting a cat as a rodent control device,or for dog food as a security device,or even a bird as aerial surveillance.
contrary to fletcher assertion,then,there is ample evidence from which the jury could have found,beyond a reasonable doubt,that fletcher and others had the intent necessary to defraud the united states in its efforts to collect taxes.we cite as evidence of one particularly egregious example rogers testimony that,in the face of an irs audit,fletcher instructed her to create a phony invoice to support a deduction of legal and professional expenses on an amended tax return filed on behalf of two arkansas clients.from this exchange alone the jury could certainly infer a purpose to defraud the government by interfering with irs functions,and the rest of the evidence that we have rehearsed further supports that conclusion.we note,moreover,that the requisite agreement need not be express,but rather can be an informal tacit understanding between the coconspirators and can be proved entirely by circumstantial evidence.ervasti,at internal citation and punctuation omitted.we believe,therefore,that the government presented sufficient evidence to support fletcher conviction on the conspiracy count.
fletcher was also charged with aiding in the preparation and presentation of false tax returns,see.of the original sixteen false return counts,the jury convicted fletcher on two counts,both pertaining to the tax returns of james and ginger mcnair a mistrial was declared on the remaining counts.the false return counts require the government to prove that fletcher w illfully aid ed or assist ed in,or procure d,counsel ed,or advise d the preparation or presentation of a return which is fraudulent or is false as to any material matter.see ervasti,at.liability under is not limited to return preparers the statute reaches all knowing participants in the fraud.see united states rowlee,cir,cert.denied,d united states hooks,cir united states crum,cir united states maius,cir,cert.denied,d.
we believe that the government presented sufficient evidence to support fletcher conviction on the false return counts pertaining to and mcnair.it was as a result of attending fletcher seminar in that the mcnairs retained jo c to implement fletcher tax strategy of converting ordinary personal expenses into business expenditures.webber testified that fletcher handwriting appears on a page of the mcnairs participation agreement that explained the mcnairs fees and suggested investments.with jo c and in particular the rogerses assistance,the mcnairs filed an amended tax return for on this return they deducted as business expenses a purely personal trip to las vegas to get married and costs associated with the care of mcnair sick dog.on their tax return,they again deducted the expenses,as well as thousands of dollars in auto and travel costs to and from a rental home that was in fact in their front yard and occupied by mcnair mother.mcnair testified that she became concerned about jo c tax preparation services,challenging,for example,the omission of the paid preparer signature from the return.we find particularly telling mcnair testimony that she addressed her questions and concerns not only to and rogers,but also to fletcher on one occasion.from this evidence,the jury could certainly find that fletcher willfully aided,assisted in,procured,counseled,or advised the preparation or presentation of the mcnair false and fraudulent income tax returns.
finally,fletcher free speech argument is wholly unavailing.there was ample evidence that fletcher did more than merely advocate,through speech,violation of the tax laws.see united states buttorff,cir citing brandenburg ohio,d,cert.denied,d.fletcher was not prosecuted for speech alone,but rather for his role,as outlined above,in the fraud that the jo c actors actually perpetrated against the united states.see,id.at.we note,moreover,that as a result of fletcher seminars where he explained how to convert ordinary personal expenditures into tax deductible business expenses and his meetings with clients,his clients not only retained jo c tax services for the current year,they began the process of filing amended tax returns for previous years.in these circumstances,fletcher speech is not entitled to first amendment protection.
fletcher next argues that the district court erred in failing to grant a mistrial during webber testimony.at trial,webber testified that he attended client appointments with fletcher where fletcher advised the clients how to complete the workbooks.according to webber,when clients were unable to come up with a dollar amount for their business expenses,fletcher would choose a random number by,for example,opening the phone book and having the client point to a number.
initially,the district court overruled fletcher objection to this testimony.on,however,it was revealed that these appointments occurred sometime in or,well outside the conspiracy period of on or about august,through december.the district court then instructed the jury to disregard the testimony but refused to grant fletcher motion for a mistrial.fletcher argues that the district court abused its discretion in failing to grant his motion for mistrial.we disagree.the admission of allegedly prejudicial testimony is ordinarily cured by an instruction to the jury to disregard the testimony.united states nelson,cir,cert.denied,d.in this case,the district court clearly and promptly admonished the jury not to consider webber testimony about workbook appointments.we assume that the jury followed the district court instruction.see united states maza,cir,cert.denied,d and,d.we note further that in its final charge to the jury,the district court fortified its earlier instruction by reminding the jury that t estimony that i struck from the record,or told you to disregard,is not evidence and must not be considered.considering the district court curative instruction in context with the entire trial,including the strength of the government evidence rehearsed above,we can not say that the jury was substantially swayed in spite of the instruction.see id.
fletcher also argues that the district court should have granted a mistrial because of prosecutorial misconduct during the government closing argument.in particular,fletcher asserts that the government based arguments on excluded evidence and made misleading and confusing statements to the jury.because fletcher did not object to these incidents,however,we review the district court decision not to grant a mistrial sua sponte for plain error.under plain error,the question for determination is whether the argument was so prejudicial as to have affected substantial rights resulting in a miscarriage of justice.united states griffith,cir internal quotations omitted.plain error review is extremely narrow and is limited to those errors which are so obvious or otherwise flawed as to seriously undermine the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states beck,cir.
our examination of the record reveals that fletcher is correct that the government improperly referred to excluded evidence during its closing argument.it is a principle that the government must not urge a jury to convict for reasons other than the evidence properly before the jury.see united states tulk,cir united states beckman,cir.in this case,the government twice referred,albeit briefly,to the excluded portion of webber testimony concerning fletcher use of a phonebook to divine a number for business expenses.
likewise,it is apparent from the trial transcript that during closing argument,the government erroneously referred to the mcnairs participation agreement as a workbook.the significance of these references is that fletcher handwriting appeared within that participation agreement,on a page explaining the mcnairs fees and suggested investments.fletcher contends that by erroneously referring to it as a workbook,the government suggested that fletcher helped fill out a taxpayer workbook.
in assessing whether fletcher was prejud
