ii.standard of review 
the decision of a district court to grant or deny a motion for summary judgment is reviewed de novo.adamson unum life ins.of,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
iii.discussion 
the federal tax lien act ftla grants the united states a lien upon all property and rights to property,both real and personal,of a taxpayer who has failed to pay taxes after demand has been made.see plymouth sav.bank,cir.the ftla gives certain commercial liens priority over federal tax liens.see.congress enacted this legislation to help improve the status of private secured creditors,and modernize the relationship of federal tax liens to the interests of other creditors.united states kimbell foods,d quoting.at,as reprinted in,and citing at.
section c gives a commercial lien a security interest priority over a federal tax lien if certain conditions are met.first,the security interest must be in qualified property.second,this qualified property must be covered by the terms of a written agreement entered into before the federal tax lien filing.third,this written agreement must constitute either a commercial transactions financing agreement ctfa,which is at issue in the instant case,or one of two other specified agreements.finally,the security interest must be protected under state law against a judgment arising out of an unsecured obligation.
a ctfa is an agreement entered into by a person in the course of trade or business,in order to make loans to a taxpayer to be secured by commercial financing security acquired by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of his trade or business.c a i.the loan must be made prior to or within days of the federal tax lien filing or before the lender had actual knowledge of the tax lien filing if this is earlier than days in order to qualify under this subsection.see c a ii.commercial financing security is defined as inventory,mortgages on real property,accounts receivable,and paper of a kind ordinarily arising in commercial transactions,which includes contract rights.c c c c.with respect to a ctfa,qualified property includes only commercial financing security contract rights or accounts receivable acquired by the taxpayer within days of the federal tax lien filing.c b.
when analyzing a priority dispute under ftla,courts first look to state law to determine the nature of the legal interest which the taxpayer had in the property sought to be reached by the statute.aquilino united states,d ellipsis and footnote omitted united states cache valley bank,cir.federal law creates no property rights,but does attach federally defined consequences to rights created under state law.see aquilino,at.
once a court has determined that a property interest exists under state law,the relative priority of the liens is determined under federal law.see cache valley bank,at.as noted above,for a private security interest to take priority over a federal tax lien,the interest must be in qualified property,meaning the property must be a type of commercial financing security acquired prior to,or within days after,the federal tax lien filing.see c and.
relevant treasury regulations contain definitions to aid in determining whether property is qualified under the statute.these regulations define commercial financing security such as contract rights and accounts receivable,and outline when such property is acquired.a contract right is defined as any right to payment under a contract not yet earned by performance and not evidenced by an instrument or chattel paper.c c i.an account receivable is any right to payment for goods sold or leased or for services rendered which is not evidenced by an instrument or chattel paper.id.c c ii.contract rights are acquired when a contract is made,while an account receivable is acquired when a right to payment is earned by performance.id.c d.identifiable proceeds arising from the collection or disposition of qualified property are considered to be acquired at the time qualified property is acquired.id.thus,proceeds of a contract right are considered to be acquired when the contract is made,while the proceeds from accounts receivable are acquired when the service is performed.
one difficulty encountered by courts in determining whether property is an account receivable or a contract right is that often the property can arguably be classified as both.see bremen bank trust united states,cir.cases dealing with often involve some sort of contract,and in some cases the payments made pursuant to these contracts are considered the proceeds of contract rights.see plymouth,at pine builders,united states.however,money paid pursuant to a contract sometimes is classified solely as an account receivable.see bremen bank,at holding that exclusive shipping contract did not grant any right to pay
