sidney janis owned and operated a art gallery in new york city.in,he transferred ownership of the gallery to a trust,naming himself and his sons,conrad and carroll,trustees.sidney janis died a year later,leaving conrad and carroll with ownership of the gallery through the trust.this arrangement lasted until,when the brothers terminated the trust and distributed its assets,including the gallery and its paintings,to a partnership.the brothers were the only members of the partnership,and they each held equal shares of its assets.these assets included items of artwork that the gallery owned at sidney death.this appeal from a judgment of the united states tax court assessing income tax deficiencies for the taxable years,and turns on the proper method for determining any gain or loss conrad and carroll sustained when they sold a number of these works in the years after they inherited the gallery.specifically,the issue is whether the fair market value of the artwork upon which the estate tax was calculated also constitutes the cost basis of the property for income tax purposes when it was later sold.we hold that it does where,as here,the taxpayers do not challenge the accuracy of the method used to calculate the fair market value of the works of art upon which the estate tax was calculated.
the judgment of the tax court generated two appeals.the one taken here by carroll janis and his wife,and a second taken to the court of appeals for the ninth circuit by the other janis brother,conrad,and his wife.on august,the ninth circuit affirmed the judgment of the tax court.specifically,the ninth circuit held that the value of the artwork owned by sidney janis at his death was a question of fact and that the valuation of million placed upon it by the tax court was not clearly erroneous and the janises were obligated by the duty of consistency to use the same million figure,which they employed for the purpose of calculating the estate tax,when they calculated the cost basis on their income tax returns.janis comm r of internal revenue,cir.while we likewise affirm the judgment of the tax court,we do so for different reasons,which are explained more fully in the discussion following the complicated background of this appeal.
background 
the resolution of this appeal begins with the estate tax return form filed by carroll and conrad janis as of sidney janis estate.the estate tax is imposed on the fair market value of the assets of the estate as of the date of death or a date six months from the date of death at the option of the estate.a b.the latter date,which is referred to as the alternate valuation date,was the date chosen by the estate because the value of the principal asset of the sidney janis less than the valuation thereof at the date of death.the gallery items of artwork were appraised by sotheby at,as of the alternate valuation date.sotheby appraised the underlying artwork for the janises at their retail values on an art work basis.this valuation,however,was not the fair market value of the artwork if these items were to be placed for sale in the ordinary course in the market at one time.nor did it reflect the sum that a prospective purchaser of the gallery would pay.rather,the appraisal offered by sotheby was merely hypothetical and was of little value unless adjustments were made to take into account other factors.indeed,the janises stated in their form that t here can be no question that the retail market for individual art works would not be an appropriate market in which to sell decedent interest in the gallery itself.instead,they took the position that 
the most reasonable approach to valuation is to take the underlying asset value,adjusted to reflect the actual realizable value in the context of an operating business w here there are valuable underlying assets in a business,as here,a willing buyer would try to value the business by reference to the amount he might receive from a disposition of such underlying assets in the ordinary course.
a willing buyer would not pay the aggregate retail value of each piece,because that would rule out any profit in the sale of the artwork and because it would take time and the concomitant expense of operating the business over time to obtain the retail value of each piece.a significant discount off the aggregate retail value would be required to take account of these factors.based principally on the foregoing consideration,as well as other adjustments in the appraised valuation that we pass over,including one recommended by sotheby,the janises took the position in the estate tax return that the fair market value of the artwork was discount off the sotheby appraisal.
the irs elected to audit the return.as part of the audit,the irs art advisory panel the panel reviewed of the pieces of art,which represented of the total value of the collection,and accepted the stated value of the remainder.the panel was created by the irs to assist it in reviewing selected cases involving taxpayer valuation of major art objects it is composed of nationally prominent art museum directors,curators,and art dealers appointed by the commissioner john steinkamp,fair market value,blockage,and the valuation of art,denv,internal footnotes omitted.like sotheby,the panel appraised the retail value of each work on an individual basis.by this method,it determined that the aggregate retail value of the collection was.the panel concluded,however,that this did not represent the fair market value of the artwork,because it did not reflect the reality that the gallery collection would command a much lower price if sold at approximately the same time.to reflect this,the panel recommended a discount,for a total discounted value of.
the panel invoked the necessity of applying a blockage discount to justify the reduced value.the theory behind a blockage discount,as the janises observe,is that if a large quantity of any item is added to the existing supply,the price of all such items will tend to fall.as one commentator has observed 
blockage is triggered by a determination that an item value in the marketplace does not accurately reflect its fair market value because it is part of a block which can not be sold within a reasonable time without adversely affecting price.if value is determined by reference to market prices on the basis that the taxpayer in fact could have sold the property at the market price,support for such an approach disappears when the quantity available for sale greatly exceeds the market usual volume.judicial consideration of blockage resulted from recognition that per unit market prices did not always accurately reflect the fair market value of units held as part of a large block.
steinkamp,fair market value,supra,at internal footnote omitted see also estate of comm r,cch noting that the application of a blockage discount to value an estate paintings was appropriate,because if all or a substantial portion of those works had been simultaneously offered for sale on the date of death,the availability of such a large block of works would have depressed the price to be paid for each of the individual works.while t he estate of sidney janis is not an artist estate,and does not involve a large number of works by one particular artist,but rather works by many different artists,the panel concluded that some of the general principles underlying the blockage discount applied in a somewhat modified way.
the gap between the fair market value asserted by the janises and the panel was bridged in subsequent negotiations that resulted in an agreed upon valuation of for the artwork.this sum was approximately more than the aggregate fair market value the janis brothers had claimed on the estate tax return.because it was the result of a compromise,it is not entirely clear how the parties came to that number.for our purposes,it is enough that the irs and the janis brothers agreed that it would not have been possible to sell the pieces of artwork for the retail value that each piece could bring if sold separately over time.the discount the parties used was applied to the aggregate value and the parties did not attempt to determine whether the di
