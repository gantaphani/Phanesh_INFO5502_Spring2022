this case returns to us from the supreme court with directions to conduct a thorough examination of the record to determine whether or not the defendant offer of proof was sufficient to justify the presentation of a return of capital theory to the jury.we conclude it was not and affirm the judgment of the district court.
the facts of this case have been described fully in prior appellate decisions so we need not explain the background in detail.in brief,michael boulware was the president and owner of hawaiian isles enterprises the corporation,a distributor of tobacco,water,coffee,vending machines,and video games.boulware was initially convicted on five counts of filing a false tax return in violation of,four counts of tax evasion in violation of,and conspiracy to make a false statement to a financial institution in violation of,all related to his receipt of certain funds from the corporation without disclosing the same on his income tax returns.
on appeal from the first trial,we reversed the tax convictions because of the exclusion of evidence regarding a state court adjudication of property rights in funds diverted from the corporation,and affirmed the conspiracy conviction.boulware i,at.
boulware was and convicted on the five counts of filing false tax returns and the four counts of willfully attempting to evade taxes.the government theory was that boulware diverted more than million from the corporation for his personal use,without disclosing those funds in his tax returns.boulware asserted a number of alternative theories in an attempt to show the diversions were proper including claiming the distributions were a return of capital.to that end,boulware sought to present evidence,including expert witness testimony,that the corporation had no earnings and profits in the relevant taxable years,so the money distributed by the corporation was,in fact,a return of capital up to the amount of his basis in his stock,a.
the government filed a motion in limine to prevent boulware from presenting evidence regarding the return of capital theory.it relied on circuit precedent that a defendant was required,as a prerequisite to the assertion of the theory,to show that the corporation intended the distribution to be a return of capital.see united states miller,cir.
the district court granted the motion in limine because boulware proffer failed to satisfy miller and because much of the evidence was excludable as improper legal opinion.after boulware was convicted a second time,we affirmed the district court denial of the proffer because miller required some demonstration on the part of the defendant or corporation that distributions were intended to be a return of capital.boulware ii,at.
the supreme court reversed boulware ii,holding that the miller rule upon which the panel was required to rely was incorrect,and concluding that a defendant could establish a return of capital or assert the return of capital theory without a showing of contemporaneous intent to make a distribution.at,d.as the court noted,under the relevant statutory sections,the tax consequences of a distribution by a corporation with respect to its stock depend,not on anyone purpose to return capital or to get it back,but on facts wholly independent of intent whether the corporation had earnings and profits,and the amount of the taxpayer basis for his stock.id.at.
the supreme court agreed,however,that the theory requires more than merely showing that the corporation lacked earnings and the recipient stock basis was in excess of the distribution,emphasizing that there must be evidence that the distribution was with respect to stock.id.at.the supreme court then remanded with instructions for us to reconsider the proffer in light of its decision and the entire record of the case.
we review a district court decision to admit or exclude expert opinion testimony under the deferential abuse of discretion standard.united states mccaleb,cir.we review de novo whether an offer of proof satisfies the elements of the asserted defense.united states schoon,cir.
due process requires that criminal prosecutions comport with prevailing notions of fundamental fairness and that criminal defendants be afforded a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.clark brown,cir quoting california trombetta,d.a defendant is entitled to an instruction on his theory of the case if the theory is legally cognizable and there is evidence upon which the jury could rationally find for the defendant.united states morton,cir.
on remand,the question for us is whether the tender of evidence to support the return of capital theory was sufficient to allow the presentation of the evidence and theory to the jury.as we noted in united states kayser,cir 
the legal standard is generous a defendant is entitled to an instruction concerning his theory of the case if the theory is legally sound and evidence in the case makes it applicable,even if the evidence is weak,insufficient,inconsistent,or of doubtful credibility.united states washington,cir.a defendant needs to show only that there is evidence upon which the jury could rationally sustain the defense.united states jackson,cir per curiam.
on the other hand,a trial court may preclude a defense theory where the evidence,as described in the defendant offer of proof,is insufficient as a matter of law to support the proffered defense.united states dorrell,cir.counsel must also articulate every ground on which the evidence is admissible,since a ground not identified at trial will not provide a basis for reversal on appeal.jack weinstein and margaret berger,weinstein federal evidence,joseph mclaughlin,matthew bender.ed see also hudspeth comm r,cir holding that failure to identify ground of admissibility limited appellate review to plain error.
in support of his assertion of the return of capital theory,boulware made an offer of proof as to expert testimony and evidence regarding corporate earnings.
we need not consider whether boulware proffer of expert testimony satisfied the requirement that the defendant minimally establish all the elements of the asserted theory because the trial court denied the proffer on alternate and adequate grounds.in addition to precluding the testimony on the basis of miller,the district court excluded the expert testimony because it constituted a legal opinion.it did not abuse its discretion in doing so.united states scholl,cir see also aguilar international longshoremen union,cir noting matters of law are for the court determination,not that of an expert witness.
here,boulware expert sought to testify that the corporate distributions were legally,either because they were loans,monies placed in trust,or returns of capital.the trial court exclusion of the expert testimony to the extent that it constituted a legal opinion was well within its discretion.see nationwide transp.fin.cass info,cir a n expert witness can not give an opinion as to her legal conclusion,an opinion on an ultimate issue of law.quoting hangarter provident life accident ins,cir.
boulware sought to introduce other evidence in support of his return of capital theory.specifically,boulware wished to introduce evidence that the corporation had earnings in its tax returns to show that the corporate distributions to boulware could be deemed a constructive dividend or return of capital to boulware which may or may not be income depending on whether the corporation had earnings or profits for the years when the monies were obtained by boulware.
after a careful examination of the record,we conclude that the district court properly declined the offer of proof as to the return of capital theory because the offer failed to satisfy all the elements of the theory.as the supreme court explained in boulware iii,the return of capital theory requires a corporate distribution with respect to a corporation stock,the absence of corporate earnings or profits,and the stockholder stock basis be in excess of the value of the distribution.at.
the admission of evidence of corporate earnings,by itself,is plainly insufficient to satisfy the elements necessary to assert a return of capital theory.however,in eval
