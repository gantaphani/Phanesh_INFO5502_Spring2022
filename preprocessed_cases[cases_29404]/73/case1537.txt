introduction 
at issue in this consolidated original proceeding is whether the public utilities commission the puc has the authority to implement the electric program investment charge epic.epic requires electric utility corporations serving california to collect a surcharge on their ratepayers electricity bills to fund renewable energy research,development,and demonstration projects with the aim of making electricity service cheaper,safer,and more reliable for the corporations own ratepayers.southern california edison sce,one of the three large utilities required to collect the surcharge,petitioned for writ of review to challenge the puc two decisions creating epic.we hold that the puc possesses the constitutional and statutory authority to implement epic epic is not an unlawful delegation of the puc authority and the surcharge is not a tax requiring legislative enactment,but a valid regulatory fee.accordingly,we deny the writ petitions.
factual and procedural background 
background 
as part of its deregulation of california electricity industry in pub,et the legislature included in the electric utility industry restructuring act a requirement that the puc direct utilities to collect revenue for research and development through a surcharge on electricity sales,known as a system benefits charge.the legislature express purpose was to provide funding for programs that,inter alia,enhance the reliability of the state electric system and provide californians with the benefits of energy efficiency and conservation,research and development,and the operation of existing,and the development of new and renewable,resource technologies,subds.a b.
to finance the system benefits charge,the legislature directed the puc to order california three large utilities regulated by the puc,sce,pacific gas and electric,and san diego gas and electric to collect a nonbypassable charge a fee that all consumers must pay from ratepayers.the charge is a flat of usage,and is a separate component of electric bills,segregated from other revenue,to be used for these identified system benefits,subds.a b.
the requirement that utilities collect the system benefits charge originally expired in.former,subd.c.however,again declaring it to be the intent of the legislature and the policy of the state to provide safe,reliable,affordable,and environmentally sustainable electric service by continuing to make prudent investments in energy efficiency,renewable energy,and research and development,the legislature enacted section,popularly called the public goods charge.as with section,section requires that customers of electrical corporations pay a nonbypassable charge to provide these public and system benefits,subd.b.the legislature directed the puc to order the three electric corporations to collect per year starting in,specific dollar amounts for energy efficiency and conservation activities,renewable energy,and research,development and demonstration rd d,adjusted for inflation or growth in electric commodity sales,subd.d.the statute assigns administrative duties for renewable energy and rd d to the california energy resources conservation and development commission the cec,while placing oversight responsibilities with both the puc and the cec,subd.e see also,pub.resources code.
the legislature extended the funding levels for the public goods charge through,subd.c.specifically,section,subdivision c directed the puc to require each electrical corporation to collect the surcharge beginning january,and ending january,subd.c.
on the eve of the expiration,the legislature once more considered whether to extend the public goods charge funding in subdivision c of section.despite a report by the legislative analysis office finding a need for a continued state role in research and development,and recommending continued investment,the proponents in the legislature did not garner the necessary supermajority of votes.assem.bill reg.sess.
in,governor brown sent a letter to the puc requesting that it take action under the puc authority to ensure that programs like those supported by the public goods charge are instituted and hopefully at their current levels.
the puc initiated a bifurcated rulemaking to address whether and how to preserve funding for ratepayer benefits associated with the renewable electric energy and rd d portions of the expiring public goods charge.in phase,the puc determined whether to continue to impose any charge for these programs,and if so,how much,how to impose it,and for how long.phase addressed more detailed program design,oversight,and administrative issues related to how the funding would be allocated and by whom.
after receiving comments and replies,the puc issued the phase decision adopting epic,a program to conduct rd d into,and market support and facilitation of,safe,and reliable renewable energy sources and technology for the benefit of the electric corporations ratepayers,and to fund the program through a surcharge on those ratepayers commencing january.the puc initially imposed epic on an interim basis,subject to refund,until either it issued its final decision in phase,or until january,whichever came first.
the puc determined its authority to institute epic lay in california constitution,article xii,and sections and,along with other statutes that promote renewable energy and rd d programs,many of which authorities predate the public goods charge.the puc observed that epic was not a continuation of the section public goods charge,but a new surcharge for a different program within the puc existing constitutional and statutory authority.among other differences,epic concerns renewable energy sources only,and does not include the energy efficiency or conservation components of the public goods charge.the puc reasoned that although the public goods charge funding had expired,nothing prohibited it from adopting a different program.
the phase decision issued six months later,extended epic through and established a detailed framework for oversight,administration,and use of the collected funds.the primary and mandatory guiding principle of epic is to provide electricity ratepayer benefits,defined as promoting greater reliability,lower costs,and increased safety unlike the public goods charge,which included funding for energy efficiency and conservation,the puc limited epic to provid ing public interest investments in applied research and development,technology demonstration and deployment,market support,and market facilitation,of clean energy technologies and approaches for the benefit of electricity ratepayers of the three large utilities.italics added.c lean energy technologies includes renewable generation the puc determined that the utilities should collect million per year,which amount put epic at the same funding levels as the public goods charge,minus the energy efficiency component.the puc reasoned that without adequate funding,the benefits to ratepayers of any program for renewable energy technology and rd d would be lost.
the phase decision set out a detailed procedure for administration of the epic funds by both the utilities and the cec.the puc determined that the utility corporations should administer percent of the revenue and use that money for technology demonstration and deployment activities on the electricity grid,which constitutes about percent of the budget devoted to this activity,as the utilities own the infrastructure on which the technologies are being tested and may ultimately become the consumers of those technologies.the puc assigned to the cec the task of administering the remaining percent of the funds based on the cec expertise in energy issues and experience in administering activities that are in nature,including applied rd d,and the cec disinterest in any particular company or solution.the puc was also alert to assure that epic funds be used only for epic purposes by protecting the epic funds from potential diversion to other purposes unrelated to epic by the state budget.accordingly,the puc decided that administrative and staffing costs would be transferred by the utility corporations to the cec on a quarterly basis.f unding should not be used to support activities or efforts that are duplicative of efforts that are being undertaken elsewhere or that are more expensive than necessary to achieve the goals.and,taking into account sce endorsement,the puc determined that funds used for grants or contracts with third parties would be transferred from the utility corporations to the cec only after the contract or grant has been approved by the utilities and the cec.finally,to protect the electricity ratepayers,funds administered by the cec are not to be used for any purposes associated with publicly owned utility activities.
the puc retains oversight and policymaking duties under epic.it reviews,modifies,and approves detailed investment plans the epic administrators,the cec and the utilities,must submit triennially.the investment plans must contain specific information to aid the puc evaluation and be sufficiently detailed to justify receipt of a grant of ratepayer funds from the puc to the cec.all grants and loans must meet the tight criteria approved by the puc who expects a clear nexus with the goals of cost,safety,and reliability benefits for the electricity corporations ratepayers.
very soon after the phase decision was issued,the legislature enacted public resources code sections through,establishing the electric program investment charge fund the epic fund,a special account in the state treasury into which the epic money administered by the cec is to be deposited.pub.resources code.section requires the puc to forward the epic fund money to the cec on a quarterly basis,subd.b,and requires the cec to administer the epic fund as directed by the puc,subds.a,c d.
while this case was under consideration,on september,governor brown signed public resources code sections and into law.section,effective september,requires the cec,among other things,to award epic funds for projects that will benefit electricity ratepayers and lead to technological advancement and breakthroughs to overcome the barriers that prevent the achievement of the state statutory energy goals pub.resources code,subd.a.the statute also sets out the terms that are imposed as a condition for receipt of epic loans or grants,the reporting requirements,the process for tracking progress and outcomes,and the cec annual report to the legislature,among other things,subds.b g.section precludes the puc from collecting funds under epic in an annual amount greater than the amount set forth in the phase decision.ibid.
the instant proceeding 
sce,who provides electrical service in portions of california southern cal.edison public utilities,supra,th at,sought rehearing to challenge the puc phase and phase decisions.in response,the puc issued,which modified its phase decision to add authority for its actions,and denied rehearing.
before the puc addressed sce phase rehearing request,sce filed two petitions for writ of review in this court.the first petition challenges the phase and rehearing decisions and the second petition challenges the phase decision.this court consolidated the two writ petitions and held them in abeyance pending the puc disposition of sce application for rehearing of the phase decision.thereafter,the puc issued,which made immaterial modifications to its phase decision and denied rehearing.sce filed its amended petition for writ of review challenging,and

the standard of review 
section allows litigants seeking to challenge decisions of the puc to petition this court directly for a writ of review.southern cal.edison public utilities,supra,th at.the petitioner bears the burden to establish the grounds for setting aside the decision.utility consumers action network public utilities com.th.
our review of puc decisions is limited to determining on the basis of the whole administrative record whether the puc acted without,or in excess of,its powers or jurisdiction,or has not proceeded in the manner required by law,subd.a.there is no contention here that the puc did not proceed according to law when implementing epic and so we are tasked only with determining whether epic falls within the puc authority.
as the puc is not an ordinary administrative agency,but a constitutional body with broad legislative and judicial powers,its decisions are presumed valid.citations.southern cal.edison public utilities,supra,th at utility consumers action network public utilities com.th.generally,we give presumptive value to a public agency interpretation of a statute within its administrative jurisdiction because the agency may have special familiarity with satellite legal and regulatory issues,leading to expertise expressed in its interpretation of the statute.citation.pacific bell wireless,llc public utilities com.th.therefore,the puc interpretation of the public utilities code should not be disturbed unless it fails to bear a reasonable relation to statutory purposes and language citation.ibid.when the issue is the scope of the puc jurisdiction,however,the general rule of deference to interpretations of statutes subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of agencies does not apply ibid.
the puc has authority to implement epic.
epic is a proper exercise of the puc power.
the puc is a constitutional body with duties,functions and powers notwithstanding it is a state agency.consumers lobby against monopolies public utilities com.cal d,clam,disagreed with on another point in kowis howard cal th,fn.the california constitution confers broad power on the puc to regulate public utilities,which includes fixing rates and establishing rules for those utilities.cal,art xii.the puc authority includes not only administrative but also legislative and judicial powers.san diego gas electric superior court cal th,covalt cal,art xii,t he commission may fix rates,establish rules,examine records,issue subpoenas,administer oaths,take testimony,punish for contempt for all public utilities subject to its jurisdiction.
the puc powers are not limited to those expressly enumerated in the constitution.clam,supra,cal d at.the legislature has plenary power to confer additional authority on the puc.cal,art xii,italics added the legislature has plenary power,unlimited by the other provisions of this constitution but consistent with this article,to confer additional authority and jurisdiction upon the public utilities commission.
pursuant to this plenary power,the legislature enacted section which vests the puc with expansive authority clam,supra,cal d at to supervise,to regulate every public utility,and do all things which are necessary and convenient in the exercise of such power and jurisdiction,regardless of whether it is specifically designated in the public utilities code or in addition thereto,italics added pg e public utilities com.th.
the primary limiting factor on puc jurisdiction is that the puc action must be cognate and germane to utility regulation.pg e public utilities,supra,th at.as long as the authority sought is cognate and germane to utility regulation,the puc authority under section has been liberally construed.citations,quoting from clam,supra,cal d at pp.covalt,supra,cal th at.the other important limitation on the authority conferred by section is a specific statutory directive that prohibits the puc action.pg e,supra,at southern california edison peevey cal th.
given the puc vast,inherent power to take any action that is cognate and germane to utility regulation,supervision,and rate setting,unless specifically barred by statute,there is no question that the puc has the inherent authority to create epic and to impose fees necessary to carry out that program.epic directs electric utility corporations to invest in research into,and development of,renewable electric energy sources and technologies designed to lower costs,increase safety,and improve reliability of electricity service for the benefit of these corporations own customers,and fixes a surcharge on those same ratepayers to recover the cost.
in addition to the puc inherent authority to implement epic,the legislature has directed the puc to develop renewable energy resources and technologies,much of which authority predates the public goods charge and section.the legislature declared that the principal goal of electric utilities resource planning and investment shall be to minimize the cost to society of the reliable energy services that are provided by electricity,and to improve the environment and to encourage the diversity of energy sources through,among other things,development of renewable energy resources,such as wind,solar,biomass,and geothermal energy,subd.a,italics added.toward that end,the legislature first mandates that the puc shall direct that a specific portion of future electric generating capacity needed for california be reserved or set aside for renewable resources until the puc completes an electrical generation procurement methodology that values the environmental and diversity costs and benefits associated with various generation technologies,italics added.second,the legislature commands that the puc shall require each electrical corporation to identify a separate component of its rates to collect the revenues used to fund programs that enhance system reliability and provide benefits,defined as,inter alia,i operation and development of existing and new and emerging eligible renewable energy resources,subds.a,b b,italics added.third,section empowers the puc to include in its,expenses for rd.sections,and are not simply policy goals as sce argues shall is mandatory.common cause board of supervisors cal d.the puc interpretation of these statutes is reasonably related to their purposes and language.pacific bell wireless,llc public utilities,supra,th at.
furthermore,epic is authorized by the remainder of section,which is still valid notwithstanding the sunset of the public goods charge funding mechanism of subdivision c.section is found the reliable electric service investments act,ch,art.article,which sets forth the unmistakable intent of the legislature and the policy of california to make prudent investments in renewable energy,and research,development and demonstration to ensure that californians continue to receive safe,reliable environmentally sustainable electric service,subd.a,subds.b,c e e.to implement this legislative intent,section continues to require that every customer of an electrical corporation pay a nonbypassable system benefits charge to fund,inter alia,such renewable energy and rd,subd.b.more particularly,section still directs that the puc shall order san diego gas and electric company,southern california edison company,and pacific gas and electric company to collect system benefits charges,subd.d,italics added and subdivision b still requires that public utilities shall continue to collect and administer system benefits charges pursuant to section.finally,section continues to place administrative responsibilities with the puc and the cec,subds.e f.
sce disagrees that section remains valid.observing that the defunct subdivision c funded the programs authorized pursuant to this section italics added see fn.ante,sce argues the expiration of section,subdivision c necessarily entails the expiration of the policy goals that are part of that program,as articulated in sections,and,subdivision a,in article.sce opportunistically focuses on the words programs authorized pursuant to this section to argue that the failure to extend minimum funding levels for the public goods charge somehow worked to gut the entirety of article of the public utilities code.not so.p ursuant to this section means just that pursuant to section.we certainly can not conclude from the mere failure to extend the funding in subdivision c of section that the legislature intended to obliterate wholesale article,the reliable electric service investments act,or the policy declaration in section,or even the remainder of section.the legislature knows how to clearly terminate an entire program and specify the impact on funding.the legislature spelled out the elimination of an entire program in education code section the following programs shall sunset on june,c bilingual education italics added see alejo torlakson th,effect of,was to sunset the whole bilingual program and,detailed impact on funding.although the legislature could abolish the entire reliable electric service investment act it had created,nothing in the mere failure to extend funding in subdivision c of section spells out the elimination of the entire public goods charge program.had the legislature intended to eliminate the whole of article or even just the policy declaration and mandates in section,it would have done so more clearly and expressly.
we can discern no particular intent from the legislature failure to enact an extension of subdivision c of section.courts can rarely determine from the failure of the legislature to pass a particular bill what the intent of the legislature is with respect to existing law.ingersoll palmer cal d,fn.omitted grupe development superior court cal th,dyna med,fair employment housing com.cal d,unpassed bills,as evidences of legislative intent,have little value.without an explicit and clear declaration that it intended to reverse itself on longstanding electric energy policy and directives to the puc,we decline to infer from the failure to extend funding levels for the public goods charge that the legislature intended to repeal its repeated declarations of state policy and its directives to the puc in multiple parts of the public utilities code to invest in and develop safe,reliable,renewable energy,rd d,and the system benefits charge,subd.a.
indeed,not only has the legislature directed the puc to promote renewable energy technology and rd d through programs funded by a rate surcharge,but it has not enacted legislation to prohibit epic.we reject any suggestion by sce that the failure to extend the funding mechanism in subdivision c of section functions to bar epic.courts uphold actions cognate and germane to utility regulation absent a specific legislative directive prohibiting the puc from enforcing conditions it is empowered to impose.pg e public utilities,supra,th at,italics added.as our supreme court explained,i f puc lacked substantive authority to take the action at issue there,it was not for lack of inherent authority,but because this action was barred by some specific statutory limit on puc power to set rates.citation.southern california edison peevey,supra,cal th at.the mere failure to pass legislation is manifestly not the equivalent of a specific legislative directive prohibiting epic.pg e public utilities,supra,at.certainly,the legislature could have barred epic.at the same time it enabled the implementation of epic in senate bill enacting pub.resources code,the legislature barred the puc action with respect to several programs.bill,supra,ch,enacting stripping puc of authority to establish a entity with money or to enter into contracts with entities enacting restricting puc ability to distribute,expend,or encumber money received by the puc as the result of a puc proceeding or judicial action.no legislative enactment expressly prohibits the puc from collecting the epic surcharge.
a good example of a specific statutory directive prohibiting the puc action is assembly bill reg.sess.chapter,section.by way of background,in april,the puc created the california institute for climate solutions the cics and directed the cics to administer grants for research on reducing greenhouse gases and adapting to climate change.three months later,the legislature passed assembly bill,section,which states the public utilities commission shall not execute an order,or collect any rate revenues,in rulemaking order instituting rulemaking to establish the california institute for climate solutions,and shall not adopt or execute any similar order or decision establishing a research program for climate change unless expressly authorized to do so by statute.italics added.assembly bill specifically prohibits the cics but does not address epic,sce contention notwithstanding.unlike the cics,epic is not a research program for climate change.it is a program to fund research and development activities to benefit the electricity corporations ratepayers.that some approved research projects may result in innovations that reduce greenhouse gases,does not transform epic into a research program for climate change prohibited by assembly bill accordingly,although it prohibited the cics,assembly bill does not even begin to bar epic.
to the contrary,the legislature ratified epic by creating the epic fund in the state treasury as soon as the puc created the program,and again when it set forth criteria for the cec and limited the funding levels to those set in the puc decisions.pub.resources code.public resources code sections through do not create puc jurisdiction to implement epic.rather,these successive statutes make plain the legislature approval of epic irrespective of the outcome of this proceeding.professional engineers in california government schwarzenegger cal th,revised budget act does not grant governor authority to impose unpaid furloughs on certain executive branch employees,but language in bill embodies legislature ratification or endorsement of plan already in effect.
in sum,epic is cognate and germane to the puc inherent power to regulate and supervise utilities as the program governs the cost,safety,and reliability of electricity provided by electric utility corporations,and fixes rates.in addition,the puc has explicit authority to require utilities to collect a system benefits charge for renewable energy and rd d projects.finally,rather than to prohibit it,the legislature has twice endorsed epic.
sce remaining arguments are unavailing.
sce disputes that section provides puc authority for epic.it reasons that together,sections,and authorize the puc to set rates to reimburse utilities for the costs the utilities incur for rd d because,it argues,section concerns programs proposed by electrical and gas corporations.section reads,the commission shall consider the following guidelines in evaluating the research,development,and demonstration programs proposed by electrical and gas corporations.italics added.nothing in these statutes limits the puc to surcharging rates only for rd d that is proposed by electrical corporations.section provides simply that if a utility corporation proposes an rd d project,the puc must consider the statute guidelines in evaluating that program nor is section so specific or limited.as noted,section reads,for purposes of setting the rates to be charged by every electrical corporation,gas corporation,heat corporation or telephone corporation for the services or commodities furnished by it,the commission may allow the inclusion of expenses for research and development.italics added.read together,as sce observes we must do medical board superior court th,section authorizes the puc to allow inclusion of expenses for research and development when setting rates and section sets forth the criteria for the puc to consider when evaluating rd d proposals made by the utilities these statutes do not limit the puc to authorizing charges for rd d only obviously,epic does not conflict with section that statute permits the puc to include rd d costs in rate setting.more important,epic rd d is otherwise authorized by sections,subdivision b,and,subdivision b.
sce contends that the puc lacks authority to establish epic because,it reasons,notwithstanding section authorizes the puc to regulate and supervise utilities,that utility regulation means the regulation of the operation of the utilities,which regulation sce asserts is really only set ting rates.sce argues that epic is different from traditional regulation because epic funds are paid to private parties for rd d rather than to sce,and so the puc is not regulating the utility operations so much as its billing operations.thus,sce argues,the epic revenues are not being used for purposes related to sce utility operations or expenses.
the puc power is not as restricted as sce paints it.the puc authority extends beyond mere.clam,supra,cal d at to regulate means to govern or direct according to rule or to bring under the control of law or constituted authority.webster new internat.dict.ed.regulating is exactly what the puc is doing by acting pursuant to sections,and to implement a program for the research,development,and application of renewable electricity sources and technologies activities directly related to sce operations for the benefit of the electricity corporations ratepayers and to recover the cost through a rate surcharge on those same ratepayers.this is not a novel exercise of puc authority.in covalt,the supreme court established that section and other statutes empowered the puc to adopt policies about whether the conduct of electric utilities are a risk to public health and to order utilities to participate in research into exposure patterns,engineering,and policy options,and to recover the cost of that research from ratepayers.see covalt,supra,cal th at.sce suggestion that the research in covalt was to be conducted only by the utilities is unsupported.the puc in covalt directed the utility corporations to participate in education and research programs and to participate in an experimental research program to be conducted by the federal government.re potential health effects of electric and magnetic fields of utility facilities d,italics added see also covalt,supra,at.clearly,therefore,epic,which directs utility corporations to administer research programs,falls within the puc authority.
sce contends that the puc has no authority to establish epic to collect revenue from ratepayers on behalf of the cec or recipients of grants,which are not utilities and which the puc does not have the jurisdiction to regulate the assertion is wrong.the programs the supreme court recognized in covalt were administered by the department of health services dhs and the federal government.covalt,supra,cal th at,re potential health effects of electric and magnetic fields of utility facilities,supra,d at,the research and education programs which we are adopting today will be implemented in large part by the dhs,who we are naming as the research and education program managers.furthermore,section continues to direct that both the puc and the cec administer the public goods charge,subds.e f and the legislature has endorsed the cec administrative role in epic.pub.resources code.factually,the puc is not regulating the cec as a utility.as amicus observes,the cec role is to administer epic for the puc.epic establishes a surcharge to provide,safe,and reliable renewable energy sources for the benefit of the electric corporations ratepayers.apart from the fact that epic requires the utilities to administer percent of the revenue,negating the contention epic is entirely run by another state agency,the puc maintains tight control over the epic program through its oversight and approval power,sce suggestion to the contrary notwithstanding.
sce also relies on a legislative counsel opinion written in july determining the puc did not have the authority to impose epic.the opinions of the legislative counsel are not binding on this court.people united states currency th.opinions of the legislative counsel ordinarily are prepared to assist the legislature in its consideration of pending legislation citation,and therefore such opinions often shed light on legislative intent.john well child family center schwarzenegger cal th,italics added.however,when the legislative counsel opinion addresses a matter other than pending legislation,such as when the opinion expresses a view concerning the constitutionality of an action taken by another branch of government,it is entitled to no more weight than the views of the parties.ibid.opinion by legislative counsel that governor exceeded his authority in vetoing items in bill entitled to no more weight than the views of the parties.here,the opinion sce cites was written by the legislative counsel two weeks after the legislature endorsed epic by creating the epic fund pub.resources code,and the opinion discusses a view about the puc authority,not that of the legislature,to impose epic.the legislature did not thereafter revoke or amend the epic fund legislation it went on to enact public resources code sections and.we give this legislative counsel opinion no more weight than the arguments of the parties here and disagree with its conclusions.
accordingly,none of sce arguments is persuasive.
epic does not involve an unlawful delegation of authority from the puc to the cec.
sce contends that under epic,the puc orders the transfer of epic funds to the cec,which has the discretion to award rd d grants.it asserts,citing the phase decision,that the puc explicitly states that it will transfer responsibility to the cec,and argues that this establishes that the puc is unlawful ly delegating its authority to the cec.italics added.
sce is factually incorrect.the phase decision,from which sce purports to quote,did not create epic administrative process that was accomplished in the phase decision.moreover,sce misquotes the language cited in phase.there,the puc acknowledged that it can not delegate its authority and responsibility to determine recoverable costs,programs rules,regulations and policies,but does have authority to transfer the day to day administration of a program,as it does with a variety of programs.italics added.
nor is sce legal argument persuasive.generally,powers conferred upon public agencies and officers which involve the exercise of judgment or discretion are in the nature of public trusts and can not be surrendered or delegated to subordinates in the absence of statutory authorization.citations.california sch.employees personnel commission cal d.however,an agency delegation is lawful if there has been no total abdication of authority.taylor crane cal d.thus,public agencies may delegate the performance of ministerial tasks california sch.employees personnel commission,supra,at while retaining for themselves general policymaking power to determine the terms and conditions.taylor crane,supra,at.moreover,an agency subsequent approval or ratification of an act delegated to a subordinate validates the act,which becomes the act of the agency itself.citations.california sch.employees personnel commission,supra,at.
based on these authorities,the puc has not unlawfully delegated authority to the cec.epic designates both the cec and the utilities as administrators of epic,while the puc retains oversight and control of the funding,grants and loans,and policy.under epic,the detailed investment plans of the dual administrators must be approved triennially by the puc,who may modify the plans if necessary.those plans must be presented with a high level of detail and address specific items of mapping,the amount of funds to be allocated to particular programs,justifications for the allocation proposed,informational summaries,the type of funding mechanism,and eligibility criteria metrics,among other things.additionally,there will be an independent evaluation of the epic program to be conducted in.the puc only allows the extension of grants and loans showing the required nexus to program goals.that the cec may shift up to percent of the funds between categories,as sce observes,for administrative flexibility undermines neither the cec obligation to use the funds for epic purposes nor the puc power to oversee the entire program shifted funds remain in epic and may only be shifted among categories.nor has sce pointed to any statute that prohibits the puc from delegating the administration to the cec.to the contrary,the legislature has ratified epic pub.resources code,and specifies that the cec shall administer the epic fund pub.resources code,subd.a,italics added,and directs that the cec follow very specific criteria in developing and implementing epic pub.resources code.in short,not only has the puc retained its oversight authority,but its review and approval process functions as a ratification of the administrators actions.as a consequence,epic does not constitute an unlawful delegation of authority.
the puc is acutely aware of the difference between delegable program administration and nondelegable policy and oversight duty.in in re distributed generation and distributed energy resources,wl,the puc use d the term program oversight to mean those activities that involve formal on program elements,funding levels and ratemaking,which are the lawful obligations of the public utility commission by contrast,p rogram administration involves operations requiring little discretion and in compliance with state rules and decisions.id.at.this expression of terms is entirely consistent with the puc approach in epic,which in turn complies with taylor and california sch.employees,as the puc retains policymaking authority to determine terms and conditions while delegating the administrative tasks to the utilities and the cec.taylor crane,supra,cal d at california sch.employees personnel commission,supra,cal d at see also in re commission future energy efficiency policies,wl,at pp,puc concerned it could not exert policy and oversight control over independent administrators through contractual relationships.

sce contends that epic is a tax,and as such,violates article xiii a,section.starting with the premise that the legislature clearly considered the public goods charge a tax because it failed to extend the funding levels in subdivision c of section by a supermajority,sce then attempts to demonstrate how epic does not fall within any of the enumerated exceptions to the definition of tax in proposition.sce further asserts that we may not rely on the definition of a regulatory fee in sinclair paint,supra,cal th,as that case predates proposition,which measure was enacted to undercut that opinion.
the term tax has no fixed meaning and the distinction between taxes and fees is frequently blurred,taking on different meanings in different contexts.california farm bureau federation state water resources control bd.cal th,california farm bureau.generally,tax refers to a compulsory payment made to the government or remitted to the government.taxes ordinarily are imposed to raise revenue for the government.citations.schmeer county of los angeles,supra,th at holding ordinance requiring stores to charge customers cents per plastic carryout bag not a tax because revenue not remitted to county.

we conclude epic is not a tax.proposition plainly defines a tax as a change in state statute which results in a higher tax cal,art.xiii a,subd.a,italics added,not to a commission decision to regulate utility corporations rd d into renewable energy for their own electricity customers and to charge a fee to pay for that activity.western states petroleum board of equalization cal th,in cal.const,art.xiii a,subd.a b y its terms applies only to a change in state statute which results in any taxpayer paying a higher tax not to an agency decision to modify an administrative rule italics added.epic was not created by a change in a state statute.to be sure,the legislature recognized it could only extend the public goods charge in section,subdivision c by a vote of at least of both of its houses.but,epic is not the public goods charge and not a state statute designed to result in a higher tax.
this is because epic is a valid regulatory fee.proposition places on t he state the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a levy,charge,or other exaction is not a tax,that the amount is no more than necessary to cover the reasonable costs of the governmental activity,and that the manner in which those costs are allocated to a payor bear a fair or reasonable relationship to the payor burdens on,or benefits received from,the governmental activity.cal,art.xiii a,subd.d.
n early verbatim language was used before proposition was passed to assess whether a charge was a tax on the one hand,or a special tax or regulatory fee on the other hand.griffith city of santa cruz th.griffith explained,as stated in san diego gas electric san diego county air pollution control dist.d,a special tax under section of california constitution article xiii a does not embrace fees charged in connection with regulatory activities which do not exceed the reasonable cost of providing services necessary to the activity for which the fee is charged and are not levied for unrelated revenue purposes.citations.griffith city of santa cruz,at.to show a fee is not a tax,the state must show that the estimated costs of the service or regulatory activity,and the basis for determining the manner in which the costs are apportioned,so that charges allocated to a payor bear a fair or reasonable relationship to the payor burdens on or benefits from the regulatory activity.california farm bureau,supra,cal th at,quoting from sinclair paint,supra,cal th at california of scientists department of fish game th,applying sinclair paint test.as california farm bureau observed,t he scope of a regulatory fee is somewhat flexible and is related to the overall purposes of the regulatory governmental action.california farm bureau,at,italics added.to be valid,a fee must be linked to,but not exceed,the overall cost of the government regulation.an excessive fee that is used to generate general revenue becomes a tax,italics added.
utilizing this test,which dates back to,there are many kinds of fees and charges that have been held not to be taxes.sinclair paint,supra,cal th at,and cases cited therein.sinclair paint held a charge similar to the aims of epic,namely to mitigate actual or anticipated adverse effects of the fee payor operations,when it bears a reasonable relationship to those adverse effects,would be a regulatory fee and not a tax.id.at.evans city of san jose th,held that a charge on downtown businesses to decorate and provide music to attract more business was not a tax because the promotion inures to the benefit of businesses and landlords within the bid because in making the downtown area a safer,cleaner,and more economically viable area,the business license holder is specially benefitted id.at.finally,california farm bureau held that a charge imposed on water appropriators by the state water resources control board was not a tax because the fee in that case did not authorize the collection of any more than the administrative costs incurred.california farm bureau,supra,cal th at.
after the passage of proposition,griffith city of santa cruz,supra,th addressed the question whether fees associated with an ordinance calling for annual inspections of all unoccupied residential rental properties within the city limits was an invalid tax.id.at analyzing proposition,cal,art.xiii d,containing the same test as proposition.applying the test just cited,griffith held the fees before it were expressly exempted from the proposition definition of tax because the city proved that the fees were imposed to cover the cost of performing inspections.griffith,at.
likewise,epic is a regulatory fee and not a tax.the puc has demonstrated that the fees charged in connection with epic do not exceed that necessary to cover the rd d into renewable energy as the fees mirror the amounts in the public goods charge minus the energy efficiency component and the legislature has since approved that amount.pub.resources code.furthermore,the puc demonstrated that epic bears a reasonable relationship to the ratepayers benefits because the charge is designed to benefit the utility corporation ratepayers only by making their electricity cheaper,safer,and more reliable.the remaining ratepayers,those of california public utilities,are still obligated to pay their own system benefits and public goods charge for renewable energy,subd.a,subd.b.furthermore,the administrative procedure,tightly controlled by the puc,describes how epic revenues will be allocated.thus,the fees charged are directly linked to the activities performed under epic and the scope of epic is related to the overall cost of the governmental regulation.california farm bureau,supra,cal th at,italics added.
sce argues that epic is intended to benefit more than its ratepayers and asserts the puc has declared that the program addresses statewide energy policy and social objectives.however,the possibility that some epic research may incidentally provide a social benefit to the public at large does not transform epic into a tax where a discrete group,namely the utility corporations ratepayers,is specifically benefitted.evans city of san jose,supra,th at.permissible fees need not be finely calibrated to the precise benefit each individual fee payor might derive.what a fee can not do is exceed the reasonable cost of regulation with the generated surplus used for general revenue collection.an excessive fee that is used to generate general revenue becomes a tax.california farm bureau,supra,cal th at.the policy sce cites is simply the impetus for epic,while the epic charge is designed to specifically benefit a discrete group by reducing the electricity costs borne solely by the utility corporations own ratepayers.
not only is the charge linked to the cost of the activity,but epic is not imposed to generate general revenue.california farm bureau,supra,cal th at.the puc consciously sought to protect the epic funds from potential diversion to other purposes unrelated to epic by the state budget.the puc and the legislature arranged for the payment of epic administration costs and extension of epic grants and loans in a manner designed to prevent diversion for purposes.pub.resources code.utilizing an proposal,funds for grants or contracts will be transferred from utility corporations to the cec only after the contract or grant has been approved by the utilities and the cec.sce contention is thus unavailing that there is no assurance that epic funds will be used solely to support rd d with the result epic is a tax epic funds are to be used for grants or loans for renewable research and development and administration of such grants or loans for the ratepayers benefit.pub.resources code,subds.c d.epic revenues are not to be used for any purposes associated with utilities.the epic money is to be placed in the epic fund for purposes.pub.resources code.accordingly,as epic is a regulatory fee,with the result it is not a tax 
b.the separation of powers clause 
sce next argues that epic violates the separation of powers clause by usurping the legislature taxing authority.sce argues regardless of whether proposition applies by its literal terms to the puc,the court should apply its definition of tax in determining whether the puc,in adopting epic,has invaded the legislature exclusive prerogative to impose a tax.
the separation of powers doctrine,derived from article iii,section of the
