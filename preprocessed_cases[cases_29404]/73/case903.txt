when can you trust your accountant advice about when your taxes are due that is the question we face today.appellant peter knappe,acting as the executor of an estate,asked his accountant to apply for an extension of the deadline to file the return from the internal revenue service irs.the accountant told knappe that the deadline had been extended one year,when in fact it had been extended only six months.acting on the bad advice,knappe filed the tax return several months late,and the irs assessed significant penalties against the estate.knappe initiated this action in the central district of california,seeking a refund of the penalty.the district court granted summary judgment to the government on the ground that knappe had not shown reasonable cause to excuse the penalty,as that term is used in a.we affirm.
background 
ingeborg pattee died on november,leaving behind a substantial estate.her will named as the executor of the estate peter knappe,a longtime friend and successful businessman.because knappe had no prior experience serving as the executor of an estate or preparing an return,he enlisted the help of francis burns,a certified public accountant.burns had worked as a corporate tax accountant for knappe company for many years,and knappe had always been satisfied with his work.in december,burns told knappe that the pattee estate would need to file a united states estate tax return,irs form.he also correctly informed knappe that the deadline to file the return was nine months from the date of pattee death august.
at some point before that deadline,knappe realized he did not have time to obtain real estate appraisals that he needed to prepare the return accurately.knappe sought burns advice about requesting an extension of the filing deadline from the irs.burns told knappe that he could obtain an extension of both the filing and payment deadlines,and that the same extension was available for both deadlines.knappe authorized burns to prepare and file irs form,an application for extension of time to file a return pay estate and generation skipping transfer taxes.
form gives taxpayers three options they can seek an extension of the form filing deadline,seek an extension of the time to pay any estate tax due,or both.the instructions that accompany form explain the difference between the two categories of extensions.the instructions for part ii,extension of time to file form state that an executor may apply for an automatic month extension of time to file form.an executor who is out of the country may apply for an additional extension in excess of the automatic six months the instructions warn,however,that y ou can not combine an application for an automatic extension and an additional extension on the same form.finally,the instructions explain that an executor who failed timely to apply for the automatic extension may apply for an extension for cause.unless the executor is out of the country,however,extensions for cause are limited to months from the original due date of the form.
the instructions for part iii,extension of time to pay explain that such an extension may not exceed twelve months and is granted at the discretion of the irs.in contrast to extensions of the filing deadline,the irs may grant up to ten consecutive extensions of the payment deadline parceled out one year at a time provided the taxpayer can establish why it is impossible or impractical for the executor to pay the full amount of the estate tax by the estate tax return due date.
the two types of extensions are thus subject to two different sets of rules.extensions of the filing deadline are granted automatically for six months,and only foreign executors can seek additional time.extensions of the payment deadline,on the other hand,are purely discretionary,and the irs may grant multiple extensions,each as long as a year.
burns filed form on august,applying for the automatic filing extension and a discretionary payment extension.
after filing the completed form with the irs,burns sent a copy to knappe.knappe gave the form a cursory review,but did not examine it in detail.knappe testified that there was no reason he could not have scrutinized the form,but that he mostly noticed the extension date burns had requested,and burns estimate that the taxes owed would total million.
the irs approved the extension request in writing on january.on the form itself,which the irs returned to burns,an irs agent had next to the box burns had checked to apply for the automatic extension of the filing deadline.a new document,titled notice to applicant,was attached to the returned application.the notice to applicant included two sections the first relating to the application for an extension of the filing deadline,and the second to the application for an extension of the payment deadline.three checkboxes appeared in both sections approved,not approved because,and other.none of the boxes was checked in the first section.in the second section,the irs agent had checked approved and had typed,to only.
at the time burns prepared form,he mistakenly believed that it was possible to request a extension of the filing deadline,even though he had read the instructions and reviewed the relevant statutes and treasury regulations.before burns filed the form,he advised knappe explicitly that he could obtain a extension of both the filing and payment deadlines.knappe testified that he believed that the extension application would extend both the filing and payment deadlines for one year to august.knappe understanding of the deadlines rested entirely on burns representations he made no independent effort to assay the rules.when the irs approved the automatic sixmonth extension to the filing deadline and the discretionary extension to the payment deadline,neither burns nor knappe realized their mistake.
convinced that the filing deadline had been extended one year,knappe elected to wait until may to file the return,in part to accommodate burns busy schedule during tax season.burns and knappe worked together to complete the return,and on may,burns sent knappe the completed form.burns also prepared a cover letter for knappe to send to the irs,which read,enclosed for filing is united states estate tax return form for the above referenced decedent.the extended payment date of this return is august,as shown on the irs form attached to this return.knappe filed the return and cover letter on behalf of the estate on may.he also enclosed a check for the balance of the estate tax.knappe later testified that he could have filed the return by february,if he had understood that burns had only obtained a extension.
sometime in,the irs observed that knappe had filed the return after the february,deadline.the agency assessed a percent penalty for a delinquency,excluding interest,in the amount of knappe called burns to ask why the irs believed the return was late.burns reviewed the regulations and quickly realized he had made an error.burns admitted that determining the correct deadline was not an ambiguous question.
knappe requested an abatement of the penalty.the internal revenue code excuses executors from penalties if the failure to file was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.a.knappe argued that he was entitled to an abatement because his reliance on burns erroneous advice was reasonable cause for the late filing.the irs denied the abatement request.knappe administratively appealed the irs decision,but the irs denied the appeal.knappe then paid the full amount due and filed a claim for refund with the irs.when the irs rejected the claim,knappe brought this refund action,again alleging that his reliance on burns constituted reasonable cause.
the government moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the motion,holding that the existence of reasonable cause under a was an issue of law and that knappe reliance on burns advice was insufficient to establish reasonable cause.knappe timely appealed.
we have jurisdiction under,and we review de novo both the district court summary judgment and its interpretation of the internal revenue code.aloe vera of,united states,cir.
ii.analysis 
an return,form,must be filed within nine months of the decedent death.a.an executor may apply for an automatic extension of time to file form by filing form on or before the due date of the return and checking the appropriate box.b.while the irs may grant a reasonable extension of time for filing any return,no such extension shall be for more than months except in the case of taxpayers who are abroad.a.
extensions of the deadline to pay the estate tax operate differently.treasury department regulations specify that the irs may grant an extension of time to pay estate taxes,at the written request of the executor,for a reasonable period of time,not to exceed months.a.
an executor who fails to file a timely return is subject to a penalty.see a.the latefiling penalty is mandatory when a taxpayer fails to file any return on the date prescribed therefor determined with regard to any extension of time for filing,unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.id.the penalty amount is five percent of the amount of tax that appears on the return for each month or fraction of a month that the return is late,up to a maximum of percent.id.
to establish reasonable cause,a taxpayer must prove that he exercised ordinary business care and prudence and was nevertheless unable to file the return within the prescribed time.c.knappe central argument on appeal is that by relying on his expert accountant advice about the effect of the extension on the deadline for filing the return,he exercised ordinary business care and prudence and so had reasonable cause for filing the return three months late.
before we turn to that cardinal issue,we must first address knappe argument that the reasonableness of his actions is an issue of disputed fact that can not be appropriately decided on summary judgment.
the supreme court has held that w hether the elements that constitute reasonable cause are present in a given situation is a question of fact,but what elements must be present to constitute reasonable cause is a question of law.united states boyle.in this case,the parties do not seriously disagree about the material facts.knappe insists that factual disputes remain regarding whether knappe had knowledge of the correct filing deadline and whether burns advised him about it.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to knappe,however,we simply assume that he had no actual or constructive knowledge of the correct filing deadline and that his uncertainty was the product of burns bad advice.what remains is the unambiguously legal question of whether knappe actions satisfy the minimum elements of reasonable cause.see id.
cases addressing reasonable cause for late filing of tax returns fall into two general categories.in the first category are cases involving taxpayers who delegate the task of filing a return to an expert agent,only to have the agent file the return late or not at all.the leading case in this category is boyle.there,boyle,the executor of his mother estate,retained an attorney who advised him that an return was due but did not mention when it was due.id.boyle contacted the attorney repeatedly to inquire into the progress of the estate proceedings and the preparation of the return,and was repeatedly assured that the return would be filed in plenty of time.id.at quotation marks omitted.eventually,the attorney admitted to boyle that the return was late because a clerical oversight had caused him to overlook the deadline.id.at.the return was filed three months late.the irs assessed the statutory penalty,and boyle sued to recover it.id.at.
the supreme court held that boyle reliance on his attorney to file the tax return timely was not reasonable cause for the delay.congress has placed the burden of prompt filing on the executor,the court explained,not on some agent or employee of the executor.id.at.the court described the taxpayer fixed and clear duty as an obligation to ascertain the statutory deadline and then to meet that deadline,except in a very narrow range of situations.id.at.delegating the duty of filing to an agent was not within the very narrow range of situations in which failing to meet a statutory filing deadline would be excused,because congress has charged the executor with an unambiguous,precisely defined duty to file the return within nine months.id.at.that the executor agent was expected to attend to the matter does not relieve the principal of his duty to comply with the statute.id.the court continued 
reliance by a lay person on a lawyer is of course common but that reliance can not function as a substitute for compliance with an unambiguous statute it requires no special training or effort to ascertain a deadline and make sure that it is met.the failure to make a timely filing of a tax return is not excused by the taxpayer reliance on an agent,and such reliance is not reasonable cause for a late filing under a.
id.at see also conklin of santa rosa,united states,cir holding that reasonable cause did not excuse a corporation late filing and payment of taxes when the company office manager failed to make timely filings and payments and falsified records to disguise her errors from company management.
in the second category are cases in which a taxpayer relies on an agent erroneous advice that no return is due.courts have consistently held that such reliance does constitute reasonable cause for delay.even the boyle court appeared expressly to endorse such a rule 
when an accountant or attorney advises a taxpayer on a matter of tax law,such as whether a liability exists,it is reasonable for the taxpayer to rely on that advice.most taxpayers are not competent to discern error in the substantive advice of an accountant or attorney.to require the taxpayer to challenge the attorney,to seek a second opinion,or to try to monitor counsel on the provisions of the code himself would nullify the very purpose of seeking the advice of a presumed expert in the first place.ordinary business care and prudence do not demand such actions.
at citations omitted.cases in this category stand for the principle that the question of whether a return is due is a matter of substantive tax law,and that a taxpayer acts with ordinary business care and prudence when he relies on an expert answer to that question.see,united states kroll,cir holding that when there is no question that a return must be filed,the taxpayer has a personal,nondelegable duty to file the tax return when due but noting that w hether or not the taxpayer is liable for taxes is a question of tax law which often only an expert can answer.the taxpayer not only can,but must,rely on the advice of either an accountant or a lawyer.this reliance is clearly an exercise of ordinary business care and prudence.
this case does not fall squarely into either category.knappe neither delegated the task of filing the return to a neglectful agent nor received mistaken advice that no taxes were due.rather,he personally filed the return after the actual deadline,but within the time that burns erroneously had assured him was available.
in boyle,the supreme court expressly declined to reach the question posed by this case 
courts have differed over whether a taxpayer demonstrates reasonable cause when,in reliance on the advice of his accountant or attorney,the taxpayer files a return after the actual due date but within the time the adviser erroneously told him was available.we need not and do not address ourselves to this issue.
at citations omitted.our sister circuits have reached contradictory conclusions.compare,estate of kerber united states,cir per curiam refusing to find reasonable cause where an executrix attorney correctly advised her that it would be necessary to file an estate tax return but erroneously believed that the return was due one year,rather than nine months,after the decedent death,with estate of bradley comm r,cch,holding that it was consistent with ordinary business care and prudence for the executor to consult a member of an accounting firm which regularly prepared tax returns for advice on the due date of the estate tax return and to rely on the advice he rec
