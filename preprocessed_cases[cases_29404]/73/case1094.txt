this case presents the question whether congress intention to permit state taxation of indian land unambiguously encompasses the unique taxation scheme now before us.see montana blackfeet tribe of indians,d states are permitted to tax indians only when congress has made its intention to permit such taxation unmistakably clear.
in,the quinault indian nation quinault nation or nation purchased approximately acres of forest land,most of which was located in grays harbor county,washington grays harbor or the county.two years later,the quinault nation transferred the land to the united states to hold in trust for the nation,thereby triggering a compensating tax imposed by the county.under washington tax law,land classified for forest use is assigned a reduced property valuation for property tax purposes.under certain circumstances,the sale or transfer of forest use land deprives the property of its favorable tax status and triggers the imposition of a tax on the.
believing that the county lacked federal congressional authority to levy this tax,the quinault nation sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the tax in district court.grays harbor urged that the tax fell within the scope of permissible state taxation of an indian tribe.faced with competing interpretations of the washington statute,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of grays harbor,holding that the tax was a permissible taxation of land under the indian general allotment act of,stat,as amended,et,as construed by the supreme court in county of yakima confederated tribes bands of the yakima indian nation,d.
on appeal,our analysis rests on the court teaching in county of yakima.as the supreme court reminded us in that case,our choice between reasonable constructions of the general allotment act must be dictated by a principle deeply rooted in this court indian jurisprudence statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of the indians,with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit.id.at.quoting blackfeet tribe,at.
the result in this case boils down to whether the tax is characterized as a permissible taxation of land,that is an ad valorem tax,or as an impermissible tax more akin to an excise tax.fairly characterized,the tax is triggered by the sale or transfer of the property and the amount of the tax is derived from a formula that is a hybrid of market value and tax savings.the tax simply does not fall easily within the ad valorem category.and although the excise tax box may not be a perfect fit,because the transfer of the property triggers the tax,it is more akin to an excise tax than any other.in this nether world of indian taxation,the ambiguity inherent in this tax scheme tips the balance in favor of the quinault nation.consequently,because the construction is plagued with ambiguity,and because it is not enough to be persuaded that the county is a permissible or even the better reading,we reverse.
background 
the quinault reservation was established by executive order in pursuant to the treaty with the quinault.see executive order of november,stat.in the century that followed,ownership of tribal lands was on a virtual.within fifteen years of establishing the reservation,congress enacted the general allotment act,which permitted the allotment of tribal lands to individual indians and resulted in the vast majority of reservation land being allotted to individuals.indian general allotment act of,stat,as amended,et.in,congress stepped in to halt further allotment.indian reorganization act,stat,as amended,et.nonetheless,by the,of the reservation allotted land had been transferred to ownership,with a handful of entities owning approximately of these holdings.
as a result of several legislative initiatives to promote tribal land acquisition and economic development,the quinault nation undertook to reacquire lands within the reservation,including forest lands.the nation acquired over acres of forest land from rayonier,a timber company,in.the vast bulk of the land and the portion at issue in this located in grays harbor,with the remainder located in a neighboring county.at the time of sale,the nation signed a notice of continuance,ensuring that the property would retain its forest use classification and,thus,its reduced valuation for property tax purposes.
pursuant to of the indian reorganization act,in march the quinault nation applied to have the united states accept title to the acres in trust for the nation,thus removing the land from washington tax rolls.see title to any lands acquired pursuant to this act shall be taken in the name of the united states in trust for the indian tribe,and such lands shall be exempt from state and local taxation.emphasis added.the bureau of indian affairs approved the application for transfer of title,and notice of the approval was sent to the grays harbor assessor office.
grays harbor did not object to the transfer,but notified the nation that the completed transfer would trigger a tax of because the transfer was to a tax exempt entity,the united states.see.b.of the,roughly was attributable to tax savings earned by the nation while it owned the forest land from june until may the remainder of the tax ostensibly recouped savings earned by rayonier in the years preceding the sale.
the nation challenged the tax in a declaratory judgment action in federal district court.in ruling on for summary judgment,the district court concluded that the compensating tax constituted an ad valorem real property tax of the type approved in county of yakima and thus upheld its imposition under of the general allotment act.the quinault nation paid the disputed tax under protest pending the outcome of this appeal.
discussion 
county of yakima and state taxation of indian land 
it is a well established principle of indian law that state and local governments lack the power to tax reservation indians or their land a bsent cession of jurisdiction or other federal statutes permitting it.county of yakima,at.quoting mescalero apache tribe jones,d.this general exemption from state taxation is lifted only when congress has made its intention to do so unmistakably clear.blackfeet tribe,at.see also lummi indian tribe whatcom county,cir.the prohibition on state taxation of indian tribes has been described as a per se rule.california cabazon band of mission indians,d.
the supreme court applied this principle in county of yakima,where it considered whether yakima county could impose an ad valorem tax on reservation fee land and an excise tax on the sales of such land.at.the court held that the indian general allotment act of,under which the land at issue had been allotted and,evinced congress clear intent to subject the yakima nation reservation fee land to state real estate taxes.id.at.the court reasoned that when the general allotment act rendered the allotted lands alienable and encumberable,it also rendered them subject to assessment for taxes.see also cass county leech lake band of chippewa indians,d congress has manifested such an intent to permit state taxation when it has authorized reservation lands to be allotted in fee to individual indians,thus making the lands freely alienable and withdrawing them from federal protection.lummi indian tribe,at n o matter how the reservation land became patented,it is taxable once restraints against alienation expire.
the court conclusion that the indian land was taxable did not,by itself,determine the extent of permissible state taxation.to resolve that issue,the court turned to of the general allotment act,stat,as amended by the burke act of,stat,codified at.section provides 
at the expiration of the trust period and when the lands have been conveyed to the indians by patent in fee,then each and every allottee shall have the benefit of and be subject to the laws,both civil and criminal,of the state or territory in which they may reside provided,that the secretary of the interior may,in his discretion,and he is authorized,whenever he shall be satisfied that any indian allottee is competent and capable of managing his or her affairs at any time to cause to be issued to such allottee a patent in fee simple,and th
