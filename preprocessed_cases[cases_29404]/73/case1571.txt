it is well settled that a trial court is vested with wide discretion in fixing the amount to be awarded to a prevailing party for attorneys fees,and that a court award will not be disturbed on appeal unless the record discloses an abuse of discretion.see serrano priest cal d,serrano iii.the primary question here is whether the trial court abused its discretion by applying a negative multiplier in setting the amount of an attorneys fees award against a government agency based on the conclusion that it would be better for less money to be paid to the prevailing parties for their attorneys fees so as to leave the agency with more money for its ongoing governmental operations.we find this is not an appropriate factor upon which to reduce otherwise documented attorneys fees.
the statutory setting for the litigation 
the community redevelopment law crl health,et is a comprehensive statutory scheme intended to help local governments revitalize blighted areas.to accomplish this end,the crl allows for the financing of redevelopment projects through tax increment financing.tax increment financing works this way redevelopment agencies do not have the power to tax,but may finance redevelopment projects through loans or the sale of bonds.when a redevelopment project results in increased property values,the tax attributable to the increase in value the tax increment is collected by the taxing authority and distributed to the redevelopment agency,which then uses the money to pay off its debt.the basic concept is a redevelopment project in effect pays for itself.city of dinuba county of tulare cal th.
in recent years,the legislature has enacted a number of statutes out of a concern that implementation of the crl may adversely impact housing,particularly low income housing.for example,section requires redevelopment agencies to set aside not less than percent of its tax increment proceeds in a low and moderate income housing lmih fund.other statutes require agencies to provide relocation benefits to persons displaced by a redevelopment,to include prescribed percentages of units for low and moderate income housing in housing projects,with covenants to keep those units affordable for prescribed periods,and to replace affordable units lost because of redevelopment activities.
the litigation 
in december,esperanza rogel and other residents of a mobile home park plaintiffs in the city of lynwood filed a complaint and verified petition for writ of mandate against the city,the city council of the city of lynwood,and the lynwood redevelopment agency lrda.plaintiffs complaint alleged that a proposed plan to change the mobile home park into townhomes would result in the loss of low income rental housing units and would force plaintiffs out of the city because it otherwise lacked housing they could afford.plaintiffs alleged that the lrda had violated and had a history of violating statutes requiring relocation assistance,setting aside money to assist affordable housing goals,and building affordable units with covenants to keep them affordable.plaintiffs prayed for declaratory and injunctive relief against the lrda,and for a writ of traditional mandate directing the city,through its city council,to prepare and adopt a housing component into the city general plan compliant with statutorily mandated elements.in april,following procedural matters not relevant to the current appeal,plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint and writ petition which largely the claims summarized above.
in august,the trial court dzintra janavs denied plaintiffs petition for writ of mandate against the city and city council.in october,the court lifted a stay of plaintiffs claims against the lrda and transferred the case for reassignment to a trial department 
plaintiffs initial lawyers were affiliated with public counsel and the california affordable housing law project.in october,plaintiffs filed notice that the law firm of myers llp had become associated as plaintiffs cocounsel.
in january,the lrda moved to stay discovery until plaintiffs appeal of the denial of their writ petition had been completed.the parties later stipulated to take the motion off calendar.in april,the lrda filed a motion to strike almost allegations from plaintiffs first amended complaint,including single words such as unlawful,references to the city on the ground the city was no longer a party,and dozens of other passages which,in the eyes of the lrda,constituted objectionable legal conclusions.in june,the trial court denied the lrda motion upon finding the agency was attacking unimportant parts of the pleading.at the same time,the court set a trial date for december.
during the ensuing course of the litigation,the lrda repeatedly failed to respond to discovery,and plaintiffs filed multiple motions.the record suggests that the lrda repeated failures to comply with discovery were the result of its internal failures to maintain ordinary records.at various times,the lrda claimed it could not locate documents concerning budgets,general ledgers,bank accounts,and audit reports.in this vein,the lrda housing manager and the person it designated as most qualified to testify on affordable housing issues both testified the lrda records were so disorganized that it would be difficult for the agency even to determine the number of redevelopment projects in which it had been involved.in the words of lrda lawyer at one hearing i know that the agency does not have a very good record of what it did in to simply because that too long ago.because of the lrda deficient,plaintiffs lawyers were sometimes required to recreate records the lrda should have routinely prepared,maintained and produced.
plaintiffs discovery efforts included the following in may,plaintiffs filed a motion to compel responses to their request for production of documents.in september,plaintiffs filed a motion to compel further response to their request for production of documents,and a motion to compel further responses to their requests for admissions and their form interrogatories.in december,plaintiffs filed a motion for issue and evidence sanctions based on the lrda discovery failures,a motion for an order deeming plaintiffs requests for admissions admitted and to compel responses to special interrogatories,and a motion to produce documents responsive to plaintiffs second request for production of documents.for all practical purposes,plaintiffs won all of their motions.
on december,the trial court granted in part plaintiffs motion for issue and evidence sanctions against the lrda.the court ordered that matters included in three sets of plaintiffs requests for admissions were to be deemed admitted,and that the lrda could not introduce evidence of any document responsive to plaintiffs first request for production of documents unless the documents were produced by december.the court also imposed monetary sanctions against the lrda.
meanwhile,ability or agreeability to continue with its role as plaintiffs cocounsel became more limited.in august,plaintiffs public interest lawyers persuaded gibson,dunn crutcher llp to assume the role of lead cocounsel in preparation for trial.
on january,the lrda served its response to requests for admissions,admitting each matter covered by the discovery request.together,the matters deemed admitted by the trial court december,order and the lrda january,admissions essentially established the following elements of plaintiffs action 
the lrda never provided relocation assistance to persons displaced from dwelling units within its jurisdiction.
the lrda never determined how many housing units it should have produced to fulfill its housing obligations,or how many housing units it had actually produced.
the lrda had no evidence that,since january,it had satisfied any of its housing obligations related to any of its redevelopment projects.
since january,the lrda had failed to assure that dwelling units developed or substantially rehabilitated within its jurisdiction were made available at an affordable housing cost to,and occupied by,persons of low or moderate income.
since january,the lrda had failed to produce the number of replacement dwelling units it was obligated to produce.
the lrda had no evidence that it satisfied any of its replacement housing obligations from january to september,and,since,the lrda had produced no replacement dwelling units.
since january,the lrda had failed to deposit the prescribed percentage of its tax increment not less than percent into a lmih fund.
the lrda failed to record any affordability covenants for housing units in any redevelopments.
since january,the lrda redevelopment activities had discriminatory,adverse,and disproportionate impact on racial and ethnic minorities,persons with disabilities,and families with children,and further discriminated against the development of housing reserved for occupancy by lower income households.
on february,at which time trial was set to begin on february,the lrda approved a settlement.on march,the trial court signed and entered a stipulation and order incorporating the settlement agreement.the court march order included the following provisions,among others the lrda shall develop a minimum of inclusionary dwelling units within four years,and develop and make available for occupancy by march another replacement dwelling units the lrda shall record affordability covenants on all newly developed inclusionary and replacement dwelling units the lrda shall establish,fund,administer,and use in accordance with applicable law a separate and segregated lmih fund the lrda must deposit into the lmih fund to replace improperly expended funds the lrda shall provide full payment of all relocation assistance owed to persons displaced by lrda activities,including the named plaintiffs and the lrda shall submit specified issues to a redevelopment specialist who will make final and binding determinations of inappropriate lrda expenditures from the lmih fund,as well as any related penalties for which the lrda may be liable.
the settlement agreement included this provision addressing attorneys fees plaintiffs shall not be precluded from seeking to recover reasonable attorneys fees and costs for the prosecution of this action.however,notwithstanding the foregoing,nothing in the settlement agreement or otherwise shall preclude the lrda from raising its financial condition including the financial obligations assumed by the lrda in connection with this settlement agreement in response to any such effort to recover reasonable attorneys fees and costs,nor shall anything in this settlement agreement preclude plaintiffs from responding to any such argument by the lrda.italics added.
in april,plaintiffs filed a motion for an award of attorneys fees and costs pursuant to code of civil procedure section,supported by a series of attorneys declarations and accompanying billing documentation.the aggregate sum requested or lodestar based on the hours worked and applicable hourly rates totaled approximately million.plaintiffs asked the trial court to apply a multiplier of to the lodestar in light of the complexity of the issues,the skill displayed in litigating the case,the results obtained,the importance of the case,and the risk taken by plaintiffs lawyers in pursuing the litigation 
the lrda opposed plaintiffs motion for attorneys fees on three principle grounds the most it could pay in attorneys fees without harming its affordable housing mission including its obligations under the settlement agreement was roughly plaintiffs lawyers had inflated the lodestar and the lrda had incurred far less in attorneys fees.the lrda further argued the case involved straightforward statutory issues,and the plaintiffs had obtained only limited success.based on all of these factors,the ldra asserted that a negative multiplier was appropriate.
at a hearing on may,the trial court noted plaintiffs clearly were entitled to an award of attorneys fees.it made repeated statements over the course of the hearing to the effect that the case had resulted in a substantial public benefit,and that the lrda may never have developed affordable housing units without being motivated by the litigation.the court specifically described the result as a benefit to the citizens of lynwood and to the county as a whole.at the same time,however,the court requested additional briefing to help determine the amount of the fees award.it specifically indicated it was interested in the attorneys fees language in the settlement agreement dealing with the lrda financial condition.
plaintiffs supplemental briefing argued the settlement agreement did not require the court to consider the lrda alleged financial condition in determining the amount of the attorneys fees award,only that the lrda could raise the issue.plaintiffs argued that,if public entities like the lrda could avoid responsibility for violating the law by claiming they could not afford to pay attorneys fees,the private attorney general statute would become meaningless and enforcement of vital public policies would be impaired.plaintiffs disputed the lrda claim that payment of attorneys fees would impede the agency affordable housing obligations.plaintiffs submitted a declaration from david nolte,a certified public accountant.nolte explained that the last audited financial statement from the lrda revealed a million fund balance.further,the city owed the lrda million.
in its supplemental opposition,the lrda argued that the language in the settlement agreement about the agency financial condition showed that the parties intended to go beyond the factors addressed in serrano iii,supra,cal d,and to allow the court to include this factor in its determination of the amount of attorneys fees.changing its original assertion that it could pay only,the lrda proffered that an award of attorneys fees in excess of would be made at the expense of low and moderate income housing for the city residents.the lrda further argued the court should reduce any fee award because the law firms which had worked on the litigation promote themselves as charitably giving to the community through their pro bono work.in separately filed papers,the lrda argued plaintiffs lawyers spent over hours on their successful discovery motions,while the lrda lawyers had spent hours.in a similar vein,the lrda argued plaintiffs lawyers overstaffed and overprepared for depositions.
on july,the court issued a tentative ruling.the court ruled plaintiffs were the prevailing parties,having obtained the relief sought in the complaint through the stipulated judgment.the court also found plaintiffs litigation had conferred a significant public benefit in that the settlement agreement would result in the development of almost new affordable housing units and the reimbursement of amounts owed by lrda to various public funds.in its oral pronouncements,the court expressly noted that,without plaintiffs counsel,we would not have the result we have.we would not get anything.the court expressly stated plaintiffs counsel did a fantastic job with regard to affordable housing in the city.
despite its written and oral statements,the court ruled it would measure the amount of attorneys fees by applying a negative multiplier of to the lodestar requested by plaintiffs.the trial court based its ruling on two predominant grounds first,the settlement agreement authorized the court to factor in the lrda financial condition in deciding the amount of fees second,the requested attorneys fees would significantly reduce the amount that the lrda has to provide additional housing.in its oral pronouncements at the hearing,the court stated that the lrda financial condition was the most compelling reason for reducing the fees.during the remaining parts of the hearing,the court added these sentiments i t seems as though the money should be spent in lynwood and not on the lawyers.if that were not the case,you would be entitled to more fees in the court view.i ca see taking money away from the citizens of lynwood i just think that money is better directed to the city of lynwood sic in helping those people with the housing.
the court second reason for applying a negative multiplier was its finding that portions of the attorney time reflected in the billing statements submitted by plaintiffs lawyers was duplicative and,therefore.the court did not calculate and deduct specific amounts from the lodestar based on these conclusions,but cited this as a factor for applying a negative multiplier.in addition,the court found that the time billed also reflected work completed by law students who received school credit,and that this time billed should not be passed through to the lrda.the court also suggested plaintiffs were seeking attorney fees for actions taken against the city,which were not related to plaintiffs claims against the lrda.again,however,the court did not deduct specific amounts from the lodestar based on these conclusions.basically,the trial court adopted the lrda claims regarding unreasonable billing but did not specifically calculate and deduct the excessive fees.instead,it cited the overbilling element as a basis for applying a blanket negative multiplier.
finally,the court noted the pro bono nature of the lawyers work as a factor for applying a negative multiplier t he court considers an award of millions of dollars of in attorneys fees unreasonable and excessive when most of the work by plaintiffs counsel was pro bono.
as a result of the negative multiplier,the attorneys fees award in favor of plaintiffs was reduced from the million rounded lodestar to rounded.on july,the court adopted its tentative ruling,and on august,the court signed and entered an order on the attorneys fees motion.
plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
plaintiffs contend the trial court abused its discretion by diverging from the lodestar approach normally applied when calculating an attorneys fees award.we agree.
i.the governing law 
a court assessing attorneys fees must begin with a lodestar figure based on the time spent and the reasonable hourly rate of each attorney involved in the presentation of the case.ketchum moses cal th,discussing serrano iii,supra,cal d at.the lodestar essentially sets a basic fee for comparable legal services in the community.it may be adjusted by the court in order to fix a fee at the fair market value for the particular action.ketchum,supra,at,italics added.in short,the court task is to determine whether the litigation before it involved elements justifying augmentation or diminution of the unadorned lodestar in order to approximate the fair market value for such services.ketchum,supra,at,discussing serrano iii,supra,at,italics added see also serrano unruh cal d.if there is no reasonable connection between the lodestar figure and the fee awarded,the fee does not conform to the objectives established in serrano iii,and may not be upheld.press lucky stores,cal d.
in serrano iii,supra,cal d,a trial court took the following factors into consideration in setting an attorneys fees award to be shared equally by each of the two law firms representing the prevailing plaintiffs the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved,and the skill displayed in presenting them the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys the contingent nature of the fee award,both from the point of view of eventual victory on the merits and the point of view of establishing eligibility for an award the fact that an award against the state would ultimately fall upon the taxpayers the fact that the attorneys in question received public and charitable funding for the purpose of bringing law suits of the character here involved the fact that the monies awarded would inure not to the individual benefit of the attorneys involved but the organizations by which they were employed and the fact that in the court view the two law firms had approximately an equal share in the success of the litigation.id.at,fn.omitted.without expressly discussing any one factor,and without expressly stating that the identified list of factors was mutually inclusive or mutually exclusive,the supreme court affirmed the attorneys fees award,finding no abuse of discretion.id.at.
ii.the lodestar approach should have been followed 
we agree with plaintiffs the trial court erred by diverging from the lodestar in the current case.the cases on this subject do indeed support the proposition that a court is permitted to apply a negative multiplier.however,in our view,they also teach that some identified,legally justifiable circumstance must exist in support of a decision to diverge from the lodestar.
for example,in san diego police officers san diego police department th san diego police officers,the court of appeal affirmed a negative multiplier where the record showed the following circumstances the plaintiff association had achieved very limited success the portion of its writ petition on which it prevailed did not involve complex issues of law the case did not preclude the association attorneys from working on other matters and did not involve a contingency fee and the award of fees would ultimately be borne by the taxpayers id.at.the court further noted that t he vast majority of the association time and effort was clearly spent on issues upon which the police department prevailed.ibid.
the facts in the current case are directly opposite to those in the san diego police officers case.in the current case,plaintiffs achieved a significant success.plaintiffs prevailed in an action made complex by the lrda internal incompetence of keeping documents in a disorganized,unaccessible fashion its deliberate obstructionism of its discovery obligations.the case required large and largely avoidable amounts of lawyers time to overcome the lrda lack of basic,thereby precluding work on other matters.at best,plaintiffs current case and the san diego police officers case are similar only to the extent that the award of attorneys fees would ultimately be borne by the taxpayers.further,since the lrda does not actually have the power to tax,this is not as much of a similarity as it might initially appear 
in thayer wells fargo bank,th,the court of appeal affirmed the application of a negative multiplier where the record showed that the prevailing parties lawyers did little more than duplicate pleadings filed in related cases.id.at.and in enpalm,llc teitler th,the court of appeal affirmed the application of a negative multiplier where the record showed that the prevailing party lawyers misrepresented the number of hours worked.id.at.although the trial court in plaintiffs current action voiced some concerns about their lawyers billings,the record does not support a conclusion that the types of overreaching involved in thayer or enpalm were involved here.moreover,as discussed below,the lawyers billings were not the predominant factor in the trial court decision to apply a negative multiplier.
turning to that principal issue in the current case,we agree with plaintiffs that the trial court erred by applying a negative multiplier based on the factor that payment of lodestar attorneys fees would not be the better use of the lrda money.as noted above,the supreme court in serrano iii implicitly approved consideration of a taxpayer burden factor in fixing an appropriate figure for an attorneys fees award.serrano iii,supra,cal d at.however,the court was not called upon to expound on issues such as when the taxpayer factor could properly be considered and to what extent the factor could be calculated into the attorneys fees determination.indeed,in serrano iii,the court affirmed an award against governmental defendants based on a positive multiplier applied to the lodestar.id.at.
we acknowledge that,following serrano iii,our state courts have regularly affirmed attorneys fees awards against governmental entities based on positive and negative multipliers.however,no case cited in the parties briefs has affirmed a negative multiplier attorneys fees award against a governmental agency which was based on the express factor that it would be better for a governmental entity not to pay the lodestar so that the entity ability to fund its ongoing operations are not be affected.in our view,the absence of history on this subject is not surprising given that the funding of a governmental entity ongoing operations has little,if any,bearing on the fair market value of
