we affirm the district court.the whites proposal to surrender personal property that the irs can not levy on and can not otherwise collect without resort to litigation does not constitute a surrender under a c.we therefore leave for another day the question of whether a permits a plan to be confirmed when a chapter debtor surrenders only part of the property securing a claim.
the facts of this case are undisputed.the whites failed to pay fully their federal income taxes for the tax years and.on october,the irs filed a notice of tax lien in wake county,north carolina,with respect to the tax deficiencies for,perfecting a security interest for in all of the whites property.
on january,the whites filed a chapter bankruptcy petition in the bankruptcy court for the eastern district of north carolina.on schedules attached to the petition,the whites listed the irs as a creditor holding an unsecured priority claim of and an unsecured general claim of.they did not,however,include the irs on the schedule of secured creditors.
the irs filed a proof of claim on april,in which it asserted a claim of secured by certain of the whites property.shortly thereafter,on june,the chapter trustee filed a motion to dismiss the whites bankruptcy case,contending that the whites plan as filed is not feasible and,therefore,will not meet the requirements of a.the chapter plan is not feasible in that it fails to pay secured claims in full and does not provide dividends to priority and general unsecured creditors.at.
to qualify for confirmation under chapter,the whites plan must satisfy the requirements of a of the bankruptcy code.
the whites treatment of the irs secured claim,in particular,is governed by subsection a under this provision,a plan proposed treatment of secured claims will be confirmed if the secured creditor accepts the plan,see a a the debtor invokes the cram down power,see a b or the debtor surrenders to the creditor the property securing the claim,see a c.
on june,the whites sent a letter to the irs requesting that the irs amend its proof of claim because the whites had decided to surrender part of property securing the irs claim.the letter stated that the whites had decided to surrender their apparel jewelry certain of their household goods,including their stove and refrigerator and their plymouth voyager totaling in value.the whites intended to retain the remaining in property securing the irs tax lien,including a chevrolet silverado truck and two ira accounts.at.in the letter,the whites indicated that the value of the surrendered property should be added to the irs unsecured general claim and subtracted from the irs secured claim,reducing the secured claim to.in other words,the whites proposed a plan that attempts to invoke both the cram down and surrender options under a.
the irs rejected the whites proposed amendment to its secured claim and instead,on june,filed an amended proof of claim reasserting the secured claim and asserting an unsecured priority claim of and a general unsecured claim of.
on september,the bankruptcy court denied the trustee motion to dismiss the whites bankruptcy case.in denying the trustee motion to dismiss,the court reasoned that a did not preclude the whites from surrendering part of the irs secured claim,and treating the remaining portion of the claim as secured to the value of the retained collateral,though the court did note that in some circumstances it might be unfair to a secured creditor to allow a partial surrender of collateral.at.
on october,the trustee filed a motion to confirm the whites amended plan.the irs then objected to confirmation of the plan on the grounds that by proposing bifurcation of the irs secured claim,the plan failed to provide for full payment of the claim,in violation of a the plan was not feasible because the whites proposed to surrender personal property,including their clothing and household goods,that was necessary for their continued generation of income and thus for their compliance with the plan the plan was proposed in bad faith because the whites never actually intended to turn over the property to the irs and the whites were prohibited by and from paying their federal tax liabilities with personal property.the irs also argued that it would be without any means of forcing the whites to turn over the collateral securing its claim because the irs is prohibited by of the internal revenue code irc from levying on the surrendered personal property.
on december,the bankruptcy court denied the irs objection to the confirmation of the plan.the court affirmed its earlier ruling that partial surrender of the property securing a claim is permissible under a,but the court also went a step further and concluded that because the irs asserted that it could not convert its tax lien on the secured collateral into payment because of the property exemption from administrative levy,the irs claim was not a secured claim,but an unsecured claim.at.
the irs appealed the bankruptcy court order to the district court,arguing that the bankruptcy court erred in ruling that the irs claim for was unsecured and in holding that partial surrender of property in partial satisfaction of a secured claim is permitted under a.on march,the district court reversed the bankruptcy court order,holding first that the irs claim was not rendered unsecured by virtue of the irs inability to convert the lien into payment.united states white.the court stated that the irs inability to levy on exempt property does not destroy the lien,or make the irs claim unsecured this is because a federal tax lien maintains value independent of the government ability to proceed against the property by administrative levy,given the irs considerable arsenal of collection tools.id.at.accordingly,the court held that the irs claim remains secured even where the irs is unable to immediately seize property secured by a federal tax lien.id.at.
the district court also reversed the bankruptcy court ruling permitting the whites proposed surrender of exempted personal property to the irs.while the court agreed with the bankruptcy court that under certain circumstances a debtor may bifurcate a secured claim and follow more than one of the options set forth in a,it found that the bankruptcy court erred in finding that any surrender of personal property to the irs was permissible under the circumstances of this case.id.at emphasis in original.noting that the bankruptcy court had accepted the whites proposal despite the fact that there were substantial legal obstacles to the irs collection of the property,the district court held that partial surrender of collateral is not an option i f the debtor is prohibited from surrendering certain property by law,id.the court concluded that by merely proposing a surrender of exempted property,and not actually making the property available to the irs,the whites could not be said to have surrendered their property in any meaningful fashion.id.at.
the whites timely appealed we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to d west conferring jurisdiction on courts of appeals to review final decisions of district court
