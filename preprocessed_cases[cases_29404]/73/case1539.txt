discussion 
standard of review 
interpretation of a statute presents questions of law for the court to decide,and is reviewed de novo.ramirez yosemite water cal th,fredenburg city of fremont th,subd.a.plaintiff raises issues regarding the interpretation and application of section and whether it may be read in a manner to afford her taxpayer standing.the de novo standard of review,therefore,applies in this case.
ii.taxpayer standing under section 
section provides,in relevant part an action to obtain a judgment,restraining and preventing any illegal expenditure of,waste of,or injury to,the estate,funds,or other property of a county,town,city or city and county of the state,may be maintained against any officer thereof,or any agent,or other person,acting in its behalf,either by a citizen resident therein who is assessed for and is liable to pay,or,within one year before the commencement of the action,has paid,a tax therein.italics added.the fundamental purpose of this statute is to enable a large body of the citizenry to challenge governmental action which would otherwise go unchallenged in the courts because of the standing requirement.blair pitchess cal d,blair.
in torres,supra,the fourth district court of appeal held that proof of payment of real property tax is required by section payment of sales tax will not suffice.th.the plaintiffs in torres had filed a taxpayer action challenging the validity of a proposed redevelopment project by the city of yorba linda.the plaintiffs did not reside or own real property in that city.rather,the complaint alleged both plaintiffs currently lived in anaheim,but were interested in moving to yorba linda if they could find decent,safe,sanitary and affordable housing.each plaintiff paid a sales tax to the city of yorba linda within one year before filing the action.id.at.in rejecting the plaintiffs claim of taxpayer standing,the appellate court looked to the language of section granting standing to one who is assessed for and is liable to pay,or within one year before the commencement of the action,has paid,a tax therein.the court read this language as requiring proof of payment of an assessed tax.the court found the nonresident plaintiffs lacked standing because they had paid only sales tax,which is technically assessed against the retailer,not the consumer,though as a practical matter the retailer simply passes the sales tax on to the consumer,who pays it at the time of purchase.id.at.
two years later,our supreme court decided tobe,supra,holding,in part,that two taxpayer plaintiffs who were homeless and thus necessarily did not pay real property taxes had taxpayer standing under section.cal th.in tobe,the plaintiffs,some of whom were homeless,brought an action to bar the enforcement of a santa ana ordinance that banned camping and storage of personal effects in public areas throughout the city.id.at.in the course of reaching its decision,the court held that regardless of whether the plaintiffs had a beneficial interest in the writ action,they did have standing to bring the petition as section taxpayers.id.at.there is no indication,however,that the court considered the issue of what taxes plaintiffs had paid to enjoy this standing the main focus of the case was geared toward separate constitutional concerns.as plaintiff acknowledges,cases are not precedent for issues not considered and decided.camarillo vaage th.
one year after tobe was decided,the second district court of appeal cited torres as stating the correct rule and held that proof of payment of real property tax is required by section payment of sales,gasoline,and income taxes will not suffice.cornelius,supra,th at.in cornelius,a nonresident plaintiff brought suit against the los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority mta challenging an affirmative action program it had implemented as a required condition of receiving federal funds.the plaintiff did not reside in the county of los angeles or own real property therein.rather,he worked for a company in hollywood that had allegedly lost out on a bid in that county due to an affirmative action program.id.at.he claimed he had the right to sue based on his payment of sales and gasoline taxes within the county,as well as his payment of income taxes to the state.id.at.in rejecting the claim of taxpayer standing,the appellate court first found that real property taxes are assessed on the property owner directly and therefore satisfy the language of section.as the plaintiff had not paid real property taxes,he could not claim taxpayer standing on that basis.id.at.cornelius does not mention the tobe opinion.
below,the parties agreed that under the rule of stare decisis,the trial court here was constrained to follow cornelius because it squarely addresses the issue of property tax payment and it the supreme court decision in tobe.on appeal,plaintiff asks us to reject cornelius and torres in favor of tobe and other cases that have,according to her,construed section broadly to achieve its remedial purpose.she asks us to hold that payment of any form of tax suffices for standing under section.
iii.plaintiff lacks standing 
plain language of section 
plaintiff claims the plain language of section reveals that payment of any tax is sufficient to confer taxpayer standing,including payment of fees for services such as water and sewage as noted above,that section allows a citizen resident to bring a lawsuit if the individual is assessed for and is liable to pay,or,within one year before the commencement of the action,has paid,a tax therein plaintiff first claims the statute is written in the disjunctive,asserting the word or separates persons who have been assessed for and are liable to pay a tax from those who have merely paid a tax in the relevant jurisdiction.as to the latter class of taxpayers,she asserts an assessment is not required.while she claims the overall meaning of the statute is made difficult by the manner in which the words are parsed and separated by commas,in reality it is her own interpretation that is strained.plainly,the word or is intended to provide an alternative to the clause is liable to pay.thus,the statute gives standing to two classes of persons who have been assessed for taxes those who are liable to pay an assessed tax but who have not yet paid,and those who paid an assessed tax within one year before the filing of the lawsuit.unlike plaintiff,we see nothing in this interpretation that would lead to any
