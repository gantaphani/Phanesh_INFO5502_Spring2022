opinion of the court 
in this consolidated appeal,we are asked to interpret the scope of a statutory tax exemption and to determine if,in enacting that exemption,congress acted unconstitutionally.for the reasons to be discussed,we will affirm.
consolidated for our review in this appeal are three district court actions,brought in the eastern and middle districts of pennsylvania and the district of new jersey.appellants in are cape may county,new jersey,and county clerk rita marie fulginiti.appellants in are delaware and chester counties,pennsylvania.appellant in is evie rafalko mcnulty,recorder of deeds for lackawanna county,pennsylvania.we will refer to these parties,collectively,as appellants.appellees are the federal national mortgage association fannie mae or fannie,the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac or freddie,and the federal housing finance agency the fhfa.for reasons that we will discuss,appellees are identically situated for purposes of this appeal.we will therefore refer to them,collectively,as the enterprises.the united states was not involved in these cases at the district court level,but we granted its request for leave to intervene on appeal in the district of new jersey and the eastern district of pennsylvania cases,to defend the constitutionality of the tax exemptions at issue here.the united states appears as amicus curiae with respect to the middle district of pennsylvania case.
fannie mae and freddie mac are but privately owned corporations that issue publicly traded securities.congress created fannie and freddie to establish and stabilize secondary markets for residential mortgages in order to promote access to mortgage credit throughout the nation.fannie mae see also note freddie mac.fannie and freddie pursue their mission by purchasing mortgages from lenders,pooling them together and selling securities backed by those mortgages.in the wake of the housing market collapse of,fannie and freddie found themselves owning a great many defaulted and overvalued subprime mortgages.they went bankrupt,and on july,congress created the fhfa to act as conservator for fannie and freddie.a conservatorship is like a receivership,except that a conservator,like a trustee in a reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code,tries to return the bankrupt party to solvency,rather than liquidating it.dekalb cnty.fed.hous.fin.agency,cir discussing the fhfa conservatorship in the context of a lawsuit identical to the instant appeal.the fhfa is thus a party to this litigation in its role as conservator,but for purposes of our analysis,all three entities are identically situated.
congress exempted the enterprises from all state and local taxation.fannie mae exemption statute states 
fannie mae,including its franchise,capital,reserves,surplus,mortgages or other security holdings,and income,shall be exempt from all taxation now or hereafter imposed by any state,or by any county,except that any real property of the corporation shall be subject to state,territorial,county,municipal,or local taxation to the same extent as other real property is taxed.
c.both freddie mac and the fhfa exemption statutes are materially identical to fannie.e freddie mac j fhfa.the enterprises are thus exempt from all taxation by any state or local government,with the exception that they are still subject to taxes on real property.
pennsylvania and new jersey,like other states,tax the transfer of real estate.in pennsylvania,each person who makes,executes,delivers,accepts or presents for recording any document must pay a tax in the amount of one percent of the value of the real estate transferred.ann.document means a ny deed,instrument or writing which conveys,transfers,devises,confirms or evidences any transfer or devise of title to real estate in this commonwealth.id.pennsylvania also allows local authorities to impose real estate transfer taxes.id.
similarly,new jersey law requires the grantor of a deed to pay a fee to the county recording officer at the time the deed is offered for recording.stat.ann.the fee consists of a a state portion at the rate of for each of consideration or fractional part thereof recited in the deed,and b a county portion at the rate of for each of consideration or fractional part thereof so recited.id.grantors must also pay a supplemental fee for each property conveyance or transfer.id.
delaware and chester counties filed an amended complaint in the eastern district of pennsylvania on behalf of themselves and a putative class of all similarly situated counties in pennsylvania,seeking a declaratory judgment that the enterprises were not exempt from paying state and local real estate transfer taxes and a judgment awarding the damages in the amount of the unpaid taxes.the enterprises filed a motion to dismiss,which the district court granted.
the district of new jersey action proceeded similarly.cape may county and its county clerk filed an amended complaint on behalf of all new jersey counties seeking declaratory relief and damages.after hearing argument on a motion to dismiss,the district court dismissed the case.
lackawanna county recorder of deeds filed suit in the middle district of pennsylvania,on behalf of herself and a putative class consisting of all similarly situated pennsylvania counties,municipalities,and state entities,seeking a declaration that the enterprises were subject to state and local transfer taxes,money damages,and other relief the district court granted the enterprises motion to dismiss.the middle district of pennsylvania action differed slightly from the other two,in that the district court did not consider the constitutionality of the exemptions,which is why the united states appears only as amicus curiae with respect to that case.
appellants in each case timely appealed,and we consolidated the cases for appellate review.
the district courts had jurisdiction pursuant to,because of the presence of a federal question.the district courts also had jurisdiction pursuant to f,which provides for original district court jurisdiction over all civil actions to which freddie mac is a party without regard to amount or value nowithstanding any other provision of law.f.we have jurisdiction over the district courts final orders of dismissal pursuant to.we apply a plenary standard of review to issues of statutory interpretation,and to questions regarding a statute constitutionality.united states walker,cir.
appellants present both statutory and constitutional challenges to the enterprises claimed tax exemptions.as we will discuss in detail below,we disagree with their arguments.
it is the cardinal canon of statutory interpretation that a court must begin with the statutory language.in re philadelphia newspapers,llc,cir.we presume that congress expresses its intent through the ordinary meaning of the words it uses.murphy millennium radio group llc,cir.when that meaning is plain,our sole function at least where the disposition required by the test is not absurd is to enforce the statute according to its terms.id.quoting alston countrywide fin,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the enterprises are statutorily exempt from all taxation imposed by the states or their local subdivisions,with one notable exception the states may tax the enterprises real property.see c fannie mae id.e freddie mac id.j fhfa.the enterprises charters do not define the words all or taxation.when words are left undefined,we have turned to standard reference works such as legal and general dictionaries in order to ascertain their ordinary meaning.eid thompson,cir quoting united states geiser,cir.all of something is the whole amount or quantity of it it is every member or individual component,the whole number or sum of that thing.webster third new international dictionary,unabridged.taxation is the act of imposing a tax,and a tax is a charge imposed by the government on persons,entities,transactions or property to yield public revenue and,in its broadest sense,embraces all governmental impositions on the person,property,privileges,occupations,and enjoyment of the people,and include s duties,imposts,and excises.black law dictionary,ed emphasis added.under the canon of statutory construction expressio unius est exclusio alterius the express mention of one thing excludes all others,the solitary exception subjecting the enterprises to real property taxation implies strongly that they are exempt from all other types of taxes.see in re federal mogul global,cir.
the enterprises exemption from taxation is thus clearly expansive.fighting against such a capacious reading,appellants urge that all taxation means something other than it says that it is instead a term of art meaning only direct taxes.there are only three types of direct taxes capitations,also known as poll taxes,which are fixed taxes levied on people,see black,supra,at taxes on real property and taxes on personal property.see murphy.the transfer taxes are not direct taxes but rather are an excise tax,an indirect tax imposed on the manufacture,sale,or use of goods.black,supra,at.they tax the transfer of property,not the property itself.
in support of their argument,appellants rely on the supreme court decision in united states wells fargo bank.there,the court interpreted a provision of the housing act of that gave state and local housing authorities the power to issue financing instruments,termed project notes,see also hennepin cnty.fed l nat.mortg.ass n,d,noting that the project notes were property issued by state and local housing authorities during the housing shortage of the,aff cir.congress had exempted the project notes from all taxation now or hereafter imposed by the united states.wells fargo,at.wells fargo sought a refund of estate taxes paid on its project notes,arguing that the taxes fell within the ambit of all taxation from which the notes were exempt.rejecting wells fargo argument,the court observed that f or almost years after the act passage,it was generally assumed that this exempted the notes from federal income tax,but not from federal estate tax.id.at.the court understood as a background principle against which the housing act was passed that an exemption of property from all taxation had an understood meaning the property was exempt from direct taxation,but certain privileges of ownership,such as the right to transfer the property,could be taxed.id.at second emphasis in original.in appellants view,the supreme court exegesis of the meaning of all taxation in wells fargo controls our interpretation here.
the flaw in this argument,as both the enterprises and the united states observe,is that wells fargo involved an exemption of specific property from all taxation,whereas this case involves exemptions of entities.the estate tax that the court considered in wells fargo was an excise tax on the transfer of property at death,and transfer of the notes,as by bequest or sale,was not property and so could be taxed.dekalb county,at emphasis omitted.contrary to appellants argument,the distinction between a property exemption and an entity exemption renders wells fargo inapposite.
rather,our interpretation is guided by federal land bank of paul bismarck lumber.in bismarck,the supreme court considered whether a provision of the federal farm loan act that exempted federal land banks from paying state taxes included a state sales tax on property.the relevant portion of the farm loan act stated t hat every federal land bank shall be exempt from federal,state,municipal,and local taxation.the court determined that the unqualified term taxation used in the farm loan act clearly encompasses within its scope a sales tax such as the instant one.id.at.
the exemption in bismarck is materially identical to the enterprise exemptions in two important ways.first,in bismarck,as here,the exemption applied to entities,not to specific property,unlike the exemption in wells fargo.second,like the transfer taxes at issue here,a sales tax is an excise or privilege tax different in kind from a tax on property.sullivan united states.both taxes are measured by reference to the value of the property involved in the transaction,and both are taxes on the privilege of transferring ownership of the property,not taxes on the property itself.
to date,three courts of appeals have considered and rejected appellants contention.in dekalb county,the seventh circuit observed that the wells fargo court was saying that an exemption from property taxes,such as a tax on project notes,is not an exemption from transfer taxes as well,because a transfer tax is not a property tax even when the transfer is of property.at.had the supreme court meant to hold that the term all taxation means just property taxation a very strange reading,equivalent to interpreting all soup to mean all lobster bisque it would have had to overrule bismarck wells fargo does not even cite bismarck.id.similarly,in county of oakland federal housing finance agency,the sixth circuit reversed the only court in the country to have agreed with appellants argument,cir,rev g d.the sixth circuit held that bismarck controlled,and that appellants argument would require us to stretch wells fargo beyond its clear language.id.at the eighth circuit has ruled likewise.see hennepin,at we disagree with hennepin county argument that wells fargo limited the meaning of all taxation in an exemption statute to mean only all direct taxation citation omitted emphasis in original 
appellants argument is fundamentally incompatible with the statutory text.accordingly,we will join our sister circuits,interpret the phrase all taxation to mean precisely what it says,and hold that the enterprises are statutorily exempt from paying state and local real estate transfer taxes.
before turning to appellants constitutional arguments,we pause briefly to consider their alternative statutory argument.they contend that even if the transfer taxes fall within the scope of all taxation,the enterprises are still not exempt because the transfer taxes fall within the exception for taxes on real property.we disagree.
as we previously noted,the enterprises statutory exemption from all taxation contains a single exception they are not exempt from state and local taxes on real property.c fannie mae id.e freddie mac id.j fhfa.appellants posit that the transfer taxes are effectively taxes on real property because under pennsylvania law an owner can not perfect an interest in real property until the deed is recorded and the transfer taxes paid.appellants br.at 
we reject this argument as foreclosed by both united states supreme court and pennsylvania supreme court precedent,and as manifestly contrary to the difference between direct and indirect taxes the very difference,indeed,that appellants rely upon so heavily in their principal statutory argument.in wells fargo,the supreme court recognized the distinction between an excise tax,which is levied upon the use or transfer of property even though it might be measured by the property value,and a tax levied on the property itself.at.the pennsylvania real estate transfer tax is an excise tax because it is not a tax on the real estate itself but a tax on certain transactions pertaining to real estate.sablosky messner,discussing a prior version of the pennsylvania transfer tax.
appellants attempt to blur this clear distinction by arguing that the transfer taxes amount to direct real property taxes because they are calculated by reference to the value of the property,and because failure to pay the tax can result in the creation of a lien on the property.we find neither contention persuasive.with respect to the former,the supreme court rejected a similar argument in southern railway watts,recognizing that a privilege tax is not converted to a property tax because it is measured by the value of the property,emphasis added.with respect to the latter,the argument proves too much.under pennsylvania law,an individual failure to pay the transfer tax results in the creation of a lien in favor of the affected local government on all of the individual property both real and personal.see.ann.by appellants logic,then,the transfer tax is a direct tax on both real property and personal property.to see the absurdity of this reading,one need only consider that the united states may place a lien on a delinquent taxp
