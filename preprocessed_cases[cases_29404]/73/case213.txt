the question presented on this appeal is whether fees incurred by a trust are fully deductible in calculating adjusted gross income for purposes of the internal revenue code irc under e,or whether these fees are deductible only to the extent that they exceed two percent of the trust adjusted gross income under a.michael knight,trustee of the william rudkin testamentary trust the trust,appeals from a decision of the united states tax court robert wherry.we affirm the decision of the tax court and hold that a trust fees are subject to the floor of a and therefore not fully deductible in arriving at adjusted gross income.
background 
the parties in this case stipulated to the following facts.henry rudkin established the william rudkin testamentary trust in connecticut on april,for the benefit of his son william,william wife and william descendants and their spouses.the trust was originally funded with proceeds from the sale of pepperidge farm,a food products company,to campbell soup company.in,michael knight,the trustee,engaged warfield associates,warfield to provide advice to the trust.in its tax return,the trust reported total income of and claimed a deduction in the amount of for fees paid to warfield.the trust claimed this deduction on line of its tax return for deductions not subject to the floor the trust claimed no deduction on line for a llowable miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the floor.
on december,the internal revenue service the irs sent the trust a notice of deficiency for the year.in the notice,the irs indicated that it rejected the trust itemized deduction for fees in the amount of,and permitted such a deduction only in the amount of that portion of the fees which exceeded two percent of adjusted gross income of as a result,the trust owed in taxes.the parties subsequently became aware that the notice contained an error in its calculation of the trust adjusted gross income and stipulated that the correct amount was.the parties therefore agreed that the corresponding deduction for fees would be,but,for reasons not relevant here,agreed further that the resulting deficiency calculated in the december notice would remain unchanged.
the trust thereafter filed a petition disputing the assessed deficiency.it argued that the trustee fiduciary,the investment duties defined under the connecticut uniform prudent investor act.required investment advisory services for the proper administration of the trust sizable stock portfolio and that the fees were therefore fully deductible under e.following a trial in the united states tax court in hartford,connecticut,the tax court held that the investment advisory fees paid by the trust are not fully deductible under the exception provided in section e and are deductible only to the extent that they exceed percent of the trust adjusted gross income pursuant to section a.rudkin testamentary trust comm r,wl.this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
this appeal,which we have jurisdiction to consider under a,presents a question of statutory interpretation.in interpreting a statute,w e start,as always,with the language of the statute.williams taylor,d.we give the words of a statute their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning,absent an indication congress intended them to bear some different import.id.internal quotation marks omitted.our inquiry must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.robinson shell oil,d internal quotation marks omitted.the plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.id.at.a lthough a court appropriately may refer to a statute legislative history to resolve statutory ambiguity,there is no need to do so if the statutory language is clear.toibb radloff,d.
in considering the question of statutory interpretation presented on this appeal,we review the legal conclusions of the tax court de novo.reimels comm r,cir a providing that the courts of appeals shall have exclusive jurisdiction to review the decisions of the tax court in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions tried without a jury.in particular,w e owe no deference to the tax court statutory interpretations,its relationship to us being that of a district court to a court of appeals,not that of an administrative agency to a court of appeals.callaway comm r,cir quoting exacto spring comm r,cir posner.
statutory framework 
under the irc,the adjusted gross income of an estate or trust shall be computed in the same manner as in the case of an individual,subject to one exception relevant to this appeal.e.the exception provides that the deductions for costs which are paid or incurred in connection with the administration of the estate or trust and which would not have been incurred if the property were not held in such trust or estate shall be fully deductible from gross income in calculating adjusted gross income.id.e.in order to understand this provision operation,it is necessary first to comprehend the manner in which adjusted gross income is calculated for individuals.
section of the irc imposes a tax on all taxable income of individuals and trusts.in calculating taxable income,a taxpayer must first determine the amount of gross income,which is defined as all income from whatever source derived.id.a.the taxpayer then arrives at adjusted gross income by subtracting from gross income certain deductions,such as trade and business expenses and losses from the sale of property.id.a.finally,taxable income is calculated by subtracting from adjusted gross income any itemized or deductions.id.in the case of an individual,deductions include,inter alia,all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year for the management,conservation,or maintenance of property held for the production of income.id.
again in the case of an individual,the miscellaneous itemized deductions,deductions for any taxable year shall be allowed only to the extent that the aggregate of such deductions exceeds percent of adjusted gross income.id.a.stated differently,the rule creates a floor for an individual itemized deductions of the sort at issue here.section b exempts from the floor certain specifically enumerated itemized deductions.id.b.fees are generally treated as itemized deductions under.g specifying the circumstances in which f ees for services of investment counsel are deductible under section.they are not listed in b,so are therefore not exempt from the floor established by a.temp.reg.a ii stating that investment advisory fees are subject to the floor of a.
as noted,under e,trusts are generally subject to the same rules for calculating adjusted gross income that apply to individuals,with one exception that is relevant to this appeal.a trust costs are fully deductible,rather than subject to the floor,if they satisfy both of the following two requirements they are paid or incurred in connection with the administration of the trust and they would not have been incurred if the property were not held in such trust.e.there is no dispute here that the fees at issue meet the requirement of the first clause,that is,that the fees knight paid to warfield were incurred in connection with the administration of the trust.instead,the issue presented here,on which some of our sister circuits have disagreed,is whether the fees also satisfy the requirement of the second clause of e and therefore are fully deductible without regard to the floor of a.
ii.the circuit split 
the sixth circuit was the first federal court of appeals to consider the question presented here.it held that the investment advisor fees paid by the trust were costs incurred because the property was held in trust,thereby making them eligible for the e exception and not subject to the base of two percent of adjusted gross income.comm r,cir.the sixth circuit reasoned that because a trustee has a fiduciary duty to manage trust assets as a prudent investor,fees are necessary to the trust administration and caused by the fiduciary duty of the trustee.id.the court reasoned further that although individual investors often incur costs for investment advice,they are not required to consult advisors and suffer no penalties or potential liability if they act negligently for themselves.id.in short,established the rule that a trust costs attributable to the trustee fiduciary duty,and not required outside the administration of trusts,fall within the e exception and are therefore fully deductible 
the federal circuit rejected this reasoning in mellon bank,united states.in mellon bank,the court held that the second clause of e serves as a filter with respect to the first clause and treats as fully deductible only those administrative expenses that are unique to the administration of a trust and not customarily incurred outside of trusts.id.at.because i nvestment advice and management fees are commonly incurred outside of trusts,the court reasoned,these costs are not exempt under section e and are required to meet the two percent floor of section a.id.at.the federal circuit also found its construction to be consistent with the statute legislative history.id.it concluded by noting that the trust reading of the statute,which would find all costs arising out of the trustee fiduciary duties to fall within the second clause of e,rendered that clause superfluous because any costs associated with a trust will always be deductible.id.
the fourth circuit subsequently joined the federal circuit in holding that fees incurred by a trust are subject to the floor of a.scott united states,cir.noting that the text is clear and unambiguous,the fourth circuit stated that administrative expenses are subject to the floor if they constitute expenses commonly incurred by individual taxpayers.id.at.applying this rule,the court concluded that because fees are commonly incurred outside the context of trust administration,they are subject to the floor.id.the court noted,however,that o ther costs ordinarily incurred by trusts,such as fees paid to trustees,expenses associated with judicial accountings,and the costs of preparing and filing fiduciary income tax returns,are not ordinarily incurred by individual taxpayers,and they would be fully deductible under the exception created by e.id.these costs,the court explained,are solely attributable to a trustee fiduciary duties,and as such are fully deductible under e.id.stating a rationale similar to the federal circuit in mellon bank,the court said that to find a trust fees to be fully deductible would lead to the conclusion that a ll administrative expenses could be attributed to a trustee fiduciary duties,rendering the second clause of e meaningless.id.
iii.analysis 
the trust contends that the sixth circuit construed e correctly and that the federal and fourth circuits interpreted the provision inconsistently with both its plain language and legislative history.the trust principal textual argument is that the second clause of e creates a but for causation test,excluding from full deduction only those costs which would have been incurred even in the absence of the trust ownership of the property,without the trustee.the trust also relies on the drafting history of e to make the somewhat different argument that by enacting that particular section,congress intended only to prevent trusts from fully deducting those administrative expenses incurred by entities in which they had invested.for the reasons that follow,we reject both arguments.
statutory language 
the trust reads e to reflect congress intent to allow a full deduction for the administrative costs of a trust that are attributable to the fiduciary duty of the trustee.the trust argues that the statute sets forth a but for causal test if the cost would not have been incurred without the trustee,then it is attributable to the trustee performance of its fiduciary duty and is thus fully deductible under e.according to the trust,therefore,the second prong of e requires no consideration of whether a generic individual owner of the same assets may have incurred the cost at issue.rather,the trust contends that the causation test plainly entails a simple exercise of removing the trustee from the property and seeing which costs remain and which ones disappear without him.the trust points to specific statutory language in advancing this view.it reads the statute use of the language such trust to refer to the specific trust under consideration,its trustee and that trustee duties,rather than to the generic trust of e introductory language,that is,a trust of the type to which e is applicable under the trust construction,the statute requires consideration of whether a particular cost would have been incurred if the trustee had never existed.it would ignore,however,how an individual property owner managing the same assets would have acted.for the following reasons,we find the trust interpretation unreasonable.
as an initial matter,had congress intended to create a causation test of the type the trust advances,which disregards what an individual asset owner may have done if the assets were not held in trust,it could have done so in language clearly expressing that intent.such a but for causation test,however,is not apparent from the text ordinary,common meaning.see luyando grinker,cir noting we interpret a statute according to the ordinary,common meaning of the statute plain language.on the contrary,the phrase if the property were not held in such trust more logically directs the inquiry away from the trust and back toward the hypothetical ownership of the property by an individual.that is,the introductory language of e takes as its point of reference the rules that apply to individual taxpayers,and by using the phrase,if the property were not held in such trust,congress has aimed the inquiry at the costs that a hypothetical individual property owner could incur with respect to that property.we therefore agree with the fourth circuit statement in scott that the second prong of e does not ask whether the costs at issue are commonly incurred in the administration of trusts or are incurred as a result of a particular trustee fiduciary duty.it focuses the inquiry,instead,on the hypothetical situation where the assets are in the hands of an individual.see at.
although the statutory language directs the inquiry toward the counterfactual condition of assets held individually instead of in trust,the statute does not require a subjective and hypothetical inquiry into whether a particular,individual asset owner would have incurred the particular cost at issue.nothing in the statute indicates that congress intended the test for the exception to the floor to give rise to factual disputes about whether an individual asset owner or owners is insufficiently financially savvy or the assets sufficiently large such that he or she unquestionably would have sought investment advice.instead,the plain meaning of e second clause excludes from full deduction those costs of a type that could be incurred if the property were held individually rather than in trust.in other words,for the trust to avoid the floor and have advantage of the full deduction,the plain language of the statute requires certainty that a particular cost would not have been incurred if the property were not held in trust.
for that reason,the statute demands not a subjective and hypothetical inquiry,but rather an objective determination of whether the particular cost is one that is peculiar to trusts and one that individuals are incapable of incurring.in other words,the statute sets an objective limit on the availability of a full deduction and,as the source of that limit,looks to those costs that individual property holders are capable of incurring and permitted to deduct from adjusted gross income.for example,the fact that fees are subject to the floor under regulations applicable to individual taxpayers proves the fees to be a cost that individual taxpayers are capable of incurring.fees and other costs that individual taxpayers are capable of incurring are,therefore,not fully deductible pursuant to e when incurred by a trust.by contrast,costs that individ
