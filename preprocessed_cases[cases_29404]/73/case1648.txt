appellants here,petitioners below,are joe abouab,karl plischke,and terri chantrelle petitioners.they filed a mandamus action against the city and county of san francisco,its recorder,tax collector,and assessor when referred to collectively,the city,seeking to compel the city to investigate an unreported change in ownership of a san francisco property and reassess it.the reassessment happened,the upshot of which,after many years and many proceedings,was an increase in property tax revenue of some.
petitioners made a motion seeking a determination that they are entitled to attorneys fees in connection with that.the trial court rejected all of the theories on which petitioners fee claim was based,and denied them any fees.we,too,reject their claim and affirm.
i.the background 
introduction 
the appeal arises out of the reassessment of a san francisco property called one market plaza,a commercial office building and nearby parking garage one market plaza or the property.the reassessment was triggered under article xiiia of the california constitution proposition,following a determination that there had been a change in ownership.the change in ownership was not a simple,straightforward transaction by any means,but a complex series of transactions beginning in,involving the equitable life assurance company of the united states equitable,the international business machines retirement plan trust fund plan,and various separate accounts,highly regulated transactions authorized by the insurance laws of both california and new york,where equitable was incorporated.the transactions are described in detail in the recent opinion by division five of this court,ibm personal pension plan city and county of san francisco th,d,and such detail is not necessary to an understanding of the issue here.suffice to say that the reassessment came about only after an extensive investigation,review of thousands of pages of documents,a federal lawsuit,a lengthy hearing before the assessment appeals board aab,two lawsuits in the san francisco superior court,and more.while the ultimate outcome of the reassessment is still not finally determined,the net effect is,as of now,some plus in the city coffers.
b.the inkling of the change in ownership and the request for legislation 
attorney wayne lesser lesser,one of petitioners lawyers,represented the defendants in a declaratory relief action involving a small sandwich shop in one market plaza those defendants were joseph abouab,one of the petitioners,and his wife.according to lesser,as part of his due diligence he investigated a fictitious business filing pertaining to the owner of the property,to learn that the filing had expired.this led to a successful demurrer,which led to a new complaint alleging a fictitious business certificate naming a new owner.further investigation led lesser to uncover other names and,to him,confusion,the initial clue the ownership of one market plaza had changed.
in late august a meeting was held to attempt to settle the declaratory relief action.this meeting was attended by lesser,abouab,and four others,one of whom refused to identify his principal or even answer why he was there.according to lesser,this person told abouab that the building owners wanted him out,that there would be no settlement,and that they would bury him.this made lesser even more resolute.
though the declaratory relief action continued,lesser representation of abouab terminated by october.lesser nevertheless continued to investigate the change in ownership at one market plaza,and along the way apparently developed various sources,including a confidential source within equitable and other street sources.
meanwhile,beginning in october,lesser started communications with the san francisco mayor office and city attorney office to inform them about the possible change of ownership of a large downtown building.lesser did not identify the building in lesser words,he sought to interest them in potential legislative action in the nature of a local whistle blowers qui tam statute styled after california government code section the cal.qui tam statute to benefit abouab and the city.there was interest in such legislation,as evidenced by various memoranda and draft legislation in the record.however,for reasons not explained in the record,the board of supervisors did not pass the ordinance,and apparently in early october,lesser was advised of that fact.days later,he filed the within petition.
c.the writ proceeding 
on october,a petition for writ of mandamus was filed on behalf of petitioners,allegedly taxpayers of the city and county of san francisco the petition sought to compel the city to investigate an unreported change of ownership at one market plaza and to reassess the property.the petition was followed shortly by a first amended petition,filed october,which sought the same relief as the original,on the same theory,apparently only adding the assessment appeals board aab as a respondent and some exhibits.both petitions sought attorneys fees under former section of the charter of the city and county of san francisco charter and the common fund doctrine.
as petitioners stipulated below,in a stipulation filed over years after the petition,prior to filing their petition they did not discuss the basis for their position with the assessor office or share any information concerning the unreported change of even the identity of the property.the scope of the stipulation is broad,as the facts deemed as conclusively established included the following 
petitioners moving papers refer to a confidential source within the equitable who was lesser client petitioners and their counsel have declined to identify this person to respondents,based on a claim of privilege.the identity of this source was not disclosed to respondents during the course of their investigation of the one market plaza matter,nor was it made public in any other way 
petitioners moving papers refer to numerous street sources that counsel for petitioners developed during his investigation of the one market plaza matter neither petitioners nor their counsel ever disclosed the identity of any of these sources to the city before the end of the aab proceedings in this matter.none of these sources testified at the aab proceedings or provided any documentary evidence that was submitted into the record in front of the aab.
petitioners moving papers refer to their efforts to have a local tax reward ordinance adopted by the san francisco board of supervisors during discussions concerning this proposed ordinance,counsel for petitioners told representatives of san francisco that there was a possible unreported change of ownership affecting one or more large downtown properties in san francisco.during these discussions,neither petitioners nor their counsel identified the property or properties in question nor did they request any representative of san francisco to take any action with respect to the one market plaza property.
prior to serving their writ action on san francisco,neither petitioners nor their counsel provide sic any information to any city employee that identified one market plaza as the property involved in the unreported change of ownership.
prior to serving their writ action on san francisco,neither petitioners nor their counsel made any effort to discuss the issues raised in their writ petition with any city employee,or to resolve those issues without resorting to litigation.
petitioners arranged to serve the petition at a meeting at the office of deputy city attorney burk delventhal.the meeting was attended by three attorneys on behalf of petitioners,lesser,michael mendelson,and john doherty,and two attorneys for the city,delventhal and claude kolm,head of the city attorney tax division.according to lesser,they explained the nature of the petition and offered to cooperate with the city,at which point delventhal telephoned steven dunbar of the assessor office,to ask that he join the meeting.and,according to lesser,at the end of the meeting delventhal reportedly jumped up and said let get them and expressed appreciation and delight for the potential joint efforts to follow.efforts followed all right,but hardly joint.
d.the assessor investigation and the reassessment 
following receipt of the information from petitioners counsel,the assessor office began its investigation into the matter,under the supervision of chief assistant assessor dunbar,who was second in command of the san francisco office and with extensive experience involving change in ownership issues dunbar began almost immediately,and on october,acting under the statutory power of revenue and taxation code sections,subdivision d,and,he sent letters with document demands to the plan,equitable,and related entities concerning the ownership of one market plaza.
as dunbar began his investigation,on november,the city attorney wrote to lesser,advising that the assessor office has begun prompt action to investigate the change in ownership of one market plaza,and based on the results of this investigation,the assessor,the tax collector,and the recorder will seek to recover such taxes as the facts indicate are due.as a result,we believe there is no longer cause for this suit or for further actions to be taken which will only be duplicative of the assessor actions and could run up attorneys fees to be paid for from city funds.consequently,i request that you take action to dismiss the suit.if you do not do so and instead seek to initiate discovery,san francisco will move for a protective order unless it is assured that you will not seek attorneys fees for time spent on the discovery.
lesser responded by letter dated november,in which he expressed his shock at the city position and opined that the taxpayers interests would be best served by petitioners continued involvement.in the words of lesser declaration,his letter informed the city that neither petitioners nor counsel would get lost or abandon their duty to their taxpayer class to confer the maximum financial benefits to the citizens of san francisco.as doherty later declaration would describe the situation,shortly after the petition was filed,the city attorney attitude towards petitioner suddenly became hostile and uncooperative,and remained that way for about eight years,approximately.
dunbar document demands produced a massive amount of material in response,the plan alone producing some boxes of documents relating to one market plaza.these boxes were delivered to dunbar office,and he personally went through each of them,flagged those that seemed most relevant to the change of ownership determination,and had copies of many of those documents sent to the city attorney office for their review.equitable,too,produced many boxes of documents,which dunbar and deputy city attorneys reviewed and copied this investigation consumed half of dunbar working time for some months.
according to dunbar,these confidential materials provided the key evidence,the foundation of what would be his conclusion that the separate account transaction constituted a change of ownership of one market plaza under california property tax law.dunbar review of the documents revealed,for example,that as a result of the separate account transaction,the plan gained the right to profit from the rents received on the property the plan could also require that the property be sold,and was the party that would gain or lose depending on whether the property value had increased or decreased.the plan also gained the right to manage the property and to choose tenants for it.and the plan was responsible for the expenses of the property and had control over decisions of how much to spend on renovations.in short,the plan was the owner of the property in everything but name which,in dunbar view,compelled the conclusion that the separate account transaction had been a reassessable change in ownership of one market plaza.
dunbar discussed his intent to reassess the property with attorneys in the city attorney office,who told him they would support his decision.dunbar had the property reassessed,based on a year base year value,and on march,the assessor office notified one market plaza corporation the entity formed to manage the property that the property would be reassessed because the separate account transaction constituted a change in ownership under california property tax law.in march and april,the assessor office sent out notices of supplemental and escape assessments on the one market plaza property,with the new base year value based on the purchase price that had been paid by the plan for the property during the transaction 
following more investigation,in november,the assessor office increased the assessed value of the property based on the income method rather than fair market value.the assessor also imposed a penalty under revenue and taxation code sections and.thus began the dispute between the city and the plan that continues to this day.
e.the stay of the writ proceeding 
meanwhile,as dunbar was investigating the issue that was the subject of the petition,on december,the plan and equitable filed motions for judgment to,as lesser put it,end the proceedings,eject petitioners and obtain judgment in their favor.the motions were based in part on the grounds that the petition was moot because the assessor was in fact doing all that the petition sought and that petitioners had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.
these motions came on for hearing before judge stuart pollak on december.though judge pollak rejected the exhaustion of administrative remedies argument,by order dated january,he ordered the entire action stayed.the stay was ordered before any discovery had,before the matter was even at issue.
f.the dismissal of the writ proceeding 
the matter was apparently quiescent for some time,until september,when petitioners filed a motion for leave to file a supplemental and second amended petition seeking to compel the assessment of a fraud penalty.on september,the plan and equitable filed oppositions to petitioners motion and renewed their motions for judgment,again arguing the petition was moot because the assessor had taken action.judge pollak heard these motions,and on november,entered an order granting petitioners leave to amend and denying the motions for judgment.
on november,petitioners filed their second amended petition.which was not responded to by the city for over a year.finally,on january,the city filed a demurrer to the second amended petition,arguing that it was barred by revenue and taxation code section,failed to plead notification,improperly sought to compel discretionary actions,and failed to allege an actual controversy.at the same time,the plan and equitable filed motions for judgment on the petition,claiming that the petition was moot,as the assessor office had taken every action that petitioners had sought.petitioners filed a motion to stay.
the matters came on for hearing on february,again before judge pollak.this time judge pollak granted the motions for judgment and dismissed the petition as moot.doing so,however,judge pollak expressly retained jurisdiction to determine whether petitioners should receive an award of attorneys fees,and extended the time to seek such an award until all challenges to the assessments had been resolved.
we digress from the chronology to note that petitioners contend that judge pollak has ruled or found that petitioners were entitled to attorneys fees if certain conditions were met.such contention is belied by the record.judge pollak remarks throughout the argument on the motions all indicated that no decision was made on the attorneys fee issue,illustrated,for example,by his express statement that he did not know whether there was an entitlement to fees,followed shortly by the caveat,should i do so.and were there any doubt on there is is dispelled by the succinct holding in judge pollak order the court has made no determination at this time as to who or which party to this proceeding is the prevailing party or whether attorneys fees and costs should be awarded or any other issue which must be determined in connection with the attorneys fee motion.
g.the federal case 
in january,the trustee of the plan filed a lawsuit in the united states district court,northern district of california.it was chase manhattan bank,city and county of san francisco cal.june,no.c vrw,and in it chase sought,inter alia,a declaration that the city attempt to reassess the property was preempted by erisa.the city filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,which the district court granted on july.chase appealed to the ninth circuit court of appeals,which affirmed see chase manhattan bank,city and county of san francisco cir,cert.den,d,the effect of which was a determination that the federal suit was properly dismissed 
h.the assessment appeals board proceedings 
following the defeat in the federal action,equitable and one market plaza corporation filed applications with the aab to challenge the reassessment and the fraud penalties.apparently contemporaneously,and before the aab hearing began,the plan and the city began settlement negotiations,which led to a proposed settlement with the following essential terms the plan would not contest the assessor change of ownership determination the parties would stipulate to values for the property that were somewhat lower than those that had been assessed in and the city would refund the fraud penalty that had been imposed.
petitioners counsel vigorously opposed that settlement and correspondence ensued between and among the aab,the city attorney,and the attorney for the plan about that opposition and the settlement.the result of all this was a notification from the aab that it rejected the settlement.subsequent negotiations led to another stipulated settlement petitioners attorneys again interposed objections again the aab rejected the deal.
following the aab rejection of the proposed settlements,the matter proceeded to a contested hearing before the aab.the hearing,beginning on january,and concluding on may,consumed days of public hearings and a number in closed session.numerous witnesses testified,and over exhibits were introduced.in addition,petitioners attorneys spoke.petitioners opening brief describes their participation as they gave testimony and submitted extensive documentary evidence including three seminal evidentiary pieces which the aab admitted into evidence over the strenuous objections of the city attorney and ibm,petitioners evidence,the irs form,the state board opinion,and a letter to the dol department of labor from equitable counsel,demonstrated fraud and change of ownership.in the main,petitioners admitted evidence relied on the dol files obtained by petitioners.while petitioners were not parties to the aab proceedings,nonetheless,petitioners provided critical admissible evidence that the aab incorporated in its decision upholding the fraud penalty and ownership change.petitioners attended all the public hearings.petitioners participated as public commentators pursuant to san francisco sunshine ordinance which provides opportunity for public comment and presentation of relevant evidence.petitioners persuaded richard hongisto to comment publicly before the aab which he did most emphatically.
on august,the aab issued its findings of fact,conclusions of law,and decision,a decision that was a complete victory for the city the aab determined there had been a change of ownership based on the separate account transaction,accepted the values the assessor had submitted,and upheld the fraud penalties.
thereafter,the city and the assessor notified the aab that the taxpayer was due a partial refund as a result of the aab decision that the property should in part be valued at a lower rate than the assessor used,and on march,the aab issued a clarification of its prior order holding that the fraud penalty could be applied only to the one market plaza office building,and not the garage.
i.the consolidated san francisco county actions 
in february,the plan filed a complaint in the san francisco superior court,which challenged both the conclusion of a change in ownership and the fraud penalty.however,during the trial court proceedings,the plan narrowed the relief sought to a full refund of the fraud penalties imposed or,in the alternative,to a partial refund of the fraud penalties imposed on the garage site based on the clarification order.
in may,the assessor filed a petition for writ of administrative mandamus code of civ,against the aab,seeking to set aside the march clarification order on the ground that the aab lacked jurisdiction to modify the substance of its august decision.
the two actions were consolidated and came on for hearing before judge alex saldamando.on april,judge saldamando entered judgment,affirming all actions of the aab.the plan appealed,and in august,division five of this court filed its opinion on that appeal.ibm personal pension plan city and county of san francisco,supra,th,d.
j.the motion for attorneys fees 
meanwhile,by order dated april,the within matter was assigned to judge richard kramer for single assignment.at a case management conference on october,petitioners advised of their intent to file a motion for attorneys fees,and judge kramer ordered that the motion address first the issue of entitlement,leaving any issue of amount for future determination.
on october,petitioners filed their motion for award of reasonable attorneys part.the motion sought attorneys fees under three theories common fund,substantial benefit,and the private attorney general statute in code of civil procedure section section.the moving papers were hundreds of pages in length and included a lengthy memorandum of points and authorities,and declarations from former assessor richard hongisto and attorneys doherty,mendelson,and lesser.petitioners also included a request for judicial notice.
at a case management conference on november,judge kramer ordered the motion set for hearing on march,with opposition due february,and reply by march.
on december,the parties participated in an unreported telephone conference call with judge kramer,following which an form of order was entered,which in pertinent part reads as follows.on march,the court will hold a hearing on petitioners motion for attorneys fees,part one entitlement.the legal issue to be addressed at that hearing is whether the lack of presuit notification bars petitioners claim to attorneys fees under any of the legal doctrines set forth in petitioners motion.the march hearing will focus on whether anything that happened,or did not happen,up until the filing of the writ petition in this matter affects petitioners right to obtain attorneys fees.
a few days later,petitioners filed a supplemental memorandum of points and authorities which in its introduction and background section confirmed that as a result of the various conferences noted above and on the record and off the record discussions between the court and parties regarding preliminary issues the parties agreed to frame the preliminary issue as whether the lack of presuit notification bars petitioners claim to attorney fees under any of the legal doctrines set forth in petitioners motion and whether anything happened,or did not happen,up to the filing of the writ petition in this matter affecting petitioners right to obtain attorneys fees.this supplemental memorandum sought attorneys fees under the common fund theory and former section of the charter.in support of the supplemental memorandum,petitioners filed a declaration of frank mahoney iii who had previously served as a member of the aab and participated in the hearings on one market plaza.
on february,the city filed its opposition to the motion,which included declarations from dunbar and deputy city attorney owen clements,both with numerous exhibits.on march,petitioners filed their reply,and the matter was fully briefed for the march,hearing.
the motion came on as scheduled on march,prior to which judge kramer had issued a tentative ruling denying the motion.at the beginning of the hearing,judge kramer confirmed that before him were two questions whether the lack of notification by the petitioners here to the city precludes their getting attorneys fees,and also whether anything happened after the filing of the petition,which would give them a right to attorneys fees,notwithstanding whatever the effect of the failure of giving notice.judge kramer then explained the basis of his tentative ruling,as follows 
as to the failure to give notice in advance,i think there is a good,solid,practical reason for requiring such notice.it to keep costs down it to give the government an opportunity to do what the government is supposed to do.and it to avoid,at a minimum,a duplication of effort,maybe even more than a duplication of effort.i think that is a solid rule which applies here.the petitioners did not give notice prior to the filing a writ of mandamus.
regarding whether or not something else happened that would nonetheless justify fees,i said the answer to that is no.first and maybe foremost,is there was never any favorable result of the writ proceeding.and i believe that that is,in the usual circumstance,perhaps subject to exceptions not applicable here,a major requirement.there has to be a success,favorable judgment on a writ petition.
against that background,judge kramer heard extensive argument,lasting almost two and hours,at the conclusion of which he announced his decision.judge kramer began by expressly stating that he was making no findings one way or the other of a normative nature as to who should have done what no findings one way or the other as to who found the fund,who preserved it,or who maintained it.all i doing is figuring out whether there is a legal basis for fees.similarly,i am making no finding as to whether the assessor would have done something in particular or whether the assessor did run with the information.
judge kramer went on to discuss section,concluding that the section does apply to activities by citizens,taking it on their own to go and supplement,or if you want to be pejorative,supplant the activities of the government,and later hope to get attorneys fees and costs as a result.this is solid law.it has great practical application.it eliminates a lot of difficulties later on,some of which are reflected in this case.
then he asked,do the common fund,or the substantial benefit equitable doctrines supplement i think not,for important reasons which he set forth,and then concluded,so i going to make it easy for you in terms of getting review of this.i hold that is the exclusive manner in which you can get attorneys fees and costs from the government in a situation such as what happened here and that the common fund and substantial benefit theories do not apply to the petitioners request here.and that being so,it seems that it been conceded by the petitioners that they are not applying under therefore,the request for attorneys fees is not justified by law.
there followed a formal order denying petitioners motion for attorneys fees,prepared,interestingly enough,by petitioners attorneys.the order was three paragraphs long,and concluded as follows after full consideration of the evidence and the argument of counsel containing sic in all supporting and opposing papers heretofore filed by the parties,the papers previously filed in this action,and the arguments of counsel,and good cause appearing therefore,and for the reasons stated in open court,the court ruled as follows it is hereby ordered that petitioners motion for an award of attorney fees is denied on the grounds that the exclusive manner whereby petitioners can receive attorney fees and costs from the government herein is pursuant to.further,neither the common fund nor substantial benefit theories apply herein.petitioners do not seek fees under,therefore petitioners attorney fee request has no legal basis.
petitioners filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.summary of petitioners position 
as indicated above,petitioners claimed entitlement to attorneys fees has evolved,beginning with their three petitions which sought fees under former section of the charter relevant case law,which fees should be based upon and taken from the common fund created then,in their original moving papers,petitioners sought fees under the common fund,substantial benefit,and private attorney general doctrines,and in their supplemental memorandum under the common fund theory and former section of the charter.finally,at the hearing below petitioners acknowledged that they were no longer proceeding under the private attorney general theory,but only on the common fund and substantial benefit theories.and that is their position here.
petitioners make three fundamental contentions on appeal,set forth in their opening brief as follows petitioners are entitled to attorneys fees under the common fund theory,under well established precedent petitioners are entitled to attorneys fees on the substantial benefit theory,a review of which theory demonstrates,as a matter of law,the lower court ruling is wrong and the trial court denial of attorneys fees has no legal or factual basis.the claimed bases for these,as the introduction to petitioners opening brief distills it,are their discovery,investigation,and litigation of the change in ownership their representation of the city as amicus curiae in the federal case and their taxpayer class representation before the aab,where,they claim,because of their advocacy the aab a rejected the settlements and b adopted their legal positions.
iii.discussion 
a.the standard of review 
the decision as to whether an award of attorney fees is warranted rests initially with the trial court where,as here,a trial court has discretionary power to decide an issue,its decision will be reversed only if there has been a prejudicial abuse of discretion.baggett gates cal d,case accord,williams san francisco bd.of permit appeals th,d case plcm group,drexler cal th,d,case.
on the other hand,we exercise our independent review on an appeal raising a pure issue of law regarding the entitlement to attorneys fees.snyder marcus millichap th,d.put another way,the determination of the statutory basis for an attorneys fees award presents a legal issue for us to determine anew on appeal,regardless of the trial court ruling.akins enterprise th,d.
whether judge kramer holding that section is the exclusive manner available to petitioners is right is not the issue here,but whether his decision denying fees was the correct result.there is perhaps no rule of review more firmly established than the principle that a ruling or decision correct in law will not be disturbed on appeal merely because it was given for the wrong reason.if correct upon any theory of law applicable to the case,the judgment will be sustained regardless of the considerations that moved the lower court to its conclusion.belair riverside county flood control dist.cal d.or,as witkin puts it,if the decision of the lower court is right,the judgment or order will be affirmed regardless of the correctness of the grounds upon which the court reached its conclusion.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.
we conclude that the order denying petitioners motion was correct,as petitioners are not entitled to attorneys fees under any theory.
b.the law of attorneys fees 
california follows what is commonly referred to as the american rule,which provides that each party to a lawsuit must ordinarily pay his,her,or its own attorney fees.citations.the legislature codified the american rule in when it enacted code of civil procedure section,which states in pertinent part that except as attorney fees are specifically provided for by statute,the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement,express or implied,of the parties trope katz cal th,d,trope.
various theories have developed as exceptions to this rule,some of which are created by statute and others by common law.as noted above,petitioners originally argued three such theories below as the claimed bases for their entitlement to fees common fund,substantial benefit,and the private attorney general,and we begin with exposition of each theory 
the common fund theory 
the common fund theory was described in serrano priest cal d,serrano iii o ne who expends attorneys fees in winning a suit which creates a fund from which others derive benefits,may require those passive beneficiaries to bear a fair share of the litigation costs.citation.this,the common fund exception to the american rule regarding the award of attorneys fees is grounded in the historic power of equity to permit the trustee of a fund or property,or a party preserving or recovering a fund for the benefit of others in addition to himself,to recover his costs,including his attorneys fees,from the fund of property itself or directly from the other parties enjoying the benefit.citation.
the substantial benefit theory 
the substantial benefit theory,also described in serrano iii,supra,cal d,was the subject of further description in woodland hills residents,city council cal d,woodland hills in serrano iii,we explained that the substantial benefit theory which may be viewed as an outgrowth of the common fund doctrine,permits the award of fees when the litigant,proceeding in a representative capacity,obtains a decision resulting in the conferral of a substantial benefit of a pecuniary or nonpecuniary nature.in such circumstances,the court,in the exercise of its equitable discretion,thereupon may decree that under dictates of justice those receiving the benefit should contribute to the costs of its production.citation.unlike the private attorney general concept,which,as we have seen,is intended to promote the vindication of important rights affecting the public interest,the substantial benefit the common fund doctrine from which it on the principle that those who have been unjustly enriched at another expense should under some circumstances bear their fair share of the costs entailed in producing the benefits they have obtained.
the common fund and substantial benefit theories are equitable theories see,generally,pearl,cal.attorney fee awards ed,chapter,pearl,and equitable principles are appropriately applied in determining whether to award attorneys fees sought under these theories.
the private attorney general statute 
the private attorney general doctrine,originally also a creature of the court inherent equitable authority see trope,supra,cal th at,d,is found in section the statute provides in essence that a successful party may be awarded attorneys fees against one or more opposing parties in an action that results in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest.the private attorney general doctrine is based on the theory that privately initiated lawsuits are often essential to the effectuation of the fundamental public polices embodied in constitutional or statutory provisions,and that,without some mechanism authorizing the award of attorney fees,private actions to enforce such important public policies will as a practical matter frequently be infeasible.woodland hills,supra,cal d at.
three basic criteria are required to support an award of attorneys fees under section the action resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest a significant benefit was conferred on the general public or a large class of persons and the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement were such as to make the award appropriate.woodland hills,supra,cal d at,press lucky stores,cal d.
petitioners did not prevail,nor meet the requirements of the catalyst theory 
the general rule is that a party seeking attorneys fees must prevail or be successful pearl,supra,which rule pertains regardless of the theory on which one seeks fees.thus,serrano iii explained that the common fund may benefit one who expends attorneys fees in winning a suit serrano iii,supra,cal d at,italics added.similarly,the substantial benefit doctrine may support a fee award to a litigant proceeding in a representative capacity,who obtains a decision resulting in the conferral of a substantial benefit woodland hills,supra,cal d at,italics added.illustrative is johnson tago,d.johnson,where,in reversing an award of attorneys fees as premature,division four of this court noted that the substantial benefit exception is limited to successful plaintiffs,plaintiffs who have ultimately prevailed in the litigation.this is the requirement under the equitable theories and,as quoted above,the rule is the same under section,which expressly states that fees may be awarded only to one who is successful.
as also quoted above,judge kramer supported his tentative ruling in part on the basis that there was no favorable result in the writ proceeding.later,in referring to knoff city of san francisco d.knoff,the primary case on which petitioners rely,he distinguished that case in part as involving a successful petition.and respondents argued below,as they do here,that to receive fees petitioners must establish that they succeeded on the merits.despite all this,petitioners opening brief eschews any reference to,much less discussion of,any requirement of prevailing or success.and their reply brief responds only with the conclusory assertion that respondents argument that petitioners failed to obtain favorable judgment has no legal basis,in claimed support of which petitioners cite only folsom butte county of governments cal d,folsom.folsom involved an action which ended in a settlement between the parties that was silent as to the issues of costs and attorneys fees,and the supreme court affirmed that plaintiffs were successful parties and entitled to fees under section.there is no settlement here.the petition was dismissed.in short,petitioners do not meaningfully address the requirement that they must prevail.
but a requirement it is,and even the cases with the most liberal interpretation of prevail or succeed do not avail petitioners.to the contrary,the most liberal approach of the most recent decision on the subject imposes a requirement that is devastating to petitioners provides complete support for judge kramer determination.that case is graham daimlerchrysler cal th,d,graham.
in graham,daimlerchrysler marketed its and dakota trucks as having a towing capacity when in fact they could tow only pounds.graham,supra,cal th at,d.daimlerchrysler became aware of the error in early,set up a response team,notified its customers of the error,and initially offered cash and merchandise in compensation it later authorized dealers to offer,on a basis,to repurchase or replace the trucks if the buyer so demanded.id.at,d.in late july and early august,the santa cruz county district attorney and the california attorney general threatened legal action for false advertising,and requested a response from daimlerchrysler by the end of august.meanwhile,on august,plaintiffs filed their complaint seeking return of their payments,compensatory damages,and attorneys fees,premised on a single cause of action for breach of express warranty.ibid.less than three weeks later,daimlerchrysler issued an offer to all dakota buyers to repurchase or replace their trucks.id.at,d.
when plaintiffs amended complaint acknowledged those offers,daimlerchrysler filed a demurrer,which the trial court sustained without leave to amend and dismissed the case as moot.graham,supra,cal th at,d.daimlerchrysler then settled with the public agencies by paying a fine and agreeing to ensure the marketing error did not reoccur.ibid.
notwithstanding the dismissal,plaintiffs sought attorneys fees under section.the trial court awarded such fees,finding that the requirements of section had been met,rejecting daimlerchrysler assertion that plaintiffs suit had no bearing on its decision,and finding that the public agencies inquiries did not make the suit unnecessary as the agencies never sought any remedies on behalf of the buyers.graham,supra,cal th at,d.the court of appeal affirmed.id.at,d.as did the california supreme court.
graham recognized that california courts have taken a broad view of what constitutes success,holding that it is not limited to a party who has obtained a judicially ordered or judicially recognized resolution of the dispute,such as a final judgment or settlement.declining to follow the united states supreme court holding in buckhannon board care home,west virginia of health and human resources,d buckhannon,the california supreme court affirmed that a party also may be found to be successful,and thus entitled to fees,if the lawsuit was a catalyst motivating defendants to provide the primary relief sought.graham,supra,cal th at,d,quoting westside community for independent living,obledo cal d,westside community.
while holding that the catalyst theory was the law in california,the court adopted a limitation proposed by the attorney general appearing as amicus curiae,a limitation dispositive here.this limitation is that a plaintiff seeking attorney fees under a catalyst theory must first reasonably attempt to settle the matter short of litigation.see grimsley board of supervisors d.grimsley.graham,supra,cal th at,d.this requirement,the supreme court elaborated,is fully consistent with the basic objectives behind section and with one of its explicit necessity of private enforcement of the public interest.awarding attorney fees for litigation when those rights could have been vindicated by reasonable efforts short of litigation does not advance that objective and encourages lawsuits that are more opportunistic than authentically for the public good.lengthy prelitigation negotiations are not required,nor is it necessary that the settlement demand be made by counsel,but a plaintiff must at least notify the defendant of its grievances and proposed remedies and give the defendant the opportunity to meet its demands within a reasonable time.ibid.
the catalyst theory was also recognized in the companion case to graham,a case even more particularly applicable here,as it involved a public entity defendant city of los angeles cal th,d,tipton.tipton was a class action in federal district court seeking damages and injunctive relief against the city for sexual and racial discrimination.settlement negotiations led to a consent decree,which was revoked by the district court.plaintiffs then began negotiations with a newly appointed police chief,which were not fruitful.but while no settlement was reached,the police department voluntarily implemented several policies.id.at,d.
plaintiffs moved for attorneys fees on the catalyst theory,arguing that the voluntary changes were similar to the original consent decree.the district court ruled for plaintiffs and the city paid the award without appeal.a year later,following the decision in buckhannon,supra,d,the city moved for reconsideration,which the district court granted,and then went on to uphold the award under california law.tipton,supra,cal th at,d.the city appealed,and the ninth circuit certified the question of the viability of the catalyst theory to the california supreme court,which upheld the theory for the reasons stated in graham,supra,cal th,d,summarizing its holding there as follows in order to obtain attorney fees without a judicially recognized change in the legal relationship between the parties,a plaintiff must establish that the lawsuit was a catalyst motivating the defendants to provide the primary relief sought that the lawsuit had merit and achieved its catalytic effect by threat of victory,not by dint of nuisance and threat of expense as elaborated in graham and that the plaintiffs reasonably attempted to settle the litigation prior to filing the lawsuit.tipton,at,d.
and,given that the defendant was a public entity,the supreme court emphasize d another critical limitation first articulated over years ago,affirming the holding in westside community,supra,cal d.tipton,supra,cal th at,d.attorney fees may not be obtained,generally speaking,by merely causing the acceleration of the issuance of government regulations or remedial measures,when the process of issuing those regulations or undertaking those measures was ongoing at the time the litigation was filed.when a government agency is given discretion as to the timing of performing some action,the fact that a lawsuit may accelerate the performance does not by itself establish eligibility for attorney fees.id.at,d.then the supreme court responded to the city argument that the catalyst theory would deter public agencies from making voluntary changes after litigation has been filed.not so,the court said,because a s noted above,we have adopted the requirement that a plaintiff attempt to settle its grievance short of litigation.thus,for example,when the responsible authorities of a public agency are unaware of a discriminatory policy by their subordinates,prompt correction of this policy once it is brought to their attention will avoid payment of attorney fees.ibid.
grimsley,supra,d,cited with approval in graham,supra,cal th at,d,is also persuasive.grimsley,a concerned citizen,filed two motions for attorneys fees,following a judgment commanding the county to adopt a plan as ordered by the court.grimsley action was filed during the county further study and modification of the plan,and his fee motions followed an order which arose out of an action to which grimsley had not been a party.both motions for fees were denied grimsley appealed them both and the court of appeal affirmed them both.
the court first observed that an award of attorneys fees under section is discretionary,and will not be reversed absent a showing of abuse of discretion it then observe d that courts may be guided by equitable principles when awarding attorney fees.grimsley,supra,d at.most significantly,the court observed that grimsley,although he had ample opportunity to do so before commencement of his action,made no complaint or suggestion to the concerned county officials about the failure to comply with the law,or in what respects those statutes were not followed.we are of the opinion,in a case such as this,that before commencing his action a private attorney general,such as plaintiff grimsley,must be required reasonably to point out to the responsible county official or administrative or legislative body,such a claimed shortcoming of a general plan,thus to avoid litigation and substantial public expense.here,it is a near certainty that had grimsley timely pointed out to an appropriate county office or agency,the respects in which the law had not been followed,appropriate corrective action would have been promptly forthcoming.applying the rationale of phelan superior court cal d,we hold that attorney fees under code of civil procedure section,will not be awarded unless the plaintiff seeking such fees had reasonably endeavored to enforce the important right affecting the public interest,without litigation and its attendant expense.grimsley,supra,d at.
it had been recognized long before graham that a party may be deemed successful even if,as here,their case has been dismissed,maria riles cal d,section case i n determining whether a plaintiff is a successful party t he critical fact is the impact of the action,not the manner of its resolution.likewise may a plaintiff be deemed successful even though the case has become moot,coalition for economic survival deukmejian d.while these holdings are facially favorable to petitioners,the principle behind them is not.for,as pearl points out,the principle that a party whose claim is mooted may nevertheless be a prevailing party stems from the catalyst theory of entitlement to attorneys fees.pearl,supra.and the prelitigation notice requirement of the catalyst not provided by dispositive.
petitioners opening brief does not even mention graham.and their reply brief argues only that there is no law holding that notification is a prerequisite to recovery under the common fund or substantial benefit theories.they cite nothing in support of that assertion,but do cite trim,county of monterey d,as holding that they are not required to exhaust administrative remedies before filing mandate where taxpayers seek to mandate a public official to perform a ministerial duty against a third party.administrative remedies is not the issue here.notification is.
while petitioners argument is not crystal clear,they may be contending that the catalyst theory does not apply to fees sought under the common fund or substantial benefit theories.if this is their argument,they must lose,as they did not prevail.in other words,they need the catalyst theory,as they perhaps concede,manifest by references in the brief to their being the moving force.if,on the other hand,petitioners argument is that the requirement of the catalyst theory does not apply except in a claim for fees under section,they offer nothing in support.and we can discern no rational basis for such a distinction.
to the contrary,graham itself found support for its conclusion of prevailing party by reference to its construction of that term in claims for fees under civil code section,that is,a contractual provision for fees to one party.graham,supra,cal th at,d.this has nothing to do with section.even more telling is tipton,which specifically held that the catalyst theory applied to government code section cases,that is,attorneys fees under the fair employment and housing act feha.tipton,supra,cal th at,d.finally,we note that cases have recognized the catalyst theory in common fund cases.see,savoie merchants bank cir,and koppel wien cir,and see generally consolidated edison company of new york bodman,recognizing that some version of catalyst theory applies,illustrated by decisions awarding common fund fees even where the claimants action was dismissed as moot.
in sum,petitioners must necessarily attempt to avail themselves of the benefit of the catalyst theory.with the benefit of that theory comes its burden,the requirement of notification,a requirement,we conclude,that applies regardless of the theory under which one seeks fees.petitioners admittedly did not meet that burden.their claim must fail.
in support of their contentions on appeal,petitioners fundamentally rely on three cases,one of which did involve an award of attorneys fees resulting from reassessment of real property owned by others knoff,supra,d.knoff,a mandamus action,had its origin in the indictment of the san francisco assessor,who was charged with accepting bribes in exchange for favorable property tax assessments.petitioners,four san francisco taxpayers,made a demand that the assessor office do its duty and reassess the properties.those demands were rejected,and petitioners filed a writ against the city and county of san francisco,its board of supervisors,and the assessor.id.at.the trial court granted judgment on the pleadings for petitioners,concluding that,despite proper demands upon them to reassess the property,none of the defendants had acted,claiming that they did not do so as they desired to await the conclusion of the criminal prosecution so as not to prejudge the assessor guilt.the trial court ordered a peremptory writ of mandate,including against the board and the assessor.id.at.
after finding that petitioners had standing,the trial court awarded them fees pursuant to former section of the charter,which provided as follows in the event that a taxpayer of the city and county institute suit or other proceeding as provided by law against any officer,board or commission of the city and county in the name of said taxpayer on behalf of the city and county,if judgment be finally entered in his favor he shall be allowed his costs and also such reasonable compensation for attorney fees as may be fixed by the court.knoff,supra,d at,fn.the court of appeal affirmed,including the award of attorneys fees.
knoff is manifestly distinguishable from the setting here.the petitioners in knoff made a demand.knoff,supra,d at.petitioners here stipulated that they did which,of course,there could be no refusal to act.the petitioners in knoff were determined to have standing id.at,which is not demonstrated here.see fn,ante.finally,the petitioners in knoff recovered fees under section of the charter,based on a judgment in their favor.id.at.there is no such judgment here 
petitioners also cite to bank of america cory d.cory,which,they assert,applies the common fund criteria in an analogous situation.we disagree.cory was an action by taxpayers against the state controller seeking to compel him to perform his duty to enforce the unclaimed property law code of civ,et against a bank which had imposed interest charges on dormant accounts and discontinued paying interest on them.id.at.at one point the taxpayers obtained a preliminary injunction invalidating certain emergency regulations the controller had issued.id.at.
the taxpayers action was then consolidated with an action against the bank in which the controller sought to recover the dormant funds plus interest and damages under government code section.the trial court found,inter alia,that the controller did not start to effectively enforce the unclaimed property law until challenged by the taxpayers suit,and therefore awarded the taxpayers attorneys fees under section.cory,supra,d at.the court of appeal affirmed the award of attorneys fees on the basis that the totality of the evidence supported the conclusion that the taxpayers suit was the sine qua non of the controller actions.as the court noted,the controller grudgingly concede d the taxpayers approach resulted in a larger recovery.most important,however,is the fact the controller did not enforce the unclaimed property law until provoked into action by the taxpayers suit.cory,supra,d at.the setting here is not analogous.
petitioners also cite rider county of san diego th,d,in which a taxpayers group filed suit challenging the validity of a sales tax that had been approved by a bare majority of the electorate.the trial court entered judgment declaring the tax invalid as not approved by a vote,and ordered disbursement of the invalidly collected taxes.it also awarded attorneys fees under the private attorney general statute.the court of appeal agreed that attorneys fees were appropriate,but not under the private attorney general statute.rather,the attorneys should be paid their reasonable attorney fees pursuant to the equitable doctrine of the common fund theory.the taxpayers recovery of the invalidly collected supplemental sales tax revenues in this case,and the resultant preservation of those revenues to satisfy subsequent refund claims constitutes a precise fit within the common fund theory.rider county of san diego,supra,th at,d.the setting here is not such a fit.
finally,we note the observation in city and county of san francisco sweet cal th,d,a case which petitioners cite,where the california supreme court held that one of the three common elements required to support a common fund fee award is that the attorney fees are sought by the sole active litigant whose recovery created the fund.petitioners were not that litigant.
in sum,petitioners admitted with the requirement of graham,supra,cal th,d,by itself defeats their claimed entitlement to attorneys fees.so,too,the general law applicable to the common fund and substantial benefit theories.
equitable considerations demonstrate that petitioners are not entitled to attorneys fees 
as quoted above,judge kramer order denying petitioners motion held that further,neither the common fund nor substantial benefit theory apply herein.while judge kramer did not elaborate on the basis of that conclusion,and it may be that he was relying on section being the exclusive manner by which petitioners could proceed,our review of the record record that petitioners assert is complete demonstrates that attorneys fees are not appropriate under either the common fund or substantial benefit theories based on equitable considerations.
as noted above,the common fund and substantial benefit theories are equitable theories,with equitable principles appropriately applied in determining whether to award attorneys fees sought under them.neal county of stanislaus d.both doctrines exist in equity so that the active litigator who extends a benefit to a class of passive beneficiaries is not made to bear the cost of litigation on his or her own.baker pratt d.
there is no question that petitioners attorneys expended much effort injecting themselves into the saga of one market plaza.likewise without question is that the city resisted such involvement,repeatedly stating that such involvement was,unwelcome.back and forth the missives flew,in the setting described by doherty as hostile and uncooperative.what,then,are the equitable considerations that favor or disfavor petitioners 
to begin with,there is the or so months from the time lesser first got wind of the one market plaza issue to the disclosure of any fact,during which time he withheld all information as he attempted to have the city pass the legislation petitioners sought,the effect of which,to use the word petitioners agreed in the stipulation,would be to obtain a reward.when that did not succeed,the petition was filed,but without any prior demand that the city do what petitioners claimed it must do,or even giving the city the benefit of the information petitioners attorneys had,a petition thus filed in disregard of grimsley,supra,d,where seven years earlier the court had said that such notification is required.given what in fact happened here,paraphrase of the observation in grimsley is apt it is a near certainty that had petitioners attorneys timely pointed out to an appropriate county office or agency,the respects in which the law had not been followed,appropriate corrective action would have been promptly forthcoming.id.at.also apt is grimsley holding,that attorney fees under code of civil procedure section,will not be awarded unless the plaintiff seeking such fees had reasonably endeavored to enforce the important right affecting the public interest,without litigation and its attendant expense.ibid.
that was the law when petitioners began their quest,at least in section settings,and a maxim of equity jurisprudence is that described in johnson a trial court equity powers are formidable citation,but must be exercised pursuant to the principle that equity follows the law.citations.a court of equity can not grant relief which the law denies the law has not yet yielded its primacy to equity.johnson,supra,d at.
next,there is the subject of settlement which,as noted above,the city twice attempted,which attempts petitioners resisted,according to them with marked success,thwarting both attempts.referring to the city attempted settlement,petitioners describe it as a particularly sordid act in this drama.and,petitioners assert,were it not for them,the city would have given back million to the plan.
whether this would have been the outcome is not apparent from the record,and certainly there is no finding of any kind in this regard.but there has long been a strong public policy favoring settlements mcclure mcclure cal,ratcliff architects vanir construction management,th,d lambden,and the city,acting through the city attorney,had apparently concluded that settlement was warranted in light of significant expenses associated with continued litigation,the risk that a court might determine that no change of ownership had occurred,and the potential difficulties in proving fraud to support the penalty.so,we ask,what equities favor petitioners,who thwarted such settlement.but that is only the half of it.
if the city attempt at settlement was sordid,what would be the word to describe petitioners settlement offers petitioners attorneys,whose standing to settle is by no means clear,themselves first proposed a settlement shortly after the announcement of the reassessment of the property,specifically in a march,letter to the attorney for the plan,the attorney for equitable,and deputy city attorney kolm.there,petitioners proposed the following settlement equitable and the plan would not contest the recently assessed back taxes or the interest the city would refrain from imposing a percent fraud penalty and would have no attorneys fees obligation and in lieu of paying a percent fraud penalty,equitable and the plan would pay attorneys fees to petitioners equal to percent of the back property taxes and interest thereon.in short,petitioners settlement would result in the city receiving less and petitioners receiving attorneys fees of some million.this,within six months of the filing of their of which had been stayed 
petitioners made a similar offer on april,shortly before the commencement of the aab proceedings.under this proposal,the city would roll back the values that had been placed on one market plaza from the levels to the april levels,resulting in the value being reduced from the stipulated value of million to million for the tax year,with similar reductions in other years.the apparent result of this would be that the city would have received much less than it would have received under its proposed settlement with the plan,the settlement petitioners would later go on to oppose.but this was apparently acceptable to petitioners,so long as the plan paid fees to petitioners equal to and percent of the taxes retained by the city.if all this is evidence of equitable conduct,it comes in a novel guise.
despite that the motion was limited to the issue of entitlement to attorneys fees,petitioners devote almost a quarter of their opening brief to a request that we in fact award them a fee here.their specific request is for some million,computed as percent of the million common fund.alternatively,in a footnote,petitioners request.while we do not reach this issue in light of our rejection of petitioners claim,and would not reach it in light of the order below reserving the issue,we point it out to demonstrate the final inequity of petitioners position.
the amount of attorneys fees to be awarded under any theory is to be reasonable.and it is to be for legal work,generally not for administrative work.see,californians for responsible toxics management kizer d.section case fees allowed for successful lawsuit fees not allowed for time spent in collateral proceedings before the water quality control board ciani san diego trust savings bank th,d participation in coastal commission held to be activity not entitling an award of attorneys fees but see wallace consumers cooperative of berkeley,d.fees allowed for administrative hearings intertwined inextricably with the legal action.the sum total of the legal work on behalf of petitioners in this proceeding was to file three petitions oppose the motions to dismiss and one demurrer file several miscellaneous motions,including to amend,to stay,and to consolidate and prepare some status conference statements.and,of course,the voluminous paperwork in connection with the fee motion.petitioners may perhaps have participated as amici curiae in the federal case.see fn.ante.that is it,and for it petitioners seek million from the public coffers of the city.that is hardly reasonable.nor equitable.but it is a special circumstance permitting a court to deny an award altogether.serrano unruh cal d,and numerous cases there collected.
we close with the observation of one court of appeal,discussing possible applicability of the catalyst theory there must still be a sound basis that the party was more than an initial impetus behind the creation of the benefit.allowing private counsel to receive fees based on the benefits created by public agencies would undermine the equitable principles which underlie the concept of the common fund in re prudential ins.america sales litigation cir.
iv.conclusion 
public interest litigation does much good for the public,to be sure.and certainly there are times it is necessary,as when an agency is unwilling or incapable,as excellently described in nestande watson th,d,a section case the private attorney general theory is based in part on the supposition that even in cases in which public enforcement is possible,public agencies are often unwilling or incapable because of insufficient staffing to protect important rights.mcdermott rothschild,foreword the private attorney general rule and public interest litigation in california,accord,hewlett squaw valley ski th,d due to the burdens imposed on public agencies,adequate government enforcement of the laws is not always possible,making private action imperative.
at the same time,it has been noted in various ways,in varying language,that not all cases couched as pro bono publico are so motivated.for example,graham itself observed that awarding fees without requiring efforts at settlement would not advance the basic objective of the private attorney general doctrine and would encourage lawsuits that are more opportunistic than authentically for the public good.graham,supra,cal th at,d.and while judge kramer specifically refrained from making any determination about the normative nature as to who should have done what,as do we,it may be that petitioners more accurately,petitioners c
