peter adkison appeals the tax court dismissal of his claim for relief under for lack of jurisdiction.section c allows a former spouse who once filed a joint return and now,no longer married,meets certain requirements to claim relief from joint and several liability for a tax deficiency.the tax court held that it lacked jurisdiction because adkison deficiency stemmed from a partnership interest that is the subject of an ongoing partnership proceeding under the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act tefra and regulated by a separate set of provisions.we agree with the tax court that no remedy is available to adkison until the tefra partnership proceedings have finished,although we arrive at that conclusion through a different path.
in,adkison and his,cathleen adkison,filed a joint tax return claiming deductions and losses through their investment in a partnership called shavano strategic investment fund,llc shavano,which had entered into a transaction with a tax shelter referred to as bond linked issue premium structure or blips.in,the internal revenue service began a disclosure initiative,soliciting taxpayers to disclose their participation in certain tax shelter transactions,including blips.by this time,the adkisons had divorced,but they disclosed their participation in the blips shelter,and the irs began an audit of their joint tax return.although negotiations failed between peter adkison and the irs in october,adkison remitted million to be posted as a cash bond against his tax liability.
in december,the internal revenue service commissioner sent shavano a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment fpaa for the year,as required by.five months later,in may,presidio resources,llc,a partner in shavano,filed a timely petition for readjustment of partnership items under tefra,see,in the united states district court for the northern district of california,an action that remains pending.
shortly after the petition for readjustment was filed in the partnership proceeding,adkison submitted form,an official request for innocent spouse relief,seeking individual relief from joint and several liability on the tax deficiency due to his partnership participation in the tax shelter.the commissioner did not respond to adkison request.instead,on november,the commissioner sent adkison and his a notice of deficiency,stating that they owed million for the tax year.the notice advised the adkisons that if they wished to contest this determination in court before making any payment,they had days to file a petition with the united states tax court.
in february,adkison filed a petition with the tax court,invoking the court jurisdiction under e.he requested two things a redetermination of his tax deficiency,as contained in the commissioner notice of deficiency under,and review of the commissioner failure to respond to adkison request for separation of liabilities under c.ten months later,the commissioner moved to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction,arguing that the notice of deficiency was invalid because of the shavano partnership proceeding in the northern district of california.see a.the commissioner advised the tax court that it was aware of the potential confusion and conflict between the shavano partnership proceeding pending in district court and its decision to issue a notice of deficiency to adkison.the commissioner characterized its approach both as deliberate and pruden tial while it was sorting out how the deals were done.
the tax court granted the commissioner motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,reasoning that because a separate partnership proceeding involving the transaction from which the deficiency arose was already pending,the commissioner did not assert a deficiency against adkison within the meaning of e a.adkison brought this appeal.
we begin with the principle that the tax court,as an article i court,is a court of limited jurisdiction and may only exercise jurisdiction to the extent authorized by congress.estate of branson comm r,cir.because the deficiency at issue is an affected partnership item,we must examine the interrelationship between the court jurisdiction to hear a claim for relief from joint and several liability under and the court jurisdiction under tax code provisions applying to affected partnership items.conclusions of law,including the tax court interpretation of the internal revenue code,are reviewed de novo.suzy zoo comm r,cir.whether the tax court has subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law and thus reviewed de novo.crawford comm r,cir.
when a married couple files a joint tax return,both filers are held jointly and severally liable for any deficiency stemming from their joint return.d.in,congress provided an avenue of relief from joint and several liability if a petitioning spouse shows he or she was unaware of a mistake made in the return,if the spouses divorced and the petitioning spouse shows no actual knowledge of deficiency,or if equitable relief is appropriate.b,c,f.in this case,adkison,as a divorced spouse,claims he is entitled to relief under c because he did not have actual knowledge of an understatement in his joint tax return.
section e grants jurisdiction to the tax court to hear such claims 
in the case of an individual against whom a deficiency has been asserted,and who elects to have subsection b or c apply 
a in general.in addition to any other remedy provided by law,the individual may petition the tax court and the tax court shall have jurisdiction to determine the appropriate relief available to the individual under this section if such petition is filed i at any time after the earlier of i the date the secretary mails,by certified or registered mail to the last known address,notice of the secretary final determination of relief available to the individual,or ii the date which is months after the date such election is filed or request is made with the secretary and ii not later than the close of the day after the date described in clause i i.
e emphasis added.
adkison has met the statutory requirements for jurisdiction in the tax court,and if only were at play here,he could proceed with his petition for relief.the commissioner sent adkison a notice asserting a million deficiency,adkison filed his petition and elected subsection c to apply,and it had been six months since he officially requested relief.he meets the requirements to establish jurisdiction in the tax court under e.having filed a notice of deficiency stating that adkison owed million in back taxes,the commissioner can not claim that the notice was not an assertion of a deficiency within the meaning of e.
what makes this case complicated is that there is a tefra overlay to the spousal relief provision in.tefra has specific rules for the treatment of partnership items that may supersede the general rules for obtaining relief from joint and several liability under.a,stat,codified as amended at.in tefra,congress provided a unified regulatory scheme for controlling the audit and litigation of partnership interests.tefra requires that the tax treatment of any partnership item shall be determined at the partnership level,thereby ensuring the consistent treatment of partnership taxes and avoiding repetitive audits and litigation.see also wall united states,cir.tefra applies to all partnership items,which congress has broadly defined as items that are more appropriately determined at the partnership level than at the partner level,a,and any item that is affected by a partnership item.id.a.
in general,a partnership proceeding must be completed and a valid notice of deficiency sent before the tax court may examine the individual tax treatment of an affected item.b ecause the tax treatment of affected items depends on partnership level determinations,affected items can not be tried as part of a partner personal tax case until the completion of the partnership level proceeding.energy partners comm r,wl superseded on other grounds by taxpayer relief act of,a,stat.see also gaf comm r,wl crowell comm r,wl.this general approach to affected partnership items has an express special rule for spouses who seek relief from joint
