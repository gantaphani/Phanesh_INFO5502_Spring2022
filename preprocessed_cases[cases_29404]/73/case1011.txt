the main question before us is whether the internal revenue service irs exceeded its statutory authority when it promulgated revenue procedure we hold that the irs acted within its authority.because plaintiff tualatin valley builders supply,failed to meet the revenue procedure deadline for claiming the benefit of a temporary net operating loss carryback,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the united states.
factual and procedural background 
the material facts are not in dispute.plaintiff is a dissolved oregon corporation that has completed a chapter bankruptcy proceeding.plaintiff tax year ended on march.on its income tax return,timely filed in december,plaintiff claimed a net operating loss of about million 
on the same date that it filed its income tax return,plaintiff filed for a quick refund for tax year plaintiff quick refund application used a net operating loss carryback from.when plaintiff filed that application,its net operating loss could be carried back only two years.b a the irs allowed plaintiff tentative adjustment for.
on march,a few months after plaintiff filed its income tax return and application for a quick refund,congress amended of the internal revenue code to provide a net operating loss carryback period for tax years ending in and.job creation and worker assistance act of jcwa act,a,stat,codified at b h congress also provided that a taxpayer could elect not to take advantage of the new carryback provision.such an election would be allowed in such manner as may be prescribed by the secretary of the treasury and shall be made by the due date including extensions of time for filing the taxpayer return for the taxable year of the net operating loss.id.b,codified at j.once made,the election would be irrevocable.id.
because the jcwa act amended the internal revenue code in march but applied to tax years ending in and,some had established their tax positions for or.in,therefore,the irs released revenue procedure,which outlined procedures for implementing the carryback period for those taxpayers.generally,taxpayers wishing to change their tax positions were required to do so on or before october.id.
on january,more than two months after the deadline established by the revenue procedure,plaintiff filed an amended corporate income tax return in which it carried back its net operating loss.on that amended return,plaintiff claimed a refund of income taxes,with interest,after applying a carryback of its net operating loss.the irs disallowed plaintiff refund claim because plaintiff already had elected to carryback the net operating loss to tax year,and plaintiff had failed to file a change of position by october,as required by revenue procedure.through its liquidation plan agent,plaintiff then brought this action,pursuant to a,seeking a refund for.
on for summary judgment,the district court denied plaintiff claim for a refund.the court held that the irs validly set the october,deadline in revenue procedure,explaining 
the court construes this language in j such election shall be made in such manner as may be prescribed by the secretary emphasis provided as plainly bestowing upon the irs the explicit authority to determine how and when such elections can be made.the irs did so by publishing revenue procedure.the instructions prescribed by the secretary establish the deadline of october,for electing to invoke the carryback.plaintiff failed to meet this deadline.
plaintiff timely appealed.
standard of review 
we review de novo both a district court grant of summary judgment and a district court interpretation of the internal revenue code.abelein united states,cir.
discussion 
on appeal,plaintiff makes two arguments.first,it argues that revenue procedure was an impermissible exercise of the agency authority and an incorrect interpretation of jcwa act.second,plaintiff contends that,even if revenue procedure is valid,plaintiff timely filed a refund claim under d a of the internal revenue code as part of this second argument,plaintiff contends that d b i,which mandates that a refund generally should be allowed even if otherwise prevented by operation or rule of law,trumps revenue procedure and its deadline of october.
in response,the government argues that revenue procedure is entitled to deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d.the revenue procedure,it contends,was promulgated pursuant to an express delegation of authority and,in any event,congress later authorized and endorsed the revenue procedure,including its deadline,when it amended the carryback rule as part of the working families tax relief act of,b,stat.the government also argues that d b i serves the specific purpose of permitting a net operating loss carryback to a year closed by litigation,which is not the situation here.
revenue procedure 
statutory interpretation begins with the text of the enactment.duncan walker,d.if congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.if congress has not spoken directly to the precise question at issue,we must decide how much weight to accord an agency interpretation.
the text of jcwa act creates a net operating loss carryback period for losses arising in tax year or and gives taxpayers an opportunity to elect out of that period.the statute is silent,though,on how to treat taxpayers who already had elected a net operating loss carryback.both j and a related congressional letter gave authority to the irs to promulgate implementing rules.see j providing that a taxpayer election shall be made in such manner as prescribed by the secretary congressional letter stating that it is the intent of congress that such revocation be made in such manner as prescribed by the secretary and w e trust that this letter provides sufficient clarification so that guidance can be issued in a manner that fully reflects congressional intent.
generally,when congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill,there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation,and s uch legislative regulations are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.chevron,at.the government contends that revenue procedure satisfies the requirements for,and is entitled to,chevron deference.if the government is correct,then a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.id.at.
but not all agency determinations are accorded chevron deference.a gencies charged with applying a statute necessarily make all sorts of interpretive choices,and not all of those choices bind judges to follow them.united states mead,d.even where not binding,those agency choices certainly may influence courts facing questions the agencies have already answered.id.in such an instance,t he fair measure of deference to an agency administering its own statute has been understood to vary with circumstances.id.at.generally referred to as skidmore deference,the weight given to the agency interpretation depends on the degree of the agency care,its consistency,formality,and relative expertness,and to the persuasiveness of the agency position.id.footnotes omitted citing skidmore swift.
our case law leaves unresolved the question whether a revenue procedure should receive chevron or skidmore deference.compare schuetz banc one mortgage,cir granting chevron deference to an informal policy statement from the department of housing and urban development,with omohundro united states,cir per curiam applying skidmore deference to an irs revenue ruling we need not resolve the tension between schuetz and omohundro here.even assuming that chevron deference is not appropriate,under the less stringent skidmore analysis,we hold that revenue procedure still should receive significant deference and that the revenue procedure is valid.
skidmore deference requires us to consider a variety of factors,such as the thoroughness and validity of the agency reasoning,the consistency of the agency interpretation,the formality of the agency action,and all those factors that give it the power to persuade,if lacking the power to control.mead,at.some skidmore factors are difficult to assess with respect to revenue procedure there is no prior or later interpretive history to jcwa act or revenue procedure,and no analysis or reasoning accompanied the revenue procedure procedural prescriptions.the balance of the skidmore factors,however,reveal that revenue procedure is a persuasive interpretation of the law.the authority on the interpretation and application of the internal revenue revenue procedure under an express grant of congressional authority.the irs did so only after requesting further guidance from congress concerning its intent.in addition,the amendments that congress enacted after publication of revenue procedure were consistent with the procedures and deadlines established by the irs.see working families tax relief act b enacting technical amendments to the jcwa act.that sequence suggests that congress implicitly ratified the revenue procedure as consistent with its intentions in passing the jcwa act.see,bob jones united states,d analyzing congressional action to determine whether it implicitly ratified an irs revenue ruling.
plaintiff contends that neither j nor the congressional letter directs the irs to issue rules specifically related to a taxpayer in plaintiff is,a taxpayer that filed an application for tentative adjustment under the net operating loss carryback rule and now seeks to apply the net operating loss carryback rule.although that may be so,congress has given the irs broad authority to issue rules implementing the tax laws.a t he secretary shall prescribe all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement of this title,including as may be necessary by reason of any alteration of law in relation to internal revenue.that broad authority supplements the specific grant of authority that congress gave the irs in jcwa act b.
silence or ambiguity on a precise issue within the general ambit of a statute does not mean that courts accord no deference to an agency interpretation of that statute.on the contrary,congress silence in this situation created an ambiguity for the irs to resolve.in seeking to find a balance between the finality of income tax elections and a retroactive statute,the revenue procedure provides taxpayers a period of time,albeit a limited one,to make a new election to modify a prior one.requiring taxpayers to decide by october,whether they would apply the net operating loss carryback period was consistent with the text of the jcwa act and was implicitly ratified by congress when it amended the act in.
plaintiff next argues that d b i trumps revenue procedure reduction of the period within which a taxpayer can file an amended return carrying back a net operating loss.section d b i provides 
if the allowance of a credit or refund of an overpayment of tax attributable to a net operating loss carryback is otherwise prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law other than section relating to compromises,such credit or refund may be allowed or made,if claim therefor is filed within the period provided in subparagraph a of this paragraph providing a period for the filing of an amended return.
the government contends that d b i serves a far narrower purpose,namely,ensuring that a net operating loss carryback is available even if the carryback year was litigated and closed.in support,the government cites the legislative history of the precursor to d b i from the income tax code of and mar monte united states,cir,in which we recognized that d b i reflected a congressional concern that a taxpayer otherwise might be foreclosed from carrying back a net operating loss to a tax year previously litigated.
we need not decide whether d b i takes precedence over revenue procedure because the two may be harmonized.simply put,revenue procedure did not shorten the period for filing an amended return.under,plaintiff still could file an amended return any time within three years from the date its return was due,carrying back its net operating loss for two years plaintiff simply could not carryback its net operating loss for five years without having also complied with the notice requirements of revenue procedure.had plaintiff given the irs timely notice of an election to change its previously established tax position,it would have had three years to file a claim for by means of an amended return.
conclusion 
it is well established that w hether and to what extent deductions shall be allowed depends upon legislative grace.new colonial ice helvering.congress provided eligible taxpayers with a windfall when it enacted jcwa act,extending from two years to five years the period in which and net operating losses could be carried back and deducted.congress did not act fast enough to preempt taxpayers such as plaintiff from establishing contrary tax positions,so it authorized the irs,both generally and specifically,to promulgate rules implementing the new carryback period.the irs did so in revenue procedure,which established an october,deadline for taxpayers in plaintiff position.that deadline is consistent with the text of the statute and the authority congress has conferred on the irs.moreover,congress implicitly ratified revenue procedure when it amended jcwa act while leaving untouched the revenue procedure and its prescriptions.because revenue procedure does not prohibit a taxpayer from filing a claim for refund in the absence of compliance,the revenue procedure neither shortens the period for filing a claim for refund or credit under d a nor conflicts with d b i.
in sum,giving appropriate deference to revenue procedure,we hold that plaintiff was required to file either an application for tentative refund or an amended tax return on or before october,in order to carryback its net operating loss to its tax year.it did not do so.accordingly,we agree with the district court that plaintiff refund claim for was untimely.
i join the court in its conclusion that revenue procedure is a valid exercise of the internal revenue service authority.yet as the majority notes,there is tension in our case law as to whether the level of deference prescribed in chevron,nat.res.def.council,d,or skidmore swift,should apply to the agency action in this case.thus,while i agree with the majority that revenue procedure withstands scrutiny under either standard,i write separately because i believe this tension,left unresolved,could lead our court down a path that is inconsistent with supreme court authority and with common sense.as i explain,i believe that in this case,chevron deference must apply.
prior to,the internal revenue code allowed taxpayers to carry back the net operating loss accrued in a particular tax year by a maximum of two years.b a.in,congress enacted the job creation and worker assistance act of jcwa act,a,stat,codified at b h,which temporarily extended the carryback period from two years to five years.id.the new carryback applied only to tax years ending in or.in addition,the jcwa act provided that taxpayers could opt out of the carryback,stating that the taxpayer election shall be made in such manner as may be prescribed by the secretary.j.the internal revenue service irs responded to this specific delegation of authority by promulgating revenue procedure.among other things,the revenue procedure required taxpayers wishing to opt out of the carryback to make their election on or before october.in this appeal,we must decide whether the irs exceeded its authority when it imposed this deadline.
as an initial matter,the jcwa act states unequivocally that the secretary shall prescribe the manner of elections.j.thus,because congress has directly spoken to the precise issue,chevron,at,i would look no further than the statute text in ascertaining the scope of the rulemaking authority congress intended to delegate to the irs.accordingly,i do not believe the congressional letter discussed by the majority is relevant to our analysis.see op.at citing congressional letter from
