petitioner churchill downs,incorporated and its subsidiaries together churchill downs appeal the united states tax court judgment that they were entitled to deduct only of certain expenses they incurred in and because the expenses qualified as entertainment for purposes of internal revenue code n b.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
the facts of this case are not in dispute.churchill downs owns and operates the churchill downs race track in louisville,kentucky,and three other race tracks.churchill downs conducts horse races at these tracks,and earns revenues from wagering,admissions and seating charges,concession commissions,sponsorship revenues,licensing rights,and broadcast fees.although churchill downs does not compete directly with other race tracks due to differences in the timing of race events,it competes for patrons with other sports,entertainment,and gaming operations.
churchill downs biggest race is the kentucky derby,held each year on the first saturday in may.churchill downs hosts the following events in connection with the race a sport of kings gala,a brunch following the post position drawing for the race,a hospitality tent offering coffee,juice,and donuts to the press,and the kentucky derby winner party.the sport of kings gala includes a press party,dinner,and entertainment.the kentucky derby items and amounts at issue in this case are 
in,churchill downs also agreed to host another race,the breeders cup,at the churchill downs racetrack.its contract with breeders cup limited bcl obligated it to host certain promotional events designed to enhance the significance of the the breeders cup races as a national and international horse racing event.these events included a press reception cocktail party and dinner,a brunch,and a press breakfast.the breeders cup items and amounts at issue in this case are 
finally,churchill downs hosted a number of miscellaneous dinners,receptions,cocktail parties and other events indirectly associated with one or both of these races,at an expense of in and in.

this court reviews the tax court factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.see friedman comm r,cir.in particular,this court reviews the tax court interpretation of internal revenue code provisions and related treasury regulations de novo.see wolpaw comm r,cir.
a allows a taxpayer to deduct all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business.a.a disallows certain deductions otherwise permitted by,and provides that 
no deduction otherwise allowable under this chapter shall be allowed for any item w ith respect to an activity which is of a type generally considered to constitute entertainment,amusement,or recreation,unless the taxpayer establishes that the item was directly related to,or,in the case of an item directly preceding or following a substantial and bona fide business discussion including business meetings at a convention or otherwise,that such item was associated with,the active conduct of the taxpayer trade or business.
a.n further limits deductions for entertainment expenses,providing that 
the amount allowable as a deduction under this chapter for 
a any expense for food or beverages,and 
b any item with respect to an activity which is of a type generally considered to constitute entertainment,amusement,or recreation,or with respect to a facility used in connection with such activity,
shall not exceed percent of the amount of such expense or item which would but for this paragraph be allowable as a deduction under this chapter.
n.the commissioner does not dispute that all of the expenses at issue qualify as ordinary and necessary business expenses directly related to the active conduct of churchill downs business,and thus that some deduction of these expenses is allowed.however,he argues that n applies to limit deduction of these expenses because they qualify as items associated with activity generally considered entertainment.
o gives the commissioner the power to promulgate such regulations as he may deem necessary to enforce.o.here the commissioner has promulgated a regulation in connection with n,which provides that 
an objective test shall be used to determine whether an activity is of a type generally considered to constitute entertainment.thus,if an activity is generally considered to be entertainment,it will constitute entertainment for purposes of this section and section a regardless of whether the expenditure can also be described otherwise,and even though the expenditure relates to the taxpayer alone.this objective test precludes arguments such as that entertainment means only entertainment of others or that an expenditure for entertainment should be characterized as an expenditure for advertising or public relations.however,in applying this test the taxpayer trade or business shall be considered.thus,although attending a theatrical performance would generally be considered entertainment,it would not be so considered in the case of a professional theater critic,attending in his professional capacity.similarly,if a manufacturer of dresses conducts a fashion show to introduce his products to a group of store buyers,the show would not be generally considered to constitute entertainment.however,if an appliance distributor conducts a fashion show for the wives of his retailers,the fashion show would be generally considered to constitute entertainment.
b ii emphasis in original.each party relies on this language as support for its position.churchill downs argues that the derby and breeders cup expenses at issue should not be considered entertainment expenses because these pre and events showcased its entertainment product.specifically,it contends that the sport of kings gala and the other events generated publicity and media attention which introduced its races to the public in the same manner that a dress designer fashion show introduces its product to clothing buyers.in response,the commissioner relies on b ii statement that an item generally considered to be entertainment is subject to the limitation even where it may be otherwise characterized as an advertising or public relations expense.the commissioner argues that the brunches,dinners,galas,and parties at issue qualify on their face as items generally considered entertainment and,following b ii,that they are not saved from this classification by the fact that these amounts were spent to publicize churchill downs racing events.
these arguments expose an inherent tension in b ii.on the one hand,b ii states that an item generally considered to be entertainment is subject to the limitation even if it may be described otherwise,in particular as advertising or public relations.at the same time,the regulation suggests that certain expenses generally considered entertainment but somehow instrumental to the conduct of a taxpayer business do not qualify as entertainment for purposes of n.the regulation draws the line between pure publicity and entertainment events integral to the conduct of the taxpayer business by providing the contrasting examples of a fashion show offered by a dress designer to store buyers not entertainment and a fashion show offered by an appliance manufacturer to the spouses of its buyers entertainment.see b ii.in the first example,the event is attended by the taxpayer primary customers,and the taxpayer product is present at the event and is the focus of it.in contrast,the second example reflects a purely social event focused on something unrelated to the taxpayer product,held to generate good will among selected third parties wit
