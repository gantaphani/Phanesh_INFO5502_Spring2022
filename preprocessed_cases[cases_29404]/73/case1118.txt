this case requires us to consider whether the tax court detailed its reasoning with the requisite specificity dictated by leonard pipeline contractors comm r,cir.the estate of emanuel trompeter and trompeter daughters,who are of the estate collectively,the estate,appeal from a tax court decision partially upholding a dollar deficiency determination by the internal revenue service and imposing a percent penalty for fraud.because the tax court did not articulate sufficiently the basis for its ruling on omitted assets and its rationale with respect to the valuation of certain stock,we vacate the tax court decision and remand for further proceedings.
background 
emanuel trompeter,a wealthy entrepreneur who resided in southern california,died on march,at the age of.his only surviving children,robin carol trompeter gonzalez and janet ilene trompeter polachek,are the estate and its only beneficiaries.
trompeter earned much of his wealth during his tenure as proprietor of trompeter electronics,tei,a entity that he and his former wife,sylvia trompeter,founded in.tei specialized in,among other things,manufacturing components of missiles.in,sterling holding sterling,another private firm,acquired a controlling interest in tei in exchange for approximately million in cash and shares of a class of sterling preferred stock.trompeter received of the shares,and sylvia received the remainder.the value of these shares is one of the key areas of disagreement between the estate and the internal revenue service irs.
shortly before his death,trompeter prepared gonzalez for her role as by discussing his extensive cash,stock,and personal holdings,and introducing her to a variety of attorneys,accountants,and other professional advisors who would be able to assist her in,among other things,preparing a federal estate tax return.after gonzalez and her sister took control over the estate,they replaced trompeter longtime counsel and accountant,and assumed an active role in assisting the new professionals in their preparatory efforts.
in june,the reviewed and filed the estate federal tax return with the irs.the gross estate was valued at,and the taxable estate at.shortly thereafter,various sources notified the irs that the estate had underpaid its tax obligations and they supplied evidence to support their allegations.in connection with his investigation,the commissioner seized various unreported assets from a safe deposit box,including gold and silver coins,jewelry and gems.
the commissioner subsequently determined that the estate had knowingly underreported the taxable estate by,including million in omitted assets,an undervaluation of the sterling shares and some of trompeter gold coins,the items seized from the safe deposit box,and an improper deduction taken for a sham claim made by sylvia trompeter against the estate.in addition to various deficiency penalties,the commissioner also assessed a fraud penalty pursuant to section a of the internal revenue code 
the estate then commenced an action in tax court challenging the irs determinations.following a lengthy bench trial,the tax court made findings as to the various omitted assets,valued trompeter rare coins,analyzed the fair market value of the sterling stock and upheld the commissioner determination on this issue,and imposed a fraud penalty.trompeter,cch,wl.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review the tax court factual determinations,including valuation of assets and findings regarding fraudulent behavior,for clear error.see boyd gaming comm r,cir.in drawing its conclusions,however,the tax court is obligated to detail its reasoning.notably,as we held in leonard pipeline contractors comm r,cir 
i t is the obligation of the tax court to spell out its reasoning and to do more than enumerate the factors and leap to a figure intermediate between petitioner and the commissioner a reasoned decision as to what is reasonable in this context must bring together the disparate elements and give some account of how the judge has reached his conclusion.we have held district courts to this standard.not less is expected from the tax court.
id.at citations omitted.indeed,we have not hesitated to remand cases to the tax court when its written findings regarding valuation are somewhat inscrutable.see,estate of mitchell comm r,cir estate of magnin comm r,cir.
with these standards in mind,we turn to those tax court findings that the estate challenges on appeal.
ii.omitted assets 
trompeter was a collector of rare coins.trompeter also had other valuable collections including art,artifacts,firearms,gems,jewelry,and music recordings.there is considerable dispute,and much ambiguity in the record,about the exact nature and valuation of those holdings,but the estate concedes that it failed to report approximately million in assets.among other things,the estate did not report the gun collection valued at,the music collection valued at and some of the gems valued at.
the irs determined that the estate failed to report million in assets,principally art,artifacts,diamonds,jewelry,and the like.this figure was based on the estimate made by the son of one of trompeter acquaintances,joe pasko,who filed a claim against the estate for a million commission,alleging that trompeter had retained him to sell assets worth at least million.
although it rejected the estate argument that trompeter had gifted some of the omitted assets to the,the tax court did not accept the commissioner determination,because,among other things,the record did not disclose all of the unreported assets,nor was pasko conversant with the full extent of trompeter holdings.the court did,however,conclude that there were unreported assets 
following our detailed review of the record,we find that the estate failed to report million of assets inclusive of the approximately million amount conceded by the estate.
trompeter,at emphasis added.
the difficulty with this finding is that it is so conclusory as to make it unreviewable.the tax court did not specify which portions of the trial record it referenced,detail the methodology it used to arrive at its conclusion,list the omitted assets,or even offer a description of the items.
we can understand and review the basis for rejecting the million figure.unfortunately,it is the alternative finding that leaves us hanging.the convenient shorthand reference to a detailed review of the record only tells us,based on the length of the record,that the court spent considerable time scrutinizing it.we do not doubt the court sincerity or diligent review.rather,we simply do not have any factual findings that can be adequately reviewed for clear error.how did the tax court arrive at the million figure what items comprise the million in omitted assets 
in declining to detail the assets with some reasonable specificity,the tax court places us in the untenable position of either abdicating our reviewing role or sifting through a voluminous record to construct a plausible account of the missing assets.although the latter exercise may be theoretically possible,it is not an exercise to be performed by the court of appeals.see,estate of mitchell,at t he commissioner offers us a multitude of avenues through which one might arrive at a percent combined discount.this strained effort,in and of itself,is the most telling evidence of the inadequacy of the tax court explanation.see also akers comm r,cir unlike the original judgment of solomon,the true rationale of which has been readily apparent to generations of disinterested not,at first blush,to both of the maternal judgment appealed from here has no discernible logic.we are not prepared to permit the tax court,whenever it disagrees with the valuations offered by both sides,simply to shut its eyes and pick at random any number that happens to lie somewhere between the commissioner valuation and the taxpayer.
it is,therefore,not sufficient to say that the value of various unspecified collections of art,artifacts,gems,is million.consequently,consistent with our holding in leonard pipeline,we instruct the tax court on remand to provide sufficiently detailed findings regarding the assets including their valuation th
