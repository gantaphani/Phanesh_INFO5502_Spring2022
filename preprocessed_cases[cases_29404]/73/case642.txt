the district court enjoined william benson,a tax protester,from promoting,organizing,or selling his reliance defense package and amendment reliance package,which were based on the false premise that customers could stop paying federal income taxes and avoid or defeat prosecution by relying on the materials in the packages.however,the court denied the government request to require benson to divulge a list of his customers.we affirm the injunction,but reverse as to the customer list,and remand for further appropriate proceedings.
background 
benson wrote a book titled,the law that never was,in which he claims that the sixteenth amendment to the united states constitution was never properly ratified.benson packaged his book with several excerpts from state legislative histories and records from the national archives as well as court cases and other materials to create what he called the reliance defense package.he advertised the package and its component parts for sale on his website,www.thelawthat neverwas.com.the entire package was offered for sale for.benson branded a similar set of materials as the amendment reliance package,which was promoted and offered for sale on the website of the free enterprise society.
the details of benson promotional claims will be more thoroughly discussed below,but they can be boiled down to two theories.benson first and primary theory was that the sixteenth amendment was never properly ratified because several states intentionally attempted to modify the language of the proposed amendment and so did not ratify the actual amendment proposed by congress.without the sixteenth amendment,benson explained,the federal income tax system is unconstitutional according to the supreme court.see pollock farmers loan trust.benson stated that he does not file an income tax return and that his customers may choose to do the same.
benson second theory,which was alluded to on benson website and more thoroughly discussed in the reliance defense package itself,was that an individual could not be successfully prosecuted if he truly believed he was not required to pay income taxes.benson claimed that the supreme court held in cheek united states,d that when a defendant had a belief he was not required to file,he must be permitted to present that belief to the jury.benson also cited united states powell,cir for the principle that the defendants conviction for failing to file tax returns could not be sustained if the defendants sincerely believed they were not required to their foundation for that belief.and benson promised that the reliance defense package would allow customers to develop that sincere belief.
at the government request,the district court granted summary judgement and issued an injunction against benson however the district court denied the part of the requested injunction that would have required benson to turn over his customer list 
ii.discussion 
on appeal,benson claims that he did not violate the statute the district court relied on to grant the injunction.he also argues that the injunction violates his first amendment rights.the government counters that there was ample statutory and constitutional support for the injunction.the government contends that the district court erred by not requiring benson to produce a list of his customers.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo and its decision to grant an injunction for abuse of discretion.united states raymond,cir united states kaun,cir.
statutory authority for the injunction 
a district court is authorized to enter an injunction against any person if it finds that the person has engaged in any conduct subject to penalty under,and that injunctive relief is appropriate to prevent recurrence of such conduct.b.
violation of 
section imposes a penalty on any person who organizes or assists in the organization of any plan or arrangement,or participates directly or indirectly in the sale of any interest in an entity or plan or arrangement,and in connection with such organization or sale,makes or furnishes a statement with respect to the allowability of any deduction or credit,the excludability or any income,or the securing of any other tax benefit by reason of holding an interest in the entity or participating in the plan or arrangement which the person knows or has reason to know is false or fraudulent as to any material matter.a.
benson claims that he was simply urging political action and was not promoting any plan because he did not engage in affirmative conduct such as offering to help prepare trusts,false forms,false income tax returns,letters to harass the irs,claims for tax refunds,as some tax protestors have in the past.benson is wrong,both legally and factually.
first,the definition of a plan for purposes of is broad.raymond,at any plan or arrangement having some connection to taxes citing kaun,at.courts have not been hesitant in finding tax protesters activities to qualify as plans.kaun,at words any other plan or arrangement are clearly broad enough to include a tax protester group raymond,at sale of program that told customers they could legally refuse to pay federal income tax was sale of an interest in a plan under united states schulz,d,instruction guide on stopping employer withholdings was plan or arrangement,aff,cir.benson plan was simpler than some prior tax protester schemes,but its purpose was the evade tax liability.instead of filing false tax returns,benson plan encouraged customers not to file a tax return at all.such a do kit does not require forms or filings.here,the devil is not in the details.like every other tax protester,benson was selling an illegal method by which to avoid paying taxes the details of that method are immaterial.
second,benson materials were prepared in such a way so that the entirety of either package could be sent to the irs if they began an investigation.the reliance defense package included a customized reliance letter,which concluded 
it is insanely unrealistic for someone like customer name to believe that he would be required to file any forms with any state taxing agency or the federal government,when the amendment to the constitution is an absolute complete total fraud as proven by the law that never was volume i and in excess of documents that customer name relies on as his state of mind,frame of mind reliance,and belief.the entire reliance program shall become a part of his permanent record.
therefore,benson was providing his customers with something to send to the irs in an effort to avoid paying taxes.at least one taxpayer submitted the reliance letter and several other elements of the reliance defense package along with the entire amendment reliance package to the irs when questioned about failing to file an income tax return.the only distinction between benson plan and other plans is that benson materials were to be utilized after the irs launched an investigation.so benson did organize a plan or arrangement and participated in the sale of an interest in the plan or arrangement.a.
benson made numerous statements about the tax benefits to be enjoyed by customers as a result of purchasing his materials and participating in his plan or arrangement.a a.in promoting his materials,benson claimed that he discovered that the amendment was not ratified and to have documents proving that the amendment is an absolute,complete,total fraud.benson also claimed on his website that 
after serving time in federal prison for not paying his united states income taxes,bill benson still does not pay income taxes and yet our federal government chooses not to arrest him.why because now he can use this book,which he has written the law that never was in his defense.
benson marketed the reliance defense package on his website as a compendium of information giving you the education and choice toward not filing an income tax return.this compendium will give you the education to say based on my,frame of mind,reliance and belief i am obeying the dictates of constitutional law.benson boasted that t o date,the irs has steadfastly refused to prosecute any person standing on this defense.why do they do this because they know they can not win benson also stated that included in your package will be numerous dvds and many other references proving that you are not a taxpayer 
benson knew or had reason to know that his statements were false or fraudulent.a a.benson claim to have discovered that the sixteenth amendment was not ratified has been rejected by this court in benson own criminal appeal.united states benson,cir in thomas,we specifically examined the arguments made in the law that never was,and concluded that benson did not discover anything.quoting united states thomas,cir.w e have repeatedly rejected the claim that the sixteenth amendment was improperly ratified.one would think this repeated rejection of benson sixteenth amendment argument would put the matter to rest.benson,at citations omitted.
benson knows that his claim that he can rely on his book to prevent federal prosecution is equally false because his attempt to rely on his book in his own criminal case was ineffective.benson,at.benson book has been repeatedly discredited by the courts.miller united states,cir we find it hard to understand why the long and unbroken line of cases upholding the constitutionality of the sixteenth amendment generally,and those specifically rejecting the argument advanced in the law that never was,have not persuaded miller and his compatriots to seek a more effective forum for airing their attack on the federal income tax structure.citations omitted.
benson statement that the government can not successfully prosecute any person choosing not to file a tax return based on his belief that he is obeying the dictates of constitutional law is also false.this argument seems to be derived from cheek united states,d,as discussed above.but cheek only supports a defense that the defendant misunderstood the requirements of the tax code,not that he believed those requirements to be unconstitutional.id.at.claims that some of the provisions of the tax code are unconstitutional are submissions of a different order from a misunderstanding of the law d efendant views about the validity of the tax statutes are irrelevant to the issue of willfulness united states dunkel,cir stating that cheek held that judges may rebuff defenses based on erroneous constitutional beliefs such as that the amendment was not properly ratified.
benson argues that because he made no false statements,materiality is not at issue.we obviously disagree with benson premise and so must decide whether benson false statements pertained to a material matter.a a.there is no matter more material to the sale of a tax avoidance package than whether the package effectively allows customers to avoid taxes.benson program was organized and promoted as a golden ticket whereby purchasers could avoid income tax liability and criminal liability.benson false statements regarding the vulnerability of the sixteenth amendment and the ability of his customers to refuse to pay taxes without being prosecuted were material because they would have a substantial impact on the decision to purchase his tax package.united states gleason,cir citing united states buttorff,cir see also united states white,cir material because taxpayers who have been or are now being audited by the irs or are involved in litigation because they relied upon appellant representations should certainly have been informed about their complete lack of merit.even if some of benson followers purchased the packages for educational purposes or to take political action,as benson claims,it is hard to believe they would have bought the materials knowing they were false.
likelihood of recurrence 
in determining whether an injunction is appropriate to prevent recurrence of the illegal conduct,the court must consider the totality of the circumstances including 
the gravity of harm caused by the offense the extent of the defendant participation and his degree of scienter the isolated or recurrent nature of the infraction and the likelihood that the defendant customary business activities might again involve him in such a transaction the defendant recognition of his own culpability and the sincerity of his assurances against future violations.
raymond,at quoting kaun,at internal quotations omitted.lengthy discussion of this matter is not warranted.reliance on benson false promises has deprived the government of revenue and has harmed benson customers who were deceived by the siren call of the tax protester movement.united states engh,cir.benson was at the heart of this scheme,which he knew or should have known had been thoroughly rejected by the courts.his violation of was not isolated,but continuous since his false assurances about the efficacy of his products were posted on his website.benson does not acknowledge his culpability,and,despite any assurances to the district court,he is not likely to stop without an injunction.the district court adequately examined the necessary factors and did not abuse its discretion in concluding that an injunction was necessary.see kaun,at.
first amendment 
of course,even though the injunction was properly granted under,it still must meet the standards of the first amendment.benson claims that the injunction is a violation of his constitutional right to engage in political expression and that the government is trying to squelch his view that the sixteenth amendment was never ratified.the government contends that the injunction enjoins false commercial speech,which receives no first amendment protection.
the first amendment provides broad protection to speech,but not all speech.commercial speech receives lesser protection and false or misleading commercial speech receives no protection at all.central hudson gas public service comm of new york,d.for commercial speech to come within the protection of the first amendment,it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.id.at.when deciding if speech is commercial,appropriate considerations include whether the speech is an advertisement the speech refers to a specific product and the speaker has an economic motivation for the speech.bolger youngs drug products,d.
there is some debate about what the injunction in this case actually prohibits.benson repeatedly asserts that it prevents him from distributing court opinions,legislative journals,and other public records,and from speaking about or expressing an opinion about those documents.we interpret the injunction as the government did at oral argument that it prohibits false statements made in connection with the sale of a product.the government clarified that the injunction does not prevent benson from promoting his opinion in the public square.neither is benson prohibited from selling his book,the law that never was,according to the government brief therefore,benson is not prohibited from distributing his opinion that the sixteenth amendment was not ratified or public documents that he believes support his of which are contained in his book.
what benson is prohibited from is engaging in unprotected false commercial speech.this interpretation is evidenced in the language of the injunction the government originally requested,prohibiting benson 
from directly or indirectly,by means of false,deceptive,or misleading commercial speech 
organizing,promoting,marketing,or selling the tax shelter,plan,or arrangement known as the reliance defense package,or any other abusive tax shelter,plan or arrangement that incites taxpayers to attempt to violate the internal revenue laws 
engaging in any conduct subject to penalty under irc,making or furnishing,in connection with the organization or sale of an abusive tax shelter,plan,or arrangement,a statement he know s or has reason to know is false or fraudulent as to any material matter and 
engaging in any conduct that interferes with the administration and enforcement of the internal revenue laws 
emphasis added.we read the injunction issued in this spirit.therefore,the injunction prohibits only false,deceptive or misleading commercial speech that is related to the provision of tax advice.raymond,at citing kaun,at.
