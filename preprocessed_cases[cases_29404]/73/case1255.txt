the united states appeals the invalidation of its assessment of a tax liability against james white following confirmation of white chapter bankruptcy plan.we reverse and direct entry of summary judgment for the government.
background 
white was president and sole shareholder of wcc.on may,white filed a petition for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code.the bankruptcy court confirmed his reorganization plan on may.the plan provided that the title and ownership of the estate assets would revest in white as of the effective date,defined as the date sixty days following the date after which the order of confirmation is no longer subject to appeal and on which date no such appeal is pending,or july.the final decree was entered in white chapter proceeding on december.
on july,the irs assessed a liability in the total amount of pursuant to against white for willfully failing to pay the irs the income and social security taxes required to be withheld from his employees paychecks.the irs later sued white for collection in the northern district of georgia.
on may,the district court entered judgment for white and the government timely filed this appeal.
statutory framework 
before discussing the merits of the parties arguments,it will be useful to outline statutory provisions which were in effect and governed the events in this case a debtor who has filed for chapter bankruptcy enjoys an automatic stay against actions to enforce,collect,assess or recover claims against the debtor or against property of the estate.a.it is the law of this circuit that a ctions taken in violation of the automatic stay are void and without effect.acceptance hall,cir.section c provides that the stay of an act against the property of the estate continues until such property is no longer property of the estate.section c provides that the stay of any other act continues until the earliest of a the time the case is closed,b the time the case is dismissed,or c the time a discharge is granted.
this case involves the application of c c providing that the automatic stay is lifted at the time a discharge is granted the discharge of the debtor here was effected by confirmation of the plan pursuant to d a.section d a provides that except as otherwise provided in the plan,the confirmation of the plan discharges the debtor 
ii.discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.morris communications pga tour,cir.the district court held that the irs assessment of white tax liability was void because it was made while white enjoyed an automatic stay against collection of the tax white makes basically three arguments in support of the district court ruling a that the district court correctly held that the confirmation of white reorganization plan,although it discharged the debtor,had no effect on the automatic stay with respect to the tax because the tax was a debt b that the automatic stay remained in effect and the assessment was thus void because the effective date of the plan was delayed until after the assessment and c that the district court correctly held alternatively that the assessment was an act against the property of the estate and thus the automatic stay continued until the property revested in the debtor which occurred upon the effective date of the plan,after the assessment,all of which meant that the automatic stay continued until after the assessment and thus the assessment was void.we address and reject each argument in turn,and reverse the district court 
a.the district court erred in holding that the automatic stay against collection of debts is not terminated after a grant of discharge.
as noted above,the relevant statutory provisions provide that confirmation of the plan discharges the debtor and that discharge of the debtor lifts the automatic stay white argues,and the district court so held,that the confirmation of the plan in this case,and the consequent discharge of the debtor,had no effect at all with respect to the instant tax because the instant tax is a debt.in other words,white argues that,although the debtor was discharged with respect to dischargeable debts,the discharge had no effect at all with respect to the instant taxes.this position finds no support in the case law,and,indeed,is contrary to the law of this circuit.it is generally recognized that once confirmation has been entered,and a discharge granted,holders of debts can seek repayment from the debtor for the original amount.see in re gurwitch,cir allowing the irs to seek collection of tax liabilities after confirmation of bankruptcy plan and before closure of the case see also in re depaolo,cir the party to whom a nondischargeable debt is owed is entitled after confirmation to enforce his or her rights as they would exist outside of bankruptcy.internal citations omitted.
in addition,the rule suggested by the district court contradicts a plain reading of the relevant statutes.section of the bankruptcy code states that the confirmation of a plan discharges the debtor from any dischargeable debt and it does not make the discharge contingent upon the types of debts the debtor owes.a debtor can not receive different discharges for different types of debt but can be granted only a single discharge applicable to all debts.in re cardillo.confirmation of a bankruptcy plan grants the debtor a discharge that replaces the automatic stay with a permanent injunction pursuant to of the bankruptcy code but that injunction prohibits collection only with respect to dischargeable debts and does not apply to nondischargeable debts.thus,once a plan has been confirmed,holders of nondischargeable debts can generally pursue collection unless the plan has provided otherwise or unless the court otherwise orders.
b.the plan did not provide for the effective date to be the date of discharge.
the validity of the irs assessment depends upon whether a discharge was granted on the date of the plan confirmation,may,which was prior to the date of assessment,july.the plan did not contain any provisions explicitly stating that the discharge would take place after confirmation,but the plan did say that it would take effect sixty days after the order of confirmation could no longer be appealed,july.thus,we must determine whether a discharge was granted upon confirmation of the plan or upon the plan effective date.we conclude that a plan identification of a effective date is not sufficient to delay the grant of discharge.
we begin by noting that the statutory language does not explicitly refer to an effective date it does,however,allow that confirmation of a plan need not grant the debtor a discharge if the plan provides otherwise.thus,white can prevail only if the plan stipulation of a effective date satisfies the otherwise provided condition.we hold that it does not.
first,we note that while the bankruptcy code makes numerous references to the effective date of the reorganization plan,it does not in the instant provision.if the plan could delay the grant of discharge merely by having a effective date,then congress statement that the confirmation of a plan discharges the debtor from any debt would be in error.the reason is that,under this interpretation of d,confirmation of a plan would discharge debts only when the plan takes effect upon confirmation.that is to say,the triggering event for discharge would not actually be the plan confirmation but the plan taking effect.because of the bankruptcy code numerous references to the reorganization plan effective date elsewhere,we should assume that had congress intended to condition discharges on a plan taking effect,it would have done so explicitly.see,nunnally equifax information services,cir where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.quoting russello united states,d.thus,it would seem contrary to congress intent to hold that confirmation of the plan did not grant white a discharge 
second,our interpretation of is consistent with the policy aims behind the bankr
