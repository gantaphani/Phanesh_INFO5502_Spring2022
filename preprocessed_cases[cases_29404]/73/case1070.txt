charles addis and his wife cindi addis appeal a tax court judgment denying them charitable contribution deductions for their payments to the national heritage foundation nhf in and.the central question is whether f disallows the deductions because the receipts substantiating the transfers to the nhf stated the addises received no consideration though they expected the nhf to use their funds to pay part of the premiums on life insurance benefitting their trust pursuant to a arrangement.we hold that section f bars the deductions and affirm the decision of the tax court.
charles addis is a farm labor contractor and his wife cindi addis is a bookkeeper.they are the initial trustees and beneficiaries of the charles addis family trust,which they created on may.on the couple deaths,the trust benefits their family members.
the nhf is a organization under c and is eligible to receive contributions under if tax code requirements are satisfied.
the questions we consider arise from the addises attempts to claim charitable contribution deductions for payments to the nhf in connection with a charitable arrangement.in general,a charitable insurance transaction involves a transfer of funds by a taxpayer to a charity,with the understanding that the charity will use the transferred funds to pay premiums on a cash value life insurance policy that benefits both the charity and the taxpayer family.notice.
the agreement 
on october,charles addis wrote nhf president houk stating the addis trust was going to obtain life insurance on cindi addis and offering the nhf the option of buying an interest in the policy.charles addis wrote the premium for national heritage foundation interest under the option is a year for years.
on october,the nhf and charles addis,in his capacity as trustee,entered an agreement governing the nhf option of buying policy benefits from the addis trust.the same day,commercial union life insurance company issued a policy on cindi addis,then,to charles addis in his capacity as trustee.the initial death benefit was.the planned annual premium was.
under the agreement,the nhf had the option of paying of the planned annual a planned premium period of twelve years.the nhf would then be entitled to of the initial death cindi addis died.the nhf share of the death benefit was fixed even if the death benefit increased in value,as projected.
if the policy was surrendered and the nhf had made all its premium payments,the nhf would be entitled to its termination account value the aggregate of all the premiums it had paid over the years minus the cost of its share of the death benefit measured using a factor set by the agreement called the annual renewable term art rate.
though the agreement contemplated payments by the nhf for twelve years,the nhf could opt to not pay all or any part of its premium portion.depending on the shortfall and amount of prior payments,the nhf benefits might be curtailed.because the nhf used the addises transfers to pay policy premiums in each of the tax years at issue,we discuss only the provisions that govern if the nhf paid its full portion.
under the agreement,the addis trust would pay only of the planned annual premium but be entitled to about of the initial death benefit plus the projected increases in the death benefit over the years.the addises retained the sole right to borrow on the policy or surrender the policy.if the addises surrendered the policy,the addis trust owned the net cash surrender value less the nhf termination account value.
if the policy death benefit fell below the amount sufficient to give the nhf its share of the death benefit,the addis trust would pay the shortfall.similarly,if the policy net surrender value proved insufficient to provide the nhf with the amount to which it was entitled on surrender,the addis trust would pay the shortfall.
insurance marketer lawrence cronin testified the addis case was actually the first case that we ever sold involving the concept.nhf president houk testified that about to of the more than foundations under the nhf aegis were based on similar arrangements.

about a month after the nhf and the addis trust entered the agreement,the addises sent a check dated november,to the nhf.charles addis cover letter stated in part 
i am expecting you will use my donation to pay the premiums on the policy payable to my foundation.although i realize you are under no obligation to do so,i request that you use my donation for that purpose.
in another check,also dated november,the addises paid commercial union life their premium portion of.
charles addis acknowledged in testimony before the tax court that the addises expected the nhf to use their money to pay premiums pursuant to the option agreement.charles addis explained that they said they were going to make the payments.charles addis testified that if the nhf did not make the premium payments,we would,obviously,contact them and say,why not,and if we were satisfied,we quit giving them money.
on november,the nhf credited the addis family foundation with the addises transfer,then debited the addis account the same day to reflect that the was sent to commercial union life insurance company.the nhf receipt substantiating the addises payment stated in accordance with irs regulations,the national heritage foundation did not provide any goods or services to the donor in return for the contribution.
