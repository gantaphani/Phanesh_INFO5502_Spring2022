hoyt partnerships 
was one of over one hundred partnerships that hoyt organized,promoted and operated from through hoyt enticed investors by marketing the partnerships not only as investment opportunities but also as tax shelters.beyond marketing and running the partnerships,hoyt acted as the tax matters partner tmp in each of the partnerships subject to the tax equity fiscal responsibility act of,a.further,from approximately through,hoyt was a licensed enrolled agent qualified to represent taxpayers before the irs.see b.
in hoyt capacities as tmp and as an enrolled agent,and through tax preparation companies that he owned and ran tax office of hoyt sons,and laguna tax service,hoyt directed the preparation of the tax returns of each partnership.he usually signed and filed the tax returns on behalf of the partners such as the hansens.adams,at.
in,the irs began auditing the hoyt partnerships.this led to numerous tax court cases.one of the more prominent cases,and one that hoyt utilized as support for the legitimacy of all his partnerships and their accompanying tax benefits,was bales commissioner,cch.the bales decision ruled against the irs.bales found that hoyt partnerships were not economic shams.therefore,the deductions claimed through partnership expenses were legitimate.id.at.bales specifically found that during the years before,hoyt was operating a legitimate and,at times,thriving cattle business.id.at.
despite the setback of the bales decision,the irs continued its investigations into hoyt partnerships,which led to the freezing of income tax refunds to hoyt partners in february.at this time,the irs also disallowed individual hoyt partners claimed benefits and ceased issuing tax refunds stemming from the hoyt partnerships.by,the hoyt partnerships entered bankruptcy,and,in,the bankruptcy court consolidated all the assets and liabilities of the cattle and sheep partnerships and sold off the little remaining livestock 
b.the hansens investments 
petitioner gary hansen graduated from california polytechnic state university with a degree in architecture and construction engineering.petitioner johnean hansen works as a respiratory therapist.the hansens have no formal business training or experience in farming,ranching,or investment partnerships.their investment experience prior to their investments in hoyt partnerships included purchasing a home,owning rental property,buying government bonds,opening bank accounts,holding term life insurance,selling amway products,and participating in the retirement program sponsored by hansen employer.
the hansens first learned of the hoyt partnerships through a coworker and attended a hoyt information presentation in pasco,washington in late fall.the hansens talked with other partners at this time and received informational materials.one of the materials the hansens received,and subsequently relied upon in making their investment decision,was a document entitled hoyt and sons the lb.tax shelter.this document explained how the hoyt partnerships were designed to provide profits over time and emphasized that the primary return on investment is realized through tax savings based on the information in this document,partners were to profit from their investment in two ways first,hoyt would distribute partnership expenses among the partners,which the partners could use as a deduction to offset other sources of income and second,the livestock would eventually be liquidated,which was expected to return a profit on the initial investment.see adams,at.
the lb.tax shelter document contained a discussion of risks and statements regarding the legality of the tax savings.one such statement exclaimed if you like most,your first impression of our program was,this deal looks too good to be true one section of the document discussed the potential of irs audits and stated that the irs will brand the partnerships an abuse and will subject the partnerships to automatic and constant audit because of these constant audits,the document contained an explanation of why hoyt organization alone should be trusted to prepare tax returns for the partners 
you will feel better when you see our name on your return,stating that all information is true.then you have an affiliate of the partnership preparing all personal and partnership returns and controlling all audit activity with the internal revenue service.
the document referred to this strategy as circling the wagons and depicted the irs in an illustration as a native american about to attack the hs circle of wagons.this strategy allowed hoyt to distribute partnership losses among the partners as needed to minimize partners tax liability 
if a partner needs more or less partnership loss any year,it is arranged quickly within the office,without the partner having to pay a higher fee while an outside preparer spends more time to make the arrangements.
finally,in a section entitled tax aspects,the document warned investors as follows 
out here,tax accountants do read brands,and our cowboys do read tax law.if you do have a tax man who knows you well enough to give you specific personal advice as to whether or not you belong in the cattle business,stay out.the cattle business today can not be separated from tax law any more than cattle can be separated from grass and water.do have anything to do with any aspect of the cattle business without thorough tax advice 
after reviewing this and other hoyt promotional materials and talking with existing partners,but without any assistance or advice from a tax man independent of hoyt,the hansens invested in the hoyt partnerships in late.upon joining the hoyt partnerships,the hansens signed documents giving hoyt permission to incur debt for which they would be personally liable.hansen testified that at the time of their investment,she and her husband believed it would provide not only tax benefits but also a retirement income.
during the course of their investment,the hansens participated in the partnerships.beginning as early as,the hansens attended monthly meetings of local hoyt partners at which guest speakers were sometimes present.hansen consistently read the materials obtained from the hoyt organization,which included independent materials that discussed the aspects of the hoyt business such as cattle figures.hansen attended two ranch tours in and at which she,along with other hoyt partners,visited hoyt ranches and saw cattle and equipment.hansen made frequent telephone calls to the hoyt organization when questions arose,particularly when questions arose involving tax matters.
the hoyt organization prepared the hansens tax returns and refund claims from through.in,the hansens reported on schedule losses of.these losses eliminated the hansens tax liability,and they filed a form,application for tentative refund,to carry back the excess loss in the amount left over after reducing tax liability to zero to and.by so doing,the hansens received refunds of all the income tax they had paid during these years.the hansens continued to allow the hoyt organization to fill out the tax returns and apportion partnership losses through.the hansens never sought verification of the information by a tax adviser or accountant,independent of hoyt,on the schedules or on their tax returns.the hansens estimate that from through,they sent the hoyt organization over,which included payment on notes,partnership assessments,contributions to hoyt sponsored partnership retirement accounts,and of the tax savings the hoyt organization claimed to have generated.
irs involvement 
in december the irs sent a letter informing the hansens their return had been selected for audit by letter dated april,the hansens received further notice that the partnership tax year was under review.the letter stated in relevant part 
based upon our review of the partnership tax shelter activities,we have apprised the tax matters partner that we believe the purported tax shelter deductions credits are not allowable and,if claimed,we plan to examine the return and disallow the deductions credits.the internal revenue code provides,in appropriate cases,for the application of a negligence penalty under section a with respect to the partners.
by the time they filed their tax return,the hansens had received eight notices informing them the irs was beginning an examination of various hoyt partnerships in which they had been involved,including.
hoyt had warned the partners the irs might undertake such action.regarding the irs april,letter,hoyt sent a letter to the partners informing them to not worry about the irs threats of disallowance.on another occasion,hoyt sent a letter to partners expressly contradicting information the irs earlier had provided the partners regarding the time spent by partners which they claimed as material participation in the partnership the irs responded to hoyt letter,pointed out the problems in the letter,and urged partners to seek independent advice if still confused.
despite these warnings and letters and express urging to seek advice independent of hoyt,the hansens continued to claim the deductions on their tax returns.hansen testified that she often corresponded with the hoyt organization when questions arose and that she read all the materials the hoyt organization sent her.hansen further testified that she relied on the assurances offered by hoyt and others within his organization,particularly when issues with the irs arose.because hoyt loudly proclaimed the reach and authority of the bales decision as vindication of the partnerships activities and tax claims,particularly whenever tax complications with the irs arose,the bales decision greatly influenced the hansens decision to maintain their investment.hansen testified she read the bales decision many times and that in her mind,it legitimized the partnership activities.
procedural history 
in the commissioner issued a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment fpaa for the tax year of the partnership.following hoyt failure timely to petition the tax court for a redetermination of the adjustments in the fpaa,the commissioner adjusted the partners individual returns and applied a negligence penalty against the partners for claiming a deduction arising from.pursuant to this negligence penalty,the hansens were charged a penalty because of their understatement of in their tax return.
the hansens brought suit challenging the negligence penalty in the united states tax court.special trial judge goldberg held a trial at which hansen was the only witness to testify.following the trial,the tax court issued an opinion upholding the negligence penalty.hansen commissioner,ria.the court specifically found that the hansens were negligent in using their hoyt partnership losses virtually to eliminate their,and through income taxes because they had relied solely on the hoyt organization which stood to receive the bulk of the tax savings generated and had failed independently to verify the returns,despite repeated irs warnings.id.at.further,the court found the hansens negligent in claiming losses on their return because they had relied on the schedules issued by the hoyt organization without knowledge of how the losses were generated and without seeking tax advice independent of hoyt,despite repeated warnings to do so.id.at.
the tax court also rejected the hansens contentions that they had acted with reasonable cause and in good faith.id.at.the court found that any reliance on tax advice from the hoyt organization alone or partners in the hoyt organization was insufficient because of the blatant conflicts of interest inherent in such advice,the hoyt organization was promoting the scheme and receiving of the tax benefit from the hansens investment id.at.the court also rejected the hansens contention that the bales decision provided reasonable cause to claim the deduction because the bales case involved different investors,partnerships,years,and issues.id.at.finally,the court ruled that although the hansens were indeed victims of hoyt fraud,such victimization did not grant them license to act negligently in claiming such large tax deductions.id.at.
because the hansens do not challenge the commissioner disallowance of the various deductions,the sole issue before us is whether the tax court correctly determined the hansens are liable under a for negligently understating their tax liability on their return.we hold that the tax court did not clearly err in upholding the negligence penalty.
we review findings of negligence by the tax court under the clear error standard.zachary sacks commissioner,cir.accordingly,regarding the tax court weighing of the evidence,w e must uphold the tax court finding unless we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.wolf commissioner,cir quoting united states united states gypsum.
the internal revenue code code imposes an penalty on underpayments of tax arising from the taxpayer negligence,which is equal to percent of the amount of the underpayment caused by taxpayer negligence.a,b.the code defines negligence as any failure to make a reasonable attempt to comply with the provisions of the code,id.c,and requires the taxpayer to prove he acted with due care see collins commissioner,cir stating the commissioner decision to impose negligence penalties is presumptively correct.due care is an objective standard by which the taxpayer must show that he acted as a reasonable and prudent person would act under similar circumstances.see reg.b.negligence is strongly indicated when a taxpayer fails to make a reasonable attempt to ascertain the correctness of a deduction,credit or exclusion on a return which would seem to a reasonable and prudent person to be too good to be true under the circumstances.reg.b,b ii.we look at both the underlying investment and the taxpayer position taken on the tax return in evaluating whether a taxpayer was negligent.sacks,at.
the code provides an exception to the negligence penalty when a taxpayer can demonstrate both reasonable cause for the underpayment and good faith in acting pursuant to such cause.c reg.a the regulations further provide that the determination of reasonable cause and good faith is made on a basis,taking into account all pertinent facts and circumstances,thereby adding a subjective element in determining whether the exception applies.reg.b.most important in this determination is the extent of the taxpayer effort to assess the taxpayer proper tax liability.id.
before examining the facts of this case,we note here the determination by two of our sister circuits that the tax court correctly upheld the negligence penalty imposed by the irs on other in for the tax year.both mortensen commissioner,cir and van scoten commissioner,cir considered many of the arguments before us in this appeal and concluded the were negligent.because the facts of this case are remarkably similar to the facts of both mortensen and van scoten,we are guided in part by these holdings.
the hansens put forth a variety of arguments as to why the tax court clearly erred and as to why they acted with reasonable cause and in good faith in their investments in the hoyt partnerships and in their tax deductions.many of these arguments are overlapping.as our analysis will show,none of the hansens arguments demonstrate the tax court clearly erred in upholding the negligence penalty.because negligence in the claiming of a deduction depends upon both the legitimacy of the underlying investment,and due care in the claiming of the deduction,we examine both the hansens initial investment and their actions throughout the course of the investment.sacks,at.
regarding both the objective negligence standard in a and the more subjective reasonable cause and good faith exception in c,the hansens fail to demonstrate the tax court clearly erred in finding they failed to act as would a reasonable investor,or a reasonable unsophisticated investor,faced with similar circumstances when the hansens invested in the hoyt partnerships.
first,although warned to consult a tax man independent of hoyt ab initio,at no time before their investment did the hansens seek to verify the legitimacy of the tax benefits of the investment from a source independent of hoyt.from the beginning of the investment,the hansens were on notice that the investment took an extremely aggressive tax posture that could lead to frequent irs audits.the hansens admittedly relied on the lb.tax shelter document,which contained warnings to seek their own tax advice and to stay out of the investment absent such advice.the document further warned that the irs considered the partnerships abusive and would subject them to constant audit.
other facts dating to the time of the investment suggested the investment was highly suspicious.for example,the hansens were informed that all their tax returns should be prepared by hoyt to effectuate sound defenses against irs attacks.the hansens further learned that hoyt promised to secure a refund of their prior three years of taxes based on their investment.despite these warnings and suspicious facts,the hansens invested in the partnership without seeking verification of the partnerships and their accompanying tax strategies from a source independent of hoyt.
we have consistently held that given similar warning signals,investors must undertake adequate investigations at the time of investment to avoid the negligence penalty.in a similar action contesting negligence penalties based on business deductions,we stated that t he discussions in the prospectuses of high and the risk of audits should have alerted taxpayers that their deductions were questionable at best.despite these warning signals,taxpayers did not reasonably investigate the venture before investing.collins,at.we came to the same conclusion in sacks,where the prospectus warned of the risk of investment,yet the investors failed to conduct an adequate investigation.at.similarly,in allen commissioner,we held that a plethora of warning signals surrounding the transaction were sufficient to force the investors reasonably to investigate the contribution scheme before they went forward,cir.
the hansens argue the warning signals were insufficient to put them on notice to conduct further investigation into the scheme.they point to other information in the lb.tax shelter discussing the legitimate nature of the business and argue that announcing the risk of audit does not mandate a negligence penalty.the hansens further argue that the tax court ignored evidence that they reviewed independent magazines prior to investing.
however,these arguments do not negate the fact that clear warning signals were actually present at the time of investment therefore,nothing the hansens put forth demonstrates the tax court committed clear error in finding inadequate the hansens investigation regarding the tax benefits prior to investing each of the tax court findings is supported in the record,and it makes no unwarranted inferences concerning the hansens knowledge or action at the time of investment.considering both the sixth circuit in mortensen and the tenth circuit in van scoten affirmed the tax court determination,the tax court findings here should likewise be upheld.see mortensen,at van scoten,at.
next,the tax court found the hansens actions during the course of investment insufficient to establish they acted with reasonable care.the record indicates that throughout their investment,the hansens relied on the hoyt organization to prepare their individual tax returns.the hoyt organization also reported the hansens share of partnership losses on schedule,which the hansens never verified by recourse to a source independent of hoyt.based on the tax returns prepared by the hoyt organization and the refunds the hansens received,during the years through,the hansens paid only in taxes on of related income.
additionally,the irs sent the hansens numerous warnings regarding the propriety of the deductions based on the hoyt partnerships.from june through february,the hansens received eight notices from the irs informing them the irs was beginning audits of partnerships such as.without any investigation or advice independent of hoyt regarding these notices,other than to discuss the matters with members of the hoyt organization,the hansens claimed in partnership losses in,attributable to.according to the tax court,such action,in light of the numerous warnings from the irs and the disproportionately large tax savings in relation to the investment,was enough to constitute negligence.
the tax court did not commit clear error in so holding.the hansens put forth the following arguments as to why they acted reasonably in claiming the deduction from hoyt was an enrolled agent the hansens discussed the state of the partnership with other hoyt partners the hansens indirectly relied on professionals consulted by other partners and by the hoyt organization the hansens personally monitored the hoyt business by reading information sent to them and participating in ranch tours and the hansens received refunds after the irs notified them it might audit their returns.however,each of these alleged defenses involves either pure reliance on the hoyt organization or large assumptions regarding the state of the partnerships based both on information from the hoyt organization and in some instances independent articles and on irs inaction.
as the tax court explained,the hansens investigation into the partnership went no further than members of the hoyt organization and other hoyt.hansen commissioner,ria,we have previously held that a taxpayer can not negate the negligence penalty through reliance on a transaction promoters or on other advisors who have a conflict of interest.see neely united states,cir reasonable inquiry as to the legality of the tax plan is required,including the procurement of independent legal advice when it is common knowledge the plan is questionable.emphasis added accord zmuda commissioner,cir.although the hansens may have done some things to keep track of the hoyt partnerships,it was not clear error for the tax court to conclude that even a taxpayer with similar characteristics as the hansens in a similar situation would seek further advice based on the warning signs present throughout the investment.given facts analogous to the present case,the sixth circuit in mortensen concluded the investor actions constituted little more than hunker ing down.at.the tenth circuit held the same.van scoten,at holding that the van scotens sic investment monitoring efforts,which mostly consisted of reviewing information provided by the hoyt organization did not cure the failure to seek independent tax advice regarding the validity of the cattle partnerships and the concomitant tax deductions.we agree and decline to find clear error in the tax court holding.
we address two final arguments whether the bales decision justifies the hansens actions and whether the hansen
