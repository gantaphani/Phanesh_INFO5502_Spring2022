the united states appeals the district court order granting partial summary judgment to plaintiff carol negron executrix of the estates of mildred lopatkovich and mary susteric.the district court determined that departure from the annuity tables provided by and reg.the irs annuity tables was warranted when negron could show that the value ascribed by the tables is unrealistic and unreasonable and there is a more reasonable and realistic means by which to determine its fair market value.then,it found that transferability of an annuity would affect its fair market value and that the value ascribed by the annuity tables for both estate taxes was unrealistic and unreasonable.because the irs annuity tables properly value lottery annuities for estate tax purposes,we reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
in,lopatkovich and susteric,along with an unidentified third party,jointly won the ohio super lotto jackpot of million.each winner was entitled to receive annual payments of for a total payment of.the first checks were received in january.
both lopatkovich and susteric died in with fifteen more lottery payments remaining lopatkovich on november and susteric on october.these payments were not assignable and could not be used as collateral.the lorain county probate court appointed negron executrix of both estates.negron elected for each estate to receive a lump sum cash settlement of the remaining prize awards pursuant to ohio ann.
each estate was required to include the value of the remaining lottery payments on its estate tax return.negron reported the value as on each return based upon the amount that each estate received from the ohio lottery commission.the commission calculated the present value of the remaining lottery a discount rate of from the state valuation tables in effect on january,the date the lottery prize was won.
the internal revenue service irs determined that the proper values of the remaining lottery payments were for lopatkovich and for susteric.it used discount rates of for lopatkovich and for susteric from the irs annuity tables in effect on the dates of death to calculate the present value of the remaining payments reg.d.the irs assessed an additional tax of for lopatkovich and for susteric.both estates paid the additional tax,with interest,and filed refund claims.the irs denied both claims,and the estates filed suit in the district court for a refund.
b.the district court opinion 
the government and negron filed for summary judgment on the proper method of valuation for annuities the government arguing that the irs annuity tables must be used and negron arguing that an exception was warranted because the tables created unreasonable and unrealistic results.the district court granted negron motion in part and denied the government.it noted that there was a circuit split on whether the irs annuity tables accurately reflect the fair market value of future lottery payments with marketability restrictions the second and ninth circuits have held that they do not,and the fifth circuit along with two other district courts have held that they do.see cook commissioner,cir estate of gribauskas commissioner,cir shackleford united states,cir anthony united states,no.d,wl,at.june,estate of donovan united states,no.dpw,wl,at.the district court was more convinced by the reasoning of the second and ninth circuits.it explained that departure from the irs annuity tables was warranted when the plaintiff could show that the value ascribed by the tables is unrealistic and unreasonable and there is a more reasonable and realistic means by which to determine its fair market value.then,it found that transferability of an annuity would affect its fair market value and that the value ascribed by the annuity tables for both estate taxes was unrealistic and unreasonable.further proceedings were required for negron to show a more reasonable and realistic valuation method in order to justify departure from the irs annuity tables.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
this court has jurisdiction over the government interlocutory appeal under b.the district court granted the government motion to certify the june,summary judgment order for interlocutory appeal to the sixth circuit.it found that the government showed that the summary judgment order involved a controlling question of law,there was a substantial ground for difference of opinion considering the circuit split on the issue,and an immediate appeal would materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.see in re city of memphis,cir.we granted the government petition for permission to appeal.
we review a district court summary judgment order de novo,using the same standard as the district court.c midwest media property,symmes,ohio,cir alkire irving,cir.the court must construe all inferences in favor of the party.alkire,at.
iii.analysis 
this appeal boils down to whether the irs used an appropriate discount rate when calculating the present value of the remaining lottery payments.negron argues that it is unreasonable that the estates were taxed on a distribution amount in excess of that received.this concern translated into allegations that the irs annuity tables did not properly take into account marketability restrictions on the lottery annuity and thus did not provide a reasonable assessment of its fair market value.
it is tempting to accept the argument that a person estate should not be taxed on a lottery annuity amount that it did not receive.this additional tax burden does not seem fair.however,the difference in the amount received and the value for federal tax purposes occurred because of the interaction between the state and federal discount rates ohio with a discount rate in effect on the date the prize was won and the irs with a discount rate in effect on the date of death.see ohio admin.code b.the two discount rates yielded different results because they served different purposes one approximated the value of the unpaid annuity as if it had been a lump sum from the beginning the other valued the annuities as an ongoing annuity or a continuing stream of periodic payments.the lump sum calculation was simply an alternate method of valuing lottery winnings and does not make the irs method unreasonable.
negron does not facially challenge the tables,and the claim thus reduces to equity.the estates chose to take lump sum payments rather than to continue the annuities.if the estates had chosen to continue the annuities,the ohio discount rate would not have entered into the equation.it was the estates choice that made the results of the irs assessment particularly unpleasant,and i t is not entirely clear how the discount can properly address such an equitable concern,beyond simply reducing the scale of the liability.estate of donovan united states,no.dpw,wl,at.furthermore,equity arguments are insufficient to invalidate properly enacted treasury regulations,such as those requiring the use of the irs annuity tables.see nichols united states,cir.despite the differences in discount rates and resulting present value calculations,the internal revenue code and treasury regulations provide a reasonable and proper framework for calculating federal tax liability.
statutory and regulatory framework 
an estate tax is imposed on the transfer of the taxable estate of every deceased united states citizen or resident.the taxable estate equals the value of the gross estate less applicable deductions,and the gross estate includes the value at the time of his death of all property,real or personal,tangible or intangible,wherever situated.the value of the gross estate reflects the extent of the decedent property interest at the time of his death.the value of annuities obtained after march,are specifically included in the gross estate.
the general rule for valuation is that t he value of every item of property includible in a decedent gross estate is its fair market value at the time of the decedent death,and fair market value is the price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller,neither being under any compulsion to
