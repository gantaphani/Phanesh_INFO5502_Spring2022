ward franklin dean appeals his conviction and sentence for income tax evasion,and attempted interference with the administration of internal revenue laws,a.dean challenges his conviction on a number of grounds,arguing that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of the attempt at obstruction and that the jury received erroneous or misleading instructions.dean also argues that the district court failed to comply with the jury selection and service act of,by denying him an opportunity to inspect the grand jury list and failing to comply with the district court jury plan.
dean challenges the constitutionality of his sentence as well,arguing that the court improperly applied the holding in united states booker,d to his sentence,which addressed conduct.according to dean,the retroactive application of booker to his sentence violates due process and the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws.for the reasons stated below,we affirm dean conviction on both charges and the district court sentence.
background 
in,ward dean,a medical doctor,published author,and retired naval flight surgeon,became a tax protester.he had always paid his federal income taxes faithfully up to this point,but on his tax form for,dean suddenly reported his income and his tax liability as.at the time,dean was earning over a year as the medical director for vitamin research products and drawing down roughly a year through his navy pension.although dean accountant,john graham,prepared a return and a return that reflected dean true earnings and his tax liability,dean refused to file these returns and substituted forms that stated he owed nothing in taxes.dean also submitted a revised form to his employer,claiming that he was exempt from federal income tax withholding for.
the internal revenue service irs sent dean a letter on october,informing him that it considered his return frivolous because it reported income,notwithstanding documentation to the contrary.that did not dissuade dean from continuing to report his income and tax liability as on subsequent tax returns,however.in,dean filed a credit application that stated his yearly income was,but when he submitted his tax return for,he reported an adjusted gross income of on form.in,dean filed another credit application that stated his yearly income was.yet,once again,when he filed his tax return,he reported his income as on form.
both the form and the form state on the face of the form that wages and pensions constitute income which is to be reported.the instruction booklet that the irs puts out for these forms also states that wages and pensions constitute income.nevertheless,dean continued to deny any tax liability on his,and income tax returns,entering income on his forms for.he also continued to claim on his forms that he was exempt from withholding.
the irs,for its part,continued to notify dean that his returns incorrectly reported no income or tax liability and that he was required to pay income tax.on october,irs sent dean a letter regarding his return.the letter stated that the irs would uphold a penalty that the service had imposed upon him for filing a frivolous income tax return in.dean challenged the penalty in the united states district court for the northern district of florida.
in the meantime,irs revenue agent wayne jackson had begun to investigate dean burgeoning tax debt.on january,jackson issued summonses to dean employer,to the department of finance and accounting service dfas,which administered dean pension from the navy,and to several banks where dean had accounts,requesting copies of dean financial records.in keeping with irs policy,jackson sent dean a copy of each of the summonses.
dean immediately contacted each of the parties by letter to advise them that they were under no obligation to comply with this fraudulent summons.it is not a court order,dean stated in his letter of january.rather,dean asserted,it is a phony document sent by a revenue agent who has no authority to send a lawful summons to anyone.emphasis in the original.see government ex.wj.
on october,the district court upheld the penalty that irs imposed on dean for filing a frivolous tax return,granting summary judgment in favor of the government.the court stated that dean of gross and taxable income was obviously incorrect and that the incorrect information was due to defendant frivolous justifications.
in,dean earned over.despite that fact,dean failed to file a tax return for.thereafter,the irs began working with government prosecutors to indict dean for tax evasion and attempting to interfere in the administration of internal revenue laws.on march,a federal grand jury sitting in the northern district of florida,indicted dean with six counts of income tax evasion for the years of through and one count of endeavoring to obstruct the administration of internal revenue laws.dean trial date was initially set for june,but it was subsequently postponed a number of times,until a final date was set for december.
on november,nine days before trial was to commence,dean filed a motion to inspect the jury records pursuant to the jury selection and service act of.the district court granted dean motion on december.dean authorized his representatives to inspect the records for him,which they did the following day on december.before trial started on the morning of december,dean filed a motion to stay the proceedings,alleging substantial with the jury selection and service act in seating his grand petit juries.
dean argued that he had not been able to inspect the grand jury lists,only the petit jury lists,but that the jury qualification questionnaires for the petit jury had raised questions about whether the clerk of the court had followed the district jury plan in determining the eligibility of prospective jurors.the plan stated that eligible jurors had to be citizens,who had resided within the district for a set period of time,and had the ability to speak,read and write english.according to dean s motion,a number of prospective jurors had indicated that they were born outside the united states,raising questions as to their citizenship.he also found that a number of prospective jurors had failed to indicate how long they had resided within the northern district of florida and that the qualification questionnaires did not attempt to determine whether a prospective juror could speak english.dean suggested that these problems might have plagued the grand jury questionnaires as well.
during a hearing on the motion,dean counsel conceded that it could resolve dean doubts about the grand jury that very morning if the court would get a copy of the grand jury list faxed over.dean counsel also conceded that he would have an opportunity to resolve his doubts about the nationality,residency and skills of the petit jury during voir dire.the court delayed trial in order to give dean counsel an opportunity to review the grand jury list,but it ultimately denied dean motion to stay the proceedings because the motion failed to conform to procedural requirements.the court noted that the motion was untimely and that it did not include a sworn affidavit as required by statute.although it did not need to reach the merits of the motion,the court also opined that the motion lacked merit because it did not seek to challenge the district court jury plan.
dean trial proceeded as planned and concluded two days later on december.dean filed a motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the evidence,but the court denied the motion and sent the case to the jury.the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts that same day.dean renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal and the court denied it once again.on july,the court sentenced dean to three concurrent jail terms on counts and to three other concurrent jail terms on counts.the district court ordered the latter sentences to run consecutively after the sentences in counts.dean filed a timely notice of appeal of his conviction and sentence on july.
ii.standards of review 
since the appellant challenges his convictions and sentence on multiple grounds,we must apply several different standards of review to his claims.first and foremost,we note that the appellant challenges several pattern jury instructions that he formerly approved at instruction regarding the crime of tax evasion and the instruction regarding the crime of attempting to interfere with the administration of internal revenue laws.we review challenges to jury instructions that are raised for the first time on appeal under a plain error standard.united states puche,cir.
a constitutional right,or a right of any other sort,may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it.united states olano,d quoting yakus united states.under rule b of the federal rules of criminal procedure,appellate courts have limited power to correct errors that were forfeited in this manner.
rule b provides that a plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the attention of the court.fed.rules crim.b.as this court noted in united states pielago,cir,we may find evidence of plain error in either one of two situations.one occurs where an intervening decision of this court or the supreme court is squarely on point and invalidates a lower court ruling.see,united states walker,cir,where an intervening decision of the supreme court that held the gun free school zone act unconstitutional made the defendant conviction under that statute plain error.we will also find plain error where an erroneous decision appears to be particularly egregious,and strikes at a core principle embodied in the violated law or rule.pielago,at.see,united states quinones,cir,where this court found that the district court failed to ensure a criminal defendant understood the nature of the charges against him,one of the core principles embodied in.
if we find plain error,we have the discretion to correct the error where it seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states young,d quoting united states atkinson.
where an appellant has objected to a jury instruction at trial,we review the court decision to use that instruction for abuse of discretion.see mccormick aderholt,cir.however,we will only reverse a jury verdict if we are left with a substantial and ineradicable doubt as to whether the jury was properly guided in its deliberations.id.quoting roberts schaefer hardaway,cir.
similarly,where a court declines to use a proffered jury instruction,we review that decision for abuse of discretion.united states morris,cir united states carrasco,cir.as long as a defendant theory of defense has some basis in the evidence and legal support,a defendant is entitled to have the court instruct the jury on that theory.united states orr,cir citing united states gold,cir,cert.denied,d.
nevertheless,the refusal to give a proffered instruction only constitutes reversible error if the requested instruction was a correct statement of the law,its subject matter was not substantially covered by other instructions,and its subject matter dealt with an issue in the trial court that was so important that failure to give it seriously impaired the defendant ability to defend himself.united states paradies,cir citing united states sirang,cir.
challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence involve questions of law which we review de novo.united states dodds,cir.in doing so,we evaluate the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,and draw all reasonable inferences and credibility assessments in the government favor.united states harris,cir.
the appellant urges us to review his challenge to the jury selection process under the same de novo standard.he cites united states grisham,cir as support for the proposition that constitutional challenges to the jury selection process are reviewed de novo.our responsibility is to examine the appellant claim for what it actually is,not for what he would have it be,however.see mckinney pate,cir,cert.denied,d.although the appellant asserts that the court denied him the right to inspect grand jury lists,the record indicates that he filed a motion to inspect the jury lists on november,nine days before trial.the district court granted that motion on december.the appellant inspected both the petit and grand jury lists before trial was to commence.
on the day of trial,december,the appellant filed a motion to stay the proceedings,arguing that the court had failed to comply with the jury selection and service act of.the court denied that motion on procedural grounds because it was untimely,and not accompanied by a sworn statement as required by the statute.additionally,the court found that the challenge lacked merit because the jury plan had been approved by the eleventh circuit and the motion did not allege that the jury plan was defective.indeed,the appellant counsel conceded during oral argument before this court that the jury plan was fine.accordingly,the appellant is not actually challenging the jury selection process,but the decision to deny his motion to stay trial.we review a decision on the timeliness of a motion to stay for abuse of discretion.see brooks united states,cir 
and,lastly,we review a constitutional challenge to a sentence de novo.united states chau,cir,accepting the court factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.united states jordi,cir.
iii.discussion 
defendant motion to stay trial 
the appellant moved to stay the proceedings against him under on the day that his trial was to begin,alleging substantial failure to comply with the provisions of a in selecting the grand petit jury.section of title of the united states code provides in pertinent part that 
a in criminal cases,before the voir dire examination begins,or within seven days after the defendant discovered or could have discovered,by the exercise of diligence,the grounds therefor,whichever is earlier,the defendant may move to dismiss the indictment or stay the proceedings against him on the ground of substantial failure to comply with the provisions of this title in selecting the grand or petit jury.
d upon motion filed under subsection a,b,or c of this section,containing a sworn statement of facts which,if true,would constitute a substantial failure to comply with the provisions of this title,the moving party shall be entitled to present in support of such motion the testimony of the jury commission or clerk,if available,any relevant records and papers not public or otherwise available used by the jury commissioner or clerk,and any other relevant evidence.if the court determines that there has been a substantial failure to comply with the provisions of this title in selecting the grand jury,the court shall stay the proceedings pending the selection of a grand jury in conformity with this title or dismiss the indictment,whichever is appropriate.if the court determines that there has been a substantial failure to comply with the provisions of this title in selecting the petit jury,the court shall stay the proceedings pending the selection of a petit jury in conformity with this title.
a and d.thus,the jury selection and service act sets two requirements for motions to stay proceedings a timeliness requirement under a and a sworn statement requirement under d.
the grand jury returned an indictment against dean on march,however,dean did not file his motion to stay the proceedings pursuant to a until the first day of trial,december.although,he filed his motion before voir dire began,the act authorizes defendants to file a motion for a stay before voir dire,or within seven days of when they discover or could have discovered grounds for challenging the jury selection process,whichever is earlier.obviously,in this case,the earlier date would have been well before voir dire.
as the district court noted during oral arguments on the motion,dean could have requested a transcript of the grand jury selection process after the grand jury returned its indictment against him on march.if he had done so,the court advised,he could have determined whether the court asked the jurors about their citizenship,length of residency within the northern district of florida,and their english language skills.dean cited these points as grounds for questioning the composition of the jury.
because he did not try to inspect the grand jury list and jury qualification questionnaires within seven days of his indictment,the date on which he could have discovered if there were grounds for a challenge,he failed to meet the deadline for filing a motion to stay under a.courts are to construe the timeliness requirement strictly as failure to comply with the requirement forecloses a challenge under the act.paradies,at cir citing united states bearden,cir,cert.denied,d.
moreover,d mandates that all motions challenging compliance with the jury selection and service act of must be supported by a sworn statement of facts,which,if true,would constitute a substantial failure to comply with the act.united states aguirre,cir.these procedural requirements are strictly enforced so that the district court has an opportunity to evaluate the alleged noncompliance and to correct it before precious judicial resources are invested in a trial.united states contreras,cir citing united states kennedy,cir,cert.denied,d.
dean failed to attach a sworn statement of the facts to support his allegation that there was a substantial failure to follow the district jury plan for selecting eligible jurors.accordingly,his motion to stay the proceedings fails to meet the requirements under d and is barred on procedural grounds.we need not reach the merits of his motion 
b.the jury instruction regarding the defendant good faith defense 
as a general rule,ignorance of the law or a mistake of law is no defense to criminal prosecution in the united states.cheek united states,d.however,the supreme court has noted that there is a good faith exception under the federal criminal tax statutes.id.at.according to this exception,if someone simply fails to understand that he has a duty to pay income taxes under the internal revenue code,he can not be guilty of willfully evading those taxes.id.at.the term willfulness presupposes the existence of a legal duty and knowledge of that duty.id.at.if,however,someone recognizes that he has a duty to pay taxes,but simply refuses to pay or to declare his income because he believes that the code is unconstitutional,he is not acting in good faith.id.at.
a person who is charged with tax evasion is entitled to have the jury hear an instruction on this good faith defense.id.at.and,the district court provided one that was used in a seventh circuit case,united states hilgeford,cir.dean argues that the instruction misled the jury because it implied that they could reject his good faith defense if they found it to be objectively unreasonable.dean contends that the supreme court rejected this sort of instruction in cheek.
we find that the district court instruction conforms quite well to the supreme court holding in cheek.the district court instructed dean jury that 
a defendant does not act willfully if he believes in good faith that he is acting within the law or that his actions comply with the law.this is so even if the defendant belief was not objectively reasonable as long as he held the belief in food faith.nevertheless,you may consider whether the defendant belief about the tax statutes was actually reasonable as a factor in deciding whether he held that belief in good faith.
the court did not insert a caveat that a defendant belief must be objectively reasonable to be in good faith.it simply reiterated a point that the supreme court made in cheek 
in this case,if cheek asserted that he truly believed that the internal revenue code did not purport to treat wages as income,and the jury believed him,the government would not have carried its burden to prove willfulness,however unreasonable a court might deem such a belief 
of course,the more unreasonable the asserted beliefs or misunderstandings are,the more likely the jury will consider them to be nothing more than simple disagreement with known legal duties imposed by the tax laws and will find that the government has carried its burden of proving knowledge.
id.at.accordingly,we find that the district court good faith instruction accurately stated the law on this issue.if we are satisfied that the district court instruction has not misstated the law or misled the jury,we give the district court wide discretion as to the style and wording employed in the instructions.united states bender,cir.the district court did not abuse that discretion in this case.
dean also argues that the district court erred in adding a willful blindness instruction at the end of its good faith instruction.there is no merit to this argument.a willfull blindness instruction is entirely appropriate where the evidence supports a finding that a defendant intentionally insulated himself from knowledge of his tax obligations.the record showed that dean,much like the defendant in cheek,had paid his taxes faithfully for a number of years before he became convinced that income taxes were unconstitutional.the record also showed that he,like the defendant in cheek,had previously challenged the validity of the income tax requirement in court,and knew,as a result of the court ruling that his arguments were frivolous.yet,dean failed to file a return although a court ruled against him on october,when he challenged a penalty that the irs imposed on him for filing a frivolous return in.
as the supreme court indicated in cheek,albeit,not in so many words,the law would not countenance such blindness 
we do not believe that congress contemplated that such a taxpayer,without risking criminal prosecution,could ignore the duties imposed upon him by the internal revenue code and refuse to utilize the mechanisms provided by congress to present his claims of invalidity to the courts and to abide by their decisions.there is no doubt that cheek,from year to year,was free to pay the tax that the law purported to require,file for a refund and,if denied,present his claims of invalidity,constitutional or otherwise,to the courts.see.also,without paying the tax,he could have challenged claims of tax deficiencies in the tax court,with the right to appeal to a higher court if unsuccessful.a.cheek took neither course in some years,and when he did was unwilling to accept the outcome.
cheek,at.thus,we conclude the district court did not err in adding a willfull blindness instruction.
c.the jury instruction on income tax evasion and attempted obstruction 
the district court used the eleventh circuit pattern jury instruction on income tax evasion,criminal offense instruction,and attempting to interfere with the administration of internal revenue laws,criminal offense instruction.dean stated at trial that he did not object to the use of either of these instructions,so we review the court decision to employ them under a plain error standard.see puche,at.
granted,district courts do not have to use our pattern jury instructions for they are not precedent and can not solely foreclose the construction of the necessary elements of a crime as stated in the statute.united states ettinger,cir.nevertheless,our pattern jury instructions clearly state the elements of proof required for conviction under both.see sansone united states,d united states stone,cir,and under a.see united states popkin,cir.accordingly,the district court did not err,much less commit plain error,in using our pattern jury instruction on these offenses.
in a related vein,dean also argues that the district court erred when it instructed the jury on the charges under count vii of the indictment,which deals with attempted interference in internal revenue actions.dean contends that the district court should not have summarized the individual obstruction charges.this argument has no merit.dean sent essentially the same letter to each of the entities that received summonses from irs namely,dean employer,the dfas,and his banks.the individual letters stated the same the entities did not have to comply with the summons to produce dean financial records for an irs investigation.thus,the court could summarize the offensive conduct quite properly as informing entities that they were
