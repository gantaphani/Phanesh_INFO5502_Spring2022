hathcock seeks reversal of the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of acme truck lines,acme.because we find hathcock,in his capacity as a truck driver,was an employee of acme at all pertinent times,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
facts and proceedings 
acme transports equipment,materials,and supplies throughout the country.hathcock,pursuant to a written agreement the lease agreement leased his truck to acme.the third paragraph of the lease agreement contains the provision central to this case 
as consideration for the use of the leased equipment lessee acme agrees to pay lessor hathcock percent of the earned revenue derived by the lessee from the leased equipment hathcock truck,less driver wages payroll taxes including fica and other deductions cost of medical or hospitalization insurance,if applicable and such other costs or payments made by lessee by reason of driver employment and less any operating costs and expenses,defined in detail,and not contested,in the fifth paragraph of the lease agreement which are incurred by lessee in connection with the use operation of the leased equipment for which lessor shall be responsible emphasis added.
acme accorded hathcock the option of choosing and designating the driver of the truck he leased to acme or allowing acme to supply the driver for his truck.
exercising his option to choose the driver of his truck,hathcock selected himself.pursuant to another provision of the lease agreement,he allocated ten percent of his lessor revenue to driver wages.in keeping with its company policy,acme informed hathcock that he would be paid by two separate to him as lessor for the lease of his truck rental check and the other to him as the designated driver of that truck paycheck.in another memorandum,acme informed hathcock of the fixed percentage of the driver wages that it would deduct from the rental check to cover those driver and costs detailed in the lease agreement third paragraph as chargeable to the lessor.
eventually,hathcock terminated the lease agreement.he then filed suit against acme in texas state court,asserting various causes of action including fraud,breach of contract,conversion,and unjust enrichment.acme removed the case to the united states district court for the southern district of texas.after the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment,the district court granted acme motion and denied hathcock.after his motion for reconsideration was denied,hathcock timely filed a notice of appeal.
discussiona.standard of review 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court a motion for summary judgment is properly granted only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact an issue is material if its resolution could affect the outcome of the action in deciding whether a fact issue has been created,we must view the facts and the inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party 
the standard for summary judgment mirrors that for judgment as a matter of law thus,the court must review all of the evidence in the record,but make no credibility determinations or weigh any evidence in reviewing all the evidence,the court must disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe,and should give credence to the evidence favoring the nonmoving party as well as that evidence supporting the moving party that is uncontradicted and unimpeached 
hathcock dual capacity as lessor and driver 
hathcock bases his claims on the proposition that acme and only acme is responsible for fica,futa,and suta taxes therefore,contends hathcock,acme deductions from his rental check to help defray its costs for those taxes were unlawful.the legality of the payment system employed by acme depends in large part on its statutory and contractual ability to treat hathcock as an for some purposes while treating him as an employee for others.
hathcock does not contend that if he had selected and designated a third party to drive his truck for acme,that driver would not have been lawfully and properly deemed an employee of acme and paid directly by acme and not by hathcock.neither does he contest that if such had been the case acme would have been entitled to deduct from hathcock rental check all employee costs designated as such in the lease agreement.hathcock sole contention here is that everything changes when the individual who leases his truck to acme drives it himself,that employee costs incurred by acme when the lessor drives can not be charged back against that person,wearing his lessor hat.
in diametric opposition,acme insists that it is entitled to treat hathcock the same way when he drives the truck that he leased to acme as it would treat a driver chosen by hathcock.thus,acme insists,it was entitled to pay him with two checks,one for each of his roles,and to deduct the contractually specified employee costs from his rental check.acme uniformly treats all truck those who own their trucks and lease them to employees,paying them by payroll checks from which the employees portions of federal income,state income,and social security taxes are withheld.in contrast,acme treats all those who choose to drive their independent contractors,paying them by rental check from which are deducted the driver wages plus a percentage thereof to cover the employer share of payroll taxes and other costs incurred by acme.
because most of acme do not choose to drive their own trucks,acme system is the norm,and is commercially logical as well.as suggested by a venerable case from this court and by a decision from the texas workers compensation commission as well,acme application of its,system to hathcock is proper acme may simultaneously treat him as an and as a.hathcock had the option either to drive the truck himself or to select a driver,and the lease agreement clearly contemplates the dichotomy.when hathcock elected to drive the truck himself,he donned a second hat.
hathcock status as an employee 
hathcock argues that he was an independent contractor at all times and was never acme employee.acme,on the other hand,maintains that when hathcock elected to serve as a truck driver,he became acme employee despite his continued role as the independent of the truck.the district court,in granting summary judgment in acme favor,was satisfied that the facts,viewed in the light most favorable to hathcock,established that he was an employee when he drove the truck leased to acme.we agree with this determination of the district court.
hathcock capacity acme when he drove the truck is material.if he were acme employee,then he created a portion of acme fica,futa,and suta tax liability,making acme withholdings from hathcock driver paycheck not merely proper but mandated by state and federal tax law.conversely,if hathcock were an independent contractor when wearing his driver hat,withholding monies from his rental check to cover acme employee expenses would have been improper.in fact,if hathcock were an independent contractor when he drove,acme would not have been responsible for withholding and remitting income,fica,futa,and suta taxes because acme is required to do that for its employees only.
courts have developed various tests to differentiate employees from independent contractors.case law from both texas and louisiana recognizes the right to control an employee conduct as the most important component of the determination the state appellate court in hoechst celanese compton explained that texas courts analyze five factors in determining the employer degree of control the independent nature of the workman business the workman obligation to furnish necessary tools,supplies,and materials the workman right to control the progress of the work except as to the final results the time for which the workman is employed and whether the workman is paid by time or by job similarly,we have evaluated employment relationships in the context of title vii and the adea by using a hybrid economic law control test that focuses on whether the alleged employer had the right to hire and fire,the right to supe
