code of civil procedure sections through hereafter the validation statutes provide an expedited process by which certain public agency actions may be determined valid and not subject to attack.the public agency may validate its action by either active or passive means.it may initiate an action in rem to establish the validity of the matter.alternatively,the agency may do nothing,and if no interested person brings suit to determine the validity of the public agency action within days,the action is deemed valid.but not all actions of a public agency are subject to validation,and the present case requires us to determine the limits of sections through.
benjamin kaatz brought suit as a taxpayer to challenge certain actions of the city of seaside city arising out of its purchase and sale of acres of residential property that were formerly part of the fort ord military base.kaatz claimed,among other things,that immediately after the city purchased the property from the united states army in july,it conveyed the entire acreage to a developer,k b bakewell seaside venture,llc k b bakewell,for a fraction of its fair market value.following motions for judgment on the pleadings and for dismissal filed by k b bakewell joined in by the city,the suit was dismissed on the basis that it was.in so doing,the court concluded that the challenged purchase and sale of property were matters that were embraced by government code section language permitting a local agency to bring a proceeding under the validation statutes to determine the validity of its bonds,warrants,contracts,obligations or evidences of indebtedness,and kaatz had not filed suit to determine the validity of the city actions within days as required by the validation statutes.
as a threshold matter,we will address k b bakewell motion to dismiss the in by the the basis that the notice of appeal was not filed within days of entry of judgment as provided in section,subdivision b section b.we will conclude that the notice of appeal was timely filed section b does not apply here,because the appeal is not challenging a judgment entered pursuant to the validation statutes.we will then address the primary issue on appeal,namely,whether the city actions challenged by kaatz were ones that were subject to validation under sections through.we will hold,based upon the limited scope of the validation statutes,that the city conveyance of the with the city prior execution of the underlying contract with the developer concerning the potential acquisition and sale of the not subject to validation.we will therefore find that the trial court erred in its application of the statute of limitations for validation proceedings and consequent dismissal of the action.accordingly,we will reverse the judgment entered on that dismissal.
procedural history 
early proceedings 
on may,kaatz filed a complaint captioned complaint by taxpayer for injunctive relief ccp alleging eight claims for relief against the city kaatz alleged that he resided in the city and had paid real property taxes to the city within one year before the action was initiated.kaatz challenged,among other things,the validity of a deed by which the city conveyed property known as the hayes park property hereafter hayes park or property to k b bakewell.
kaatz sought an order pendente lite enjoining the city from granting any construction permits and from approving any final parcel maps for hayes park.on august,after extensive briefing and argument,the court granted a preliminary injunction preventing the city from taking any action with regard to approval of the final subdivision map for the property 
one day after granting the preliminary injunction,the court granted kaatz motion for leave to amend the complaint to add k b bakewell as a defendant.and less than a week later,k b bakewell filed a motion for an order vacating the preliminary injunction,or,in the alternative,an order increasing the amount of the bond from to.k b bakewell argued that well as buyers of homes who had already planned to move into the suffer substantial injury if the injunction were allowed to remain in effect.over kaatz opposition,the court vacated the preliminary injunction on august,on the condition that k b bakewell parent,kb home,execute an enforceable guaranty of any monetary judgment imposed against k b bakewell 
ii.second amended complaint 
the second amended complaint was the operative pleading addressed in k b bakewell alternative motions to dismiss and for judgment on the pleadings kaatz asserted eight causes of action against all defendants,each claim arising generally out of the city purchase of hayes park from the united states army and the city immediate resale of that property to k b bakewell.as to the majority of the claims,kaatz cited as authority the statute permitting suit by a taxpayer to prevent the illegal expenditure of,waste of,or injury to,the estate,funds,or other property of a city under section.see fn,ante.
the relevant allegations of the second amended complaint consisted of the following following the enactment of the defense base closure and realignment act of,as amended the united states closed the fort ord military base located in monterey county the federal government was authorized to sell as surplus property under the national defense authorization act for fiscal year portions of the former fort ord,including hayes park on or about may,the city,pursuant to its council resolution authorizing such action,entered into an agreement with k b bakewell concerning hayes park entitled land disposition agreement lda on or about july,the federal government conveyed the property by quitclaim deed to the city for a purchase price of also on or about july,the city transferred all of its interest in hayes park to k b bakewell for the city transfer of the property was in contravention of the city council resolution approving the lda that the property not be sold for other than fair market value,was a breach of the city statutory duty to make the surplus property available for affordable housing,was done without ever considering any other bid,proposal,or offer for the property,and was in violation of the constitutional and statutory prohibition against cities giving away public property and as a result,k b bakewell stood to pocket,in addition to standard profit on the housing construction,an approximately million pure cash windfall representing the value of the property purportedly purchased from the city for a fraction of its fair market value.
the first cause of action sought to invalidate the deed of the property from the city to k b bakewell.kaatz alleged that the alleged transfer was void because the lda,as approved by the city council,required that hayes park be sold at its fair market value.
the second cause of action likewise sought to void the transfer of hayes park to k b to invalidate the the ground that the city,both through its execution of the lda in and its conveyance of the property in july,violated the surplus land act,et kaatz alleged that that statute required the city to provide statutory notice to specified public agencies prior to selling or otherwise disposing of surplus public land acquired from the federal government to facilitate that law goal of making such surplus land available for affordable housing.
kaatz alleged as a third cause of action that the deed of the property to k b bakewell and the underlying lda were void because they constituted a sale of city property below fair market value and did not fall within the statutory exception of government code section,under which a city may sell its land for below fair market value where the sale specific purpose is to create affordable housing 
the fourth cause of action claimed that the lda required k b bakewell,in conjunction with acquiring the property,to construct two public works projects to be located on land outside of hayes park,namely,a square foot building and housing units for homeless persons.kaatz alleged that the lda was void because the city failed to solicit competitive bids for construction of these two public works,as required under public contract code section.
under the fifth cause of action,kaatz similarly sought avoidance of the lda.he alleged that,notwithstanding the lda recital that it was approved after a duly noticed public hearing,no valid public hearing occurred,because the terms and conditions of the lda were modified on the very day the lda public hearing was held.
the sixth cause of action alleged that the california constitution,prohibits public entities from giving away public property.kaatz asserted that,because the city sold hayes park to k b bakewell for percent of its fair market value,the lda and deed were void because the city actions were unconstitutional.
the seventh cause of action alleged that the city actions in transferring the property constituted a waste of public estate,property and funds.kaatz claimed that the lda and deed to k b bakewell were therefore void.
finally,kaatz alleged in the eighth cause of action that there was a present controversy that required under section a judicial declaration of the parties rights and duties under the lda and deed conveying the property to k b bakewell.
iii.motion to dismiss or motion for judgment on the pleadings 
on november,k b bakewell filed a motion to dismiss,or,in the alternative,a motion for judgment on the pleadings.k b bakewell argued that the actions of the city being execution of the lda and the sale of the property pursuant to that subject to the validation statutes,and that because kaatz had not brought a validating proceeding within days,his action was.the city filed a joinder,and kaatz opposed k b bakewell alternative motions.
after extensive briefing including several posthearing briefs and argument,and after submission of the matter,on march,the court granted the motion to dismiss.it concluded that the city challenged actions were subject to validation and accordingly kaatz claims were barred by the statute of limitations under the validation statutes 
judgment was entered on the dismissal on april.k b bakewell gave written notice of entry of the judgment on april.
iv.postjudgment motions 
on april,kaatz filed alternative motions for new trial or to set aside and vacate the judgment.kaatz principal argument was that the court,in ruling on the alternative motions to dismiss or for judgment on the pleadings,granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings the court therefore should have granted leave to amend.kaatz alternative motions for new trial or to set aside the by k b bakewell and the city hereafter sometimes collectively respondents were denied by the court.
on june,kaatz filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of dismissal and from the order denying the alternative motions for new trial or to set aside the judgment.k b bakewell filed a motion to dismiss the appeal,and the city joined in that motion.after considering kaatz opposition and k b bakewell reply,this court ordered that the dismissal motion be heard concurrently with the appeal.
discussion 
issues on appeal 
kaatz contends that the court erred in dismissing the action.he asserts that the action was not brought under,and was thus not subject to,a statute of limitations specified in the validation statutes.kaatz argues further that his appeal was timely.
ii.timeliness of notice of appeal 
because the timely filing of a notice of appeal is a jurisdictional prerequisite for our review of this case van beurden ins.services,customized worldwide weather ins.agency,cal th,d,we first address respondents motion to dismiss the appeal.here,the notice of appeal was filed on the day after k b bakewell mailed a notice of entry of judgment.respondents contend that the notice of appeal was not timely filed because,pursuant to section b,no appeal shall be allowed from any judgment entered pursuant to this chapter,sections through unless a notice of appeal is filed within days after the notice of entry of the judgment.kaatz responds that he is not challenging by appeal a judgment entered pursuant to the validation statutes.therefore he asserts,his notice of appeal was timely filed under rule a of the california rules of court,which specifies that the normal time for filing an appeal from a judgment is days after the party filing the notice of appeal serves or is served by a party with a document entitled notice of entry of judgment.
the motion to dismiss the appeal presents an interesting conundrum.respondents assert that since the trial court concluded that the validation statutes applied to kaatz,accordingly it dismissed the judgment entered on the dismissal was clearly one entered pursuant to the validation statutes.therefore they argue,the appeal period of section b applies,and this court must dismiss the appeal without regard to its underlying merits.thus,respondents urge that we must dismiss the appeal because the trial court ruled that the action was subject to the validation statutes,regardless of whether that conclusion was correct.naturally,kaatz argues that we must consider the underlying merits to determine whether the action was governed by the validation statutes before we may consider whether the notice of appeal was timely filed.we concur with kaatz position.
we are directed to no authority squarely holding that where the trial court concludes that an action is one for which a special statute applies for purposes of calculating the timeliness of a notice of the appellant disputes that characterization of the appellate court must accept without question the lower court conclusion.nor do we find the absence of such authority surprising the proposition respondents advance seemingly suggests an abdication of the appellate court responsibilities.
respondents,however,urge that dismissal of the appeal here is supported by planning conservation league department of water resources cal th,d,planning conservation league i,a case in which the supreme court held that a notice of appeal based upon an appealable order under the validation statutes was untimely.there,the supreme court noted that the underlying facts and the merits of the dispute were not relevant to its determination of the timeliness of the appeal.id.at,d.but in that case,there was no dispute between the parties that the underlying action was brought under the validation statutes.instead,the court only addressed the narrow procedural issue ibid.of whether section b applied not only to judgments entered in validating proceedings,but to appealable orders as well.thus,the court was not faced with the unusual procedural setting present here an appeal from the dismissal of an action in which the plaintiff kaatz did not invoke the validation one in which,parenthetically,the public agency defendant city only belatedly asserted the statutes the trial court concluded that the action was subject to the validation statutes.planning conservation league i does not suggest dismissal of the appeal in this case 
kaatz cites three cases that he contends support his position that we may consider the underlying merits of the appeal to decide whether the shortened appeal period of section b applies.see new davidson brick county of riverside d.bliler city of san diego d.vogel city of millbrae d.these cases have some bearing on our inquiry in each of them,the appellate court examined the substance of the plaintiff claims to determine whether the action was one that,in fact,invoked the statute that provided for a shortened appeal period.see,new davidson brick,supra,at.but while they are somewhat supportive of our conclusion that,in resolving the motion to dismiss the appeal,we must consider whether the validation statutes apply to kaatz claims,these cases are by no means dispositive.in none of the cases did the trial court determine that the action was in fact subject to a statute that invoked a shortened appeal period.thus,the appellate courts were not addressing the precise question here are we precluded from reviewing the trial court specific finding that the case was subject to the validation statutes,thereby rendering applicable,ipse dixit,the shortened appeal period of section b 
we conclude that in order to determine the timeliness of the appeal notice,under the circumstances here,we must determine if the underlying action was,in fact,a proceeding under the validation statutes.this requires us,of necessity,to resolve the principal issue of the appeal itself.a contrary conclusion,we believe,would yield an anomalous and unjust result.it would preclude review on the merits of a trial court decision by having the appellate court assume the applicability of a statute providing for a shortened appeal period without regard to whether that assumption was correct.our view that we must consider whether kaatz action was,in fact,subject to the validation than agreeing blindly with the trial court on this consistent with the policy,based upon the remedial character of the right of appeal,of according that right in doubtful cases when such can be accomplished without doing violence to applicable rules.citation.hollister convalescent,rico cal d.
we foreshadow the balance of our decision by summarily noting our conclusion below that the city conduct challenged by kaatz was not subject to the validation statutes.the appeal period under section b was therefore inapplicable.the appeal was filed within days of the mailing by a party of the notice of entry of judgment as required by california rules of court,rule a.we thus deny respondents motion to dismiss.
iii.the order dismissing the action 
standard of review 
kaatz argues that the trial court dismissal of the action is subject to de novo review.citing mckay county of riverside d,he asserts that when the dismissal motion challenged the pleadings,the order of dismissal should be treated on appeal as if it had been an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend.of course,under well settled principles,t he function of a demurrer is to test the sufficiency of the complaint as a matter of law,and it raises only a question of law.citations.on a question of law,we apply a de novo standard of review on appeal.citation.holiday matinee,rambus,th,d.respondents do not discuss the applicable standard of review.
it is settled that one method of asserting a challenge that an action was untimely filed under the validation statutes is by the method employed here,namely,a motion to dismiss.see smith diablo unified sch.dist.d.phillips seely d.a defense that the statute of limitations bars a validation proceeding,however,may also be asserted by demurrer.see meaney sacramento housing redevelopment agency th,d see also iverson,yoakum,papiano hatch berwald th,d complaint barred on its face by statute of limitations subject to general demurrer.and w hether a statute of limitations applies ordinarily is a question of law.see embarcadero mun.improvement dist.county of santa barbara th,d.
as we will discuss,the principal issue here is whether the matters alleged in kaatz second amended complaint were subject to the validation statutes,thereby rendering the statute of limitations provided in those statutes applicable.this issue,in turn,is resolved through interpreting government code and the validation statutes.as such,the issue here is one of law requiring our independent review.planning conservation league department of water resources th,d planning conservation league ii 
we review the court order dismissing kaatz action with the above standard of review in mind.
k b bakewell motion to dismiss 
the essential position advanced in k b bakewell alternative motions to dismiss and for judgment on the pleadings was that kaatz claims were based on a challenge to the validity of the lda,executed in may.the city execution of the lda was a contract such that the city,as a local public agency,had the right to bring an action to determine the lda validity under former government code section,and under the validation statutes.therefore k b bakewell argued kaatz was required to have filed his complaint within days of the lda execution in may kaatz action filed in may was initiated nearly five years too late.as a fallback position,k b bakewell argued that if the suit were construed simply as a challenge to the city sale of the property,it would nonetheless be since the sale occurred in july,kaatz was required under sections through to have filed an action challenging the validity of the city action no later than september.
in opposing k b bakewell alternative motions,kaatz argued that the lda and subsequent deeding of the property by the city were not the kinds of public agency actions that were governed by the validation procedures specified in sections through.accordingly kaatz asserted,the action was not.
in the court lengthy ruling granting the motion to dismiss,it discussed the various authorities cited by the parties.it held that the validation procedures specified in sections through applied to the city challenged actions.the court holding was based upon the following reasoning unless contracts such as the lda were subject to the validation statutes,allowing for a prompt determination of such contract validity,the city ability to operate financially would be substantially impaired significant financial interests were affected by the lda,suggesting a need for prompt validation of the lda and the lda was a financing mechanism by which the city had acquired the property.
c.the validation statutes 
the validation statutes provide a procedure by which a public agency may determine the validity of certain acts.the public agency may bring a validating proceeding in superior court within days of the existence of any matter which under any other law is authorized to be determined pursuant to the validation statutes.such an action is in the nature of a proceeding in rem.ibid.and where the public agency does not initiate a validating proceeding under section,any interested person may bring an action within the time and in the court specified by section to determine the validity of such matter.the interested person must bring a validating proceeding within days no contest except by the public agency or its officer or agent of any thing or matter under this chapter shall be made other than within the time and the manner herein specified.thus,insofar as section provides that an interested person may bring a validating proceeding,the statute seems innocuous enough section says he must do so or be forever barred from contesting the validity of the agency action in a court of law.city of ontario superior court cal d,city of ontario.
hence,under the validation statutes,the public agency may initiate a proceeding to establish the validity of its act.alternatively,the agency may do nothing,in which case the act will become immune from attack if no interested person brings a proceeding to establish the act validity or invalidity within days.see friedland city of long beach th,d friedland validation statutes permit the public agency to validate its action by doing nothing and without giving notice,but agency may choose the more responsible first alternative of filing a validation proceeding.as the supreme court has observed a n agency may indirectly but effectively validate its action by doing nothing to validate it unless an interested person brings an action of his own under section within the period,the agency action will become immune from attack whether it is legally valid or not thus a statute which begins by providing a remedy to be pursued by public agencies,concludes by making it unnecessary for such agencies to do anything at all,and the incidental or derivative remedy of an interested person turns out to be controlling.this is truly a case of the tail wagging the dog.city of ontario,supra,cal d at.
the validation statutes do not specify the matters to which they appl y rather,their procedures apply to any matter which under any other law is authorized to be determined pursuant to this chapter.planning conservation league i,supra,cal th at,d.thus,we look to other statutes to determine the scope of public agency actions that are subject to validation under sections through.
one statutory source is government code section statute under which kaatz respondents contend was required to bring a timely validating proceeding here.government code section now subdivision a provides a local agency may bring an action to determine the validity of its bonds,warrants,contracts,obligations or evidences of indebtedness pursuant to the validation statutes.see also planning conservation league i,supra,cal th at,d.
there are numerous other statutes that provide for the validation of public agency actions by reference to sections through for instance,a validation action may be brought under government code section to determine the validity of a proposed annexation of territory under the local government reorganization act of,et.see embarcadero mun.improvement dist.county of santa barbara,supra,th at,d hills for everyone local agency formation com.d,fn.validation proceeding authorized under former.likewise,health and safety code section,subdivision a authorizes a proceeding under the validation statutes to determine the validity of establishing a local redevelopment agency,a redevelopment project,or bonds to be furnished in conjunction with such a project.see sweetwater valley civic city of national city cal d,bernardi city council th,d.and under water code section a validation action may be brought to determine the validity of the organization of an irrigation district.see clark fork reclamation dist.johns d.
applicability of validation statutes to second amended complaint 
introduction 
the fundamental question on appeal is whether the city actions that were challenged in the second amended complaint were matters that were subject to the validation statutes.more specifically,the issue is whether the city could have brought a validating proceeding concerning the execution of the lda and the sale of the property to k b thus kaatz,as an interested person,was required to do so by filing suit within days.if the city conduct was embraced by the language of government code,permitting the public agency to bring an action to determine the validity of its bonds,warrants,contracts,obligations or evidences of indebtedness pursuant to the validation statutes,then dismissal of the action was proper.the trial court itself acknowledged that this question was not easily resolved.
we begin our analysis by noting two points on which there is no disagreement.kaatz and respondents concur that not all public agency contracts are within the scope of government code section,not all such contracts are subject to the validation statutes.indeed,as discussed post,our supreme court made this point clear more than years ago.see city of ontario,supra,cal d at.for instance,a county contract retaining an attorney to provide legal services to indigent persons is not the kind of financial obligation contemplated to be automatically validated absent a challenge within the days proscribed in sections and.phillips seely,supra,d.similarly,in smith diablo unified sch,supra,d,the court held that a taxpayers suit challenging the validity of a school district contract to acquire a computer was not subject to the validation statutes.see also walters county of plumas d.walters action challenging award of franchises for collection and disposal of solid waste not subject to validation statutes.
not expressly admitted by the are no cases on point that have considered whether the kinds of contracts involved here,the lda and the conveyance of the property to k b bakewell are the types of public contracts that are subject to validation under government code section.specifically,no case has addressed whether an agreement calling for a public agency purchase and immediate resale of real property to a private party where the source of the funds for the agency acquisition is the subject to the validation statutes.moreover,no case has held generally that a public agency contract to acquire or sell real property is or is not a contract under government code section.
beyond these two undisputed points,the parties offer radically differing viewpoints on the scope of the word contracts in government code,as that issue bears upon whether the city actions here were subject to the validation statutes.because it contains our high court most comprehensive discussion of the validation statutes,we review city of ontario,supra,cal d,in some detail.
city of ontario superior court 
in city of ontario,supra,taxpayers challenged a plan for the financing of a motor raceway that included the issuance and sale by a nonprofit entity formed by the city of ontario ontario of in bonds without voter approval,the award of a contract to a private party without competitive bidding for the construction of the raceway for,and the lease of the raceway for years by the nonprofit entity to a entity that would run the facility as a private business venture.city of ontario,supra,cal d at.the plaintiffs essential claims were that the plan promoted a private commercial enterprise without any public benefit id.at,and was an unconstitutional gift of public funds or lending public credit for private purposes cal,art.xiii.id.at.after filing an answer,ontario moved to dismiss the complaint because the plaintiffs failed to comply with particular requirements for the service of summons under the validation statutes.ibid.the trial court denied the motion,impliedly finding that the plaintiffs claims were governed by the validation statutes but holding that the plaintiffs had shown good cause for failing to comply with the summons requirements.ibid.
ontario brought a writ of prohibition contending that the trial court had abused its discretion in denying the motion to dismiss,a position the supreme court rejected.city of ontario,supra,cal d at.in the course of determining that the trial court had not abused its discretion,the supreme court provided an extensive discussion of the validation statutes which is relevant to the present appeal 
s ections through were first enacted in.the legislation was proposed by the judicial council,which explained that it had been concerned for some years with the numerous statutes providing periods within which appeals may be taken at variance with the time for notice of appeal contained in the rules on appeal.citation.in particular,the council pointed to numerous scattered statutes authorizing actions by cities,counties,and public agencies to establish the validity of their bonds or assessments or the legality of their existence,and providing special procedures for appeals in such cases.city of ontario,supra,cal d at.thus,as the high court explained the historical context years later,the validation statutes were first enacted in,with the purpose of consolidating and harmonizing the various existing statutes providing special procedures for actions by cities,counties and public agencies to establish the validity of their bonds and assessments.planning conservation league i,supra,cal th at,d.
government code sections and were enacted in,two years after the enactment of the validation statutes.stats,ch.ontario argued that the use of the term contracts in government code section suggested that the validation statutes applied to any public agency contract.city of ontario,supra,cal d at.while conceding that the challenged raceway agreement facially appeared to be embraced by government code section because there was no limitation or qualification on the word contracts city of ontario,supra,at,the supreme court did not end its inquiry at that juncture.instead,it concluded that a closer examination of government code section suggested a much narrower construction of contracts for at least four reasons first,the legislative counsel digest characterized the measure as one allowing a local agency to bring an action to determine the validity of evidences of indebtedness.second,section was enacted as part of chapter of part,division,title,of the government code.chapter is entitled bonds,and deals exclusively with the power of local agencies to sell their bonds,replace defaced or lost bonds,and pledge their revenues to pay or secure such bonds.if government code section was intended to be a provision of general application,logically it should have been placed in article miscellaneous of chapter general of the same part,in which a group of such unrelated matters are collected.third,the key language of government code section bonds,warrants,contracts,obligations or evidences of indebtedness was taken directly from code of civil procedure section of chapter under canons of statutory interpretation,it should ordinarily be given the same meaning as it had in the earlier statute.but as a perusal of the companion legislation reveals,when the validation statutes were adopted they were made applicable only to such matters as the legality of the local entity existence,the validity of its bonds and assessments,and the validity of joint financing agreements with other agencies.if government code section was intended to reach any and all contracts into which an agency may lawfully enter,the restricted language of code of civil procedure section was inappropriate for that purpose.finally,that language is peculiarly inapt for expressing such a general meaning in any event,as it lists the word contracts in the midst of four other terms which all deal with the limited topic of a local agency financial obligations.city of ontario,supra,at.
in addition,the supreme court suggested that there were policy reasons for construing contracts in government code section more narrowly.in city of ontario,the court noted that a sweeping interpretation of the term contracts in that statute and the concomitant application of an abbreviated statute of limitations for potential challenges to virtually any governmental actions would unduly burden taxpayers presenting such challenges.city of ontario,supra,cal d at.
as we will discuss,the legislative history and statutory construction of government code section elucidated in city of ontario doom respondents arguments that the challenged actions of the city were subject to the validation statutes.accordingly,we will conclude that the court below erred in holding that the statute of limitations applicable for validating proceedings barred kaatz claims.
inapplicability of validation statutes to kaatz claims 
statutory construction 
we begin our analysis by noting that in statutory interpretation,where the language is clear,its plain meaning should be followed.citation.great lakes properties,city of el segundo cal d.thus,i f the language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature to interpret the statute.lungren deukmejian cal d.but this plain meaning rule does not prohibit a court from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose or whether such a construction of one provision is consistent with other provisions of the statute.ibid.
here,the parties have radically opposing views on the meaning of the term contracts in government code section.they agree,however,that contracts can not be interpreted to mean that all public agency contracts are subject to the validation statutes.and the supreme court noted that while a superficial reading of the statute suggested a broad interpretation of the unqualified term contracts city of ontario,supra,cal d at,a much narrower construction of the term was evoked upon closer examination id.at.clearly,the plain meaning rule does not apply and we are constrained to interpret government code section by reference to legislative intent and any other applicable rules of statutory construction.
it is a fundamental rule that a court should ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.moyer workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,see also in re rojas cal d.that intent may be revealed from a review of b oth the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment,fair employment housing com.cal d.the words of the statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.citations.ibid.and the contextual framework of a clause or sentence is particularly important when the statute contains a list or catalog of items,in which case a court determines the meaning of each by reference to the others,giving preference to an interpretation that makes the items similar in nature and scope.people fierro cal th,d.fn.omitted.and in the case of uncertainty,the court should consider the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.citation,supra,at.
purpose of the validation statutes 
government code section specifically references the validation statutes promulgated two years earlier and borrows from section the key language bonds,warrants,contracts,obligations or evidences of indebtedness city of ontario,supra,cal d at,that is at the heart of the present controversy.accordingly,we we infer the supreme court did in city of ontario the wider historical circumstances of government code section enactment,supra,cal d at,to include the legislative history and intent of the validation statutes.
in the context of enacting sections through,the judicial council had been concerned about the existence of numerous scattered statutes authorizing actions by cities,counties,and public agencies to establish the validity of their bonds or assessments or the legality of their existence,and providing special procedures for appeals in such cases.city of ontario,supra,cal d at,see also planning conservation league i,supra,cal th at,d.this focus is borne out by identifying the statutes specifically addressed by the validation statutes.laws that predated the validation statutes that were,in,either amended or were repealed and replaced to make specific reference to the validation statutes typically pertained to actions to test the validity of bonds assessments assessments or warrants or the existence of a governmental district or agency 
likewise,the validation statutes relationship to proceedings to test the validity of public agencies bonds or assessments or the legality of their existence city of ontario,supra,cal d at,was reaffirmed in legislation that incorporated the procedures of section through.those later statutes by and large concerned the validation of bonds assessments or the creation of districts 
moreover,the legislative history of amendments to the validation by the supreme court in planning conservation league i,supra,cal th,d,that the focal point of sections through was to ensure the ability of public agencies to obtain the timely validation of their bonds.section was amended in to add subdivision b to provide for an appeal period.stats,ch.this amendment thereby eliminated the possibility that an appeal made more than days after entry of judgment in a validating proceeding could be deemed timely.planning conservation league i,supra,at,d.as explained by the high court the amendment bill had a simple purpose to clarify the time within which an appeal may be taken in a validation proceeding,and thus accelerate the finality of these proceedings.citation.the senate committee analysis noted that validation actions are most commonly used to secure a judicial determination that a government entity proposed issuance of bonds is valid.the possibility of an appeal from the judgment validating the issue,together with california rules of court,rule a allowance of an appeal within days from entry of judgment if no notice is served or mailed,resulted in a lengthy period of uncertainty,during which underwriters and counsel often felt compelled to wait before issuing the bonds.citation.the amendment to section was proposed in order to reduce the period of uncertainty created by application of rule a to validation actions.citation.id.at,d,italics added.additionally,the amendment to section stats,ch,shortening further the appeal period under the validations statutes to days after the notice of entry of judgment.or,within days after the entry of the judgment if there is no answering party,subd.b was characterized at the time by the state department of finance as reduc ing the time it takes to get bond approval and proceed to market.citation.planning conservation league i,supra,at,d,see also ibid.holding that appealable order from validation proceeding was governed by same appeal period under,subd.b,because a contrary holding would result in uncertainty that could affect the confidence of others,bond buyers in the finality of the validation action.

we have considered the supreme court construction of government code based upon legislative history and other rules of interpretation.see city of ontario,supra,cal d at.in sum,the court identified four factors that suggested that the word contracts in the statute should be construed more narrowly than a reading that would make virtually all public agency contracts subject to the validation statutes the characterization of the proposed statute in the legislative counsel digest as permitting a local agency to bring an action to determine the validity of evidences of indebtedness id.at,the statute placement as part of chapter entitled bonds of part,division,title of the government code ibid.the fact that the relevant language of the statute bonds,warrants,contracts,obligations,or evidences of indebtedness was borrowed from section of the validation statutes,requiring that it be given the same meaning that it had in the earlier statute,the validation statutes were made applicable only to such matters as the legality of the local entity existence,the validity of its bonds and assessments,and the validity of joint financing agreements with other agencies city of ontario,supra,at,and the use of contracts surrounded by four terms made it peculiarly inapt for expressing such a general meaning id.at.
this fourth factor appears to be an application of the noscitur a sociis rule of construction.noscitur a sociis it is known by its associates is the principle that the meaning of a word may be enlarged or restrained by reference to the object of the whole clause in which it is used.citations.texas commerce bank garamendi th,fn,d.in other words,a word takes meaning from the company it keeps.people drennan th,d.in accordance with this principle of construction,a court will adopt a restrictive meaning of a listed item if acceptance of a more expansive meaning would make other items in the list unnecessary or redundant,or would otherwise make the item markedly dissimilar to the other items in the list.citation.people ex rel.lungren superior court cal th,d.here,we agree with the court in city of ontario that a narrower meaning of contracts is appropriate,in part because adopting a more expansive meaning would make the term markedly dissimilar to the other items,namely,bonds,warrants,obligations or evidences of indebtedness,subd.b see,english ikon business solutions,th,d applying noscitur a sociis to give narrow meaning to term dismissal in context of mandatory provisions affording party relief from default,default judgment,or dismissal under section,subd.b.
we also deem it of some significance that,since city of ontario,supra,cal d,was decided in,the legislature has not acted to modify in any way government code section to give a more expansive definition of the term contracts than its construction by the supreme court.see harris capital growth investors xiv cal d,supreme court generally presume s the legislature is aware of appellate court decisions.furthermore,the legislature has amended government code since.in,it added subdivision b to the statute but did not change the original text of the statute other than to insert subdivision a immediately before it.stats,ch.this fact suggests that the legislature had no quarrel with city of ontario restrictive interpretation of the term contracts.see marina point,wolfson cal d,w hen the legislature amends a statute without altering portions of the provision that have previously been judicially construed,the legislature is presumed to have been aware of and to have acquiesced in the previous judicial construction.furthermore,in the legislature addition of subsection b of government code section,it repeated the same language in the original statute that is at issue here,bonds,warrants,contracts see fn,ante.this fact further suggests the legislature concurrence with city of ontario earlier interpretation of the statute and,in particular,its interpretation of the term contracts.see city of long beach payne cal d,it is a rule of construction that after the courts have construed the meaning of any particular word,or expression,and the legislature subsequently undertakes to use these exact words in the same connection,the presumption is almost irresistible that it used them in the precise and technical sense which had been placed upon them by the courts.
moreover,it is clear that the legislature knows how to draft language that clearly provides a broad scope for matters embraced by the validation statutes.see generally,supra,cal d at,rejecting construction of statute as authorizing fair employment and housing commission to award punitive damages,where review of other statutes disclosed that when the legislature intends to authorize an agency to award damages for discrimination,it does so expressly.for example,a number of statutes expressly provide for proceedings under sections through to validate any action by the public agency.see,health,pub.resources code.likewise,various statutes refer to sections through to permit proceedings to determine the validity of any contract.see,pub.contract code.and,significantly,some of the statutes authorizing the testing of any contract by an action brought pursuant to the validation statutes were enacted before the enactment of government code section.see.
it is therefore clear that contracts under government code section should be assigned a restricted meaning.rather than authorizing proceedings to validate any public agency even any contract constituting a financial obligation of a public agency the contracts under government code are only those that are in the nature of,or directly relate to a public agency bonds,warrants or other evidences of indebtedness.we next examine whether,in light of this restricted meaning,the city execution of the lda was an action embraced by government code section.
the lda and the validation statutes 
the lda bears no relationship to the issuance of bonds.no bonds were issued or contemplated in connection with the proposed transaction under which the city would acquire hayes park and then resell it to k b bakewell.likewise,the lda does not relate to warrants.
we conclude further that the lda neither constituted nor related to evidence of public agency indebtedness.in the context of the validation statutes,the lda did not represent a transaction in which the city borrowed funds for a specific purpose,the acquisition of the property.the lda did not memorialize or otherwise describe an indebtedness incurred by the city.and we reject respondents contention to the contrary.in essence,respondents assert that because the city was not itself directly providing the funds for purchasing the instead was using a portion of the funds provided by k b bakewell in exchange for the city subsequent,immediate resale of the lda was a financing mechanism that was subject to the validation statutes.but neither the lda nor the resolution authorizing its execution spoke in terms of loaning funds or otherwise providing money to the city for its acquisition of the property.we believe that treating the lda as a financing agreement would be an unnatural characterization of the document.
respondents raise several additional arguments that the lda was subject to a validating proceeding.first,they contend that the supreme court distinguished between routine or public agency contracts that are not subject to the validation statutes,and those contracts that embody important policy decisions affecting the public at large.city of ontario,supra,cal d at.respondents argue that because the lda fell into the second category,it was governed by the validation statutes.city of ontario,however,does not establish such a test.a careful reading of the case discloses that the passage relied on by respondents was meant as an illustration of the breadth of public agency actions accomplished by contract,not as a statement that agency contracts are subject to the validation statutes if they embody important policy decisions affecting the public at large.id.at.further,as seen from our discussion,ante,nothing in the legislative history of either the validation statutes or government code section suggests that the legislature intended to provide for validation of public agency contracts where they were important or affect ed the public at large.moreover,we believe such a test would create an unworkable formula for determining whether an agency contract was subject to validation 
second,respondents assert that the lda was subject to the validation statutes because it was of such significance that the lack of a prompt validating procedure would impair the public agency ability to operate.walters,supra,d at.see also graydon pasadena redevelopment agency d.graydon.and they argue further that the absence of proceedings under the validation statutes here would impair a public agency ability to operate financially.friedland,supra,th,d.but while having a prompt validating procedure to permit a public agency to operate without impairment may be a significant rationale for the validation statutes application to agency action as provided in the statutes,the issuance of bonds,this rationale should not be transformed into a test for determining the type of agency action encompassed by government code section and the validation statutes.nothing in either city of ontario,supra,cal d,or the legislative history suggests that government code section should be construed to mean that contracts or obligations are governed by the validation statutes if a contrary conclusion would result in the impairment of the public agency ability to operate or to operate financially.such a proposed standard is unsupported by either the legislative history of the statute or the intent of the legislature.it is moreover a nebulous test,the application of which would result in uncertainty and inconsistent results based upon the extent to which individual judges might view a public agency ability to operate in a particular instance as impaired or not impaired by the absence of a validating proceeding.
third,respondents argue that because the lda concerned the city financial transaction with a third party,k b bakewell,it was thus subject to the validation statutes the genesis of this argument is apparently a statement in walters,supra,d.immediately following its reference to impair ment of the public agency ability to operate discussed,ante,the court noted we feel that the possibility of future litigation is very likely to have a chilling effect upon potential third party lenders.id.at.see also friedland,supra,th at,d one objective of validation statutes is to facilitate a public agency financial transactions with third parties by quickly affirming their legality.but if this were the standard,then any financial transaction between a public agency and a third party would be subject to the validation statutes,a proposition that is simply not true.see fn,ante,and cases cited therein.and the extent to which the nonapplication of the validation statutes may have a chilling effect upon a third party to a transaction with a public entity is not a standard for determining whether the public agency action is,in fact,of the type that is covered by sections through and government code section.as is true of the other tests advanced by respondents that we have discussed and rejected,the chilling effect standard is unsupported by statutory construction and is an impracticable formula.
moreover,the authorities upon which respondents rely do not suggest a different conclusion.for instance,in graydon,supra,d at.k b bakewell claimed at oral argument to be the principal case supporting its pasadena redevelopment agency sold approximately in tax allocation bonds to finance the public cost of a retail shopping development,which included buildings and parking garages one subterranean and two.the graydon plaintiffs challenged a component of that project,namely,the award and execution by the agency of a contract valued at approximately for construction of the subterranean garage,claiming that it was illegal because it was awarded without competitive bidding.id.at.the appellate court held that the action was subject to the validation statutes because,while it may not have been a direct challenge to the agency issuance of bonds to fund the project,the subterranean garage contract was an integral part of the whole method of financing the public costs associated with the retail center.the financing is by bonds issued by the agency.id.at.thus,the public agency action being challenged indirectly in graydon was a public financing arrangement these bonds were intimately and inextricably bound up with the award of this contract to construct the subterranean garage.id.at.the case before us involves no such challenge direct or indirect to a public financing arrangement.
in walters,supra,d,the court concluded that the claims challenging the bidding and awarding of franchises for the collection and disposal of solid waste were not subject to the validation statutes.id.at.but it held that sections through were applicable to the plaintiff claim challenging the county guaranty of the third party franchisees respective payment obligations for the purchase of heavy equipment.walters,supra,at.thus,walters is likewise factually distinguishable.unlike kaatz claims,the claim in walters that was subject to the validation statutes did,in fact,concern a direct commitment of public funds for a project,namely,the guarantee of third party obligations.and while respondents argue that the holding in walters supports a broad application of government code section a standard based on whether the lack of a prompt validating procedure will impair the public agency ability to operate walters,supra,at.we have previously rejected that assertion.
moreover,we disagree that respondents position is supported by friedland,supra,th,d,a case that concerned bonds and a substantial commitment of public funds relating to their issuance.in friedland,an aquarium project was being financed by the issuance of a nonprofit corporation revenue bonds in the amount of.id.at,d.the project included pledges of designated funds by two public agencies as security for payment of the debt service on the bonds.id.at,d.following the entry of judgment on a validation action brought by the entities to validate among other actions the pledges,the plaintiffs brought suit to invalidate the public actions.ibid.the court held that the pledges of public funds were proper subjects of the prior validation proceeding id.at,d and rejected the plaintiffs contention that,notwithstanding the statute of limitations under the validation statutes,they could raise constitutional challenges at any time id.at,d.
here,unlike friedland,there was neither a pledge of public funds nor a project involving bonds.and there was no prior action filed by the city to validate its execution of the lda.to the contrary,as kaatz argues,there is no evidence that the any time prior to joining in k b bakewell motion to dismiss more than six months after kaatz filed suit ever believed that the lda was subject to the validation statutes.there was no reference to potential validating proceedings in the lda.nor did the city raise the issue of the alleged failure to bring a timely validating proceeding in its opposition to kaatz application for preliminary injunction,or in its answer to the complaint.thus,friedland,supra,th,d,involved very different clear,substantial commitment of public funds as security for the issuance of bonds that had been the subject of prior validating the case before us.
furthermore,we reject the city claim that,based on language found in friedland,th at page,d,public agency contracts under government code section are subject to the validation statutes if they are contracts involving financing and financial obligations.nothing in friedland suggests that by financial obligations,the court meant that any financial obligation incurred by a public agency is subject to the validation statutes.such a suggestion would be unfounded since,as we have discussed see fn,ante,not all contracts that involve financial commitments by the agency are covered under the validation statutes.see phillips seely,supra,d at.
lastly,k b bakewell cites planning conservation league ii,supra,th,d,in support of its claim that the term contracts in government code section should be read broadly to include the lda.k b bakewell argues that the term contracts is not limited to public agency financing issues because those involved in planning conservation league ii were contracts affecting water supply and distribution in the f inancing was not the issue but the contracts clearly involved issue s of widespread public importance.but in that case,the controversy on appeal did not concern whether the plaintiffs claims were subject to the validation statutes.rather,the primary issues concerned whether the state department of water resources had abdicated its statutory duty to serve as the lead agency in preparing the environmental impact report eir,and whether the trial court had erred in finding the eir to have been sufficient.a secondary issue concerned whether the trial court had erred in granting summary adjudication of the validation cause of action on the basis that previously dismissed defendants were indispensable parties.the appellate court concluded that this ruling was error because an action pursuant to sections through is an in rem proceeding.planning conservation league ii,supra,at,d.no issue was raised by the parties or addressed by the court concerning whether the public agency action challenged by the plaintiffs was a proper subject for validation.therefore,planning conservation league ii,supra,th,d,offers no support for respondents contention that the lda was subject to the validation statutes.
conclusion 
based upon the foregoing,we conclude that the city conduct challenged in this execution of the lda and the city subsequent conveyance of the property to k b bakewell pursuant to that not matters embraced by the validation statutes and government code section.in so concluding,we note that there are competing policy considerations.on the one hand,respondents,as well as amici curiae argue that important matters such as a public agency acquisition and subsequent resale of a large tract of land should be the subject of prompt final resolution by application of the validation statutes.among the concerns is the risk that,absent the mechanism of prompt resolution that a validating proceeding provides,third parties such as developer k b bakewell would be unwilling to enter into a transaction such as the lda here.irrespective of this policy without offering an opinion here on its will not rewrite or interpret the validation statutes and government code section in a manner inconsistent with legislative history or intent,or in a way that is contrary to the rules of statutory construction.
we are also mindful of the competing policy concern militating against broad application of the validation statutes to render public agency actions incontestable.as the supreme court expressed in response to the potential application of government code section to all public agency contracts i f ontario construction of the word contract is correct,virtually every taxpayer has become an interested person with regard to virtually every action of a local public agency.it is unreasonable to assume that the members of such a large and amorphous group are likely to have prompt notice of each agency action affecting them.yet whether such a person has such notice or not,he is given only days in which to discover the existence,scope and effect of the agency action,to reach a conclusion as to its validity,to determine whether the agency has instituted a validating proceeding or imminently intends to do so,and if not,to prepare and file a proceeding of his own.in an age of increasingly complex government,this seems a heavy burden to impose on the vigilant taxpayer.city of ontario,supra,cal d at.we thus decline to interpret the validation statutes broadly insofar as they impose an abbreviated statute of limitations upon challenges to public agency actions,where the legislature has not intended to do so.see norgart upjohn cal th,d,to establish any particular limitations period under any particular statute of limitations entails the striking of a balance between the two public policies of applying time limits for filing actions to promote repose and the countervailing policy of having matters decided on their merits.to establish any such period under any such statute belongs to the legislature alone citation,subject only to constitutional constraints citation.
disposition 
the judgment entered on the order dismissing the second amended complaint is reversed.
all further statutory references are to the code of civil procedure unless otherwise indicated.
after the motion to dismiss was heard and decided,government code section was amended the text of the former statute that is at issue here remained unchanged but was designated as subdivision a in the amendment.see stats,ch.unless otherwise specified,we will refer to government code section as it existed before its amendment.
section reads in part an action to obtain a judgment,restraining and preventing any illegal expenditure of,waste of,or injury to,the estate,funds,or other property of a city of the state,may be maintained against any officer thereof,or any agent,or other person,acting in its behalf,either by a citizen resident therein,or by a corporation,who is assessed for and is liable to pay,or,within one year before the commencement of the action,has paid,a tax therein.
the action also named daniel keen as a defendant in his official capacity as city manager.city and keen were and are represented by the same counsel and their positions concerning the litigation do not diverge.we will therefore for simplicity refer to them collectively as the city.
in so ruling,the court found that there was a reasonable probability that kaatz would prevail on his claims that the city had violated the surplus land act,et,and government code section by selling the property for less than its fair market value.
in its kaatz argument that an injunction was needed to prevent the possibility that k b bakewell a limited liability corporation would dissipate the profits it had obtained from purchasing and developing the home a corporation listed on the new york stock exchange offered to guarantee any unsatisfied money judgment that might ultimately be entered against k b bakewell.
k b bakewell alternative motions to dismiss and for judgment on the pleadings attacked kaatz first amended complaint.the filing of k b bakewell motions predated the filing of kaatz motion for leave to file the proposed second amended complaint,wherein kaatz sought to amend the prayer.but at the hearing on k b bakewell alternative motions,all parties stipulated that kaatz could file the amended pleading and that the court could consider k b bakewell motions as applying to the second amended complaint.the second amended complaint did not alter the material allegations of the first amended complaint.

the legislature reaffirms its declaration that housing is of vital statewide importance to the health,safety,and welfare of the residents of this state and that provision of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every californian is a priority of the highest order.the legislature further declares that there is a shortage of sites available for housing for persons and families of low and moderate income and that surplus government land,prior to disposition,should be made available for that purpose,subd.a.any agency of the state and any local agency disposing of surplus land shall,prior to disposing of that property,send a written offer to sell or lease the property as follows a a written offer to sell or lease for the purpose of developing low and housing shall be sent to any loca
