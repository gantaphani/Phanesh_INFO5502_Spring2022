chrysler corporation appeals from three adverse tax court rulings that granted partial summary judgment to the commissioner of internal revenue.the disputed tax computations stem from the early to and involve substantial sums of potential tax liability.these rulings present the following questions under the accrual accounting method used by chrysler,was the company permitted to deduct anticipated warranty expenses in the year that it sold warranted motor vehicles to its dealers even though warranty claims had not necessarily been made was chrysler barred by the statutory limitations period from altering certain foreign tax credit elections did costs associated with the redemption of chrysler employee stock option plan esop constitute deductible capital expenditures 
this case essentially involves three discrete appeals.for that reason,we will abandon our usual practice of beginning our opinion with a generalized background section in favor of treating each issue individually,providing the necessary factual context in conjunction with our legal analysis.
deduction for anticipated warranty expenses 
in its opinion,the tax court framed the issue in these terms 
we must decide whether for federal income tax purposes all events necessary to determine petitioner liability for its warranty expenses have occurred when it sells its vehicles to its dealers in other words,has petitioner satisfied the first prong of the all events test entitling it to deduct its estimated future warranty costs on the sale of such vehicles 
chrysler comm r,wl,cch,ria.although discussed in more detail shortly,the all events test alluded to by the tax court provides as follows 
under an accrual method of accounting,a liability is incurred,and generally is taken into account for federal income tax purposes,in the taxable year in which all the events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability,the amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy,and economic performance has occurred with respect to the liability.
reg.a i.in this appeal,only the first prong of the the fact of the liability has been at issue.
the parties agree that this court reviews de novo a grant of summary judgment by the tax court roberts comm r,cir.
in tax years and,chrysler included deductions of and on its federal income tax returns on the basis that it incurred those amounts as warranty expenses for motor vehicles sold in those years to its dealers.a sale generally occurred when a vehicle was delivered to the carrier for shipment to the dealer.
new vehicle warranties,which are at issue here,cover defects in material and manufacture.as chrysler points out,state and federal laws regulate the entire warranty regime.specifically,the uniform commercial code,as adopted by virtually every state,state lemon laws,and the trade commission improvement act,impose warranty obligations on the seller.during the period at issue,every new vehicle sold by chrysler was covered by a warranty.when selling a new vehicle,dealers would provide buyers with a warranty manual that explained its terms and limitations.
chrysler offered two kinds of express warranty a basic warranty that applied to the first months or miles,and an extended warranty that covered certain types of repairs after the basic warranty had expired.in turn,chrysler contracted with its dealers to repair vehicles under warranty.typically,dealers would make repairs and then seek reimbursement from the company.however,dealers were required to comply with certain agreed upon procedures to substantiate their reimbursement requests that,if not followed,could result in.by chrysler had installed a computer system known as the dealer information access link dial,which an increasing number of dealers used to report warranty repairs that were subject to reimbursement.dial made it easier for chrysler to track and respond to warranty claims.
chrysler engaged consultant arthur little,to calculate the amount of warranty expenses the company incurred for tax years and.chrysler uses the accrual method of accounting and a tax year based upon the calendar year.it is undisputed that the expenses incurred by chrysler to fix conditions covered by warranty constitute ordinary and necessary business expenses under.during the period at issue,chrysler accrued the entire estimated cost of its warranties in the year that it sold the vehicles to the dealers.chrysler included this liability on its balance sheet and took it into account in the calculation of net book income.
the commissioner reduced chrysler warranty cost deduction for by,which had the ripple effect of increasing the company deduction for such costs by.
the tax court framed the legal question in these terms 
whether a business expense has been incurred so as to entitle an taxpayer to deduct it under section a is governed by the all events test as set out in united states anderson.in anderson,the supreme court held that a taxpayer was entitled to deduct from its income a tax on profits from munitions sales that took place in.although the tax would not be assessed and therefore would not formally be due until,all the events had occurred in to fix the amount of the tax and to determine the taxpayer liability to pay it 
u nder the regulations,the all events test has two prongs,each of which must be satisfied before accrual of an expense is proper.first,all the events must have occurred which establish the fact of the liability.second,the amount must be capable of being determined with reasonable accuracy.a,income tax regs.accrual of deductions c ii,income tax regs.accrual in general.for the purpose of deciding this motion,only the first prong of the test is relevant.for the purpose of the first prong of the test the supreme court has stated that the liability must be final and definite in amount,security flour mills commissioner,fixed and absolute,brown helvering,in order to be deductible.
chrysler,wl,cch,ria,citations and footnote omitted.
having set the legal stage,the court then examined and distinguished two supreme court opinions urged upon it by the parties united states hughes prop,d,and united states dynamics,d.because we agree that these cases are central to the resolution of this particular question,we find it useful to begin our discussion with reference to the construction given to them by the tax court 
chrysler places reliance on united states hughes properties,d,for the proposition that statutory liabilities satisfy the first prong of the all events test 
in hughes properties,the taxpayer was a nevada casino that was required by state statute to pay as a jackpot a certain percentage of the amounts gambled in progressive slot machines.the taxpayer was required to keep a cash reserve sufficient to pay the guaranteed jackpots when won.hughes properties at the conclusion of each fiscal year entered the total of the progressive jackpot amounts shown on the payoff indicators as an accrued liability on its books.from that total,it subtracted the corresponding figure for the preceding year to produce the current tax year increase in accrued liability.on its federal income tax return this net figure was asserted to be an ordinary and necessary business expense and deductible under section a.the court found that the all events test had been satisfied and the taxpayer was entitled to the deduction.the court reasoned that the state statute made the amount shown on the payout indicators incapable of being reduced.therefore the event creating liability was the last play of the machine before the end of the fiscal year,and that event occurred during the taxable year.
we conclude that the cases cited by chrysler do not strictly stand for the proposition that if a liability is fixed by statute,that fact alone meets the first prong of the all events test.rather we are of the opinion that the first prong of the all events test may be met when a statute has the effect of irrevocably setting aside a specific amount,as if it were to be put into an escrow account,by the close of the tax year and to be paid at a future date.in the instant case,the applicable statutes do not so provide.
the commissioner relies on the analysis contained in the supreme court opinion in united states general dynamics,d.in general dynamics,the taxpayer,who its employee medical plan,deducted estimated costs of medical care under the plan.the employer liability was determinable.the employees medical needs had manifested themselves,employees had determined to obtain treatment,and treatment had occurred.the only events that had not occurred were the employees filing claims for reimbursement before the end of the taxable year.the supreme court found that the all events test was not met until the filing of properly documented claims.the filing of the claim was the last event needed to create the liability and therefore absolutely fix the taxpayer liability under the first prong of the all events test.see id.at.
chrysler focuses on the fact that the liability in united states hughes properties,supra,was in part fixed by operation of statute and concludes from that the first prong of the all events test is satisfied if a statute in part works to fix the liability.we do not agree.in both hughes properties and general dynamics the supreme court focused on the last event that created the liability.in hughes properties the event creating liability was the last play of the machine before the end of the fiscal year.because the nevada statute fixed the amount of the irrevocable payout,that play crystalized or fixed absolutely the taxpayer liability,thus satisfying the first prong of the all events test.in general dynamics,the last event that created the liability was the employee filing the claim for reimbursement.
we are unable to find sufficient differences between the facts in general dynamics and those of the instant case to justify departing from the supreme court analysis.here,as in general dynamics,the last event fixing liability does not occur before the presenting of a claim,either a claim for warranty service by the customer through one of petitioner dealers or a claim for reimbursement made on petitioner by the dealer.
id.footnotes and citations omitted.
as the decision of the tax court makes clear,the central issue on appeal is precisely what a taxpayer must do in order to establish liability with sufficient certainty to satisfy the first prong of the all events test.we would be less than candid if we did not acknowledge a degree of sympathy with justice observation in general dynamics that t he circumstances of this case differ little from those in hughes properties.dynamics,at.dissenting.however,given that the court reached the opposite result in successive terms when faced with similar sets of facts,we must do our best to distinguish the two cases.as did the tax court,we see no viable way of reconciling hughes properties with general dynamics other than by reading the former to stand of the proposition that t he first prong of the all events test may be met when a statute has the effect of irrevocably setting aside a specific amount by the close of the tax year and to be paid at a future date.chrysler comm r,supra.the court in general dynamics held that the last link in the chain of events creating liability for purposes of the all events test was the actual filing of a medical claim.dynamics,at.it based its reasoning on the fact that general dynamics was liable to pay for covered medical services only if properly documented claims forms were filed.id.at.
like general dynamics,chrysler faces potential liability,which in its case is based upon the express and implied warranties that accompany the sale of its motor vehicles.however,that liability does not become firmly established until a valid warranty claim is submitted.as the court explained,nor may a taxpayer deduct an estimated or an anticipated expense no matter how statistically certain,if it is based on events that have not occurred by the close of the taxable year.dynamics at.citing brown helvering.the court distinguished the code treatment of insurance by to deduct reserves for incurred but not reported its treatment of companies restrained from deducting claims that are actuarially likely but not yet reported.id.at.we assume that the dial software made it easier for chrysler to track and process warranty claims it may also have assisted arthur little in calculating the cost to the company of future claims.however,even if those claims were predictable with relative accuracy,they were not actually submitted during the taxable year and therefore can not be deducted because they remain anticipated expenses.see id.at.based on actuarial data,general dynamics may have been able to make a reasonable estimate of how many claims would be filed b ut that alone does not justify a deduction.
in reaching this conclusion,we readily acknowledge that chrysler has raised a number of thoughtful points.first among them is the contention that the anticipated warranty claims at issue should be analyzed with reference to the second prong of the all events test,that is,whether the amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy.despite its surface appeal,this argument fails to recognize that it is not the imprecise amount of the claims that renders them but their contingent nature.while chrysler relies in part upon the existence of statutes,such as,to establish the fact of its liability,they impose legal duties with respect to warranties but do not necessarily fix liability.among other things,prescribes the contents of warranties,and remedies available to consumers who seek to enforce their terms.however,simply because a manufacturer has provided a warranty to a consumer,the scope of which is defined to a some degree by statute,does not mean that liability has attached until a claim has been filed invoking the terms of a warranty,liability remains contingent and,because of that fact.
the parties have cited numerous cases to us in their briefs.that we have declined to discuss them here should not be taken as a sign that they have not been fully considered.rather,it means that,like the tax court,we conclude that this issue hinges upon our construction of hughes properties and,more importantly,general dynamics.for the reasons just outlined,we detect no material distinction between general dynamics and the case before us.consequently,we affirm the judgment of the tax court.
foreign tax credits 
chrysler experienced dire financial difficulties in the late and early.in the tax years through,it reported no taxable domestic income and paid no taxes to the united states.however,it did pay foreign taxes during that period.rather than elect to take a credit for foreign taxes paid,a,chrysler took a tax deduction,a,for those years.these deductions were substantial and.
on july,the commissioner informed chrysler of tax deficiencies for the years and.in an attempt to reduce that liability,the company filed amended tax returns on july,for the years through.at the time that it filed those amended returns,only years through were open for purposes of assessment of tax by the commissioner or for a claim of credit or refund by chrysler.nonetheless,chrysler sought to amend its through returns to change the foreign tax deductions to foreign tax credits,which could then be carried forward to its tax liabilities for and.
in his notice of deficiency,the commissioner advised the company that to the extent your claims are attributable to foreign tax credit carryforwards from the years ended december,december,and december,the statute of limitations for making a timely election to claim foreign tax credit has expired and those carryforwards are not allowable.in response,chrysler filed a petition with the tax court.
three provisions of the internal revenue code come into play for purposes of this appeal.the first provides as follows 
a allowance of the taxpayer chooses to have the benefits of this subpart,the tax imposed by this chapter shall,subject to the limitation of section,be credited with the amounts provided in the applicable paragraph of subsection b plus,in the case of a corporation,the taxes deemed to have been paid under sections and.such choice for any taxable year may be made or changed at any time before the expiration of the period prescribed for making a claim for credit or refund of the tax imposed by this chapter for such taxable year 
a emphasis added.it is undisputed that the limitations period set forth in d a applies to a.this section provides as follows 
special rules relating to foreign tax credit.
a special period of limitation with respect to foreign taxes paid or the claim for credit or refund relates to an overpayment attributable to any taxes paid or accrued to any foreign country for which credit is allowed against the tax imposed by subtitle a in accordance with the provisions of section in lieu of the period of limitation prescribed in subsection a,the period shall be years from the date prescribed by law for filing the return for the year with respect to which the claim is made.
d a emphasis added the final statutory section that comes into play is c,which was added to the internal revenue code in in order to allow taxpayers to carry forward or carry back portions of a foreign tax credit that could not be used in the tax year for which they were originally claimed 
carryback and carryover of excess tax amount by which all taxes paid or accrued to foreign countries or possessions of the united states for any taxable year for which the taxpayer chooses to have the benefits of this subpart exceed the limitations under subsection a shall be deemed taxes paid or accrued to foreign countries or possessions of the united states in the second preceding taxable year,in the first preceding taxable year,and in the first,second,third,fourth,or fifth succeeding taxable years,in that order such amount deemed paid or accrued in any year may be availed of only as a tax credit and not as a deduction and only if the taxpayer for such year chooses to have the benefits of this subpart as to taxes paid or accrued for that year to foreign countries or possessions of the united states.
the united states court of claims addressed the same question that faces us some years ago,which it framed in these terms w hether in cases where there has been a carryover of foreign taxes under section c,the limitations period of section d a commences with the date prescribed by law for filing the return for the year from which the excess foreign taxes are carried,or with the date prescribed by law for filing the return for the year to which the excess foreign taxes are carried.ampex united states,emphasis original.in other words,do the phrases such taxable year as used in a and year with respect to which the claim is made as used in d a mean the year in which the foreign taxes are paid and the right to claim a credit accrues or,do they refer to the year in which the foreign tax credit is to be applied if the latter interpretation is correct,then chrysler meets the limitations period because it sought in to apply the foreign tax credits to its return.if the former construction holds,then chrysler is precluded from amending because the years in which the tax credits accrued through fall outside the limitations period.
the tax court reached the following conclusion 
section a allows a taxpayer such as chrysler to elect to credit income taxes owed to a foreign country in lieu of deducting them under section a.the commissioner argues that chrysler election was untimely.the commissioner asserts that the phrases for any taxable year and for such taxable year that appear in section a refer to chrysler,and taxable years rather than chrysler taxable year.chrysler argues that its election was timely.because section c allows a taxpayer to carry over a foreign tax credit for up to years,chrysler asserts,section a,when read in the light of section d a,generally allows a taxpayer up to years to elect or change its election under section a.chrysler concludes that the relevant phrases refer to the year for which the overpayment is claimed on account of the foreign taxes here.chrysler asserts that its conclusion comports with congress intent for section a,to avoid subjecting a taxpayer foreign earnings to taxation by both the foreign country and the united states,and that its conclusion is consistent with the application of section d a.
we agree with the commissioner that the period under section a is measured from the years for which chrysler elected the foreign tax credits,and.we read the phrase for such taxable year to refer to the any taxable year specified at the beginning of the same sentence,or,in other words,to the year for which the election of the foreign tax credit is made.the only other time that congress used the word such in section a it did so to refer to the choice made by the taxpayer described in the first sentence of section a.we believe it logical to conclude that congress use of the second such,the one at issue,refers to the only taxable year described in section a namely,the year for which the election of the foreign tax credit is made.
our reading comports with the commissioner regulations prescribed under section a.section d,income tax,provides that the taxpayer may,for a particular taxable year,claim the benefits of section or claim a deduction in lieu of a foreign tax credit at any time before the expiration of the period prescribed by section d a.here,chrysler aims to claim the benefits of section for,and and not for.the benefits which chrysler is attempting to avail itself of in are the benefits of section c.
we hold that chrysler elections for,and were untimely.accordingly,we will grant the commissioner motion for partial summary judgment.

chrysler reminds us that the underlying purpose of the statutory scheme governing foreign tax credits,which had its genesis in the revenue act of,stat,is to mitigate the evil of double taxation.burnet chicago portrait.see also ampex,at discussing history of foreign tax credit hart united states,noting inconsistencies between legislative history and language of statutes at issue.when construing a legislative enactment,we must give effect to the intent of the legislature adopting the statute in question.broadcast music,roger miller music,cir,cert.denied.while statutes imposing a tax are generally construed liberally in favor of the taxpayer,limited,at citing weingarden comm r,cir,those granting a deduction are matters of legislative grace and are strictly construed in favor of the government.intermet,at also citing weingarden at burroughs adding mach.terwilliger,cir the right to the foreign tax credit claimed is a privilege granted by the government,and hence the statute is to be strictly construed in favor of the government.but see gentsch goodyear tire rubber,cir rejecting strict construction because r elief from double taxation is not so much an act of grace as one of justice.
turning to the task at hand,we note that legislative intent should be divined first and foremost from the plain language of the statute.broadcast music,at limited,at.if the text of the statute may be read unambiguously and reasonably,our inquiry is at an end.limited at accord united states boucha,cir t he language of the statute is the starting point for interpretation,and it should also be the ending point if the plain meaning of that language is clear quoting united states choice,cir.only when our reading results in ambiguity or leads to an unreasonable result,may we look to the legislative history.limited at.finally,we must construe a statute as a whole and,in so doing,we must strive to interpret provisions so that other provisions in the statute are not rendered inconsistent,superfluous,or meaningless.broadcast music at.
with these precepts in mind,we turn to the statutes in question,beginning with a,the provision generally authorizing foreign tax credits.the critical sentence reads,such choice for any taxable year may be made or changed at any time before the expiration of the period prescribed for making a claim for credit or refund of the tax imposed by this chapter for such taxable year.chrysler concedes that the initial reference to any taxable year means the year in which the initial election was made.like the tax court,we agree that the subsequent modifier such must refer to something already alluded this case the year in which the taxpayer elected to claim a foreign tax credit.
if a existed in isolation,that would end the matter.however,as mentioned earlier,it is undisputed that the period prescribed for making a claim for credit or refund incorporates the limitations period set forth in d a.that provision establishes a window for the taxpayer to claim a credit for the year with respect to which the claim is made.in our view,the most reasonable reading of these two statutes is that the such taxable year of a and the year with respect to which the claim is made of d a refer to the same year the year in which the taxpayer first made its election whether to claim a foreign tax credit.we recognize that the court of claims has reached a different conclusion.ampex,at i f the time of the commencement of the limitations period of section d a is to be determined solely on the basis of the language of that section,the limitations period begins to run on the date prescribed by law for filing the return for the year for which a refund is sought.in our view,however,nothing in the language of d a alters our initial reading of a,which fixes the year in question as the year of election.all that d a provides to the taxpayer is a longer limitations period for altering its election of a foreign tax credit than the limitations period prescribed by a.the touchstone for triggering the statute of limitations remains the original year of election.
lastly,we must consider whether c,which authorizes a taxpayer to either carry over or carry back its application of a foreign tax credit,affects our analysis.we conclude that it does not.section c simply enhances the ability of taxpayers to take full advantage of their foreign tax credits by allowing them to apply credits that can not be used in the year of election to other years within a prescribed range.if,as in chrysler case,the taxpayer did not pay enough taxes to the united states to make full use of its foreign tax credit in the year of election,c provides an additional period to do so.under those conditions,the internal revenue code allows the taxpayer to deem the foreign taxes paid in a year other than the one in which they were actually paid.we see nothing in the language of c,however,to suggest that the limitations period of d a refers to the year that the foreign tax is deemed paid.to the contrary,when read together,the three statutory provisions set forth an unambiguous scheme for claiming and taking foreign tax credits.section a requires the taxpayer to elect to decline to foreign tax credit in the year the foreign tax is paid.section d a then allows the taxpayer a period from this initial election to amend its election.finally,c provides a way to increase the likelihood that a taxpayer can take full use of its foreign tax credits by either carrying back or carrying forward unused credits to other tax years.however,it has no effect on the limitations period,which runs from the tax year that the foreign tax was actually paid and the credit accrued.
because the statutes at issue may be read unambiguously and reasonably,limited,at,we need not resort to legislative history.as the court of claims has noted,the normal understanding of the bare language that is entitled to prevail does not necessarily exclude all possibility of an alternative reading that refined and subtle legal analysis might invent.hart,at punctuation altered.moreover,as hart,ampex,and the parties themselves concede,the legislative history accompanying these statutes is often inconsistent and not overly enlightening.see,hart,at.
before concluding,we will take a moment to mention four considerations that lend additional support to our reading of the statutes.first,we agree with chrysler that congress permits the use of foreign tax credits in order to allow taxpayers to avoid double taxation.however,chrysler did not come away because it initially elected not to take foreign tax credits for the years in question it claimed deductions based upon those foreign taxes and,presumably,there were valid accounting reasons for its choice.that it was dilatory in seeking to amend its returns in order to claim foreign tax credits for the years in dispute does not alter the fact that it received some tax benefit for foreign taxes paid.second,that congress passed clarifying language to the phrase of in amending for the year with respect to which the claim is made to for the year in which such taxes were actually paid suggests that our reading is correct.see footnote,supra.third,our reading avoids the uncertainty that would attend chrysler interpretation,which could lead to a shorter or longer limitations period depending on the unique fiscal circumstances of the taxpayer and,fourth,we are obliged to strictly construe statutes that grant a deduction to a taxpayer in favor of the government.weingarden,at.
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the judgment of the tax court,and hold that the statute of limitations period of d a begins with the date prescribed by law for filing the return for the year from which the excess foreign taxes are carried.ampex,at.
employee stock ownership plan 
the tax court framed the third and final issue as follows 
w hether chrysler corporation may deduct for amounts it paid to redeem its common stock held in the employee stock ownership trust esot underlying the chrysler employee stock ownership plan esop.
chrysler comm r,wl,ria.
the facts giving rise to this dispute are relatively straightforward and were summarized by the tax court as follows 
chrysler was faced with an economic crisis in that resulted in congress enacting the chrysler corporation loan guarantee act of lga,stat.on chrysler behalf by way of the lga,congress provided chrysler with up to billion in loan guarantees in return for chrysler satisfaction of certain conditions.
two of the conditions required that employees of chrysler and its subsidiaries and affiliates make at least million in wage and benefit concessions and that chrysler set up an employee stock ownership plan meeting the requirements of both sections a qualified deferred compensation plans and e employee stock ownership plans.two other conditions required that chrysler establish the esot within the rules of section a and that chrysler contribute shares of its common stock to the esot over a period from through.in each of those years,chrysler was required to contribute to the esot chrysler common stock with a value of at least million during that period,chrysler was required to contribute to the esot a total of at least million of its common stock.
pursuant to the lga,chrysler established the esop effective july,and funded the esot by issuing to it new shares of chrysler common stock during each of the esot fiscal years ended june,through.pursuant to the terms of the esop,employees could participate in the plan if they had worked for chrysler or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates for continuous months at the beginning of the plan year and been affected by the wage and benefit concessions required by the lga.chrysler established the esop to satisfy the lga requirement for obtaining the federal government loan guarantees,compensate employees for wage and benefit concessions,and contribute to chrysler financial recovery and viability by enhancing employee motivation and increasing productivity.
chrysler contributed million shares of its common stock to the esot from through.chrysler contributed approximately of that dollar amount in each of the years and claimed a deduction for the market value of the contributed shares for the years in which the contributions were made.the contributed shares amounted to approximately percent of chrysler outstanding shares at the end of,and the esot held the largest single block of chr
