in this case of first impression,we hold that the tax injunction act,applies to the international fuel tax agreement ifta,a taxation program in which one state collects taxes imposed by other states.we further hold that a taxpayer has a plain,speedy and efficient remedy within the meaning of the tax injunction act so long as it may obtain a full and fair hearing in the courts of the state whose tax that taxpayer challenges.accordingly,we affirm the decision of the district court,which held that the tax injunction act deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction to hear this claim that ifta precludes oregon collection of certain fuel taxes.
background 
oregon participation in ifta.
the international fuel tax agreement is a agreement that is intended to encourage cooperation in the administration and collection of motor fuel use tax.dispatch.dep t of state revenue.quoting indep.drivers ass state.ifta itself imposes no taxes.rather,its member jurisdictions impose the motor fuel taxes,and ifta permits the uniform administration and collection of those taxes as they pertain to carriers.id.at.under ifta,an interstate motor carrier pays all its state fuel taxes quarterly to the base jurisdiction in which it registers as a licensee under ifta the base jurisdiction then forwards the appropriate tax amounts to each individual state in which the motor carrier operates.that arrangement prevents a motor carrier from having to make multiple tax payments to the different states in which it operates.id.at.
ifta provisions for obtaining a refund are somewhat more complicated.pursuant to ifta article viii,a licensee must submit claims for refund for tax paid on fuel directly to the respective jurisdiction.thus,a licensee must file a request for a refund from each jurisdiction in which it paid taxes on fuel.at the same time,the base jurisdiction shall allow credits and issue refunds for all of its licensees on behalf of all member jurisdictions for fuel used outside the jurisdiction where the fuel was purchased.ifta art.xi.thus,the proper procedure for obtaining a refund for fuel taxes depends in part on the type of refund claim at issue.
federal law requires all states that have a reporting requirement to conform those requirements to ifta.thus,federal law mandates participation in ifta for all states that impose a fuel tax.the provisions of ifta itself,however,are not federal law.rather,ifta articles of agreement and audit and procedures manuals are the product of the international fuel tax association,a private organization made up of representatives chosen by the continental states and the ten canadian provinces that have entered into ifta.ifta art.xv.ifta articles of agreement govern the administration and amendment of ifta.
by statute,oregon has authorized the oregon department of transportation odot to enter into an international fuel tax agreement with jurisdictions outside of this state to provide for cooperation and assistance among member jurisdictions in the administration and collection of taxes imposed on motor carriers for the consumption of all fuels used in vehicles operated interstate.in turn,odot has promulgated regulations adopting the provisions contained in ifta articles of agreement and certain ifta manuals,and odot has applied them to motor carriers.or.admin.thus,ifta has the force of law in oregon,and motor carriers can use the state as their base jurisdiction under ifta.
unlike the other states that participate in ifta,however,oregon does not itself impose a fuel tax on interstate motor carriers operating in the state.instead,oregon relies on a complicated tax system.as the sole member jurisdiction in ifta that receives no fuel taxes from other base jurisdictions,oregon participation in ifta does not generate revenue for the state rather,oregon participates in ifta as a service to motor carriers operating outside the state.if oregon did not participate in ifta,an motor carrier would be forced either to select another base jurisdiction or to purchase a permit every time its trucks operated in another state reliance on permits would place a substantial burden on motor carriers,placing them at a significant disadvantage relative to interstate motor carriers based in other jurisdictions.
procedural background.
the state administrative proceedings.
plaintiff may trucking company is an interstate motor carrier with its principal place of business in brooks,oregon.plaintiff owns approximately tractors and trailers that operate throughout the continental united states.in,odot mailed to plaintiff a notice of assessment covering the period april,through december.the assessment determined that plaintiff had underpaid fuel taxes and thus owed in taxes calculated under ifta.in a pair of administrative proceedings,plaintiff disputed the assessment of taxes owed under ifta 
in addition to challenging odot auditing procedures,plaintiff argued that fuel consumed while idling was not taxable under ifta.plaintiff based that argument on ifta article viii,which states that t he consumption of motor fuels used in the propulsion of qualified motor vehicles,except fuel consumed that is exempt from taxation by a jurisdiction,is the taxable event under this agreement.emphasis added.plaintiff argued that,because fuel consumed while idling does not actually propel the vehicle,idling time is not a taxable event within the meaning of ifta.plaintiff separately argued that fuel consumed while idling is exempt under various member states statutes and it is entitled to seek a refund based on those exemptions from oregon,the base jurisdiction.plaintiff thus sought a refund for all fuel consumed by its while idling.in addition to mounting that specific challenge,plaintiff also contested,under various state and federal laws,the validity of oregon adoption of ifta.
in a proposed order filed on july,an administrative law judge alj concluded that odot audit of plaintiff fuel records was unreasonable and that the idling time issue was not ripe for adjudication.the parties ultimately settled their dispute with respect to the auditing procedures and stipulated that the sole remaining issue in the administrative appeal was the proper tax treatment of fuel consumed while idling.in a proposed order filed on march,the alj concluded that fuel consumed while idling is taxable under ifta.the alj also held that plaintiff,by stipulating that the remaining issue in the administrative appeal was the idling issue,had waived its and constitutional arguments.
the alj conclusions with respect to assessed fuel taxes for the period between april and december were adopted in a final order issued on july.that order held that fuel consumed while idling was taxable under ifta,noting that e very appellate court that has considered the argument that petitioner makes here has rejected it.the order also concluded that,to the extent that idling time fuel was under the statutes of various member jurisdictions,plaintiff must file its request directly with the respective jurisdictions as required by ifta article viii.
a separate final order reached the same conclusion with respect to plaintiff amended ifta returns for.plaintiff timely appealed both rulings to the oregon court of appeals,pursuant to oregon revised statute section.on plaintiff motion,the two cases were consolidated.
district court proceedings.
while its consolidated case was pending before the oregon court of appeals,plaintiff filed the present action in the district court of oregon.in its amended federal complaint,which sought both declaratory relief and a refund,plaintiff claimed that it was entitled to a refund for fuel consumed while idling and that it had no adequate or speedy remedy at law.in addition,plaintiff argued that ifta itself was illegal,invalid,and unenforceable under the united states constitution,as well as improperly adopted,improperly implemented,and improperly delegated to administrative bodies by both the united states congress and the oregon legislature.
the state sought dismissal of the action on three bases,arguing that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the tax injunction act the act,the eleventh amendment,and the abstention doctrine.the district court held that dismissal of the action was proper under both the act and younger abstention.the district court also concluded that the eleventh amendment barred plaintiff suit but that,i f jurisdiction were not already precluded by the tax injunction act,the court would allow plaintiff to amend its complaint to name an individual defendant.accordingly,the court granted the state motion and dismissed the action with prejudice.
plaintiff timely appealed the district court dismissal of the action with prejudice.

discussion 
the tax injunction act states simply that a district court shall not enjoin,suspend or restrain the assessment,levy or collection of any tax under state law where a plain,speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such state.plaintiff makes three basic arguments regarding the applicability of the act in this case.first,plaintiff argues that the act does not apply when a state collects taxes that it does not itself impose,particularly when that state does not provide a refund remedy for the taxes that it collects on behalf of other jurisdictions.second,plaintiff argues that it does not have a plain,speedy and efficient remedy because,under the state interpretation of ifta,plaintiff is not entitled to a refund from its base jurisdiction for taxes on fuel consumed while idling and therefore must seek refunds from many state courts.finally,plaintiff argues that its request for declaratory relief and a refund in the district court does not enjoin,suspend or restrain state tax collection.we address each argument in turn,but find none persuasive.
a.the tax injunction act applies to taxes collected under ifta.
the purpose of the act is implicated by taxation programs.
congress enacted the tax injunction act to protect the compelling needs of many states for a more prompt disposition of tax controversies,at.congress also expressed some concern regarding the increased costs that states would bear if forced to defend the imposition of state taxes in federal,rather than state,courts.cong.rec.as the supreme court recently explained,
the act had two closely related,objectives to eliminate disparities between taxpayers who could seek injunctive relief in federal corporations asserting diversity taxpayers with recourse only to state courts,which generally required taxpayers to pay first and litigate later and to stop taxpayers,with the aid of a federal injunction,from withholding large sums,thereby disrupting state government finances.
hibbs winn,d.
plaintiff argues that those twin objectives are not implicated here because oregon itself does not collect fuel taxes.therefore,permitting a federal action will not result in a temporary delay or permanent loss of revenue to oregon.however,that argument fails to consider the fact that permitting plaintiff to challenge the collection of taxes under ifta in federal court will disrupt revenue collection in every one of the other states that rely on fuel taxes.
more importantly,plaintiff cramped construction runs counter to the supreme court interpretation of the act as a broad jurisdictional barrier.arkansas farm credit servs.of cent,d emphasis added quoting moe confederated salish kootenai tribes of flathead reservation,d.the act is first and foremost a vehicle to limit drastically federal district court jurisdiction to interfere with so important a local concern as the collection of taxes.id.at.quoting california grace brethren church,d.
in grace brethren church,the supreme court held that the act barred federal subject matter jurisdiction over a challenge to a state unemployment tax imposed under a cooperative scheme to provide benefits to unemployed workers.at.although grace brethren church gave little attention to the cooperative or aspect of the case,we later relied on that decision to hold that the act applies with equal force to joint taxation programs and pure state tax programs.hawaiian.haw.dep t of labor indust.relations,cir.in so doing,we rejected the plaintiff argument that the comity concerns underlying the state tax injunction act are lessened when a state tax scheme contains a federal statutory ingredient.id.
although neither grace brethren church nor hawaiian telephone conclusively resolves the issue of the act applicability to taxation programs involving only states,those cases are instructive.if the concerns that animate the act are sufficient to warrant its jurisdictional bar in cases involving joint taxation programs,it follows that those concerns suffice to warrant the act application to programs in which the federal government plays little part.the act application more properly turns on whether a state revenue generation will be hindered by a federal court action,rather than on which state revenue is at issue.
that focus is consistent with the court recent decision in hibbs,which clarified that the act bars actions in federal court that seek to impede a state receipt of tax revenues.at emphasis added.the act did not apply to the action brought by the plaintiffs in that case because that action,if successful,would result in the state receiving more funds that could be used for the public benefit.id.at quoting winn killian,cir.after hibbs,the dispositive question in determining whether the act jurisdictional bar applies is whether f relief would have operated to reduce the flow of state tax revenue.id.at.when a challenge to a collection of state taxes would operate to interrupt or reduce the flow of several states tax revenues,it appears even more likely that the act precludes federal jurisdiction over that challenge than where the flow of taxes to only one state is at stake.
we further note that congress itself,although belatedly and somewhat obliquely,has addressed this issue.in,which addresses civil enforcement actions to ensure state compliance with ifta,congress expressly contemplated that such actions would be subject to the act.in its entirety,provides 
a civil request of the secretary of transportation,the attorney general may bring a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce compliance with sections and of this title.
b action under this section may be brought only in the state in which an order is required to enforce compliance.
c to section of title,the court,on a proper showing 
shall issue a temporary restraining order or a preliminary or permanent injunction and 
may require by the injunction that the state or any person comply with sections and of this title.
a c emphasis added.
thus,to construe the act as exempting taxation programs such as ifta from its coverage is inconsistent not only with the act overriding purposes,but also with the federal legislation enforcing compliance with ifta provisions we therefore hold that nothing about the nature of ifta exempts challenges to the state taxes imposed under that agreement,or the agreement itself,from the act jurisdictional bar.
the act applies so long as a party has a remedy in the courts of the state whose law that party challenges.
plaintiff second argument presents a narrower question of statutory interpretation.focusing on the repetition of the term state in the text of the statute,plaintiff contends that the tax injunction act bars federal jurisdiction only if the state that collects taxes also provides a remedy for all taxes that it collects.thus,plaintiff argues,because the act proscribes federal jurisdiction over actions that interfere with the assessment,levy or collection of any tax under state law only if a remedy may be had in the courts of such state,the act jurisdictional bar comes into play only if oregon provides a refund remedy for taxes imposed by all the other jurisdictions.emphasis added.we disagree.
plaintiff argument rests on the assumption that the phrases such state and under state law refer to the state whose law controls the assessment,levy or collection of a tax.that is by no means the only plausible reading of the statute.the canons of statutory construction include the principle that r eferential and qualifying phrases,where no contrary intention appears,refer solely to the last antecedent.longview fibre rasmussen,cir quoting singer,construction ed.accordingly,in the absence of a contrary legislative intent,we would conclude that state law and such state qualify any tax,meaning that the act applies so long as plaintiff may seek a remedy in the courts of the states that actually impose fuel taxes.at the very least,the statute is ambiguous with respect to this interpretive issue.where the language is not dispositive,we look to the congressional intent revealed in the history and purposes of the statutory scheme.united states buckland,cir en banc quoting adams fruit barrett,d.thus,we turn to other sources for what illumination they may provide.
aside from its general concern with protecting state revenues,congress viewed the act as a mechanism for steering challenges to state tax laws into state courts 
when a state question arises under a state statute,why not let the courts of that state settle that controversy,whether the controversy is between citizens of one state or citizens of two different states why not be logical and let the state courts try controversies arising under state laws within their borders.
cong,at quoting the johnson act legislative history in grace brethren church,the court made clear that even when a challenge to a state tax raises federal questions,those challenges nonetheless properly belong in a state court,because the federal constitutional issues are likely to turn on questions of state tax law,which,like issues of state regulatory law,are more properly heard in the state courts.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
in other words,the act furthers two distinct comity concerns.first,t he act is a gesture of comity toward states recognizing the centrality of tax collection to the operation of government,the act prevents taxpayers from running to federal court to stymie the collection of state taxes.wright pappas,cir.second,recognizing that challenges to state tax laws are more properly heard in the state courts,the act ensures that state courts are able to entertain challenges to their own tax laws in the first instance.grace brethren church,at.
in the ordinary case,the act gesture of comity will yield a clear result because the same state law will provide for the assessment,levy,and collection of a tax.nonetheless,we find it significant that congress chose to use the disjunctive when referring to the assessment,levy or collection of any tax under state law.emphasis added.in the case of a arrangement such as ifta,one state law levies the tax in question,while another state law provides for the assessment and collection of that tax.thus,reading the act disjunctively,identifying the jurisdiction that must supply the appropriate remedy requires us to explore the nature of plaintiff claim.if its challenge is to the assessment or collection of a fuel tax,then its action belongs in the courts of its base jurisdiction.on the other hand,if it challenges the imposition of a specific fuel tax,it must seek its remedy in the state that imposes that tax.
complicating matters here,plaintiff brought two distinct challenges in the state administrative proceedings.first,plaintiff argued that fuel consumed while idling was not a taxable event under ifta and that ifta trumped state fuel taxes that would otherwise tax fuel consumed while idling.second,plaintiff argued that various state statutes exempted from taxation fuel consumed while idling.
both challenges interfere with the assessment,levy or collection of any tax under state law.id.as noted above,ifta,although federally mandated,is enacted,implemented,and administered by the states and their ifta representatives.oregon has enacted and implemented ifta through state statutes and administrative regulations.oregon ifta is a state,rather than a federal,law,and it is a law under which state taxes are assessed and collected therefore,the act bars federal jurisdiction of plaintiff challenge to the interpretation of the ifta so long as plaintiff has an adequate remedy in oregon courts with respect to plaintiff challenge to ifta.
with respect to plaintiff challenge to the individual state statutes under which fuel taxes are imposed,by contrast,the act directs plaintiff to seek relief in the courts of those individual states.if plaintiff argues,for example,that wisconsin fuel tax exempts fuel consumed while idling,then such state refers to wisconsin because plaintiff is challenging a tax that is levied under wisconsin state law.so long as plaintiff has a plain,speedy,and efficient remedy in wisconsin courts,the act bars federal jurisdiction because plaintiff challenge would enjoin,suspend or restrain the levy of a tax under state law.
we therefore hold that whether the act applies depends on the availability and adequacy of a remedy with respect to each distinct state law that plaintiff challenges.because oregon is plaintiff base jurisdiction,plaintiff challenge to the structure and validity of ifta represents a challenge to an oregon state law under which taxes are assessed and collected.plaintiff remedy for that challenge thus lies in oregon state court.by contrast,plaintiff challenge to an underlying state tax that oregon collects properly belongs in the state whose law authorizes the imposition of that tax.looking at those remedies separately,the act bars federal jurisdiction so long as those remedies are plain,speedy and efficient.
plaintiff has a plain,speedy,and efficient remedy with respect to its challenges to both ifta and the underlying state fuel taxes.
even when the act applies,it deprives a district court of jurisdiction only when a plain,speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such state.federal courts must construe narrowly this exception to the tax injunction act.grace brethren church,at.whether the exception to the act jurisdictional bar applies depends on whether a remedy meets certain minimal procedural criteria.rosewell lasalle bank,d.particularly,the party challenging the state tax must receive a full hearing and judicial determination in which that party may assert federal rights.id.at.quoting cong.rec.substantive burdens on the party challenging a state tax,such as the necessity of traveling across state lines,do not lift the act jurisdictional bar.tully griffin,d.
for remedies to be plain,the procedures available in state court must be certain.see direct mktg.ass n,bennett,cir holding that a state remedy is not plain within the meaning of the tax injunction act if there is uncertainty regarding its availability or effect.quoting ashton cory,cir.the efficiency of a remedy generally turns on whether it imposes an unusual hardship on the party challenging the state tax requiring ineffectual activity or an unnecessary expenditure of time or energy.rosewell,at.
plaintiff remedy in oregon state courts for alleged violations of ifta.
the oregon administrative regulations implementing ifta provide for prompt administrative review of any alleged errors in the assessment of taxes owed under ifta.specifically,those regulations state 
e any person against whom a proposed assessment is made by the department may petition the department for reassessment within days after service upon the person of the assessment notice if a petition for reassessment is timely filed,the department will reconsider the assessment.the decision of the department upon a petition for reassessment will become final days after notice of the decision is served upon the petitioner.a petitioner may submit a request for hearing in the petition for reassessment and
