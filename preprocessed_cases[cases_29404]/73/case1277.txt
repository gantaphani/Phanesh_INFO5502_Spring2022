this appeal brings us the issue of whether a debtor intentional failure to file tax returns and to pay taxes owed to the internal revenue service irs is sufficient,even without any supporting affirmative conduct,to show that he willfully attempted in any manner to evade or defeat a tax,within the meaning of the provision contained in a c,which is part of the bankruptcy code.we hold that it is.
background 
from through william david fretz failed to file federal income tax returns or to pay his taxes.his problems with alcoholism during that time period caused a severe downward spiral in his life.notwithstanding that,fretz managed to maintain his employment as a physician indeed,he worked shifts of between twelve and hours in hospital emergency rooms.although he never drank within eight hours before a shift,upon completing work he would drink massive amounts of vodka until he passed out.fretz eventually joined alcoholics anonymous,regained control of his life,and quit drinking.the exact day he stopped drinking was april,
before,fretz worked in a clinic and was paid as a salaried employee,and his employer withheld income taxes from his paychecks as it was required to do.from through,however,fretz worked at several hospitals and clinics as an independent contractor.because he was no longer a salaried employee,no income taxes were withheld from his paychecks during that period.the hospitals and clinics dutifully filed forms reporting the payments they made to fretz,but he did not dutifully do anything about his income tax responsibilities.he did not make his required estimated tax payments in any of those years.not once.and he did not file his annual returns or pay any income tax.none.in fretz did hire an accountant to prepare a tax return for him,but he never filed it.on the other hand,fretz never attempted to move his assets around or otherwise conceal them except to the extent that failing to file returns conceals assets.
the day of reckoning fretz always knew would come finally arrived in march of when he received a letter from the irs stating that it had no record of receiving returns from him for through.one thing led to another and eventually to criminal charges.in january of,fretz pleaded guilty to one criminal charge,which was willful failure to file a tax return for the taxable year,in violation of.in november of,he signed returns prepared by the irs for the through tax years.included in the penalties to which he consented were civil fraud penalties for through,as authorized in b,and civil penalties for fraudulent failure to file for through,as authorized in a and f.
the amount of fretz tax liability,including the calculation of the interest and penalties,is not the issue in this case.the issue,instead,is whether his liability for those taxes,interest,and penalties is a debt that is dischargeable in bankruptcy.
procedural history 
in june of fretz filed a petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code.the next month he filed a complaint seeking to discharge his federal income tax liability for all tax years from through,except for.the government filed not only an answer denying that fretz was entitled to be discharged from liability for the tax years cited in his complaint,but it also filed a counterclaim asserting its position that his liability for the taxable year also was not dischargeable the total amount of taxes,interest,and penalties for which fretz sought discharge exceeded million at the time he filed his complaint.the government argued that fretz tax liabilities for through were nondischargeable pursuant to a c because he had willfully attempted to evade or defeat those taxes within the meaning of that provision 
the bankruptcy court held that the taxes for the years in issue were dischargeable.in its memorandum opinion the court ruled that the government had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that fretz failure to pay taxes was committed with fraudulent intent.because of fretz alcoholism,the court believed that he had followed no scheme or design to evade his taxes.ultimately,the court concluded that fretz conduct did not contain sufficient aggravating circumstances to raise the late filing of returns and failure to pay to the level of willfulness that would make the debt at issue nondischargeable.
the government appealed to the district court,which affirmed the bankruptcy court.in its memorandum opinion the district court found the issue and facts in fretz case to be virtually indistinguishable from those of in re haas,cir,abrogated in part,in re griffith,cir en banc,where we held that a debtor who accurately filed his tax returns but intentionally failed to pay taxes did not fit within the exception to dischargeability provided in a c.the district court held that because intent was the determinative factor and fretz did not engage in any affirmative acts to avoid his taxes,there was no willful attempt to evade or defeat taxes within the meaning of a c.the government appealed.
ii.discussion 
we review the bankruptcy court factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard.general trading yale materials handling,cir.by contrast,conclusions of law,whether from the bankruptcy court or the district court,we review de novo.id.
a debtor under chapter of the bankruptcy code is generally granted a discharge from all debts that arose prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition.b.nonetheless,this fresh start policy is only available to the honest but unfortunate debtor.grogan garner,d quoting local loan hunt.to ensure that,congress provided several exceptions to the general rule of discharge.one of those exceptions,and the one at play in this case,is contained in a c,which provides,in relevant part 
a a discharge under of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt 
for a tax or a customs duty 
c with respect to which the debtor made a fraudulent return or willfully attempted in any manner to evade or defeat such tax 
a c.as we have noted before,t he government bears the burden to prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that a particular claim is nondischargeable under a.in re griffith,cir.en banc citing grogan,at.at,cert.denied,d.
fretz did not file tax returns for the years in question until november of when he signed returns that had been prepared by the irs.so,we are not concerned with the first part of a c,which is aimed at a debtor who has made a fraudulent return,but only with the second part,which is aimed at one who has willfully attempted in any manner to evade or defeat his income taxes.
exceptions to the general rule of discharge,such as a c,are to be strictly construed in favor of the debtor.griffith,at in re fegeley,cir dalton,cir.but that rule of strict construction does not permit or require that an unambiguous provision be construed contrary to the plain meaning of its terms.to the contrary,we are required to interpret straightforward,unambiguous language in the bankruptcy code,like that in all other statutes,according to its plain meaning.see united states mclymont,cir t he plain meaning of the statute controls unless the language is ambiguous or leads to absurd results.citation omitted see also in re american steel product,cir it is that courts are required to apply the plain meaning canon of statutory construction in interpretation of the bankruptcy code.when statutory language has not been expressly defined,we are to give that language its common meaning.consolidated bank,united states dep t of treasury,cir in the absence of a statutory definition of a term,we look to the common usage of words for their meaning.the plain language of the second prong of a c contains a conduct requirement that the debtor attempted in any manner to evade or defeat a tax,and a mental state requirement that the attempt was done willfully.see fegeley,at in re birkenstock,cir.we turn now to a closer look at those two requirements to see if the government carried its burden of establishing that the a c exception applies in this case.
a.the conduct requirement 
we begin our closer look with the conduct requirement,remembering that congress did not define or limit the methods by which a
