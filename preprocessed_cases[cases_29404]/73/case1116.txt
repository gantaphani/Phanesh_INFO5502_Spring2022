the bankruptcy code provides that an excise tax on a transaction occurring during the three years immediately preceding the date of the filing of the bankruptcy petition is not dischargeable in bankruptcy.a e ii see also a a.in this case,an employer failed to carry workers compensation insurance,and an injured employee was compensated directly from a special fund maintained by the industrial commission of arizona commission.under arizona law,an employer who has failed to carry insurance is required to reimburse the special fund for compensation paid to an injured employee,plus penalties and interest.
we have previously held that reimbursement of the special fund is an excise tax within the meaning of a e ii.see industrial comm of camilli in re camilli,cir.in this case,we are asked to decide the date of the transaction on which this excise tax is based in order to determine the period of.we hold that a transaction is the act of employing a worker without carrying the required insurance when the worker is injured.the date of the transaction is thus the date on which the worker is injured.in so holding,we agree with the holding in bliemeister industrial comm of in re bliemeister.
at all relevant times,eric and mary deroche the deroches owned and operated the desert auto and truck service desert auto in mesa,arizona.while working as a mechanic at desert auto,rodney sandry was injured on july.sandry sought workers compensation,and on october,the industrial commission of arizona notified him that his claim had been accepted.because the deroches did not carry workers compensation insurance as required by arizona law,sandry was compensated out of the arizona special fund,and the deroches were required to reimburse the fund for that compensation,plus penalties and interest.
on october,the commission sent a notice to the deroches,stating that it would pay compensation to sandry based on an average monthly wage of.on november,the commission sent an apparently superceding notice stating,compensation is being paid on a lessor sic wage pending finality of average monthly wage.on november,the commission sent a letter stating that it had paid compensation to sandry from the special fund that the deroches current liability to the fund totaled including a penalty of and that additional amounts may become payable in the future.on december,the commission sent a notice of a continuing award stating that it was now assessing the deroches a total of including a penalty of,payable to the fund.
on december,acting pro se,the deroches requested a hearing before the commission,challenging its acceptance of sandry claim for compensation.they contended that sandry was a subcontractor rather than an employee while working at desert auto and hence not covered by workers compensation,and,further,that sandry had been injured before working at desert auto.on april,an administrative law judge held on the merits that sandry was entitled to workers compensation,and that the deroches were liable for all the compensation paid by the special fund to date,plus penalties and interest.
on may,the commission sent the deroches a notice of a supplemental continuing award,now totaling including a penalty of.this supplemental continuing award was an assessment for a cumulative total that included the amount specified in the continuing award notice sent to the deroches on december.the deroches protested the supplemental continuing award on june,and requested a hearing before the commission.
a hearing was scheduled for november.however,on november,the day before the scheduled hearing,the deroches filed for chapter bankruptcy,and they did not appear for their hearing the next day.on november,an administrative law judge dismissed the deroches request for a hearing because of their failure to appear,and deemed final the supplemental continuing award of may.
the commission filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court for.this amount appears to have been the cumulative total of the compensation the special fund had paid to sandry,plus penalties and interest.the deroches were subsequently sent additional assessments for continuing awards in increasingly higher amounts,as compensation continued to be paid to sandry out of the special fund.so far as appears from the record,the deroches have never paid any reimbursement to the fund.
the deroches objected to the commission claim in the bankruptcy court,contending that their liability to the fund was not an excise tax within the meaning of a e ii,and that it was therefore dischargeable.the bankruptcy court agreed.while the decision of the bankruptcy court was on appeal,we held in in re camilli that reimbursement of the arizona special fund by an uninsured employer is indeed an excise tax.on remand to the bankruptcy court in light of in re camilli,the deroches continued to object to the commission claim,now on the alternate ground that the excise tax in their case was subject to discharge because it was based on a transaction that had occurred more than three years before the date of their bankruptcy petition.
on summary judgment,the bankruptcy court disagreed with the deroches,holding that each separate supplement and continuing award is a transaction.because notices of award had been sent to the deroches within three years of their bankruptcy filing,the bankruptcy court concluded that the commission claim was.under the holding of the bankruptcy court,the amount assessed in the most recent award issued by the commission is,even though that amount is a cumulative running total that includes payments made by the special fund more than three years before the petition.the district court affirmed.
we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to d.when reviewing a district court decision on appeal from a bankruptcy court,we apply the same standard of review applied by the district court.see parker community first bank in re bakersfield westar ambulance,cir.we therefore review de novo the summary judgment of the bankruptcy court.see id.
we reverse and remand.
the issue in this case is what constitutes the transaction underlying the excise tax owed to the arizona special fund.the issue is difficult because liability to a state fund for reimbursement of payments made to an injured employee is an unusual excise tax.more typical excise taxes are,for example,taxes on the sale of cigarettes or license taxes.see black law dictionary ed defining excise tax as a tax imposed on the manufacture,sale,or use of goods such as a cigarette tax,or on an occupation or activity such as a license tax or an attorney occupation fee.for such typical excise taxes,the transaction underlying the tax is obvious.it is a discrete act by the person or entity being example,the sale of cigarettes or the application for a license.
the transaction in a workers compensation case is less obvious.there are a number of events that,taken together,result in the ultimate assessment of the excise tax by the special fund.first,the employer must fail to carry workers compensation insurance.second,an employee must be injured.third,the employee must make a claim for workers compensation.fourth,the commission must make a determination that the worker is entitled to compensation.fifth,the fund must pay compensation to the injured worker.finally,the fund must assess the employer for reimbursement of the compensation paid to the worker.the assessment for reimbursement to the fund,which comes at the end of this sequence of events,is the excise tax in question.
the commission agrees with the result reached by the bankruptcy court.it s
