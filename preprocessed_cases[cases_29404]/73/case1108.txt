iii.discussion 
speedy trial act 
we review the district court disposition of a speedy trial act issue for clear error as to factual findings and de novo as to application of legal standards.united states berberian,cir see also united states henderson,cir,aff,d.
under the speedy trial act,
i n any case in which a plea of not guilty is entered,the trial of a defendant charged in an indictment with the commission of an offense shall commence within seventy days from the filing date of the indictment,or from the date the defendant has appeared before a judicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending,whichever date last occurs.c.
in this case,the indictment charging the two tax offenses was returned on august,and defendant first appeared before a magistrate judge on august.defendant contends that the speedy trial act was violated as his trial should have commenced on november,but did not commence until july.therefore,defendant argues this court should reverse his conviction and dismiss the indictment.
under the speedy trial act,excluded in computing the time within which trial must commence are delay resulting from any pretrial motion,from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on,or other prompt disposition of,such motion,and a ny period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by any judge if the judge granted such continuance on the basis of his findings that the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.h f a.however,for time to be excludable under the ends of justice provision,the district court must set forth,in the record of the case,its reasons for finding that the ends of justice served by the granting of such continuance outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.h a.
the remedy for violation of the speedy trial act is dismissal of the case,on motion of the defendant.a.however,f ailure of the defendant to move for dismissal prior to trial or entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere shall constitute a waiver of the right to dismissal under the speedy trial act.see also berberian,at united states stone,cir united states brown,cir.the act provides for no exception to the waiver of the right to dismissal for failure to make a timely motion.united states westbrook,cir.
defendant has waived his right to dismissal under the speedy trial act.defendant admits that his trial counsel never moved for a dismissal of the indictment for violation of the speedy trial act,and defendant made no attempt to separately assert his right to a speedy trial.
moreover,there has been no violation of the speedy trial act.in the first instances of granting the continuances the district court specifically referred to the statutory provisions setting forth factors it considered in granting those continuances.those statutory references,in conjunction with the reasons elaborated in the defense motions seeking the extensions,and the district court reference to the motions in its orders,constitute sufficient explanation of why the ends of justice served by granting the continuances outweighed the interests of the defendant and the public in a speedy trial.therefore,any delay resulting from these motions is excluded in computing the time within which trial must commence.thus,days were excluded by the court first five continuance orders.days elapsed between defendant first appearance after the indictment,on august,and the commencement of the trial on july.therefore,only days of time elapsed from the date of defendant first appearance until the time the date the trial commenced.consequently,there was no violation of the speedy trial act.
sufficient evidence to support the verdict 
we review the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a conviction by examining whether,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states willard,cir united states,at united states deeb,cir united states cusino,cir.
defendant argues that there is no evidence that the allegedly unreported income was received during instead of.therefore,defendant contends that his motion for acquittal should have been granted.defendant argument is without merit.
the government proof at trial,when viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution,clearly establishes that a rational trier of fact could conclude that defendant received substantial income during that he did not report on his federal income tax return for that year.the evidence at trial established that during,was deposited into defendant bank accounts and defendant made cash expenditures totaling.the government evidence also proved that the in unreported cash was income that defendant should have reported on his federal income tax return.the testimony of defendant former wife also supports this conclusion.she testified about their finances during the relevant period.she was responsible for paying household bills during her marriage to defendant,and,as his spouse,knew of his disposable income,his lifestyle,and spending habits.given all of the evidence produced at trial,a rational factfinder could easily conclude that defendant received substantial income in that he did not report on his federal income tax return for that year.
the legal requirements with respect to a method of proof are questions of law,subject to review de novo.united states stephens,cir united states hunter,cir.
defendant asserts that the district court should not have permitted the government to offer evidence of bank deposits plus cash expenditures without requiring the government to establish defendant opening net worth.defendant offers no legal support for this assertion.the case law cited by defendant holds that the government must establish an opening net worth when using the increase in net worth method of proving income within a tax year.see holland united states.the defendant merely states that this same rule should be applied when the government uses the cash deposits plus expenditures method.however,no legal support is advanced for this position.the defendant argument is unpersuasive.
in contrast,the government cites clear precedent for the proposition that there is no need for the government to establish the defendant opening net worth when using the bank deposits plus cash expenditures method.see united states conaway,cir united states abodeely,cir united states soulard,cir percifield united states,cir.
under the bank deposits plus cash expenditures method of proof,after bank deposits have been added together and nontaxable amounts are eliminated,the amount of expenditures made using cash that had not been deposited into the bank accounts is added to derive gross income.percifield,at.in the instant case,the government proof fully comported with the requirements of the bank deposits plus cash expenditures method of proof.there is no requirement that opening net worth be established when using this method of proof.therefore,the government was not required to prove defendant opening net worth.
we generally review a district court finding that a defendant has sufficient financial resources to pay a fine for clear error.united states scrivener,cir united states ladum,cir united states favorito,cir.where a defendant fails to object at sentencing to an order that he pay a fine,this court may consider the issue only where exceptional circumstances exist.see united states,cir.where the exceptional circumstances exception applies,we review the disputed factual determination under the plain error standard.see united states,cir.
defendant maintains that he did not object to the amount of the fine in the district court because he was not given an opportunity to do so since he and his attorney had concluded their remarks prior to the prosecutor request that the court assess a fine.he further contends that immediately after the request for the fine was made,the court imposed the sentence without providing an opportunity for comment by either the defendant or his attorney.in any event,defendant argument that there was no showing of sufficient assets to pay a fine lacks merit.
the district court ordered defendant to pay a fine of,which was within the applicable guideline range.c.the guidelines provide that a fine shall be imposed in all cases,except where the defendant establishes that he is unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay any fine.a.defendant has the burden of proof to demonstrate that he can not pay the fine.united states,cir see united states rafferty,cir.
in the instant case,defendant failed to demonstrate that he was incapable of paying the fine.first,defendant refused to discuss his finances with the probation officer.rafferty,at defendant failed to meet his burden where,upon advice of counsel,he refused to provide any i
