the city of san francisco treasurer and tax collector tax collector is authorized to promulgate regulations and issue rules,determinations and interpretations consistent with provisions of the business and tax regulations code as may be necessary or appropriate for the purpose of carrying out and enforcing the payment,collection and remittance of taxes bus.tax,section.pursuant to this grant of authority,in december,that official promulgated a number of hotel tax guidelines the guidelines advising hotel operators that the hotel tax applied to a number of charges,one of which was charges for parking including valet services for hotel guests,including i charges to hotel guests for parking located on the hotel premises regardless how charged,and ii charges to hotel guests for parking located off the hotel premises where such charge is added to the room bill and paid to the hotel operator.
after plaintiff administrative claim for refund was denied,she filed this action in january,alleging that imposition of the hotel tax on parking charges is unlawful and in violation of the hotel tax ordinance.the ordinance only authorizes the imposition of the hotel tax on the rent for every occupancy of a guest room in a hotel,whereas the guidelines purport to extend the hotel tax to the parking charges.parking charges,however,are not rent for occupancy of a guest room,and the imposition of the hotel tax on such charges contravenes the hotel tax ordinance and is unlawful.

discussion 
establishing the standard of our review 
we would ordinarily start our analysis by establishing the standard of review,which at first glance would seem to be that the application of a taxing statute to uncontradicted facts is a question of law,and this court is accordingly not bound to accept the trial court findings of fact made from the uncontradicted facts shown in the parties stipulation and the documentary evidence.communications satellite franchise tax bd.d,accord,microsoft franchise tax bd.cal th,limited stores,franchise tax bd.th.however,plaintiff means to overturn not just judge karnow judgment,but the tax collector promulgation of the guidelines implementing the hotel tax.if plaintiff is correct that guidelines are ultra vires,their invalidity moots judge karnow contrary conclusion,and essentially demands that plaintiff prevail.see california of psychology providers rank cal d,administrative regulations that alter or amend the statute or enlarge or impair its scope are void and courts not only may,but it is their obligation to strike down such regulations.association for retarded citizens department of developmental services cal d,administrative action that is not authorized is void.
as previously mentioned,the tax collector is statutorily authorized to promulgate regulations and issue rules,determinations and interpretations consistent with provisions of the business and tax regulations code as may be necessary or appropriate for the purpose of carrying out and enforcing the payment,collection and remittance of taxes bus.tax.although this statute does not expressly mention the promulgation of guidelines,both sides appear to accept that the guidelines at issue qualify as rules,determinations or interpretations.so do we.
but plaintiff contends that the guidelines are invalid because they go beyond carrying out and enforcing the payment,collection and remittance of taxes collectible under the hotel tax as properly construed.plaintiff argues that the guidelines on parking amounts to a new tax on hotel parking,and thus impermissibly extends the hotel tax because parking space is not a guest room and does not accompany the room use and possession.under this general heading plaintiff argues that the tax collector new tax as implemented by the guidelines change s the definition of occupancy conflicts with the board of supervisors intent to specifically exempt hotel parking,as shown by the city parking tax ordinance and also violates the california constitution by increasing the hotel tax without a vote of the electorate.
plaintiff is not challenging the validity of the hotel tax itself,only the tax collector interpretative guidelines it is the administrative interpretation which she claims is illegitimate because it extends the application of the hotel tax beyond the proper scope of its language.in short,plaintiff seeks to overturn not the tax itself,but only the interpretation of it adopted by the tax collector.in this situation,the interpretation of the hotel tax and the guidelines presents a question of law,which warrants no particular deference from this court see state building construction trades council of california duncan cal.app th,yamaha of america state bd.of equalization th,see also san francisco fire fighters local city and county of san francisco cal th.
hoping to have the guidelines classified as,the city contends that deferential review is proper indeed,going so far as to assert that our review must be most deferential.the city is only partially correct,and in a sense that is not really applicable here.
such deference is extended only if the court is satisfied that the rule in question falls within the lawmaking authority delegated,that the rule is reasonably necessary to implement the purpose of the statute,and that it is consistent with the controlling law yamaha of america state bd.of equalization,supra,th.such an inquiry obviously requires examination of the statute and the regulation s,and that examination would to be de novo because it entails what we have called,the quintessential judicial function.state building construction trades council of california duncan,supra,th,accord,yamaha of america st
