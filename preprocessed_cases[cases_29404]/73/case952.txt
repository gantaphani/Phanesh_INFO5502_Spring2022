on this appeal from the tax court,we must decide whether,under the tax regulations in effect during tax years,and,related companies engaged in a joint venture to develop intangible property must include the value of certain stock option compensation one participant gives to its employees in the pool of costs to be shared under a cost sharing agreement,even when companies operating at arm length would not do so.the tax court found related companies are not required to share such costs and ruled that the commissioner of internal revenue attempt to allocate such costs was arbitrary and capricious.we reverse and hold related companies in a cost sharing agreement to develop intangibles must share all costs related to the joint venture,even if unrelated companies would not do so stock options for which companies claim tax deductions are a cost under former d and such costs are related to the intangible product development,as part of the compensation package offered to employees involved in activities under the joint venture 
background 
xilinx,xilinx researches,develops,manufactures,markets and sells integrated circuit devices and related development software systems.xilinx wanted to expand its position in the european market and established xilinx ireland xi in as an unlimited liability company under the laws of ireland.xi sold programmable logic devices and conducted research and development r d.two wholly owned irish subsidiaries of xilinx owned xi during the tax years of,and,the only years at issue in this appeal.
in,xilinx and xi entered into a cost and risk sharing agreement the agreement,which provided that all right,title and interest in new technology developed by either xilinx or xi would be jointly owned.under the agreement,each party was required to pay a percentage of the total r d costs in proportion to the anticipated benefits to each from the new technology that was expected to be created.specifically,the agreement required the parties to share direct costs,defined as costs directly related to the r d of new technology,including,but not limited to,salaries,bonuses and other payroll costs and benefits indirect costs,defined as costs incurred by departments not involved in r d that generally benefit r d,including,but not limited to,administrative,legal,accounting and insurance costs and costs incurred to acquire products or intellectual property rights necessary to conduct r d.the agreement did not specifically address whether employee stock options esos were a cost to be shared.
xilinx offered esos to its employees under two plans.under one plan,employees were granted options as part of the employee hiring and retention program.the options were of two varieties incentive stock options isos and nonstatutory stock options nsos.employees could exercise these options two ways by purchasing the stock at the market price on the day the option was issued exercise price regardless of its market price or by simultaneously exercising the option at the exercise price and selling it at its price,pocketing the difference.under the other plan,employees could acquire employee stock purchase plan shares espps by contributing to an account through payroll deductions and purchasing stock at percent of either its exercise price or its market price on the purchase date.employees must always pay taxes on nsos,see,but have to pay taxes on isos and espps only if they sell acquired stock shares before a specified waiting period has expired a disqualifying disposition,see b.in determining the r d costs to be shared under the agreement for tax years,and,xilinx did not include any amount related to esos.
in tax years,and,xilinx deducted as business expenses under and approximately,and,respectively,based on its employees exercises of nsos or disqualifying dispositions of isos and espps it also claimed an r d credit under for wages related to r d activity,of which approximately,and in the respective tax years were attributable to exercised nsos or disqualifying dispositions of isos and espps furthermore,in xilinx and xi entered into two agreements that allowed xi employees to acquire options for xilinx stock.both agreements provided xi would pay xilinx for the cost of the xi employees exercise of the stock options,which was to equal the stock market price on the exercise date minus the exercise price.in the,and tax years,xi paid xilinx,and,respectively,under these agreements.
the commissioner of internal revenue commissioner issued notices of deficiency against xilinx for tax years,and,contending esos issued to its employees involved in or supporting r d activities were costs that should have been shared between xilinx and xi under the agreement.specifically,the commissioner concluded the amount xilinx deducted under h for its employees exercises of nsos or disqualifying dispositions of isos and espps should have been shared.by sharing those costs with xi,xilinx deduction would be reduced,thereby increasing its taxable income.the commissioner determination resulted in substantial tax deficiencies and penalties under a.
xilinx timely filed suit in the tax court.the tax court denied cross motions for summary judgment.after a bench trial,the tax court found that two unrelated parties in a cost sharing agreement would not share any costs related to esos.after assuming esos were costs for purposes of d,the tax court then found b which requires cost sharing agreements between related parties to reflect how two unrelated parties operating at arm length would and concluded the commissioner allocation was arbitrary and capricious because it included the esos in the pool of costs to be shared under the agreement,even though two unrelated companies dealing with each other at arm length would not share those costs.
the commissioner timely appealed.on appeal,the parties focused primarily on whether the requirement in d that all costs be shared between related parties in a cost sharing agreement or the requirement in b that all transactions between related parties reflect what two parties operating at arm length would do controlled.after oral argument,we requested supplemental briefing on whether esos were costs and whether they were related to the intangible product development for purposes of d,and whether a literal application of d would conflict with a tax treaty between the united states and ireland that was in effect during the and tax years.
ii.standard of review 
decisions of the tax court are reviewed on the same basis as decisions from civil bench trials in the district court.dhl comm r,cir.thus,we review the tax court conclusions of law de novo and its factual findings for clear error.id.
iii.discussion 
the commissioner does not dispute the tax court factual finding that unrelated parties would not share esos as a cost.instead,the commissioner maintains esos are a cost that must be shared under d,even if unrelated parties would not share them.
b and d are irreconcilable,so d,the more specific of the two,controls.
congress has authorized the secretary of the treasury to allocate income and deductions among related business entities to prevent tax avoidance.
in any case of two or more organizations,trades,or businesses whether or not incorporated,whether or not organized in the united states,and whether or not affiliated owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests,the secretary may distribute,apportion,or allocate gross income,deductions,credits,or allowances between or among such organizations,trades,or businesses,if he determines that such distribution,apportionment,or allocation is necessary in order to prevent evasion of taxes or clearly to reflect the income of any of such organizations,trades,or businesses.in the case of any transfer or license of intangible property within the meaning of section h b,the income with respect to such transfer or license shall be commensurate with the income attributable to the intangible.
the secretary in turn promulgated regulations authorizing the commissioner to allocate income and deductions among related entities.the introduction to these regulations explains 
the purpose of section is to ensure that taxpayers clearly reflect income attributable to controlled transactions and to prevent the avoidance of taxes with respect to such transactions.section places a controlled taxpayer on a tax parity with an uncontrolled taxpayer by determining the true taxable income of the controlled taxpayer.this section sets forth general principles and guidelines to be followed under section.
a the next subsection states that the standard to be employed in every case to ensure taxpayers accurately reflect income from controlled transactions and do not avoid taxes through such transactions is an arm length standard 
in determining the true taxable income of a controlled taxpayer,the standard to be applied in every case is that of a taxpayer dealing at arm length with an uncontrolled taxpayer.a controlled transaction meets the arm length standard if the results of the transaction are consistent with the results that would have been realized if uncontrolled taxpayers had engaged in the same transaction under the same circumstances arm length result.however,because identical transactions can rarely be located,whether a transaction produces an arm length result generally will be determined by reference to the results of comparable transactions under comparable circumstances.
another section,however,specifically governing cost sharing agreements between controlled parties to develop intangible property authorizes the internal revenue service to make each controlled participant share of the costs as determined under d of intangible development under the qualified cost sharing arrangement equal to its share of reasonably anticipated benefits attributable to such development a.controlled participants must include all costs in the pool of costs to be shared proportionally the all costs requirement 
for purposes of this section,a controlled participant costs of developing intangibles for a taxable year mean all of the costs incurred by that participant related to the intangible development area,plus all of the cost sharing payments it makes to other controlled and uncontrolled participants,minus all of the cost sharing payments it receives from other controlled and uncontrolled participants.costs incurred related to the intangible development area consist of operating expenses,as defined in d,other than depreciation or amortization expense,plus to the extent not included in such operating expenses,as defined in d the charge for the use of any tangible property made available to the qualified cost sharing arrangement.
d.operating expenses are defined as includ ing all expenses not included in cost of goods sold except for interest expense,foreign income taxes and domestic income taxes,and any other expenses not related to the operation of the relevant business activity.d.how these various provisions interact is the crux of the parties dispute.
section b specifies that the true taxable income of controlled parties is calculated based on how parties operating at arm length would behave.the language is unequivocal this arm length standard is to be applied in every case.in the context of cost sharing agreements,this would require controlled parties to share only those costs uncontrolled parties would share.by implication,costs that uncontrolled parties would not share need not be shared.in contrast,d specifies that controlled parties in a cost sharing agreement must share all costs related to the intangible development area,and that phrase is explicitly defined to include virtually all expenses not included in the cost of goods.the plain language does not permit any exceptions,even for costs that unrelated parties would not share.each provision plain language mandates a different result.accordingly,we conclude the two provisions establish distinct and irreconcilable standards for determining which costs must be shared between controlled parties in cost sharing agreements specifically related to intangible product development.
the structure of the regulatory regime confirms this conclusion.section b explains that s ections through provide specific methods to be used to evaluate whether transactions between or among members of the controlled group satisfy the arm length standard,and if they do not,to determine the arm length result.section c best method rule explains how the commissioner and taxpayers should determine which of these methods provides the most reliable measure of the arm length result the two primary factors to take into account are the degree of comparability between the controlled transaction or taxpayer and any uncontrolled comparables,and the quality of data and assumptions used in the analysis.notably,is not included among the methods specified in b for determining the arm length result,and the comprehensive definition of costs related to the intangible development area does not implicate the factors identified in c.thus,through establish a sophisticated methodology for comparing controlled transactions to uncontrolled transactions that is generally applicable when determining what items must be allocated among related parties.the regulatory regime then addresses a particular type of controlled sharing agreements related to intangible product establishes a comprehensive definition of what costs must be shared that does not turn on similar uncontrolled transactions.section thus appears to be a provision creating an exception to the general methodology established in the earlier provisions.as long as taxpayers comply with the requirement of sharing all intangible development costs proportionally to the expected benefit,see b requiring each participant share of intangible development costs reflect that participant share of anticipated benefits,they are assured the district director will not make allocations and revise the claimed tax liability attributable to the cost sharing agreement,a.a bright line rule governs what costs must be shared,rather than comparing the cost sharing agreement to similar agreements between unrelated parties.
in fact,the regulatory history suggests the secretary viewed cost sharing agreements related to intangible product development as a unique type of controlled transaction meriting a distinct method of analysis.the amendments to reflected congress particular concern over transfers and licenses of intangible property,but the conference committee report explaining those amendments recognized that many important and difficult issues under section we re left unresolved by this legislation and suggested a comprehensive study of intercompany pricing rules should be conducted and careful consideration should be given to whether the existing regulations could be modified in any respect.conf,reprinted in.in response,the internal revenue service and treasury department conducted a detailed study of controlled party transactions,publishing its results in.see notice.the study primarily considered transfers of intangibles,but it also addressed the application of section to other transactions,including cost sharing agreements.intercompany transfer pricing and cost sharing regulations under section,proposed.the secretary then promulgated the precursors of through and in as a single proposed regulation,but did not finalize the comprehensive all costs requirement in d until december,see,six months after the rest of the section regulations were finalized,see.the secretary separate regulatory action addressing cost sharing agreements related to intangible product development lends further support to our conclusion that the all costs requirement is different from the arm length standard generally applicable to other controlled transactions 
because the all costs requirement is irreconcilable with the arm length standard,we hold d controls,in light of the elementary tenet of statutory construction that where there is no clear indication otherwise,a specific statute will not be controlled or nullified by a general one,santiago salgado garcia,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted see also long island care at home,coke,d applying this canon of construction to regulations.section applies to cost sharing agreements related to intangible development,which is the particular controlled transaction at issue here,and specifies that all costs related to the intangible development area must be included in the pool of costs to be shared.the general requirement in b that the arm length standard should apply in every case involving a controlled transaction does not override such a specific provision 
we are not persuaded by either party attempts to harmonize the two provisions.xilinx argues that b in every case language requires us to construe d all costs requirement to mean that parties must share only those costs that parties operating at arm length would share,suggesting d did not explicitly incorporate an arm length standard because that requirement is implicit,and controlling,in light of b.although this explanation at first seems plausible,we are not ultimately persuaded.to read such a qualification into the precise and comprehensive language of d and d would ignore the plain meaning and context of the cost sharing provisions,specifically all costs related to intangible development.all means the entire number,amount or quantity or every,american heritage college dictionary ed,and related means b eing connected or associated,id.at.these terms,taken together with the regulation,describe a fixed set of costs that must be shared in their totality and that will not vary based on the type of intangible property being developed.transporting an arm length standard into d would transform this apparently all encompassing and description of the costs to be shared into a methodology under which the costs to be shared would not be fixed by these defined terms but would rather ultimately be defined by the conduct of unrelated parties.significantly,achieving an arm length result is not itself the regulatory regime goal rather,its purpose is to prevent tax evasion by ensuring taxpayers accurately reflect taxable income attributable to controlled transactions see a.during the regulatory process,the secretary concluded cost sharing agreements related to intangible development merited separate attention.the plain language in the finalized articulates a bright line rule,which appears to reflect a judgment that intangible product development through cost sharing agreements presents a special case requiring a distinct approach to ensure related parties do not evade taxes.under the circumstances,we are reluctant to import a general standard into a comprehensive definition contained in a highly specific regulation 
on the other hand,the commissioner argues that the word generally in b means there are exceptions to using the results of comparable transactions under comparable circumstances to determine the arm length result and that d all costs requirement is such an exception.in context,however,the sentence containing the language quoted above conveys that identical transactions between unrelated are the ideal for determining the results that would have been realized if controlled taxpayers had engaged in the same transaction under the same circumstances arm length result,b are rare,so comparable transactions are generally the only feasible way to determine the arm length result.moreover,b does not list among the sections providing specific methods for calculating the arm length result,so the commissioner suggestion that d all costs requirement is simply another method of determining the arm length result is implausible.see boudette barnette,cir holding when a statute designates certain manners of operation,all omissions should be understood as exclusions.finally,the commissioner has presented no evidence that any companies operating at arm length share eso costs and does not challenge the tax court finding that unrelated parties would not do so.if unrelated parties operating at arm length would not share the eso cost,requiring controlled parties to share it is simply not an arm length result.see b defining arm length result as consistent with the results that would have been realized if uncontrolled taxpayers had engaged in the same transaction under the same circumstances 
we also disagree with the dissent that the united tax treaty and the treasury department technical explanation of that treaty are useful guides in determining which of the two irreconcilable standards governs dissent at.to be sure,the technical explanation,which was issued while the tax regulations at issue in this case were in effect,states that the treaty incorporates the arm length principle from united states tax law,refers to the arm length standard as decisive and makes no specific mention of the all costs requirement.dissent at the dissent maintains the general arm length standard should trump the specific all costs requirement because it is hard to believe the treasury department conceal ed from its treaty parties that the arm length standard had an exception when stock options were in question.dissent at.but this argument rests on the false premise that treasury officials involved in the treaty negotiations believed the all costs requirement was inconsistent with the arm length standard articulated in through.the dissent overlooks several details the commissioner has always argued,before the tax court and on appeal,that the all costs requirement is consistent with the arm length standard in b the treasury department has never publicly differentiated between the two standards and the current regulations explicitly state the all costs requirement is consistent with the arm length standard,see a d iii.by all appearances,the treasury department consistent view over the years has been that requiring related parties in a cost sharing arrangement to share eso costs is not incompatible with international norms or the regulatory arm length standard under domestic tax law.obviously,we have concluded the second view is not supported by the plain language of the regulations in effect during,and and we express no opinion on the first.but the dissent goes a step further by projecting our conclusion years into the past and assuming the treasury officials involved in negotiating and interpreting the tax treaty agreed with it,without offering any basis for doing so.as we have explained,we do not believe the secretary accidentally promulgated a highly specific regulation that plainly requires related parties in cost sharing agreements to share all costs.the treaty documents do not alter our view.
in sum,we conclude the arm length regulation,b,and the all costs regulation,d,can not be harmonized.accordingly,we hold d,being the more specific of the two,controls.
section d does not violate the united tax treaty.
as noted,we requested supplemental briefing on whether d might be preempted for the tax years the united tax treaty was in effect.the tax treaty establishes that the appropriate standard for determining whether to reallocate profits from controlled transactions involving controlled parties is whether conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations that differ from those that would be made between independent enterprises.see united tax treaty,ria int.tax treaty.the department of the treasury treaty explanation confirms that this standard is identical to the arm length standard in b.see department of the treasury technical explanation of the united tax treaty,ria int.tax treaty.nonetheless,d does not conflict with the tax treaty in these circumstances,because the treaty expressly allows a contracting state to apply its domestic laws to its own citizens,even if those laws conflict with the treaty.see united tax treaty,ria int.tax treaty notwithstanding any provision of this treaty,a contracting state may tax its residents and its citizens,as if the treaty had not come into effect.xilinx is not a foreign entity,so applying d to it does not violate the treaty,even if the regulation all costs requirement is at odds with the treaty arm length standard.
esos for which companies claim tax deductions are costs and are related to the research and development activity,to the extent they are given to employees involved in or supporting that activity.
because d controls,the commissioner properly allocated the eso amounts only if they are costs incurred by xilinx related to the intangible development area.
certain eso amounts are a cost.
xilinx relies on the considerable evidence and testimony presented to the tax court that unrelated parties in a cost sharing agreement do not treat esos as costs to be shared.this evidence is beside the or not unrelated parties share an item is immaterial to whether it is a cost to either party.xilinx also maintains esos are not costs because two provisions of allow taxpayers to use any accounting method as long as it is used consistently xilinx reads these provisions to allow a taxpayer to establish conclusively what is or is not a cost by using a particular accounting method and sticking with it.xilinx then argues that under one particular business accounting method,which was widely accepted when congress passed in the and was still an acceptable method during the tax years at issue,esos are not treated as costs.
xilinx argument that accounting requirements allow taxpayers to what is and is not a cost by consistently using a particular accounting method is creative but unsound.the accounting requirements are minimum eligibility requirements for a qualified cost sharing agreement.it does not logically follow that whatever accounting method a taxpayer uses,even a nonstandard one,conclusively establishes what is a cost,even if that method differs from how the regulation defines costs.rather,the regulation accounting requirements are clearly intended to ensure the government has a basis upon which to verify whether taxpayers who obtain the benefit of a qualified cost sharing agreement are accurately reporting and sharing costs,not treating items that are costs under the regulation as something other than costs.
also,the official accounting method upon which xilinx relies,accounting principles board opinion apb,was superseded by statement of financial accounting standards sfas.although sfas allowed taxpayers to employ apb methodology under which these esos have zero cost during the relevant tax years,sfas explained that the apb method was no longer the preferred method for valuing esos,going so far as to require companies employing apb also to report the cost of esos under sfas preferred fair value based method.xilinx used apb and treated the esos as a zero cost on its books,but it also complied with sfas and reported the eso cost under the sfas fair value method in footnotes to its public income statements.thus,although xilinx did not violate business accounting practices in ascribing zero cost on its books to esos,the preferred business accounting practice during the relevant tax years treated esos as costs.
in the end,xilinx argument is undermined by the regulatory language and its own tax returns.costs incurred related to the intangible development area are operating expenses as defined in d,d,which provides that operating expenses include all expenses not included in cost of goods sold except for any expenses not related to the operation of the relevant business activity,d xilinx stipulated that it did not include the value of the esos in the cost of goods sold,and it claimed tax deductions under and for the exercised nsos and the disqualifying dispositions of the isos and espps as business expenses.see a allowing employers to deduct all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred emphasis added.xilinx could not have claimed deductions on these esos unless they were an expense,which is the key term in the definition of cost under d.moreover,xilinx required xi to pay it for the value of the esos xi employees exercised.requiring reimbursement for esos granted to another company employees further supports the conclusion that the esos are costs.in short,the preferred business accounting method in effect during the relevant tax years treated esos as costs,and xilinx itself treated certain amounts of esos as expenses in claiming them as a tax deduction.accordingly,we hold the eso value that xilinx deducted as a business expense is a cost for the purposes of d 
esos are related to the intangible development area.
the tax court found the esos are part of xilinx employee recruitment and retention program,and xilinx does not suggest salaries or benefits,like healthcare and retirement contributions,for employees involved in r d activities are not related to their work on the r d activities.it is difficult to view esos as anything but part of xilinx employee compensation package,because it is a benefit conferred in exchange for services rendered.esos are just as related to connected or associated with an employee work as any other employment benefit or compensation.see american heritage college dictionary ed.in fact,xilinx claimed the esos as part of a tax credit available for wages paid or incurred to an employee for qualified research services performed by such employee.b a.xilinx inclusion of esos as part of employee wages for the r d tax credit undermines its attempt to avoid tax liability by arguing those esos are not related to the same research activity.although related to in d and for in b a are not identical terms,they convey essentially the same thing in the context of each provision the expense must be part of the compensation given to an employee involved in the relevant activity.
accordingly,xilinx arguments that its esos have nothing to do with r d,are issued company wide and are not viewed by the employees who receive them as related to their r d are misplaced.the same can be said of any component of an employee compensation package.for example,health benefits given to a company employees are not tied to any particular task an employee performs,yet the cost of those benefits borne by the employer is still related to the work its employees do.the cost of health benefits was specifically included among the items to be shared between xilinx and xi as part of the total r d costs.for employees who work on r d,the cost of health benefits for that employee is plainly related to the company r d activities.
xilinx also focuses on the considerable evidence it presented to the tax court proving companies operating at arm length do not share the cost of esos.it maintains those companies would share eso costs if they were in fact related to a joint venture,just as they share all other costs related to the project,and points out that not even the united states allows contractors hired to conduct r d to bill the government for the cost of esos.xilinx believes the reason companies operating at arm length do not share esos must be that the cost is not related to the joint venture.the evidence presented to the tax court,however,suggests three reasons why companies operating at arm length do not share eso costs,none of which have anything to do with whether the cost is related to the joint venture.first,as xilinx has pointed out,unlike most costs,companies bear no expense for esos in fact,the exercise of esos results in cash inflow.even though companies can estimate the accounting cost of esos,the tax court found those costs can not be measured precisely,so companies operating at arm length may elect not to share esos,because agreeing how to value something with no present cost might be a sticking point in negotiating an agreement.second,the tax court noted the cost of esos is tied to the value of one company stock,so sharing this cost might create a perverse incentive for the other company to minimize the economic value of the joint venture in order to keep its partner stock value low and thereby limit its own share of the cost for its partner esos.finally,a company operating at arm length has an incentive not to share eso costs,to the extent those costs can be deducted as a business expense.what company would not like to bear the full cost of something that imposes no expense and confers the benefit of a tax deduction although the record conclusively establishes that companies in a joint venture operating at arm length do not share eso costs,none of the possible explanations for this fact demonstrate eso costs are unrelated to the joint venture.
accordingly,we hold esos are related to the work performed by the employees who receive them.the eso costs for employees who were involved in activities that would contribute to the joint venture between xilinx and xi therefore should have been shared.based on the record before us,however,we can not conclusively determine whether the commissioner allocation is limited only to employees involved in the joint venture and takes into account whether employees spent all or only part of their time on tasks relevant to the joint venture.accordingly,we remand to the tax court on the narrow issue of determining whether the commissioner allocation accurately reflects eso costs for employees involved in tasks related to the joint venture.
iv.conclusion 
we hold that d all costs requirement is irreconcilable with b requirement that an arm length standard should apply in every case and that d,as the more specific of the two provisions,controls.we further hold esos are costs related to the intangible development area and therefore must be shared between controlled parties in a cost sharing agreement.we therefore reverse the tax court,because the commissioner allocation was appropriate to the extent it involved eso costs xilinx claimed as a business expense deduction and was limited to esos for employees involved in the joint venture.we remand so that the tax court may ensure the commissioner allocation is consistent with our holding.
xilinx may have been caught off guard by the deficiency notices,which is understandable given the absence of any public guidance that the commissioner would interpret the cost sharing regulation to require sharing of eso costs.this result is nonetheless mandated by the plain meaning of d,which we have concluded controls over b.we are troubled,however,by the imposition of accuracy related penalties here.although we have construed the regulations in a manner favorable to the commissioner,we rejected the commissioner attempted harmonization of and along the way.moreover,the secretary has since promulgated new regulations clarify ing this issue by explicitly including esos as costs to be shared.when even the government has found it necessary to clarify the regulations,we have our doubts that imposing a penalty on taxpayers for their failure to follow the letter of the law is appropriate.on remand,the tax court may also consider any defenses xilinx raised against the commissioner imposition of accuracy related penalties.
reversed and remanded.
the commissioner of internal revenue has issued regulations that are irreconcilable.these are the regulations relevant to this case.we have three alternatives 
hold that when the commissioner talks out of both sides of his mouth,his speech is unintelligible and his regulations are unenforceable.
apply a rule of thumb the specific controls the general.
resolve the conflict based on the dominant purpose of the regulations,aided by the basic rule that ambiguous documents are to be interpreted against the drafter and further enlightened by the way the treasury has proceeded in drafting tax treaties relevant to american parents and their foreign subsidiaries.
the majority has chosen the second alternative.it is a simple solution.it is plausible.but it is wrong.it converts a canon of construction into something like a statute.it ignores the international context and the treasury own practice.in what follows,i will spell out this mistake and why i chose the third alternative.
the problem.the majority put it well 
section b specifies that the true taxable income of controlled parties is calculated based on how parties operating at arm length would behave.the language is unequivocal this arm length standard is to be applied in every case.in the context of cost sharing agreements,this would require controlled parties to share only those costs uncontrolled parties would share.by implication,costs that uncontrolled parties would not share need not be shared.in contrast,d specifies that controlled parties in a cost sharing agreement must share all costs related to the intangible development area,and that phrase is explicitly defined to include virtually all expenses not included in the cost of goods.the plain language does not permit any exceptions,even for costs that unrelated parties would not share.each provision plain language mandates a different result.accordingly,we conclude the two provisions establish distinct and irreconcilable standards for determining which costs must be shared between controlled parties in cost sharing agreements specifically related to intangible product development.
the handy canon of construction.often the specific controls the general.this rule has been used by the supreme court,long island care at home,coke,d.apply this simple rule here,and section d controls.the conflict dissolves.the commissioner is vindicated.
this simple solution is all too pat.it gives controlling importance to a single canon of construction.but,as every judge knows,the canons of construction are many and their interaction complex.the canons are not mandatory rules.chickasaw nation united states,d.they are guides designed to help judges determine the legislature intent.id.they can be overcome by other circumstances manifesting that intent.id.the canons are tools designed to help courts better determine what congress intended,not to lead courts to interpret the law contrary to that intent.scheidler national org.of women,d.in the light of these principles,three considerations show the commissioner position to be untenable.
purpose.first,the purpose of the regulation is paramount.that purpose is parity between taxpayers in uncontrolled transactions and taxpayers in controlled transactions.the regulations are not to be construed to stultify that purpose.if the standard of arm length is trumped by d the purpose of the statute is frustrated.if xilinx can not deduct all its stock option costs,xilinx does not have parity with an independent taxpayer.under the majority holding,the law is interpreted contrary to the intent of its maker.
a basic rule.second,a very old canon of construction applies in this case,in which the complex statutory and regulatory scheme leads itself to any number of interpretations.we resolve the inconsistencies against the government.united dominion industries,united states,d thomas,concurring and citing,among other cases,united states merriam.if the words are doubtful,the doubt must be resolved against the government and in favor of the taxpayer.this canon of construction is framed in the cases just cited as particularly relevant to tax statutes.it is,however,not a concession to taxpayers.it is the way legal documents are read.the draft is construed against the drafter.
treasury practice.the purpose of the regulations and the normative rules of interpretation deny recognition to the commissioner position on d.additionally,his own agency has undercut him in the tax treaty between the united states and ireland,signed into law by president clinton on july.the announced purpose of the tax treaty is the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to income and capital gains.
