opinion of the court 
the distinction between a loan and an advance payment for the purpose of whether the funds received are to be treated as income subject to federal income tax is not always apparent on the face of the documents.instead,the issue is to be determined after an examination of all the facts and circumstances.comm r indianapolis power light,d internal citation and quotation marks omitted.the applicable law is not uncertain.it is settled that receipt of a loan is not income to the borrower.id.on the other hand,funds received are taxable as income upon receipt if they constitute advance payments id.the courts determinations as to which side of the line a particular payment falls have not always been consistent.in the appeal before us we must decide whether the tax court erred in characterizing the payment received by appellant as income,for which it had been issued a notice of deficiency.
appellant karns prime fancy food,is a pennsylvania corporation that operates grocery stores in the harrisburg,pennsylvania area.during the taxable year ended january,karns operated five grocery stores in harrisburg,pennsylvania.karns principal supplier was super rite foods,a wholly owned subsidiary of rich foods.karns ceo,scott karns,prepared a capital budget in and determined that karns required million for capital improvements in the coming years.karns approached dale conklin,president of super rite,about borrowing funds from super rite.super rite did not generally make loans to its customers,but would,from time to time,make funds available to certain of its creditworthy and strategically important customers.appellant br.at.due to karns loan obligations with its primary requested and obtained a waiver from pnc in order to secure the funds that super rite was willing to provide.
super rite requires customers to whom it provides financial assistance to enter into a supply and requirements agreement supply agreement whereby the customer,in this case karns,agrees to purchase a minimum dollar amount of products from super rite.super rite also requires the customer to execute a promissory note payable to super rite in the amount of the funds it provided.thus,super rite agreed to make million immediately available to karns and karns executed a promissory note to super rite on april.karns signed the supply agreement on april,
pursuant to that agreement,karns agreed to repay the note in six annual payments of.significantly,the agreement provided that if karns met the supply requirement for the previous calendar year at issue by purchasing the stipulated amount of super rite products,the due and owing for that year would be forgiven.karns received the million on may.karns recorded the note on its books as a longterm note payable.super rite recorded the note as an asset and amortized the note monthly over the period.
a.the supply and requirements agreement 
the supply agreement provided that super rite would be the principal wholesaler for all of karns purchased products in the harrisburg geographical area.karns agreed to purchase million worth of product annually from super rite.in addition,karns agreed to super rite general policies and practices in effect,with respect to,for instance,product pricing karns paid a markup for grocery products,for dairy products,and for frozen products,billing and payment terms,and returns and credits for purchased products.under the terms of the agreement,karns was given seven days to make payment for its product purchases.failure to do so constituted default,and super rite had the right to suspend shipments during the term of default.any default under the supply agreement also constituted a default under the note,thus requiring the balance under the note to become due immediately.
under the terms of the supply agreement,super rite could cancel the agreement if karns filed for bankruptcy,failed to pay in accordance with the agreement,or was in default of any material contract,instrument or agreement,including,without limitation,any lease of real property,any material lease of personal property or any promissory note,instrument or agreement evidencing or in respect of any indebtedness for borrowed money or any security therefor app.at.karns had the right to cancel the agreement in the event that super rite filed for bankruptcy protection.karns granted super rite a security interest in its assets,including inventory,accounts,equipment,and proceeds.karns agreed to make its internal financial statements available within ninety days of each fiscal quarter and a financial statement prepared by its independent accountant every six months.finally,karns gave super rite a right of first refusal if karns shareholders sold either the corporation or its assets to a third party.
b.the note 
the promissory note had a face value of million.interest on the unpaid balance was to be paid at prime plus.the note was to be repaid in six annual payments of commencing april,and continuing on the third friday of each april thereafter up to and including april.the note also provided the following 
payment of the annual payment shall be forgiven by the lender if the lender determines that borrower is in compliance with,and shall not have materially breached or then be in uncured default under,that certain supply and requirements agreement of even date herewith among the borrower and lender.the entire unpaid and unforgiven principal balance hereof shall be due and payable,if prior to april,borrower ceases,for any reason,to use lender as its primary food supplier.
app.at emphasis added.
karns spent of the million received from super rite on capital improvements and temporarily invested the balance in certificates of deposit.the cds were then pledged to pnc as collateral for a new loan from pnc.that was in turn invested in further capital improvements.
in august,supervalu,acquired rich foods parent of super rite.soon thereafter,karns decided to relocate one of its stores.in order to satisfy the new lessor concerns,karns requested that supervalu guarantee its new lease.on or about january,supervalu agreed to guarantee karns lease in return the parties amended the april,supply agreement to reflect the guarantee and karns entered into several agreements with supervalu,including,inter alia,an agreement that granted supervalu a security interest in some of karns assets.
karns satisfied the supply agreement for the periods ending april,and april,and otherwise complied with,did not materially breach,and was not in uncured default under that agreement.karns prime fancy food,comm r,cch.because karns fulfilled the purchase requirements and the other covenants,the required annual payments of on the promissory note were forgiven.in its january,and january,tax returns karns reported the debt forgiveness of as other of supplier note agreement.app.at.
in,karns sought an additional from supervalu in order to facilitate a move to a new location vacated by fleming foods,a food wholesaler who declared bankruptcy.karns needed the funds to buy out the remainder of its existing lease and to purchase inventory and fixtures at the new location.supervalu agreed,and karns executed a promissory note to supervalu on march,in the amount of with interest at per year.karns executed new agreements,including a second amendment to the supply agreement,which increased the annual purchase requirements from super rite from to million.the note called for debt service payments to be made annually from march,through march,but the new supply agreement did not extend the term of the original supply agreement beyond april.
karns met the purchase requirement of million for the period ending march,and therefore did not pay the due annually under the note.for the period ended march,karns purchased only million from supervalu,and it had to pay toward the annual payment due under the march,note.
the commissioner of the internal revenue service mailed a notice of deficiency to karns for its federal income tax year ending january,in the amount of on october.the basis for the claimed deficiency was karns failure to include the million payment from super rite as income in its tax return.karns timely petitioned the tax court for a redetermination of the tax deficiency.the tax court had jurisdiction pursuant to a,and.after a trial,the court entered its decision on october,holding that the million payment to karns was not a loan and thus was includable in karns gross income.karns,at.karns filed a timely notice of appeal to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

most of the cases grappling with the issue have focused on the treatment of advance payments for purposes of taxation,probably because that was the factual pattern before the supreme court in indianapolis power,the leading decision on this issue.
in indianapolis power,the indianapolis power light company ipl required certain customers to make deposits with it to assure payment of future bills for electric service.at.although ipl commingled the funds received with other receipts and did not segregate them,it did not treat the deposits as income on its books but instead carried them as current liabilities.id.at.the internal revenue service irs had a different view of the transactions.it viewed the deposits as advance payments for electricity and assessed deficiencies on the ground that the deposits were gross income,taxable to ipl upon receipt.id.at.the tax court disagreed with the irs.id.at.it held that the principal purpose of the deposits was to serve as security rather than as prepayment of income.id.the court of appeals for the seventh circuit affirmed.id.
the supreme court granted certiorari to resolve the conflict between the seventh circuit decision and the eleventh circuit decision in city gas of florida comm r,cir.in the course of its opinion,the court provided guidance as to the distinction for taxation purposes between an advance payment and a loan.the court stated,i n economic terms,the distinction between a loan and an advance payment is one of degree rather than of kind.indianapolis power,at.it explained,t he issue turns upon the nature of the rights and obligations that are assumed when the transaction occurs.id.at.
the court held that the advance deposits were not income to ipl when received,stating that such dominion as ipl has over these customer deposits is insufficient for the deposits to qualify as taxable income at the time they are made.id.at.in holding that the deposits were not the economic equivalent of advance payments,the court noted that the customers who made the deposits retain ed the right to insist upon repayment in cash,whereas the individual who makes an advance payment retains no right to insist upon return of the funds so long as the recipient fulfills the terms of the bargain,the money is its to keep.id.at.
in rejecting the irs attempt to analogize the ipl customers security deposits to advance payments,the court stated that although there was some similarity in that a n advance payment,like the deposits at issue here,concededly protects the seller against the risk that it would be unable to collect money owed it after it has furnished goods or services,an advance payment does much more it protects against the risk that the purchaser will back out of the deal before the seller performs.from the moment an advance payment is made,the seller is assured that,so long as it fulfills its contractual obligation,the money is its to keep.id.at.
then,in the sentence that may be most applicable to the situation before us,the court stated,here,in contrast,a customer submitting a deposit to ipl made no commitment to purchase a specified quantity of electricity,or indeed to purchase any electricity at all.id.at.because ipl right to keep the money depended upon the customer purchase of electricity and that customer decision to have the deposit applied to future bills,the court noted that ipl dominion over the fund is far less complete than is ordinarily the case in an situation.id.at.
it is not easy to analogize the facts in indianapolis power to the facts in the case before us because the transactions and the positions of the parties are different.nor is the rite transaction the same as the advance payment transaction discussed in that case.however,if the super rite loan and the accompanying supply agreement are considered as an advance rebate,the analogy becomes clearer.super rite provided karns with million on condition that it purchase million of super rite products a year.when it did so,it was relieved of the obligation to pay super rite.this agreement has all the indicia of an agreement to rebate a year in advance.some indication of the court view of a loan transaction such as the one before us can be gleaned from the court distinction in indianapolis power between a loan and an advance payment taxable upon receipt.after stating that the taxability of the receipts must be determined by examining the relationship between the parties at the time of the deposit,the court stated in the language quoted above,so long as the recipient fulfills the terms of the bargain,the money is its to keep.id.at.that is the key element in a transaction,such as the one before us,where the supplier gave cash in advance to a retailer in exchange for a volume commitment.as long as karns fulfilled its terms of the bargain,to purchase million of super rite product,the money was its to keep.
that was the basis for the decision of the tax court in this case that the funds karns received were income,not a loan.in distinguishing indianapolis power from this case,the tax court noted that in indianapolis power the supreme court held that ipl did not have complete dominion over the deposits in question because it did not have some guarantee that it would be allowed to keep them.karns,at.the tax court pointed out that the customers in indianapolis power,and not ipl itself,controlled whether ipl would keep the deposits.the court contrasted that with the situation before us,stating karns had some guarantee that,for each annual period covered by the april,supply agreement and the corresponding april,note,it would be allowed to keep the amount of the annual payment set forth in that note as long as,for each such period,it lived up to its end of the bargain by not materially breaching the april,supply agreement.id.
the logic of the supreme court holding in indianapolis power applies here.according to that decision,if the taxpayer has some guarantee that it will be allowed to retain the funds,then it has complete dominion over the money.indianapolis power,at.such is the case here.karns,and karns alone,was at all times in control of whether it would meet the supply agreement.therefore,the funds provided to karns were in substance a projected rebate for products to be supplied,analogous to an advance payment,and as such were taxable income.
karns argues that the transaction was a loan and not an advance payment because any potential forgiveness under the loan was a condition subsequent.appellant br.at.from karns perspective it had an unconditional obligation to repay the note such obligation could only be expunged upon karns fulfillment of the supply agreement.however,this position exalts the form of the transaction over its substance.if karns chose to meet the supply requirement,then super rite was obligated to forgive the indebtedness.conversely,if karns chose not to live up to the supply agreement the funds under the note would become due.therefore,karns focus on the fact that it had an unconditional obligation to repay is misplaced.the point is that it was karns,and not super rite,that was in control over whether the obligation would be triggered.
although the dissent recognizes that the facts in westpac pacific food comm r,cir,are distinguishable from those before us,we must discuss that court opinion because the result differs from the one that we reach today.westpac,a partnership of three grocery store chains,entered into four contracts with four different suppliers promising to buy a minimum quantity of merchandise and received a volume discount in the form of cash up front.id.at.if westpac failed to purchase the required quantity,it was obligated to refund the cash advance pro rata.on the other hand,if it purchased the required quantity,its obligation to repay would be nullified.id.the court of appeals held that c ash advances in exchange for volume purchase commitments,subject to pro rata repayment if the volume commitments are not met,are not income when received.id.at.the court reasoned that even though the recipient of a loan may have complete dominion over the funds received,such funds do not become income until there is an accession to wealth.id.
the westpac court realized that it had to contend with two decisions of the supreme court that suggested a contrary result.in automobile club of michigan comm r,d,the court held that prepaid membership dues were properly characterized as income when received.the reasoning behind the supreme court holding was that pro rata application of the dues to each month had no bearing on the services that the club had to perform when called upon.similarly,in schlude comm r,d,the court held that cash paid to a dance studio for ballroom dancing lessons was income when received,not when the lessons were provided.in a very brief statement constituting the totality of its analysis of these cases,the court in westpac stated that its case is like indianapolis power,not automobile club of michigan or schlude.westpac,at.the westpac court ignored the discussion in indianapolis power,quoted at length above,that so long as the recipient fulfills the terms of the bargain,the money is its to keep.at.
the dissenting opinion of our colleague argues that the supply agreement and the note are not one unitary advance rebate,because the supply agreement contained a liquidated damages clause,thereby proving that the loan did not simply function as a mechanism for quick collection of any unearned rebates but rather was a bona fide loan.however,the parties before us considered the supply agreement and the note to be one unitary device.for instance,in its brief karns states,super rite agreed to loan sic the million requested by karns and karns executed a promissory note in favor of super rite in the amount of million.at the same time,karns agreed to enter into a supply and requirements agreement.appellant br.at emphasis added see also appellant br.at although the n ote is dated april,and the supply agreement april,the documents were executed at the same time.karns itself does not characterize the note as an independent transaction.instead,it states that a default under the supply and requirements agreement would constitute a default under the n ote and the unpaid balance would become immediately due and payable.id.at.
the dissent attempts to avoid the effect of that analysis by hypothesizing situations under which super rite could cancel the supply agreement.the dissent speculates that super rite could cancel the supply agreement,and then karns would have to pay.the dissent overlooks,or ignores,the provisions in the note requiring super rite to forgive the annual payment as long as karns is in material compliance with its obligation under the supply agreement.see app.at the annual payment shall be forgiven.thus,as we noted above,the control is in karns hands.
we disagree with the dissent view that super rite had immense latitude to cancel the supply agreement.the dissent relies on section vi of the agreement in making this point.however,the discretion referred to in that paragraph is hardly broad.indeed,it is quite can occur only upon the occurrence of a material adverse change in the condition financial or otherwise,business or prospects of the retailer or any guarantor of the retailer liabilities and obligations hereunder.app.at emphasis added.because the agreement requires the change to be not only material,but also adverse,there is little room left for super rite discretion.
in an attempt to show that karns has no guarantee that it would be able to keep the million,the dissent points to super rite option to terminate and calls the clause illusory.however,a termination option does not make a promise illusory where,as here,one party reserves the power to terminate for good cause or on some condition that is not wholly controlled by the promisor will.corbin on contracts,at,citing,inter alia,new england oil island oil mktg,cir seller of million barrels of oil with option not to deliver if the wells produced less.only an actual termination would affect karns duty under the contract.see termination occurs when either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or law puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach.on termination all obligations which are still executory on both sides are discharged.thus,regardless whether a termination option existed for super rite,absent the exercise of that option for cause,karns still was obligated to meet certain purchase minimums and super rite still was obligated to allow karns to keep the payment if it did.in other words,so long as karns fulfilled the terms of the bargain,the money was its to keep.indianapolis power,at.
the dissent conjectures that karns might not continue to be viable.there is no suggestion in the facts that this is the case.to the contrary,karns operated with the understanding that it would not be required to repay any of the funds.see app.at deposition of scott karns,ceo of he anticipate d that he would meet his purchase obligations such that the outstanding balance due supervalu as a result of the money transfer in would be zero.in fact,karns did not repay the funds with the exception of the fourth year after karns and supervalu agreed to increase the minimum purchase amount in by million in,karns was required to pay a pro rata portion of.app.at.supervalu treated this as a sales rebate that karns failed to earn through its failure to meet the minimum purchase requirements that year.id.at.the tax court was dealing with a real life contract in a real life situation,and it decided accordingly.
for the reasons set forth above,we disagree with the dissent as well as with the ninth circuit decision in westpac 
for the reasons set forth above,we will affirm the judgment of the tax court 
i join judge sloviter opinion in full.i write separately to supplement,from the accounting side,why i believe the result she reaches is correct and that of the ninth circuit and by implication,that of our dissenting colleague is unpersuasive.
as a preliminary comment,this case is about timing.the value of money depends on when it is received.both loans and advance payments confer an economic benefit on recipients because they allow the recipient both immediate use of the money with the chance to realize earnings thereon and the opportunity to make a profit by providing goods or services at a cost lower than the amount of the payment.comm r indianapolis power light,d emphasis in original.yet,under our laws the tax consequences for these two types of money transfers differ.whereas loans are not taxable upon receipt,advance payments are.id.at.citations omitted oak,comm r,wl.
contrary decisions in the ninth circuit 
in westpac pacific food comm r,the ninth circuit concluded that an payment with a conditional pro rata repayment liability was a nontaxable loan,cir it based its decision on assertions that there was no absolute repayment obligation,and t here was no accession to wealth when westpac got the cash,id.at.the opinion for the majority here has dealt with the first part of this reasoning as karns,not super rite,controlled whether the obligation to repay would occur i address the second part.
for the westpac court,the case was very simple,as told through the following hypothetical 
harry homeowner goes to the furniture store,spots just the right dining room chairs for each,and says i take four,if you give me a discount.negotiating a discount,he pays only for the chairs.he has not made,he has spent.now suppose harry homeowner is short on cash,and negotiates a deal where the furniture store gives him a discount as a cash advance instead of the off.this means the store gives him cash back today,and he pays for the four chairs when they are delivered shortly after the first of the year.harry can not go home and say i made today unless he plans to skip out on his obligation to pay for the four chairs.even though he receives the cash,he has not made money by buying the chairs.he has to sell the chairs for more than if he wants to make money on them.the reason why the cash back is not income is that,like a loan,the money is encumbered with a repayment obligation to the furniture store and the cash back must be repaid if harry does not perform his obligation.
id.at emphasis added.this case is that simple,the court reiterated,except that it involves a little more math and a lot more money convinced that the agreement in that case was a nontaxable loan,the westpac court commented that i t is hard to think of a way to make money by buying things.id.at.let check that out.
ii.the ninth circuit tax shelter,or how to make money by buying things 
consider a hypothetical involving hal homeowner,who would like to open a grocery distribution center out of his garage.hal goes to the supermarket and,like harry,is short on cash.also consider what happens when hal homeowner files his taxes,which makes any simple hypothetical more complex.we will suppose that hal makes a profit on the value of each carton,meaning that for every worth of food he buys he resells for.we will also assume a typical corporate tax rate of which the government applied to karns applies here.
hal homeowner walks into a supermarket and eyes cartons of food for each that would be ideal for his garage.the store owner sees what hal homeowner has in mind,and when it becomes clear that hal has no money but a lot of potential,the owner puts this offer on the table i will give you off now if you agree to buy five cartons worth of food each year for the next six years.under this scheme,hal pays each year just for five cartons.this is an example of a volume supply discount similar to the one that harry homeowner negotiated hal has gotten a off deal,except there is no cash advance involved here,which makes the tax calculation straightforward.each year,hal simply pays for worth of goods.he deducts that in business expenses and reports in resale to yield a taxable income of,which carries a tax liability of per year.
now suppose the store owner proposes this i will give you now if you buy worth of food each year for the next six years.this will get you started with your business,and you can just pay me back the at the end of the year from your resale proceeds.hal can not go home and say i made today,because he has an unconditional obligation to repay the loan at the end of the year.at the end of the first year,hal duly pays back the loan,and on his tax forms he simply deducts as business expenses from his total resale proceeds of to yield a taxable income of,which carries a tax liability of each year.this is per year less than the tax liability in scenario,which makes sense because hal makes less each year.
the reason that the was not income is that it was subject to an unconditional repayment obligation,notwithstanding whether hal performed on his contract by meeting minimum purchase requirements.in other words,it was a bona fide loan.
suppose the store owner proposes this i give you now if you agree to buy five cartons worth of food each year for the next six years.if you can manage that,you do have to worry about paying me back at the end of the year.this seems like quite a deal to hal,who readily agrees.at the end of the first year,hal deducts on his tax returns in business expenses for the food minus cash back off the full purchase price given in exchange for the purchase commitment,and reports in resale proceeds to yield a gross income of,which carries a tax liability of.this is the same as the tax liability in scenario,for hal has made the same amount.in subsequent years,hal deducts in business expenses and reports in resale proceeds to yield a gross income of each year,which carries an annual tax liability of.
when he first made the deal,hal could go home and say,i made today,because he did not plan to skip out on his obligation to buy five cartons each year,was confident that he would resell the goods for profit,and thus had some assurance that he could keep his money and make back the rest from the proceeds of his resale.with this understanding,the given to him at the outset was an advance payment that was taxable income when received.
so far,there is little cause for controversy over how hal has done his taxes.he reported his profits as gross income in scenario the volume supply discount without a cash advance he repaid his loan and then reported his profits as gross income in scenario the loan and he reported his profits,along with the amount of cash he received up front,as gross income in scenario the advance payment.what happens if hal wants to do his taxes a little differently in scenario in order to save some money 
the facts are the same as scenario,but hal does his tax reporting differently.instead of deducting in the first year,hal deducts in business expenses and reports resale proceeds of to yield a gross income of in the first year,which carries a tax liability.hal plans on waiting until the end of his term to pay tax on the as other income,loan forgiveness.he has realized a tax savings the difference between due on in scenario and due on in this scenario.
by deferring the taxes due on the,hal is able to take advantage now of the cash plus the he makes in profits without paying taxes on that full amount.put differently,this means that he is able to take advantage of a tax savings in the first year.if he pays taxes on the as income in the year of receipt as in scenario,the present value of his tax liability over the course of the deal is but if hal defers payment of taxes on the until the end of year as in scenario,the present value of his tax liability will be only over this same period.the present value of his total tax savings is a difference of in scenario minus in scenario,which is negligible when dealing in amounts so small.but the amount grows when dealing in millions.
in karns case,the deferral of the tax payment resulted in a savings of about by year same amount that the government argues is owed in back taxes.this sort of difference demonstrates how advance payments confer an economic benefit.as noted,they allow the recipient immediate use of the money or savings and the opportunity to make a profit by providing goods or services at a cost lower than the amount of the payment.indianapolis power,at.emphasis in original.for in scenario hal business expenses actually are only minus the advance,and by reporting his expenses as,he inflates his business deductions.he has gained immediate use of the money and is able to profit by providing goods at a cost lower than the amount of the payment,resulting in a tax savings in the first year.the arrangement in this case is similar.the lesson when taxes on funds advanced in year are deferred and goods purchased in year are resold for profit,money indeed can be made by buying things.
iii.conclusion 
at first blush,both tax payment now or pay appear to be merely alternate ways of doing the math,because hal homeowner and karns will eventually pay taxes on the money.but we can not view the pay later method as just another way of calculating taxes,because our laws require otherwise.first,karns avails itself of an economic benefit t
