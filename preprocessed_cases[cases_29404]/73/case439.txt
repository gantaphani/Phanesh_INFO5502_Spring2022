factual and procedural background 
charles thomas clayton is a radiologist who resides and practices in texas.clayton regularly filed federal income tax returns until he associated with a tax protest organization in.he did not file a tax return or pay tax on his income.in october,he pleaded guilty to willful failure to file a federal income tax return for and was sentenced to one year probation.he subsequently filed his and tax returns.
the events giving rise to the present conviction center on clayton tax returns for through.in,clayton began associating with larken rose,a tax protestor.together they launched a website and produced a video promoting the argument,which asserted that the domestic income of american citizens is not taxed via the internal revenue code irc.around this time,clayton also began writing letters to the internal revenue service irs and government officials,demanding that they refute the argument,and meeting with accountants to ask questions about the federal income tax code.clayton received numerous replies explaining the fallacy of the argument,which clayton patently refused to accept.
clayton did not file returns for calendar years through,although he earned over million during that period.he also filed amended tax returns for and,via two form,amended individual income tax return forms,in which he reported his income as zero and requested a refund of in tax.specifically,in april,he filed a form for reporting that his adjusted gross income was not,as he had originally reported,but.he claimed a refund of.in april,he filed a form for reporting that his adjusted gross income was not,as he had originally reported,but.he claimed a refund of.clayton attached lengthy memoranda to each amended return based on the argument.
on april,clayton was charged with two counts of making and subscribing a false form amended individual income tax return for calendar years and in violation of.the indictment also charged him with six counts of willful failure to file a tax return for calendar years through,in violation of.with respect to the six counts of willful failure to file a tax return,clayton filed a motion to dismiss the indictment,arguing that the government could not satisfy the first element of the offense,namely that he was required by law to file income tax returns for these years,because the irc does not establish a valid exemption amount that triggers the duty to pay taxes.the district court denied this motion.clayton also submitted two jury instructions concerning his theory of defense to the two counts of filing a false tax return.the district court rejected his instructions.the jury found clayton guilty of all eight counts on august.on september,clayton filed a rule motion for a judgment of acquittal on the two counts of filing a false tax return,which the district court denied.clayton was sentenced to a total of sixty months incarceration.subsequently,we denied clayton motion for release on bail pending appeal,concluding that clayton had not shown that his appeal raises a substantial question of law or fact.
ii.discussion 
whether inclusion of the consumer price index negates the duty to file a tax return 
clayton argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the six counts of willful failure to file a federal tax return because the court erroneously determined that the government satisfied the first element of a clayton was required to file a federal tax return.see united states buckley,cir providing that in order to establish a violation of,the government must prove that the defendant was required to file a return that the defendant failed to file a return and that the failure to file a return was willful see also united states matosky,cir same sansone united states,d.
clayton contends that no law requires the filing of a federal income tax return because,in establishing the exemption amount in the government failed to comply with the procedural requirements of the administrative procedure act apa.clayton contends that the statute reliance on the consumer price index cpi to calculate the exemption strips the exemption amount of legal force because the cpi is compiled by the department of labor dol and has not been promulgated pursuant to the apa 
we review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.united states adam,cir.
clayton argument that an exemption amount based on the cpi can not trigger tax liability is unpersuasive.clayton obligation to file a federal income tax return is derived from.section,being a congressionally enacted federal statute,is not the rule of an agency as the term agency is defined by the apa.see franklin massachusetts,d explaining that t he apa defines agency as each authority of the government of the united states,whether or not it is within or subject to review by another agency,but explicitly does not include the congress citing b.the fact that incorporates by reference the cpi,which is compiled and published by an agency of the dol,does not cause the apa to be invoked.in this context,the cpi is simply an ascertainable numerical standard,and there is no requirement that such a standard incorporated into a statute be itself an enforceable rule of law.ashcroft aclu,d holding that the incorporation of community standards,by itself,did not make the child online protection act unconstitutionally overbroad.
furthermore,a statute providing the basis for criminal prosecution may incorporate other provisions by reference.see united states iverson,cir.in united states iverson,the ninth circuit held that a state statute and municipal code that incorporated by reference federal standards for the term pollutants did not fail for unconstitutional vagueness.id.the court reasoned that a statute is not unconstitutionally vague merely because it incorporates other provisions by reference a reasonable person of ordinary intelligence would consult the incorporated provisions.id.
the ninth circuit rationale is persuasive here.the cpi is an objective standard that has been approved by congress,via the irc,to adjust the bare minimum exemption amount of for inflation.a reasonable person of ordinary intelligence,if he did not want to avail himself of the irs documents and notices publishing the applicable exemption amounts,would consult the cpi and make the necessary calculations to determine his gross income for tax purposes.see pond comm r,cir unpublished explaining that the irc provision of a specific number,and a statutory formula for adjusting that number,adequately defines the exemption amount and permits a taxpayer to be penalized for noncompliance see also united states priest,wl,at cir.july,unpublished mem.holding that the alleged imprecision caused by incorporating the cpi in determining a statutorily provided exemption does not void,as a matter of law,the obligation to file a tax return.
whether the denial of the defense jury instructions was an abuse of discretion 
clayton argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying the jury instructions he requested on his theory of defense to the two counts of filing a false income tax return.
we review a properly preserved challenge to jury instructions for an abuse of discretion.united states finley,cir.a district court has broad discretion in framing the instructions to the jury and this c ourt will not reverse unless the instructions taken as a whole do not correctly reflect the issues and law.united states mckinney,cir.while a defendant is entitled to an instruction on his theory of defense,he has no right to particular wording.united states simmons,cir.when considering an appeal for failure to give defendant requested defense theory instruction,we review whether the court charge,as a whole,is a correct statement of the law and whether it clearly instructs jurors as to the principles of law applicable to the factual issues confronting them.id.quoting mckinney,at emphasis added.
a person commits the felony of filing a false tax return in violation of when he w illfully makes and subscribes any return,statement,or other document,which contains or is verified by a written declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury,and which he does not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter.
clayton requested two jury instructions concerning his theory of defense to the counts of filing a false income tax return for and.clayton theory of defense at trial was that the two form that he submitted to amend his tax returns for and were not false returns,but rather were proper and lawful claims for refunds.clayton asserted that he filed form returns to initiate a process whereby,if his claims for a refund were denied,he could present in a later district court proceeding his argument that income derived from sources within the united states is income.accordingly,he attached to his two form returns lengthy memoranda explaining his argument.clayton contends that whether the returns were false or were claims for refunds was a central focus of the trial,and,based on the evidence,the jury could have concluded these issues in favor of clayton.
the jury instructions clayton requested detail the form filing procedure and are as follows 
refund lawsuits 
if a taxpayer has filed a return and paid taxes for a prior year,he may seek a refund of taxes paid for that year.this is accomplished by filing a form within years thereof.if such a claim is denied,a taxpayer may sue to recover the refund and may assert in such refund lawsuit whatever legal arguments he believes are valid.
refund suits 
a taxpayer is barred from raising in a refund suit grounds for recovery not clearly and specifically set forth in his claim for a refund on form,including all attachments.all grounds upon which the taxpayer relies must be stated in his claim for refund so as to apprise the irs of what to look into.anything not raised in the claim can not be raised later in a suit for a refund.the refund suit must be filed in either federal district court or a claims court,but can not in sic tax court.
clayton argument lacks merit because his proposed jury instructions are misleading.clayton asserts that a form can not give rise to liability for filing a false tax return because it is simply a form used to claim a refund.see a.his instructions would serve to bolster that argument.form is entitled amended individual income tax return and is verified by a written declaration that it was made under penalties of perjury.because form is used to report all changes or corrections to a filed return,even when the form is used to claim a refund,it is still a return that amends an originally filed return.as such,form can give rise to liability for filing a false tax return.
our decisions,and those of other circuits,support the conclusion that filing a false claim for the refund of taxes gives rise to legal liability for filing a false tax return.see,united states martin,cir defendant convicted of conspiracy to aid and assist in the preparation of false tax returns and false tax refund claims in violation of and,united states ambort,cir defendant convicted of counts of aiding and assisting in the preparation of false federal tax returns,in violation of,for advising individuals on how to complete form and the nonresident alien income tax return form.moreover,use of a legal procedure to challenge tax liability does not preclude criminal liability.in ambort,where a defendant advised clients to file form to avoid tax liability,he attempted to avoid conviction on charges of aiding and assisting in the preparation of false federal tax returns by arguing that he was simply following established procedures for obtaining a refund.id.at.the tenth circuit rejected his argument,stating that the defendant could not disguise his knowing disregard of legal principles and duties as a good faith procedural effort to evade those principles and duties.id.
we have already rejected,in an unpublished opinion,as patently frivolous and absurd the argument that income derived from sources within the united states is income under.rayner comm r,cir unpublished.as such,clayton should not avoid liability for filing a false tax return simply because he used the procedural device of form to challenge his tax liability under the argument.
accordingly,because clayton proposed instructions would not clearly instruct jurors about the effect of filing a false form,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying them 
whether sufficient evidence was presented to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt 
clayton argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on the two counts of filing a false income tax return for and because the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.clayton first asserts that it is clear from the facts that he was making a claim for refund of taxes previously paid and thus could not be charged for filing false returns.he relies on our decision in united states levy,cir,for the proposition that liability can not arise from a form that is not authorized by a regulation.he contends that the form can not give rise to liability because it is identified as a claim for refund in certain tax code provisions.he further contends that form allows him to file an amended tax return based on any legal argument.
clayton next argues that the evidence that his amended returns were false falls short of proving his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.he contends that the attachments that he filed with his amended returns advancing his argument make clear that his purpose in filing the amended returns was to claim a refund,not to file a false return.he further asserts that where the evidence is evenly balanced,entry of a judgment of acquittal is proper.we review the district court denial of clayton motion for acquittal de novo.united states anderson,cir citing united states payne,cir.in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence,we view the evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the verdict,and we determine whether a rational jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.id.citing united states burton,cir payne,at.the evidence need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt,and the jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence.id.quoting burton,at.moreover,our standard of review does not change if the evidence that sustains the conviction is circumstantial rather than direct.id.citing burton,at united states cardenas,cir united states bell,cir.unit b.

clayton initial arguments,which essentially contend that the form can not give rise to legal liability for filing a false tax return,have no merit.we have rejected similar arguments brought under levy that certain schedules appended to tax returns could not give rise to legal liability for filing a false tax return.united states damon,cir holding that a false schedule c is an integral part of a tax return and is incorporated therein by reference,thus giving rise to liability under united states taylor,cir same as to schedules e and f.also,as we previously discussed,filing a fa
