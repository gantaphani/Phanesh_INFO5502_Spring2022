introduction 
in,california voters enacted proposition,which amended the california constitution by adding article xiii a article xiii a.the amendment plac ed significant limits on the taxing power of local and state governments.state building construction trades council of california city of vista cal th,fn.as pertinent here,article xiii a,section provides,cities,counties and special districts,by a vote of the qualified electors of such district,may impose special taxes on such district italics added.
in,california voters enacted proposition,which added article xiii c article xiii c and article xiii d article xiii d to the california constitution in order to close loopholes in proposition.apartment of los angeles county,city of los angeles cal th,apartment of los angeles county,article xiii c,section,subdivision d provides,no local government may impose,extend,or increase any special tax unless and until that tax is submitted to the electorate and approved by a vote.italics added.
in this appeal,we must determine whether an election held by the city of san diego the city to authorize the levying of a special tax complied with these provisions of the california constitution.in the election at issue,the city did not permit the city registered voters to vote on the special tax.instead,the city passed an ordinance that specifically defined the electorate to consist solely of the owners of real property in the city on which a hotel is located,and the lessees of real property owned by a governmental entity on which a hotel is located.
we conclude that the election was invalid under the california constitution because such landowners and lessees are neither qualified electors of the city for purposes of article xiii a,section see neilson city of california city th,neilson the term qualified electors means registered voters,quoting art.xiii a,nor do they comprise a proper electorate under article xiii c,section,subdivision d.see greene marin county flood control and water conservation dist.cal th,greene e lections pertaining to special taxes in article xiii c,section,do not permit property qualifications.
we further conclude that the election was invalid under the san diego city charter city charter because city charter section section requires the approval of of the qualified electors voting in an election on a special tax,and section of the city charter section defines q ualified e lectors as those persons who are registered to vote in general state elections under state law.accordingly,we reverse the trial court judgment validating the special tax and remand the matter to the trial court with directions to enter judgment against the city.
factual and procedural backgrounda.the convention center facilities district 
the san diego city council the city council passed an ordinance enacting a new division of the san diego municipal code the division in november.san diego,ch,div.the division authorizes the city to form a convention center facilities district ccfd in order to help finance the potential expansion of the san diego convention center through the imposition of a special tax.the ordinance explains that the ccfd would compris e the entire city,but that only hotels within the ccfd would be subject to the special tax,which would be based upon a percentage of room revenues.san diego ord.
the division incorporates and modifies numerous provisions of the mello roos community facilities act of,et mello roos act,including portions of various election procedures san diego,specified in the mello roos act as necessary to authorize the imposition of a special tax.the mello roos act special tax election procedures are defined in section and provide in relevant part 
a the legislative body shall submit the levy of any special taxes to the qualified electors of the proposed community facilities district or to the qualified electors of the territory to be annexed by the community facilities district in the next general election or in a special election 
c if the proposed special tax will not be apportioned in any tax year on any portion of property in residential use in that tax year,as determined by the legislative body,the legislative body may provide that the vote shall be by the landowners of the proposed district whose property would be subject to the tax if it were levied at the time of the election.each of these landowners shall have one vote for each acre,or portion thereof,that the landowner owns within the proposed district that would be subject to the proposed tax if it were levied at the time of the election.
the division incorporates and modifies the election procedures of the mello roos act as follows 
all election procedures set forth in the mello roos act shall apply to this division with the following exceptions 
a the qualified electors shall in all cases be the landowners.
b the city clerk shall in all cases be the elections official.
c votes shall not be allocated on the basis of acreage of real property but instead shall be allocated to each landowner on the basis of one vote for each dollar of special tax that would have been the obligation of that parcel as determined by the city council if the proposed special tax had been in place for the month period ending at the end of the month which is three months prior to the month in which the resolution calling the special election is adopted by the city council.san diego.
the division defines landowner as follows landowner means the owner of the real property upon which a hotel is located except that if the fee owner of the real property is a government entity,landowner means the lessee of the government entity.san diego.
the division further provides,any special tax imposed pursuant to this division shall be levied on the property for use of the property as a hotel or,as the case may be,levied on the leasehold interest of a hotel parcel.the special tax shall not,in any year,be levied on the residential use of the property for that year.hotel use is not residential use.san diego.
the city council passed a resolution of formation in january,through which the city finalized the proposal to finance the ccfd.san diego res.the resolution of formation incorporates a rate and method of apportionment rma of the proposed special tax to be levied upon eligible taxable parcels within the ccfd.ibid.the rma provides that the special tax would be calculated based on a percentage of hotel room revenues at one of three different rates,depending on the hotel geographic location.ibid.hotels in the downtown area would pay three percent of room revenues,while those in other areas would pay either one or two percent of their room revenues.ibid.
also in january,the city council passed a resolution proposing that the ccfd authorize the city to issue up to million in bonds to be repaid by special tax revenues levied in the ccfd.san diego res.the city council adopted a resolution authorizing a special election to submit the special tax and bond authorizations to a vote of the qualified electors within the ccfd.san diego res.the election authorization resolution states that the qualified electors would be asked the following question 
shall the san diego convention center facilities district authorize the san diego city council to levy a special tax,and issue not to exceed in bonds secured thereby and by other revenues,to finance the contiguous expansion,construction,reconstruction,rehabilitation,equipping,replacement and upgrade of the san diego convention center and related expenditures,and establish the appropriations limit for the district ibid.
b.the ccfd special tax election 
the city clerk conducted a election of the landowners in the ccfd in march and april.on april,the city clerk certified that votes were cast in the election,and that percent,or of the total votes cast,were yes votes.san diego res.based on these results,the city council declared that the special tax measure had been approved.ibid.
c.the city directs that the city clerk record a notice of special tax lien and adopts an ordinance authorizing the levying of the special tax upon a final judicial determination that the special tax is valid 
the city council directed the city clerk to record a notice of special tax lien in connection with the ccfd in may that states that no special tax shall be levied until the city has obtained a final validation judgment determining that the special tax was lawfully authorized and is valid.san diego res.
in october,the city council took action to delay implementation of the special tax at issue pending a final judgment in this case by adopting an ordinance levying the special tax within the ccfd,conditioned upon,among other events,a final determination by the court that the special tax is valid.san diego ord.
d.this validation action 
the city complaint and appellants answers 
in may,the city filed a complaint that contains a single cause of action seeking validation of the ccfd special tax.in its complaint,the city outlined the formation of the ccfd and the election approving the special tax,as described above.see pt.and pt,ante.the city asserted that the passage of the ballot proposition conferred upon the city council the authority to levy the special tax to finance the authorized facilities and issue the bonds.the city alleged that t he election was in all respects valid and binding and in accordance with law,and that t he special tax is in all respects legal,valid and binding.
appellants melvin shapiro and san diegans for open government sdog each answered the city complaint.
the parties briefing 
the parties filed briefs in the superior court pertaining to the validity of the special tax in its opening brief,the city contended that the election approving the special tax was valid under the california constitution.the city argued in part 
under article xiii a,the imposition of a special tax is subject to voter approval.section of the mello roos act adopted in after proposition establishes who or what is a qualified elector for voting purposes within a community facilities district.subdivision c authorizes an election by landowners,rather than registered voters,irrespective of the number of registered voters residing with a community facilities district,in cases where the special tax will by its own terms not be apportioned in any tax year on property in residential use,subd.c.hotel property,and transitory occupancy of hotel rooms,are not residential properties or residential uses.citation.
the division mandates that special taxes under its provisions may only be levied on hotel properties accordingly,the hotel landowners,as defined under the division and the mello roos act,are the proper qualified electors for voting purposes within the district.
to confine the vote on a special tax to the owners of the real property that is going to be subject to the special tax is as old as no taxation without representation.in fact,it is the opposite side of the same coin no representation without taxation.where a citizen is not going to be asked to pay the special tax,it deprives her of no constitutionally protected interest that she is not permitted to vote on it.in fact,giving the to those directly affected by a tax those who will pay it is the policy goal underlying taxpayer protections such as proposition that are embedded in california law.
the city further argued that the special tax did not violate article xiii c,section,subdivision d adopted by the voters in through because t he city sought and received a more than affirmative vote from the landowner qualified electors within the ccfd.
shapiro and sdog each filed briefs in opposition.appellants contended that the special tax was invalid under both the california constitution and the city charter because the special tax had not been approved by san diego registered,voters.
with respect to the california constitution,sdog argued that,hoteliers those who own or lease the land on which the city hotels are located are not citizens or registered to vote and thus are not qualified electors.sdog contended that the city argument that the qualified electors could be comprised only of those individuals and entities that would pay the special tax was incorrect,arguing that there was n othing in the california constitution or any other controlling legal authority that equates qualified electors with the persons paying the tax.sdog argued that while weighted landowner voting was permissible under article xiii d,with respect to assessments,articles xiii a and xiii c require that the general electorate vote on taxes.sdog noted that the neilson court held that a municipality registered voters comprised the proper electorate to vote on a special tax imposed under article xiii a,section,and specifically rejected the argument that the electorate should be comprised of only the property owners who would actually pay the tax.citing neilson,supra,th at.
sdog further argued 
also absent from the opening brief is any case law that allows a local government imposing a special tax to make up its own definition of qualified electors for purposes of satisfying the california constitution.no case stands for that proposition because such a glaring loophole in the constitutional protections for taxpayers would be quickly abused by local governments who would raise taxes by defining qualified electors in a way that ensures victory at the ballot box while circumventing the people.nothing in the history of proposition,or suggests that voters intended such an absurd outcome.
with respect to the legality of the special tax election under the city charter,both shapiro and sdog argued that section provides that the the qualified electors of the city must approve all special taxes authorized under article xiii a,and that section of the city charter provides that the qualifications of electors for all city elections are the same as those provided under state law for the qualification of electors in general state elections.it is undisputed that state law specifies that persons who are united states citizens and residents of california are qualified electors for purposes of general state elections cal,art.ii,and thus may register to vote,subd.a specifying that e very person who qualifies under section of article ii of the california constitution and who complies with this code governing the registration of electors may vote.according to appellants,the special tax was not validly imposed under the city charter,because,as sdog argued,there can be no dispute that the city residents who are qualified to vote in california general elections were not given the opportunity to vote on the special tax.
the city filed reply briefs to both appellants opposing briefs.in its reply to shapiro opposition,the city argued that,in adopting section,subdivision c,the legislature determined that,in certain situations,the undefined constitutional term qualified electors means landowners,not registered,natural person voters,and argued that t he legislature definition carries great weight.citing san francisco industrial acc.com.cal,where a constitutional provision may well have either of two meanings,it is a fundamental rule of constitutional construction that,if the legislature has by statute adopted one,its action in this respect is well nigh,if not completely,controlling.the city further maintained that the city adaptation of the election procedures specified in the mello roos act was consistent with the legislature desire to allocate voting power in proportion to the special tax each owner would pay if approved.
the city summarized its argument by stating 
t he ccfd voting procedures,the limitation of qualified electors to ccfd landowners,and the use of a weighted vote allocation did not violate the constitution.as discussed above,the mello roos act established the mechanism of weighted,landowner votes to approve special taxes in cfds community facilities districts,subd.c.under the mello roos act,landowners who will pay the tax levied against their property are the qualified electors their votes are weighted by the amount of land they own,which reflects a legislative desire to approximate voting power to proposed tax burden.the ccfd voting methodology and qualified electors are no different constitutionally.the qualified electors in the ccfd are those landowners that will be subject to the tax votes in the ccfd were allocated based on the amount of the special tax each landowner is expected to pay whether in the ccfd or a cfd formed solely under state law,landowners subject to the special tax make up the qualified electorate.
with respect to the city charter,the city argued in its reply to shapiro opposition that the definition of qualified elector in section does not apply to special taxes because the first clause of section of the city charter provides,notwithstanding any provision of this charter to the contrary the city also argued that section explicitly permits limiting the qualified electorate for votes on special taxes within special districts in cases in which a special tax will be levied upon less than the entire city,and contended that the ccfd special tax would be levied upon less than the entire city because it would be imposed only on the hotel landowners identified with the cffd.
the trial court ruling 
after a hearing,the court issued a ruling in favor of the city,validating the special tax.in its ruling,the trial court first quoted the applicable provisions of the california constitution and the city charter,and then stated the following 
section of the mello roos act establishes who or what is a qualified elector for voting purposes within a community facilities district cfd.section,subdivision c authorizes an election by landowners,rather than registered voters,where the special tax will not be apportioned in any tax year on property in residential use.thus,the legislature established that,in certain situations,qualified electors means landowners.see san francisco industrial acc.com,supra,cal.at.notably,section,subdivision c provides,the legislative body may provide that the vote shall be by the landowners of the proposed district whose property would be subject to the tax if it were levied at the time of the election.emphasis added.thus,not even all landowners within a cfd must get a vote only those whose property would be subject to the tax are eligible to vote.that is how the ccfd was structured.hotel property and transitory occupancy of hotel rooms are not residential properties or residential uses.see san diego.the mello roos act provides for weighted voting allocation based on the amount of property owned,reflecting a legislative desire to allocate voting power in proportion to the special tax each owner would pay if approved.see california.industry governing bd.d,california.industry.
consistent with the mello roos act,the division defined qualified electors as landowners within the ccfd,those who own or lease land on which hotels operate.san diego.the division mandates that special taxes authorized under its provisions may only be levied on hotel properties.see san diego,i,and that qualified electors shall in all cases be the landowners.san diego,a.
the trial court entered a validation judgment in favor of the city that states in relevant part 
all proceedings encompassed by this validation action by and for the city and the ccfd in connection with satisfaction of the voter approval requirement to authorize the ccfd special tax,to authorize the issuance of ccfd bonds,to levy the special tax,and to establish the appropriations limit for the ccfd,were and are valid and legally effective and were and are in conformity with the applicable provisions of all laws and enactments at any time in force or controlling upon such proceedings,whether imposed by law,charter,constitution,statute or ordinance,and whether federal,state or municipal.
the appeals 
appellants each timely appealed the trial court judgment.on appeal,appellants contend that the trial court erred in concluding that the manner in which the special tax was enacted does not violate either the california constitution or the city charter 
discussiona.the city special tax is invalid because it was not approved by a vote of either the qualified electors or the electorate of the city,as is required by the california constitution 
appellants claim that the city special tax is invalid because it was not approved by a vote of either the qualified electors art.xiii a,or the electorate art.xiii c,subd.d of the city,as required by the california constitution.appellants maintain that the city registered voters are the qualified electors art.xiii a,of the city and are the city electorate art.xiii c,subd.d.in contrast,the city contends that the qualified electors under article xiii a,section may be comprised of different constituents depending on the nature of the district and the special tax to be imposed.the city further contends that proposition which adopted art.xiii c,subd.d does not apply to landowner qualified electors in community facilities district elections.resolution of these issues requires that we interpret the california constitution.
applicable principles of interpretation and standard of review 
as our supreme court emphasized in silicon valley taxpayers,santa clara county open space authority cal th silicon valley,in a case that challenged the legality of local government actions under proposition,we must enforce the provisions of our constitution and may not lightly disregard or blink at a clear constitutional mandate.citation.in so doing,we are obligated to construe constitutional amendments in a manner that effectuates the voters purpose in adopting the law.silicon valley,supra,at.
the silicon valley court outlined the principles that govern our interpretation of those provisions of the california constitution that were adopted by the voters 
w e apply the familiar principles of constitutional interpretation,the aim of which is to determine and effectuate the intent of those who enacted the constitutional provision at issue.citation.the principles of constitutional interpretation are similar to those governing statutory construction.citation.if the language is clear and unambiguous,the plain meaning governs.citation.but if the language is ambiguous,we consider extrinsic evidence in determining voter intent,including the legislative analyst analysis and ballot arguments for and against the initiative.citations.silicon valley,supra,cal th at.
moreover,r udimentary principles of construction dictate that when constitutional provisions can reasonably be construed so as to avoid conflict,such a construction should be adopted.citation.greene,supra,cal th at.
because interpretation of a constitutional provision is a question of law,we perform that interpretation de novo,or independently,and are not bound by the trial court analysis or conclusion.taxpayers for accountable school bond spending san diego unified school dist.th.
the relevant constitutional provisions 
article xiii a,section added by,provides 
cities,counties and special districts,by a vote of the qualified electors of such district,may impose special taxes on such district,except ad valorem taxes on real property or a transaction tax or sales tax on the sale of real property within such city,county or special district.
article xiii c,section,subdivision d added by,provides in relevant part 
no local government may impose,extend,or increase any special tax unless and until that tax is submitted to the electorate and approved by a vote.
the city qualified electors for purposes of article xiii a,section,and the city electorate for purposes of article xiii c,section,subdivision d are the registered voters of the city 
the text,constitutional history,and purpose of both article xiii a,section,and article xiii c,section,subdivision d support the conclusion that the city special tax election was invalid under the state constitution.neither public policy considerations nor section,subdivision c of the mello roos act warrants a contrary conclusion.
a.the text of article xiii a,section makes clear that the city qualified electors are the city registered voters 
the text of article xiii a,section states that a city may impose a special tax if it receives a vote of the qualified electors of the city the neilson court concluded that the the term qualified electors means registered voters.neilson,supra,th at,quoting art.xiii a.
in neilson,a nonresident landowner challenged a parcel tax imposed by a city after the city registered voters approved the tax by a majority.neilson,supra,th at.the nonresident landowner contended that the affected property owners,not the registered voters of city of california city,were the qualified electors for purposes of section of article xiii id.at.the city of california city argued in response that section of article xiii a should be harmonized with section of article xiii c added by proposition,and that various definitions that were in place at the time proposition was adopted lead to the conclusion that city resident voters are the relevant electorate.id.at.the neilson court outlined those definitions as follows 
the elections code defines elector to mean any person who is a united states citizen years of age or older and a resident of an election precinct at least days prior to an election.the elections code does not contain a formal definition of the word qualified,but it does contain variations of that word that are useful in determining its meaning.for example,division of the elections code is titled voters and it contains chapters titled voter qualifications ch,beginning with and registration ch,beginning with.pursuant to section of the elections code,e very person who qualifies under section of article ii of the california constitution and who complies with this code governing the registration of electors may vote at any election held within the territory within which he or she resides and the election is held.italics added.article ii,section provides that a united states citizen years of age and resident in this state may vote.also,elections code section provides that voter means any elector who is registered under this code.id.at.
in light of these provisions,the neilson court concluded that section of article xiii a required the special tax to be approved by of city of california city registered voters who voted in the election concerning the special tax.neilson,supra,th at,italics added see also foothill de anza community college dist.emerich th,agreeing with neilson and stating nonresident property owner was not qualified to vote on school bond measure,and rejecting nonresident property owner argument that qualified electors are the persons who,like him,are going to actually pay the tax.the neilson court also rejected the nonresident landowner contention that only property owners should be permitted to vote on the tax because the voting eligibility requirements that the nonresident landowner proposes are set forth in article xiii d adopted as part of proposition in regards to special assessments,not taxes neilson,supra,at,italics added.
the california attorney general has reached the same conclusion as did the neilson court.see.interpreting the the majority vote provision of article xiii a,section,and stating,the requisite majority is to be based upon those registered voters who actually voted,italics added.we accord the opinion of the attorney general great weight,while recognizing that the opinion is not controlling as to the meaning of a constitutional provision or statute.county of fresno clovis unified school dist.d,county of fresno.
as both neilson and the attorney general opinion suggest,interpreting the phrase vote of the qualified electors in article xiii a,section italics added,to refer to a vote of registered voters is fully consistent with the text of the provision.the term qualified elector is a term that has long been used in california law to refer to registered voters,without further qualification see,allyn allison d,citing bergevin curtz cal,bergevin discussed below mcmillan siemon d,mcmillan the term qualified elector,as used in former article ii,section,of the constitution,we think means an elector who is entitled to vote,italics added welch williams cal,the object of the registration law is to prevent illegal voting by providing,in advance of election,an authentic list of the qualified electors,italics added see also.the term qualified elector in this state has a precise meaning.it connotes a status and not a term of residency.qualified elector means an elector who is entitled to vote.in short,it is synonymous with the terms voter or registered voter,first two italics added accord city charter,entitled qualified electors,and stating,the qualifications of an elector at any election held in the city under the provisions of this charter shall be the same as those prescribed by the general law of the state for the qualification of electors at general state elections,italics added.
in bergevin,after noting that the state constitution prescribes the qualifications of an elector bergevin,supra,cal.at,the supreme court explained that voting registration requirements are a method of determining which individuals are qualified electors,italics added see also minges board of trustees,citing bergevin and stating,a qualified elector,then,is a person whose qualifications measure up to the constitutional standard.thus,in requiring a vote of the qualified electors,the text of article xiii a,section supports the conclusion that the provision requires a vote of those who reside in the relevant district and possess the qualifications to vote under our state constitution and who have registered to vote.
further,we are aware of no authority,and the city has cited none,that suggests that the phrase qualified electors has ever been used generically to describe a group of persons entitled to vote based on qualifications other than those specified by our state constitution.see cal,art.ii,a united states citizen years of age and resident in this state may vote,stating that every person who qualifies under article ii,section of the california constitution and who has registered may vote.thus,the text of article xiii a,section indicates that an election in which only a small subset of landowners and leaseholders are permitted to vote is not an election of the city qualified electors.
the city offers no textual argument to counter the neilson court conclusion that the phrase qualified electors in article xiii a,section refers to the registered voters of the entity,city,county,or special district imposing a special tax.however,the city notes that the neilson court stated,t he prepositional phrase of such district in article xiii a,section means city of california city because the tax is imposed by city of california city on all parcels within its geographical limits.neilson,supra,th at.the city contends that neilson holding does not apply,because,according to the city,the ccfd special tax will not be imposed on all city parcels,but only on parcels on which hotels operate.we do not read the neilson court statement as interpreting article xiii a,section to mandate an election of all of a city registered voters only where the special tax will be imposed on all parcels in a municipality rather,we read this portion of neilson as simply meaning that the registered voters of the city of california city were the proper voters to vote on the parcel tax at issue in that case,since the tax would be imposed within the city of california city.as so interpreted,we fully agree with this aspect of neilson.
b.the constitutional history of article xiii a,section is consistent with the conclusion that the city qualified electors are its registered voters 
interpreting the term qualified electors as synonymous with registered voters is consistent with the materials that were presented to the voters in connection with the approval of proposition.the legislative analyst description of proposition stated in relevant part,this initiative would authorize local governments to impose certain nonproperty taxes if of the voters give their approval in a local election.ballot,primary june,analysis of by legis.analyst,italics added see also california.industry,supra,d at in reviewing the relevant voter pamphlet,it can easily be inferred from the information given there citation that voters believed they were authorizing special taxes which required approval by of the voters in the city,county or special district,italics added.in short,the voters who voted on proposition were expressly informed at the time they approved the proposition,in the materials accompanying the ballot measure,that future local government special tax increases would require the assent of the voters.there is nothing in either the text or the constitutional history of proposition that suggests that voters intended for local governments to be able to exclude large numbers of registered voters from voting in a special tax election by limiting who would be deemed qualified electors for purposes of the election.
c.the intent of the voters in enacting article xiii a,section to restrict the taxing authority of local governments supports the conclusion that the city special tax election violated the state constitution 
interpreting qualified electors as describing a single,defined set of persons,registered voters,is consistent with california voters intent in enacting article xiii a,section.in rider county of san diego cal th rider,the supreme court explained that the voters adopted section of proposition in order to restrict the ability of local governments to impose new taxes to replace property tax revenues lost under the other provisions of proposition.rider,supra,at see also howard jarvis taxpayers county of orange th,the raison of proposition was to limit municipalities taxing power.the rider court considered this intent in determining whether an agency that adopted an ordinance to impose a supplemental sales tax throughout the county of san diego for the purpose of financing the construction of justice facilities rider,supra,at constituted a special district under article xiii a,section subject to the requirement,despite the agency lack of power to levy a tax on real property.rider,supra,at.notwithstanding the textual ambiguity of the meaning of the term special district art.xiii a,and prior case law that suggested that the agency was not a special district because it lacked the power to levy a tax on real property the rider court held that special district include s any local taxing agency created to raise funds for city or county purposes to replace revenues lost by reason of the restrictions of proposition.rider,supra,at.the rider court concluded that the tax was invalid because it had been approved by a simple majority vote,rather than by a vote,as required by article xiii a,section.rider,supra,at.
in reaching this holding,the rider court explained,we must attempt to determine whether the framers,in using the term special district,intended to adopt a definition that could so readily permit circumvention of section.rider,supra,cal th at.in concluding that the justice facilities financing agency was a special district subject to proposition limitations on special taxation,the rider court stated that the intent of the voters in enacting article xiii a,section would be frustrated if cities and counties were permitted to arrange for the formation of local taxing districts to finance municipal functions without securing the requisite voter approval.rider,supra,at.
similarly,in this case,we must determine whether the same voters who enacted proposition in order to circumscribe the taxing power of local government rider,supra,cal th at nevertheless intended for local governments to be able to define the class of electors who would be eligible to vote on a special tax,depending on,as the city argues,the nature of the district and the special tax to be imposed.we think it is clear that the voters who enacted proposition did not so intend.in our view,the city interpretation of article xiii a,section would allow the city to 
readily circumvent the vote requirement of section by the simple creation of a district which is geographically precisely coterminous with the city,but which has different qualified electors and thereby cut a hole in the financial fence which the people in their constitution have erected around their government.governmental entities may be expected,instinctively,to pour through the opening seeking the creation of similar mechanisms in myriad forms which will be limited only by their ingenuity.rider,supra,cal th at,quoting richmond,supra,cal d at dis.opn.by richardson.
interpreting the term qualified electors art.xiii a,to refer to registered voters is consistent with the voters intent to limit the taxing power of local governments.indeed,the intent of the voters at issue in this case is far more evident than was that intent in rider,since unlike the ambiguous rider,supra,cal th at term special district art.xiii a,that was at issue in rider,the voters used the term qualified electors art.xiii a,to prescribe the body of persons whose assent would be required prior to a local government imposition of a special tax.see pt,ante.since the intent of the voters is the paramount consideration in our interpretation of article xiii a,section,this analysis strongly supports the conclusion that the election approving the special tax was invalid.silicon valley taxpayers garner th.
d.the text,history,and purpose of proposition support the conclusion that registered voters also comprise the electorate in article xiii c,section,subdivision d 
the city does not dispute that that the terms qualified electors in article xiii a,section added by and electorate in article xiii c,section,subdivision d added by should be given the same meaning we agree.although worded slightly differently,the text of the two provisions is similar,requiring that before the city may impose a special tax it must gain the approval of a vote of the qualified electors art.xiii a,italics added and a vote of the electorate art.xiii c,subd.d,italics added.the supreme court has used the terms interchangeably repeatedly using the term electorate when describing the qualified electors voter approval requirement contained in article xiii a,section added by,thus providing support for the conclusion that the two terms should be interpreted to mean the same thing.see,silicon valley,supra,cal th at to prevent local governments from subverting its limitations,proposition also prohibited counties,cities,and special districts from enacting any special tax without a vote of the electorate quoting apartment of los angeles county,supra,cal th at.
in addition,because proposition was designed to close loopholes in proposition,the intent and purpose of the latter informs our interpretation of the former.apartment of los angeles county,supra,cal th at and see id.at describing history of the enactment of as buttress ing proposition limitations on ad valorem property taxes and special taxes by placing analogous restrictions on assessments,fees,and charges.while the primary purpose of proposition was to reform the law governing local government imposition of revenue generating devices other than special taxes such as general taxes,assessments,and fees,it is clear from the text of article xiii c,section,subdivision d that the voters who enacted proposition intended to reaffirm the limitation initially imposed by proposition on the ability of local governments to impose special taxes.see ballot,official title and summary prepared by the attorney general,stating that r equires that majority of voters approve increases in general taxes and reiterates that must approve special tax,italics added.
in light of the similarity of the relevant text of article xiii a,section and that of article xiii c,section,subdivision d,the constitutional history of the two provisions,and our duty to harmonize constitutional provisions where possible mcwilliams city of long beach cal th,we conclude that both provisions refer to the same group of persons whose approval is required before the city may impose a special tax.
the fact that proposition did expressly permit property owners to vote on certain assessments art.xiii d provides strong support for the conclusion that the voters who enacted proposition did not intend to permit local governmental entities to impose property qualifications for electors in elections involving taxes art.xiii c see,golden hill neighborhood assn,city of san diego th,proposition weighted voting requirement,set forth in article xiii d,section,subdivision e,enhances taxpayer consent by giving property owners whose properties are proposed to be assessed in amounts greater than other owners properties a proportionately greater say as to whether the proposed assessment will be instituted.
the lack of any provision comparable to the weighted property owner voting provisions mandated for assessments in article xiii d that would permit only property owners to vote on taxes supports the conclusion that article xiii c,section,subdivision d requires the approval of of the registered voters when a local government seeks to impose special taxes.see neilson,supra,th at noting that voting limited to property owners is permitted with respect to assessments but not with respect to special taxes.
article xiii d,section,subdivision g expressly contrasts electors and the electorate with property owners 
because only special benefits are assessable,electors residing within the district who do not own property within the district shall not be deemed under this constitution to have been deprived of the right to vote for any assessment.if a court determines that the constitution of the united states or other federal law requires otherwise,the assessment shall not be imposed unless approved by a vote of the electorate in the district in addition to being approved by the property owners as required by subdivision e.italics added.
article xiii d,section,subdivision g makes it clear that the voters who enacted proposition did not intend for the electorate art.xiii c,subd.d art.xiii d,subd.g to be subject to property qualifications,as was the case for the electorate who voted on the special tax at issue in this case.see legal services for prisoners with children bowen th,when a word is used repeatedly in the constitution,it is given the same meaning throughout unless the context clearly requires otherwise.indeed,our supreme court has directly stated,albeit in dicta that special tax elections may not contain property qualifications for electors.see greene,supra,cal th at fee elections in article xiii d,section,subdivision c authorize limiting the election to only property owners,while most other elections,including elections pertaining to special and general taxes in article xiii c,section,do not permit property qualifications,italics added.validation of the special tax election in this case would be directly contrary to the voters use of the term electorate in article xiii c,section,subdivision d,and to our supreme court statement in greene that elections pertaining to special taxes do not permit property qualifications.
the ballot pamphlet materials that were presented to the electorate that voted on proposition further support the conclusion that the election on the special tax in this case was invalid.those opposed to proposition referred to the voting format specified in the proposition related to assessments and argued,you lose rights corporations,developers,non citizens gain voting power.ballot pamp.on,supra,argument against.in rebuttal to the argument against proposition,those supporting proposition stated,under proposition,only california registered voters,including renters,can vote in tax elections.corporations and foreigners get no new rights.ballot pamp.on,supra,rebuttal to argument against.in the special tax election in this case,the city registered voters were not permitted to vote unless they happened to be landowners,and to the extent landowners were a corporation or a foreigner,they were permitted to vote.
e.the city policy argument is unpersuasive 
in its brief on appeal,the city alludes to an argument,more fully developed in its trial brief,that the appropriate qualified electors to approve or reject the ccfd special tax were those landowners that will have to pay it.there are several problems with this contention.to begin with,regardless of any policy merits of having only landowners vote on the special tax,our state constitution mandates that qualified electors and the electorate approve the imposition of special taxes if the voters who adopted propositions and had desired that only qualified property owners be permitted to vote on the imposition of special taxes,they were clearly aware of the text to use to evince such intent.see,art.xiii d,subd.g referring to assessment ballot proceeding among property owners,italics added accord southern cal.rapid transit dist.bolen,supra,cal th at under assessment voting scheme qualified owners are allotted one vote for each of assessed value of their real property,italics added.
second,the specification of a voting scheme for the imposition of taxes in article xiii c that is distinct from the voting scheme specified for the imposition of assessments in article xiii d is explained by the very different natures of taxes and assessments.silicon valley,supra,cal th at describing the distinctions between special taxes and special assessments,citing knox city of orland cal th knox.a special assessment is a charge levied against real property within a particular district for the purpose of conferring a special benefit on the assessed properties beyond any benefit received by the general public.schmeer county of los angeles th,citing knox,supra,at.in contrast,a special tax is imposed to provide benefits to the general public ibid,and it is possible that those who are burdened by the tax may enjoy no benefit from its expenditure.silicon valley,supra,cal th at,citing knox,supra,at.
the voters who enacted proposition reasonably believed that the general electorate should be the body to decide how to apportion the benefits and burdens of taxes,both general and special art.xiii c since the benefits of such taxation would accrue to the general public and the burdens could fall,at least in part,upon those who would not benefit.in contrast,these same voters reasonably gave affected property owners the right to vote on certain special assessments art.xiii d,given that a special assessment in reality is a compulsory charge to recoup the cost of a public improvement made for the special benefit of particular property.citation.knox,supra,cal th at.
finally,despite the superficial normative appeal of allowing those who pay for a tax to approve its imposition,it is often difficult to calculate the true economic incidence of any given tax.see fulton faulkner,noting the extreme complexity of economic incidence analysis.while the city argues that only landowners should vote on the special tax since they are the taxpayers who will pay the tax,it is far from clear that the incidence of the special tax will actually fall only on landowners and not on those individuals who pay for hotel rooms and generate the room revenue on which the tax is based further,even assuming that the incidence of the tax would fall solely on landowners,this would not support the conclusion that landowners are the proper class of persons to vote on the tax.that is because n othing is more familiar in taxation than the imposition of a tax upon a class or upon individuals who enjoy no direct benefit from its expenditure,and who are not responsible for the condition to be remedied.silicon valley,supra,cal th at,quoting knox,supra,cal th at.giving landowners the unilateral right to determine how to apportion the benefits that would flow from a tax whose burdens may well fall on others would be contrary to both the constitution and ordinary principles of taxation.
in short,the city policy argument is unpersuasive,and does not provide support for the conclusion that the special tax election at issue in this case was valid.
f.the landowner voting format outlined in section,subdivision c of the mello roos act does not demonstrate the constitutional validity of the city special tax election 
in seeking to uphold the special tax election in this case,the city does not provide any argument based on the text of the relevant constitutional provisions,their constitutional histories,or the intent of the voters in enacting these provisions.for the reasons described above,these traditional sources of constitutional interpretation overwhelmingly support the conclusion that the special tax election in this case was invalid because the city registered voters were not permitted to vote in the election.
the city sole theory that the special tax is constitutional is its contention that article xiii a,section did not expressly define or identify the qualified electors of the local government entities to which the majority vote requirement applied and that the term qualified electors is ambiguous.the city further contends that i n the mello roos act,four years after proposition,the legislature explicitly defined qualified electors for purposes of community facilities districts citing san francisco industrial acc,supra,cal.at stating that courts ordinarily defer to legislature specification of a definition for an ambiguous constitutional term.this is the only theory that the trial court provided in support of its conclusion that the special tax election met constitutional requirements.see pt,ante.we are not persuaded.
the term qualified electors art.xiii a,is not ambiguous,for the reasons stated in part,ante.we thus have no occasion to defer to the legislature purported interpretation of the term qualified electors art.xiii a,contained in the mello roos act.moreover,the legislature interpretation of proposition is found in its enabling legislation of the proposition et,not in the amendment of the mello roos act on which the city relies,subd.c in california.industry,supra,d,the court explained that the legislature contemporaneous construction of article xiii a,section is found in section et 
building industry correctly argues that in interpreting article xiii a,section we should also apply the rule of construction which states that ambiguities in an enactment may be resolved by referring to the contemporaneous construction given to the enactment by the legislature or by the administrative agency charged with implementing the enactment.citations where a constitutional provision may well have either of two meanings,it is a fundamental rule of constitutional construction that,if the l egislature has by statute adopted one,its action in this respect is well nigh,if not completely,controlling.san francisco industrial acc.com,supra,cal.at 
that rule has been expressly applied to article xiii a,section by the richmond,supra,cal d court t he court specifically stated that sections to were intended by the legislature as enabling legislation for section.citation.a review of the legislative history for these sections bears this out.california.industry,supra,d at.
the legislature proposition enabling legislation is fully consistent with the conclusion that article xiii a,section requires that of a district registered voters approve a special tax.the legislature entitled its enabling legislation,voter approved special taxes stats,ch,italics added and included the following provision 
the legislative body of any city or county district may,following notice and public hearing,propose by ordinance the adoption of a special tax.the ordinance shall include the type of tax and rate of tax to be levied,the method of collection,and the dates upon which an election shall be held to approve the levy of such tax.such proposition shall be submitted to the voters of the city or county,and,upon the approval of of the voters voting upon such proposition,the city or county may levy the tax.former,subd.a stats,ch,italics added.
thus,the legislature interpreted proposition,as we do to require the approval of of a city voters before a city may impose a special tax.
in any event,a consideration of the election provisions contained in the mello roos act does not persuade us that the special tax election in this case complied with article xiii a,section and article xiii c,section,subdivision d.as noted previously,section,subdivision a provides that a local government shall submit the question of whether to levy a special tax to fund a community facilities district to the qualified electors of the proposed community facilities district,as follows 
a the legislative body shall then submit the levy of any special taxes to the qualified electors of the proposed community facilities district 
section,subdivision b in turn specifies that the qualified electors will ordinarily be either the registered voters of the proposed community facilities district,or in the case of a predominantly uninhabited proposed district,the landowners of the district 
b except as otherwise provided in subdivision c,if at least persons,who need not necessarily be the same persons,have been registered to vote within the territory of the proposed community facilities district for each of the days preceding the close of the protest hearing,the vote shall be by the registered voters of the proposed district,with each voter having one vote.otherwise,the vote shall be by the landowners of the proposed district and each person who is the owner of land at the close of the protest hearing,or the authorized representative thereof,shall have one vote for each acre or portion of an acre of land that he or she owns within the proposed community facilities district not exempt from the special tax.italics added.
section,subdivision c,in turn,contains the exception referenced in section,subdivision b,stating that local governments may utilize a landowner voting format if the special tax will not be apportioned on residential property 
c if the proposed special tax will not be apportioned in any tax year on any portion of property in residential use in that tax year,as determined by the legislative body,the legislative body may provide that the vote shall be by the landowners of the proposed district whose property would be subject to the tax if it were levied at the time of the election.each of these landowners shall have one vote for each acre,or portion thereof,that the landowner owns within the proposed district that would be subject to the proposed tax if it were levied at the time of the election,subd.c.
there is nothing in either the text or the legislative history of section subdivision c that indicates that in enacting this statute,the legislature considered the meaning of qualified electors under article xiii a,section thus,there is no indication that the legislature considered any of the numerous sources of constitutional interpretation that we have cited that bear on this question.further,there is no indication in either the text or the legislative history of section,subdivision c that indicates that the legislature considered whether a landowner election under section,subdivision c constitutes a valid election of the qualified electors art.xiii a,given these circumstances,we are unwilling to defer to a purported legislative interpretation of the meaning of qualified electors under article xiii see pacific legal foundation brown cal d,doctrine of deferring to legislative interpretation of a constitutional provision is particularly appropriate when the legislature has enacted a statute with the relevant constitutional prescriptions clearly in mind,citing san francisco industrial acc,supra,cal.at.
in light of the fact that proposition,section was intended to circumscribe the taxing power of local government rider,supra,cal th at,the city argument that we should defer to the legislature purported intent in enacting section,subdivision c to afford local governments flexibility in complying with this state constitutional mandate is less than compelling.in addition,according deference to this purported legislative intent would require that we interpret article xiii a,section in a manner contrary to a decision of the court of appeal neilson,supra,th at and an opinion of the attorney general,supra.we accord the interpretation of law found in these sources significant deference.see the mega life and health ins.superior court th,we ordinarily follow the decisions of other districts without good reason to disagree county of fresno,supra,d at attorney general opinions are given great weight.further,the interpretation that the city urges would also require us to disregard the supreme court statement in greene,supra,cal th at page,that elections pertaining to special taxes do not permit property qualifications.
even assuming that,in enacting section,subdivision c,the legislature intended that local governments would be permitted to interpret the constitutional term qualified electors art.xiii a,to refer to a narrow class of landowners and leaseholders,it is well established that a statute can not trump the constitution.county of los angeles commission on state mandates th.in light of the textual clarity of the constitutional provisions at stake,and the overwhelming interpretative evidence supporting the conclusion that the special tax election in this case was invalid because the city registered voters were not permitted to vote in the election,we are obligated to effectuate the voters intent in enacting propositions and,and strike down the tax see greene,supra,cal th at ultimate constitutional interpretation must rest,of course,with the judiciary see marbury madison cranch.
accordingly,we conclude that the city special tax is invalid because it was not approved by a vote of either the qualified electors art.xiii a,or the electorate art.xiii c,subd.d of the city,as the california constitution requires.
b.the city special tax is invalid because it was not approved by a vote of registered voters,as is required under the city charter 
as an additional basis for reversing the judgment,appellants contend that the city special tax is invalid because it was not approved by a vote of the qualified electors of the city,as the city charter requires this claim turns on the proper interpretation of the city charter,an issue that we review de novo.see,city of oakland oakland police and fire retirement system th,fn.we will resolve this appeal through our de novo review of legal issues,such as the interpretation of the oakland city charter conde city of san diego th,the interpretation of a city charter is reviewed de novo on appeal.

relevant provisions of the city charter 
section of the city charter provides 
qualified electors 
the qualifications of an elector at any election held in the city under the provisions of this charter shall be the same as those prescribed by the general law of the state for the qualification of electors at general state elections.no person shall be eligible to vote at such city election until he has conformed to the general state law governing the registration of voters.italics added.
city charter section provides in relevant part,no special tax shall be permitted except as expressly authorized by this charter.
section of the city charter provides 
special taxes 
notwithstanding any provision of this charter to the contrary,a special tax,as authorized by article xiii a of the california constitution may be levied by the council only if the proposed levy has been approved by a vote of the qualified electors of the city voting on the proposition or if the special tax is to be levied upon less than the entire city,then the tax may be levied by the council only if the proposed levy has been approved by a vote of the qualified electors voting on the proposition in the area of the city in which the tax is to be levied.italics added.
qualified electors for purposes of the city charter are the city registered voters 
section of the city charter provides that the qualified electors for any election held in the city shall be those persons who are registered to vote under state law.thus,pursuant to section,qualified electors means registered voters.section,in turn,mandates that a special tax may be imposed only upon the approval of of qualified electors.reading sections and together,as we must sections and provide that the imposition of a special tax requires the approval of the registered voters in the city,or in the area of the city where the tax is to be levied.
the express reference to article xiii a and the use of the term qualified electors in the text of section strongly support the conclusion that the provision should be interpreted consistently with article xiii a,section to require an election by registered voters.see mason retirement board th,we do not interpret charter provisions in isolation,and stating that courts must interpret a charter provision with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.
the voter information pamphlet from the election at which the city voters enacted section supports this conclusion stating in relevant part 
the california state constitution presently allows voters in a city or community to approve,by a vote,special tax levies for desired additional improvements or services.
this concept is already permitted by our state constitution and is entirely consistent with the jarvis gann initiative proposition,which enjoyed widespread voter approval.the remaining step needed to permit communities in san diego to take advantage of this technique is an enabling amendment to city charter section.city of san diego sample ballot voter information,general mun,tuesday nov,argument in favor of prop,italics added.
none of the arguments that the city makes in support of its claim that section does not require a vote of registered voters is persuasive.the city primary argument is that section express definition of qualified electors does not apply to the qualified electors referred to in section because the first clause of section provides,notwithstanding any provision of this charter to the contrary in this regard,the city argues,as the language states,section or any other provision does not control with respect to special taxes.the city reading of the notwithstanding clause is unpersuasive.the definition of qualified electors set forth in section is not contrary to any provision in section.rather,section provides a definition of a term that is not otherwise expressly defined in section in any event,even assuming that the definition of qualified electors provided in section did not apply,for the reasons stated above,we would interpret qualified electors in section,in a manner consistent with article xiii a,section,to mean registered voters.
the city also contends that the special tax in this case is governed by the last clause of section,which applies when a special tax is to be levied upon less than the entire city.we have serious doubts as to whether a special tax that will be levied upon all parcels in the city that are,or will be,used for a hotel may be deemed to be a tax levied upon less than the entire city within the meaning of section.even assuming that a noncontiguous special district could be considered an area less than the entire city under section,it is unclear,at best,whether this portion of section would permit the qualified electors in an area less than the entire city to authorize the potential imposition of a tax on any parcel within the city,whenever any such parcel becomes used as a hotel in the future.in any event,even with respect to tax levies that are geographically limited,section requires a vote of qualified electors,which we have interpreted to mean registered voters.thus,even assuming that the final clause of section applies,the city special tax election violated the city charter because the city identified landowners,rather than registered voters,as the qualified electors who would be permitted to vote in the election 
accordingly,we conclude that the city special tax is invalid because it was not approved by a vote of registered voters,as is required under the city charter.
conclusion 
in rider,in ruling that a local government attempt to fund new courtrooms and jails violated the special tax election procedures mandated by proposition,the supreme court concluded its opinion with the following remarks 
we are sympathetic to the plight of local government in attempting to deal with the demands for revenue in the period yet proposition and its limitations on local taxation are constitutional mandates of the people which we are sworn to uphold and enforce.rider,supra,cal th at.
similarly,in this case,while we understand that the city would like to expand the convention center,we are duty bound to uphold the provisions of the california constitution and the city charter that require that the city registered voters approve the special tax at issue in the case.

the city incorporated this argument in its reply to sdog opposition.
sdog also contends that the judgment should be reversed because the city violated the california environmental quality act pub.resources code,et by failing to timely prepare an environmental impact maintains that the judgment should be reversed because the city alteration of the mello roos act voting procedures exceeded its home rule authority.shapiro also contends,in the alternative,that the special tax is invalid because it is akin to either an assessment or a hotel occupancy tax,and the city did not comply with the legal requirements to impose either an assessment or a hotel occupancy need not consider these additional arguments in light of our reversal of the judgment on the grounds stated in the text.
the city does not dispute that it is the city,rather than the ccfd,that seeks to impose the tax in this case.indeed,the city alleged in its validation complaint that the special tax election gave the city council authority to levy the special tax to finance the authorized facilities and issue the bonds.italics added.
the neilson court observed in a footnote that the public utilities code defines qualified elector in relevant part as a voter whose name appears on the great register of the county in which the district is located neilson,supra,th at,fn,quoting pub.
see pt,post for a discussion of the distinct voting requirements established by proposition with respect to taxes art.xiii c and assessments art.xiii d.
a textual argument can be made that the city special tax is invalid because,by referring to qualified electors,the voters who adopted proposition,section intended to require the assent of of those possessing the qualifications to vote under the state constitution,whether or not they were registered to do so.see,supra considering,but rejecting this interpretation of art.xiii a,ni slocum th,noting the distinction in former political code section between qualified electors and registered qualified elector s shamsian department of conservation th,fn.quoting former,as providing,the secretary of state shall adopt regulations requiring each county to design and implement programs intended to identify qualified electors who are not registered voters,and to register such persons to vote.however,such an interpretation would be impracticable,since the ordinary manner of determining those who are qualified to vote is through voter registration.see collier menzel d,registration is to be regarded as a reasonable regulation by the legislature for the purpose of ascertaining who are qualified electors in order to prevent illegal voting.in addition,we agree with the neilson court that by referring to a vote of the qualified electors art.xiii a,italics added,article xiii a requires an affirmative vote of of registered voters who vote in an election on the imposition of a special tax.neilson,supra,th at.
the mcmillan court noted that a former provision of the california constitution expressly used the term qualified elector in the same provision that defined the qualifications of an elector former article ii,section,of the constitution,after specifying the qualifications of an elector,contains the following proviso provided,any person duly registered as an elector in one precinct and removing therefrom to another precinct in the same county within forty days prior to an election,shall for the purpose of such election be deemed to be a resident and qualified elector of the precinct from which he so removed until after such election.mcmillan,supra,d at,italics added.
several other provisions of the california constitution refer to qualified electors.see,cal,art.ix,a superintendent of public instruction shall be elected by the qualified electors of the state at each gubernatorial election,italics added cal,art.xi,subd.a no county seat shall be removed unless of the qualified electors of the county,voting on the proposition at a general election,shall vote in favor of such removal,italics added cal,art.xxxiv,no low rent housing project shall hereafter be developed,constructed,or acquired in any manner by any state public body until,a majority of the qualified electors of the city,town or county,as the case may be,in which it is proposed to develop,construct,or acquire the same,voting upon such issue,approve such project by voting in favor thereof at an election to be held for that purpose,or at any general or special election,italics added.we are aware of no authority that suggests that the term qualified electors in these provisions has been interpreted to refer to anything other than registered voters.
interpreting article xiii a as requiring an election of a district registered voters only where the special tax will be imposed on all o f the parcels in a district has no basis in the text of the provision.
