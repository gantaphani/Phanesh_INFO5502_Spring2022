in,plaintiff el dorado palm springs,a partnership el dorado,prevailed on an assessment appeal and obtained a reduction in a real property tax assessment for the tax year el dorado failed to obtain a similar reduction for the five tax years through.in,el dorado then filed suit seeking tax refunds for all five years.on appeal,el dorado challenges the trial court judgment in favor of the county of riverside county.
we agree section,subdivision e,as it currently exists,requires the tax assessor to reappraise property after there has been a reduction in a tax assessment due to a decline in value.therefore,the tax assessor must now reappraise the value of the property for and and determine the property assessable value.but el dorado is not entitled to a refund for,and because the reappraisals,as ultimately performed for those years,supported the assessments imposed by the county.we reverse the judgment as to the years and but affirm the judgment as to the years,and.
factual background 
the superior court decided this case based on stipulated facts and evidence.four types of real property values are pertinent to our discussion the base year value the factored base year,or proposition,value the reduced,or proposition,value and the fair market value.
in april,plaintiff purchased the el dorado mobile home park,a development located in palm springs,for.in,the county tax assessor established the new base year value of the property based on the change of ownership.in,the enrolled value of the property was the factored base year value of,meaning the base year value had increased by percent each year since.el dorado submitted an assessment appeal to reduce the tax assessment.el dorado asserted the assessment was too high because the property had been subject to a temporary rent increase that expired on june,reducing the value of the property.
in september,the county assessment appeals board denied el dorado assessment appeal and upheld the enrolled value of for.after el dorado filed a petition for writ of mandate,the superior court granted the petition and issued a peremptory writ commanding the appeals board to vacate its findings and to conduct further proceedings in accordance with the court directions.in february,after a second assessment hearing,the appeals board found the proposition value for the property was only for.
during and after the time the assessment appeal was pending,the tax assessor had continued to assess the property in increasingly higher amounts for the tax years through based on the factored base year value.in other words,the tax assessor increased the assessment on the property the maximum of percent every year.by,the enrolled value had increased to.
in september,after obtaining the proposition reduction,el dorado tried to submit assessment appeals for the tax years and but the county rejected the appeals as untimely.for the tax years,and,el dorado submitted timely assessment appeals.based on the county appraisals,performed in and,the appeals board found the market value of the property for,and exceeded the enrolled value.the appeals board adopted the enrolled values as the proposition values for the property and refused to reduce the tax assessments for the latter three years.
el dorado then filed its lawsuits for refunds.the trial court found el dorado had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and was too late in seeking an adjustment for the tax years and.the court also found,in agreement with the findings of the appeals board,that el dorado was not entitled to a reduction for the tax years,and because the fair market appraisals supported the enrolled values for those years.
after a proposition reduction has been granted due to a decline in the value of property,section,subdivision e,provides that the assessor shall continue to reappraise the property in subsequent years until its fair market value exceeds the proposition value.the full text of subdivision e provides nothing in this section shall be construed to require the assessor to make an annual reappraisal of all assessable property.however,for each lien date after the first lien date for which the taxable value of property is reduced pursuant to paragraph of subdivision a,the value of that property shall be annually reappraised at its full cash value as defined in section until that value exceeds the value determined pursuant to paragraph of subdivision a.in no event shall the assessor condition the implementation of the preceding sentence in any year upon the filing of an assessment appeal.emphasis added.
the first disagreement between the parties involves whether and when reappraisal is required by subdivision e.el dorado interprets the statute to require the assessor to reappraise the subject property for,and,while el dorado unresolved challenge to the assessment was pending,even though the proposition reduction was not established until february.the assessor did not appraise the property until and in connection with the assessment appeals involving,and.therefore,el dorado contends that any assessment for through exceeding the proposition value of is void and el dorado should receive refunds of those excess amounts.
the county argues that if any reappraisal was required it was not until after february and that reappraisals were made for,and.the state board of equalization sbe,in its amicus curiae brief,maintains that reappraisal became mandatory after february.the sbe asserts the reappraisals for,and satisfy section,subdivision e,but the tax assessor should now reappraise the property for and.
we agree with the sbe that section,subdivision e requires the tax assessor to reappraise property after an assessment has been reduced due to a decline in value.but based on the plain language of the statute,we reject el dorado interpretation that reappraisals had to be performed before february.the statute provides that for each lien date after the first lien date for which the taxable value of property is reduced the value of that property shall be annually reappraised.under the circumstances of this case,the taxable value of property was not reduced until february.furthermore,as we discuss below,just as el dorado is spared having to file protective appeals,it is unreasonable to require the county to anticipate what happened in this case and to perform prophylactic appraisals in advance of the final proposition determination.the county could not have known it had to reappraise the property until the date the proposition value was finally established.reappraisal was not required until there was a proposition reduction although the reappraisal requirement then became retroactive to and.
finally,we decide that,although not until february were annual reappraisals required for,or,the appraisals performed in and fulfilled the requirement of section,subdivision e,for,and.
in reaching our conclusions,we analyze differently the two sets of tax years involved beginning with and and continuing with,and.
the tax years and 
the second disagreement between the parties concerns whether el dorado had to exhaust its administrative remedies by filing assessment appeals for and.the county argues that because el dorado did not file assessment appeals it failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and its civil actions for refunds are barred.both el dorado and the sbe contend section,subdivision e expressly relieves a taxpayer from having to file an assessment appeal.on this point,we agree with el dorado and the sbe position.
usually,to obtain a reduced assessment,the taxpayer must file an assessment appeal in accordance with sections and.when el dorado applied in september for a changed assessment for the tax years and,it was too late by two or three years but after a property owner has been granted a proposition reduction,section dispenses with the usual requirement to file an assessment appeal.subdivision e,as amended in,explains the tax assessor can not make filing an assessment appeal a condition of making a reappraisal in n
