for the kims,like many residents,the tax man cometh,but the kims,by taking the offensive and suing the internal revenue service irs,have been unusually unwelcoming.calvin ki sun kim and chun cha kim are tax protesters who,in an action for unspecified damages,allege the irs violated the taxpayer bill of rights,failed to comply with various statutes,and perpetrated an ongoing campaign of harassment by correspondence.compl.at.the kims lawsuit is one of many similar actions brought by tax protestors accusing the irs of a miscellany of misconduct.
from through,the kims did not regularly file tax returns.when they did file,their tax returns did not include required information.unsurprisingly,in the irs contacted the kims about their frivolous or missing returns.the resulting correspondence between the kims and the irs is the gravamen of this suit.
the kims insist they are not required to file individual income tax returns because the irs did not maintain proper records or perform all duties required by law.see compl.at.based on these alleged failures,the kims filed suit in the united states district court for the district of columbia in september.their complaint asserted separate counts of wrongdoing against the united states the commissioner of the irs irs employees dennis parizek,scott prentky,and chow and four unknown irs agents collectively defendants.specifically,the kims complaint alleged denial of the right to due process of the tax law,administrative law,and law of the united states,compl.at,and disregard of provisions of the tax law of the united states and regulations promulgated thereunder,compl.at.for redress of these claimed violations,the kims sought damages pursuant to bivens six unknown named agents of fed.bureau of narcotics,and what is commonly known as the taxpayer bill of rights,
the district court dismissed counts through bivens federal rule of civil procedure b,holding it lacked jurisdiction to hear the kims claims against the defendants in their official capacities,and under rule b,for failure to state a claim because no bivens remedy exists for claims against the defendants in their individual capacities.kim united states,d.the district court also dismissed counts and under rule b,holding the two counts did not pertain to collection activities within the meaning of the taxpayer bill of rights.id.at.alternatively,the district court dismissed counts and,along with count,under rule b because the kims failed to plead exhaustion in their complaint and failed to rebut the government exhaustion defense.id.at.
we affirm the judgment of the district court with regard to counts through because no bivens claim is available against the defendants in their official capacities and no bivens remedy is available against the defendants in their individual capacities.but we find,contrary to the holding of the district court,that counts relating to liens and levies and failure to provide notice of tax assessment relate to collection activities under the taxpayer bill of rights and are therefore within the jurisdiction of the federal courts.that said,we affirm the district court dismissal of count for lack of jurisdiction,albeit for a different reason.moreover,the kims were not required to plead exhaustion pursuant to the taxpayer bill of rights in order to survive the defendants motion to dismiss counts and.we therefore affirm the district court with respect to counts through,and reverse with respect to counts and.
we review de novo the district court grant of a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction under rule b,am.fed of gov t,local nicholson,f d,and for failure to state a claim under rule b,atherton office of mayor.because jurisdiction is a threshold question,see steel citizens for a better env t,we turn first to the district court dismissals under rule b.
to the extent the kims asserted bivens claims against the defendants in their official capacities,the district court dismissed the claims under rule b.kim,d at.it is well established that bivens remedies do not exist against officials sued in their official capacities.see clark library of.we therefore affirm the district court with respect to its jurisdictional dismissal of counts through as against the defendants in their official capacities.
the district court concluded counts and were subject to dismissal under rule b for lack of jurisdiction because the challenged conduct was unrelated to collection activity as required by the taxpayer bill of rights.
the taxpayer bill of rights provides 
if,in connection with any collection of federal tax with respect to a taxpayer,any officer or employee of the internal revenue service recklessly or intentionally,or by reason of negligence,disregards any provision of this title,or any regulation promulgated under this title,such taxpayer may bring a civil action for damages against the united states in a district court of the united states.
a emphasis added.section applies only to activities.see miller united states,cir t he assessment or tax determination part of the internal revenue code enforcement process is not an act of collection and therefore,not actionable under.shaw united states,cir section its specific a taxpayer to sue the government only in connection with any collection of federal tax with respect to a taxpayer quoting a gonsalves irs,cir per curiam holding that a plaintiff claim based on the government refusal to give him a tax refund runs afoul of the clause in section which says that a taxpayer may sue only if an irs agent disregards a statute or regulation in connection with any collection of federal tax.see also rossotti,at stating in dicta,t o be sure,provides for a civil action only for damages arising from the collection of taxes.
count alleges violations of internal revenue code.section requires the secretary to provide a taxpayer notice of assessment within sixty days of making the assessment.that notice must stat e the amount of an unpaid tax and demand payment a.section appears in chapter of the internal revenue code,which is aptly entitled collection.this placement is persuasive.moreover,we think a demand for payment is certainly in connection with any collection of federal tax.that the demand is also a notice of assessment does not change this conclusion.a tax assessment is essentially a bookkeeping notation,recording a taxpayer liability.hibbs winn,internal quotation marks omitted.as such,the assessment serves as a trigger for administrative enforcement efforts such as tax liens or levies to collect outstanding taxes.id.at.in contrast,a taxpayer receives a notice of assessment after his liability is set.the notice of assessment signifies the beginning of the commission enforcement efforts.thus,the notice of assessment,unlike the assessment itself,is a precursor to the filing of a lien and the execution of a levy.
in addition,requires notice of assessment after the making of an assessment of a tax pursuant to section.unlike,however,appears in the statutory chapter entitled assessment and does not require prior notice to the taxpayer.see upon request of the taxpayer,the secretary shall furnish the taxpayer a copy of the record of the assessment.placement of the provision requiring notice of assessment in the chapter pertaining to collection is not happenstance.it strongly suggests the notice of assessment referred to in pertains to collections,while those actions authorized under do not.see miller,at because the statutory requirements of notice and demand are under,chapter,collection,notice and demand is a collection procedure.thus,the provision of notice of assessment is a collection activity.because count involves conduct in connection with collection,the district court improperly dismissed it for want of jurisdiction.
count alleges violation of and the irs restructuring and reform act of,which together require the commissioner to develop and implement review and disciplinary procedures for an irs employee decision to file a notice of lien,levy,or seizure,stat.like statutory section underlying count is also located in the irc chapter on collection.the text of provides,t he secretary shall collect the taxes imp
