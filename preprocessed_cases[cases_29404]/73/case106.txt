richard olsen olsen appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the district of massachusetts affirming an administrative determination by the internal revenue service irs office of appeals permitting the irs to collect by levy unpaid employment taxes and penalties owed by olsen.see olsen united states,d.we affirm.
background 
on march,the irs sent olsen a notice of intent to levy on his property in order to collect delinquent federal employment taxes for which he was liable as a responsible person under of the internal revenue code.given in accordance with a,the notice indicated that olsen owed about in unpaid employment taxes,penalties,and interest for the wages of employees of interactive arts,the notice of levy advised olsen of his right to request,within thirty days,an administrative appeal to challenge the proposed collection action.see a.
on march,olsen filed a timely request for a collection due process hearing hereafter sometime cdp hearing with respect to the unpaid employment taxes.in the cdp hearing request,olsen said he was filing this appeal to object to the service actions in attempting to undertake collections actions when an offer in compromise is the more effective and efficient means of collecting past due taxes.
on march,the irs appeals officer assigned to olsen case sent to olsen attorney,timothy burke burke,a letter notifying him that olsen cdp hearing was scheduled for march.the officer advised burke that the hearing would be informal and that y ou may present facts,arguments,and legal authority to support your position.the letter listed items that olsen had to submit if he wanted the appeals officer to consider collection alternatives such as an offer in compromise,an installment agreement,in the hearing.these items included a completed collection information statement form for individuals form for businesses.because olsen had not filed income tax returns for the years to,the officer stated that olsen also had to complete,and file with her,income tax returns for those years.it does not appear from the record that a hearing actually took place on march 
on or about july,sixteen months after his request for a cdp hearing,olsen filed a formal offer in compromise,proposing payment of to settle his income tax liability for the years to.olsen did not state in the offer that it was also submitted to settle the unpaid employment taxes that were the subject of the notice of intent to levy and his request for a cdp hearing.without questioning the irs claims as to the amount of either form of tax liability,olsen indicated as the basis for his offer in compromise his doubt as to collectibility i have insufficient assets and income to pay the full amount.olsen stated that the tax that is owed will never be paid,and that his financial history for the past ten years shows a pattern of financial reverses which is broken by an occasional year of success.he also stated h is spouse is a piano teacher whose income has not approached on an annual basis for the past ten years.he indicated that the source of the he was offering to pay was funds from family.
with his offer in compromise,olsen submitted a collection information statement for wage earners and individuals form and copies of his income tax returns for the years to.in the form,olsen reported having no checking or savings accounts,no investments,and no automobiles,and indicated that he receives in net business income each month.on august,the irs appeals officer called burke to ask that he provide olsen income tax returns containing original signatures that could be filed with the irs.
on november,olsen appeal was transferred to a new appeals officer.the officer noted in the case activity records that a levy source had been identified,a toyota camry owned by olsen,with no lien,purchased in.the records noted that olsen wife owned a volkswagen passat with no lien and that she leased a ford taurus.the appeals officer also indicated that joint income tax returns by olsen and his wife reflected,among other income,income from a venture capital business owned by olsen as well as income of from a partnership known as tektonic partners llc for and income of from this partnership for.
on november,the appeals officer wrote to burke,informing him that a t this point the offer in compromise is not processable as income tax returns with original signatures had not yet been filed.the officer also pointed out that the offer in compromise only listed the periods for the income tax returns from to and made no reference to the employment tax liabilities that were the subject of the notice of levy and olsen request for a cdp hearing.the officer requested that burke update the offer in compromise to include the trust fund recovery penalty balance due periods as well.insofar as appears,this was never done.the officer also asked burke to provide certain other information including an income tax return for the year a collection information statement form for olsen venture capital business a form for tektonic partners llc and partnership income tax returns form for tektonic partners llc.the appeals officer also inquired as to the status of the camry,which was not reflected in olsen financial statements.she requested a response by december.
on december,burke mailed to the appeals officer olsen income tax return for and a form for tektonic partners llc for,which indicated income from tektonic partners llc in the amount of.burke wrote kindly note that the taxpayer does not have an interest in tektonic partners.accordingly,please appri s e me as to your reasons for requesting that the taxpayer prepare a financial statement for an entity owned by his spouse.according to the tax return for tektonic partners llc,olsen now owned of tektonic partners llc.
on december,burke sent to the appeals officer additional information,including olsen requested income tax returns with original signatures for the years to.the officer forwarded the income tax returns for filing elsewhere within the irs.at this point,some of the requested information still had to be provided,but the officer concluded that receipt and filing of the original tax returns allowed her to process the offer in compromise,which,on january,she began to do.
the case activity records reflect that,on january,burke called the appeals officer and informed her that he had sent the remainder of the requested information.the records also reflect that he told the officer that the offer in compromise was for all periods and that he would amend it if necessary.
on january,the appeals officer wrote to burke and asked for the following information requested in november but never received a form for olsen venture capital business,a form for tektonic partners llc,and a statement on the status of the camry.the officer also requested for the first time the following additional information forms and forms for three other tektonic partnerships and the source of unexplained deposits totaling over into olsen bank account during the period for which bank statements had been provided.the appeals officer wrote although you had informed me that one of the tektonic partnerships is owned by olsen,the requested information is still necessary.the letter also indicated that the officer had learned of a tektonic partners located in boston,and asked whether this was one of the partnerships in which or olsen had an interest.the officer requested that the previously requested documents be provided by february,and the rest of the information by february.
on january,and march,burke sent to the appeals officer some but not all of the requested information.he stated in the january letter that the camry was owned and used by olsen daughter.with the march letter,burke included tax returns for the year for the tektonic partnerships,stating that a ll interests in these entities are held by olsen spouse.
on april,the appeals officer sent another letter to burke,identifying the information that was necessary to complete her review of the offer in compromise.the officer requested information she had requested twice before in november and january and had still not received,including a form for olsen venture capital business and a form for tektonic partners llc.the officer also requested the following information,which had been requested in january but still not received forms for each of the other three tektonic partnerships,the source of over in unexplained deposits to olsen bank account,and information regarding tektonic partners located in boston.the officer asked that the information be provided by april,and she warned that i f the information requested is not provided by that date my determination may be made with the information currently available.on april,the appeals officer noted in the case activity records that olsen had not yet provided the requested information despite having been given three chances,and that his offer in compromise was not acceptable.
six weeks after the april deadline,the appeals officer still had not received the requested materials.on may,she sent olsen a notice of determination,informing him that the proposed collection action was fully sustained.the appeals officer stated that the offer in compromise was not acceptable because olsen had failed to submit information necessary to evaluate the offer despite repeated requests.specifically,the officer noted that olsen was a venture capitalist,and had failed to provide v erification of several items such as a financial statement for his business and financial statements for several other businesses.the notice concluded that the proposed collection action was now necessary to provide for the efficient collection of taxes despite the potential intrusiveness of enforced collection.the notice of determination also advised olsen of his right to seek judicial review by filing a complaint in the district court within days of the date of the notice.see d.
olsen thereafter filed a timely complaint in the massachusetts federal district court he alleged that the irs had denied him the right to a cdp hearing as guaranteed by,and asked t hat this matter be remanded to the service for full consideration.
the government produced to olsen the administrative record made up of documents,case activity records,and the like,recording the events described above.olsen thereupon filed a motion to conduct discovery prior to the filing of dispositive motions.as grounds for the motion,olsen stated that certain public information showed that the irs has systematically evaded the responsibilities given to it by congress as part of the revenue restructuring act of and that matters such as the plaintiff are not being properly considered.olsen also argued,inter alia,that discovery was necessary in order to determine whether the settlement officer failed to meet her responsibilities,including communicating with the plaintiff counsel.the district court denied the motion.
the government moved to affirm the irs appeals officer decision and to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the appeals officer had acted properly in sustaining the proposed collection action.olsen moved for a remand of the case to the irs for further administrative proceedings.the district court granted the motion to affirm,denied the motion for remand,and dismissed the complaint.see olsen,d at.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
overview of 
this appeal is from a form of administrative proceeding first provided by congress in in order to ameliorate any harshness caused by allowing the irs to levy on property without any provision for advance hearing or procedural due process in addition to already existing procedures.see living care alternatives of utica,united states,cir.enacted as part of the irs restructuring and reform act of,stat,subsection a of the statute provides for notice to the taxpayer before levy subsection b creates the right to a hearing and subsection c outlines the content of the hearing.see meadows comm r,cir.as noted in footnote,supra,treasury regulations construe the hearing provision as not necessarily requiring a encounter one or more written or oral communications will suffice.olsen does not challenge the validity of the treasury regulation in this particular.
in the hearing,the taxpayer may raise any relevant issue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy,including offers of collection alternatives,which may include an.c a.the appeals officer is to take into consideration verification that the requirements of any applicable law or administrative procedure have been met,any issues raised by the taxpayer,and whether any proposed collection action balances the need for the efficient collection of taxes with the legitimate concern of the person that any collection action be no more intrusive than necessary.id.c.if the taxpayer is dissatisfied with the administrative determination,judicial review is available.see id.d footnote,supra.
standard of review 
in a cdp case in which,as here,the amount of the underlying tax liability is not at issue,the trial court and the court of appeals review the determination of the irs appeals officer for abuse of discretion.see living care,at jones comm r,cir,at legislative history of indicating that where the underlying tax liability is not at issue,the appeals officer determination as to the appropriateness of the collection activity will be reviewed using an abuse of discretion standard of review.
it is worth noting that in living care,the sixth circuit also stated that in providing for cdp hearings on what is ordinarily a scant record,congress must have been contemplating a more deferential review of these tax appeals than of more formal agency decisions.id.at.the court went on to conclude,without a clear abuse of discretion in the sense of clear taxpayer abuse and unfairness by the irs,as contemplated by congress,the judiciary will inevitably become involved on a daily basis with tax enforcement details that judges are neither qualified,nor have the time,to administer.id.at.see also id.at a t the very least,in order to overturn the irs decisions,we must be convinced that the type of taxpayer abuse that congress sought to remedy by enacting has occurred in the case.
our own analysis of the review standard and congress wishes are much in accord with those set forth by the sixth circuit in living care.it must be borne in mind that taxpayers have further recourse,besides the cdp hearing,to procedures.while congress clearly wanted to prevent mere bureaucratic harassment,we do not understand it to have intended to strip the irs of effective and reasonable tax collection procedures.
determination of the irs appeals officer 
olsen argues the appeals officer misconstrued or overlooked the above statutory standards,and abused her discretion.we do not agree.
in a cdp hearing,taxpayers are expected to provide all relevant information requested by the irs office of appeals,including financial statements,for its consideration of the facts and issues involved in the hearing.reg.e.the irs office of appeals repeatedly asked burke for information it believed necessary to evaluate fully olsen offer to compromise for a tax liability which including the employment taxes was well in excess of.olsen did not contest the irs calculation of the total amount of the employment or other tax deficiency but rather defended his proposed offer in compromise solely on his purported inability to pay more.focus was thus upon olsen ability to pay,making it reasonable for the irs to inquire carefully into his circumstances.yet olsen was less than forthcoming with the information requested by the irs in areas where joint income tax filings and his wife bank deposits raised questions as to his true worth.not only were his responses slow in coming,they remained incomplete and,except for blanket assertions,little alternative information was tendered that might have clarified matters.the appeals officer unsuccessfully asked three letters dated november,january,and april a form for olsen venture capital business and a form for tektonic partners llc.in the january and april letters,the appeals officer requested the following information the source of over in unexplained deposits into olsen bank accounts,a form for the other tektonic partnerships,and information regarding tektonic partners llc located in boston 
the appeals officer warned burke in her november,letter,that,i f the requested information and documentation is not provided,i can not consider the offer in compromise as a collection alternative.in the letter dated january,the officer warned that f ailure of the olsens to provide the information by the due dates will result in a determination hearing being made with the information contained in the file.similarly,in the april,letter,the officer warned burke that i f the information requested is not provided my determination may be made with the information currently available.the instructions to form,offer in compromise,also warned olsen that failure to respond to inquiries for information in a timely manner constitutes grounds for giving no further consideration to an offer in compromise.despite these warnings,the requested information was not provided.
olsen complains that some of the information he did not provide could not be considered by the irs appeals officer because that information related to assets or business entities owned by his wife,not by him.he also contends the district court erred in finding that he owned certain assets.
olsen is correct that the district court itself was seemingly inaccurate when it recounted that he owned two cars which were unencumbered by liens and that he leased a third automobile,and that a federal tax lien could be placed on these vehicles.see olsen,d at.the case activity records reflect that olsen purchased a camry in the year.after several inquiries by the appeals officer,burke informed the officer that the camry was owned by olsen daughter.the case activity records indicate that olsen owned one of the other cars and leased the third.but the court factual errors relative to ownership of the cars were not central to the outcome.olsen version of who owned what seems adequately to have been passed along to the appeals officer and to have been understood by her.the district court premised its affirmation of the appeals officer determination mainly upon the affirmative steps taken by the appeals officer to obtain the financial information necessary to evaluate the offer and olsen failure to provide that information.id.at.
as for the district court finding that olsen owned certain business ventures,the record demonstrates that olsen did in fact claim that he had an interest in a venture capital business.olsen stated on his form that he receives in net business income each month but did not identify its source.his income tax returns for the years to indicated that his business was a venture capital business.thus,given olsen insistence that he could not pay his conceded liability,it was entirely reasonable for the appeals officer to seek more information about olsen venture capital business and,as well,to want to look with care into the family assets so as to verify olsen inability to pay 
olsen contends that the appeals officer improperly asked for financial information about business entities in which his wife alone had an interest.on this premise,olsen argues that he justifiably failed to provide collection information statements for tektonic partners llc as well as for the three other tektonic partnerships.he also failed to respond to the officer inquiry regarding the tektonic partners located in boston.the information was,however,relevant to evaluating olsen offer in compromise,irrespective of whether the business interests belonged to him,his wife,or both of them.olsen income tax returns for the years to showed well over in income from tektonic partners llc each of those years.and the tax return for one of the partnerships,tektonic,llc,listed olsen as a owner 
t he decision to accept or reject an offer to compromise is left to the discretion of the secretary.reg.c see also the secretary may compromise any civil or criminal case arising under the internal revenue laws emphasis added.even where a taxpayer is offering to compromise a tax liability for which the taxpayer spouse has no liability,the secretary may,in appropriate circumstances,seek information about the nonliable spouse income and assets.reg.c ii a provides that information concerning a nonliable spouse may be considered,inter alia,to the extent property has been transferred by the taxpayer to the nonliable spouse for the purpose of removing the property from consideration by the irs in evaluating the compromise or for the purpose of verifying the amount of and responsibility for expenses claimed by the taxpayer.
in the instant case,both rules are material.the facts in the record are open to the suggestion that olsen may have transferred his own interests in tektonic to his wife.the record indicates that olsen may have held an interest in the tektonic partnerships at least through the year.the olsens joint income tax returns showed income from tektonic partners llc in the amount of for,for,and for.the tax return for the year for tektonic,llc listed olsen as a owner.on october,olsen signed the year tax return for tektonic partners llc as the general partner designated as the tax matters partner for the tax year of the return.this same tax return indicated,however,that olsen owned of the interest of tektonic partners llc.on december,just two months after olsen signed this tax return as the tax matters partner,burke informed the appeals officer that olsen had no interest in tektonic partners llc and that of the interest was owned by his wife.based on these statements,it was not unreasonable for the appeals officer to suspect that olsen may have owned interests in the tektonic partnerships at least through the year and that he may have transferred his interests to his wife for the purpose of removing the assets from consideration by the irs in evaluating his offer in compromise 
the regulation permitting consideration of information about a nonliable spouse for the purpose of verifying the amount of and responsibility for expenses claimed by the taxpayer is also relevant here.reg.c ii a.on his form,olsen indicated the amount he pays for certain living expenses,such as food,housing,utilities,and insurance.for example,he stated that he paid per month for life insurance.an insurance statement olsen later submitted showed that he was insured for million at a monthly premium of annual premium of.because olsen claimed to pay only of the monthly premium,the appeals officer had reason to question the source of the remaining each month.olsen had earlier contended in his offer in compromise that he had insufficient funds to pay the full amount of his tax liability,and that h is spouse is a piano teacher whose income has not approached on an annual basis for the past ten years.at the same time,there were over in unexplained deposits into his wife bank account over a period.in light of these circumstances,the appeals officer was entitled to review olsen assets and income in order to verify the amount of and responsibility for the life insurance expense and other expenses claimed by olsen.
given olsen failure to cooperate fully despite the appeals officer repeated attempts to obtain the information deemed necessary to evaluate the offer and,in particular,olsen claimed inability to pay,we can not say the appeals officer abused her discretion in determining the collection action to be no more intrusive than necessary.c.
motion to conduct discovery and scope of district court review 
olsen argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to conduct discovery and in limiting its review to the administrative record.he now also contends,for the first time on appeal,that,under robinette commissioner,wl en banc,appeal docketed,cir,the district court should have conducted its review pursuant to a de novo trial.in robinette,the tax court held that,when reviewing for abuse of discretion under d,the tax court is not limited by the administrative procedure act apa nor is its review limited to the administrative record.id.at,wl 
taking the last issue first,we find no merit to olsen claim of entitlement to a de novo trial below.no claim to a de novo trial was made to the district court.it is a bedrock rule that w
