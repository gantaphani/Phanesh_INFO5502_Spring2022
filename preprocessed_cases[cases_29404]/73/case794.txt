on september,the irs sent robinette a notice of its intent to impose a levy to collect the full original liability minus the amount already paid under the,and of his rights to a hearing before the levy,as required under.robinette responded with a timely request for a collection due process hearing,in which he noted that he was disputing whether he owed the amounts being levied.the collection due process proceedings were conducted informally and consisted of a series of telephone calls and correspondence between an irs appeals officer and robinette,douglas coy.during these conversations,coy claimed that he mailed robinette return on october,which,pursuant to extensions robinette had received,was the date on which the return was due.coy provided a copy of the return,which the irs received and processed as an original return on february.
despite coy insistence that he mailed the return by mail with several other clients returns shortly before midnight on october,the appeals officer determined that the return had not been timely filed,and he recommended that the levy be imposed.the appeals officer noted that robinette had not complied with several requests to file the return before the offer was defaulted,and that robinette had not proposed a new or any other alternative to collection.consistent with this recommendation,the irs office of appeals issued a determination that the notice of intent to levy was appropriate.
robinette appealed to the tax court pursuant to d,arguing that the appeals officer had abused his discretion by proceeding with the collection.the tax court held a trial and agreed with robinette.robinette comm r,wl.the tax court found that robinette had not filed his return in a timely manner,but that his failure to do so was not material to his.since the breach was immaterial,the tax court reasoned,the offer should not have been defaulted,and the decision to proceed with collection was an abuse of discretion.id.at.the case generated five concurring opinions,a dissenting opinion of two judges,and a third dissenting vote.
prior to,the irs was permitted to collect a tax liability by levy against a taxpayer property,without prior opportunity for a hearing or due process,so long as there were adequate remedies.see phillips comm r.apparently concerned about potential abuses of this administrative authority to seize a taxpayer property,congress created an administrative proceeding,commonly known as a collection due process hearing,in the internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of.the applicable statute requires notice to the taxpayer of a right to a hearing before a levy is made,a,and guarantees the right to a fair hearing before an impartial officer from the internal revenue service office of appeals.id.b.in the hearing,the taxpayer may raise any relevant issue relating to unpaid tax or the proposed levy,including challenges to the appropriateness of collection actions,and offers of collection alternatives,which may include an.id.c a.the appeals officer then must consider whether any proposed collection action balances the need for the efficient collection of taxes with the legitimate concern of the person that any collection action be no more intrusive than necessary.c c.
the statute also affords a right of judicial review of the determination by the impartial hearing officer,in either the tax court or a united states district court,depending on whether the tax court has jurisdiction.id.d.judicial review in this case was available in the tax court because the levy related to robinette underlying liability for unpaid income tax.see f.
consistent with the legislative history of the act,the parties agree that the tax court reviews the decision of an irs hearing officer under an abuse of discretion standard of review.see conf,at where the validity of the tax liability is not properly part of the appeal,the taxpayer may challenge the determination of the appeals officers for abuse of discretion.in such cases,the appeals officer determination as to the appropriateness of collection activity will be reviewed using an abuse of discretion standard of review.two of our sister circuits have concluded that in providing for cdp hearings on what is ordinarily a scant record,congress must have been contemplating a more deferential review of these tax appeals than of more formal agency decisions.olsen united states,cir quoting living care alternatives of utica,united states,cir.we see merit in the observation of these courts that congress likely contemplated review for a clear abuse of discretion in the sense of clear taxpayer abuse and unfairness by the irs,lest the judiciary become involved on a daily basis with tax enforcement details that congress intended to leave with the irs,at quoting living care,at 
there is a substantial dispute in this case,however,concerning the scope of the record on which this deferential judicial review should take place.robinette argues,and a majority of the tax court held,that the tax court may receive new evidence in the course of reviewing whether an appeals officer abused his discretion in denying relief during a collection due process hearing.indeed,a significant portion of the tax court analysis that the appeals officer abused his discretion in this case was based on evidence not presented during the administrative appeal.the commissioner contends this was error,and that consistent with general principles of administrative law and the administrative procedure act apa,judicial review of the agency decision should be limited to the administrative record developed at the hearing before the appeals officer.
it is a basic principle of administrative law that review of administrative decisions is ordinarily limited to consideration of the decision of the agency and of the evidence on which it was based.united states carlo bianchi,d.outside the context of the apa,the supreme court has held that where congress simply provides for judicial review,without setting forth the standards to be used or the procedures to be followed,consideration is to be confined to the administrative record,and no de novo proceeding may be held.id.at.in reviewing agency action under the abuse of discretion standard specified in the apa,a,the focal point for judicial review should be the administrative record already in existence,not some new record made initially in the reviewing court.camp pitts,d per curiam.
robinette contention,therefore,is that the review of decisions by an irs appeals officer under should be exempt from both the statutory framework of the apa and from general principles of administrative law that limit the scope of judicial review to the administrative record we are not persuaded that congress endorsed such a departure when it authorized judicial review of irs levy activity in the tax court and the united states district courts.the apa itself says that a subsequently enacted statute may not be held to supersede or modify the judicial review provisions of,except to the extent that it does so expressly.whether or not the congress of may bind the congress of to make an express statement permitting the tax court to consider evidence outside the administrative record,see lockhart united states,d scalia,concurring,the supreme court has discerned in the apa a statutory intent that legislative departure from the norm must be clear,dickinson zurko,d,and held that exemptions from the apa are not lightly to be presumed.marcello bonds.
nothing in the text or history of the restructuring and reform act of clearly indicates an intent by congress to permit trials de novo in the tax court when that court reviews decisions of irs appeals officers under.if anything,the available evidence suggests the opposite.the standard of review itself implies that review is limited to the administrative record,for as the tax court seemingly recognized in another case,it would be incongruous to hold that review is limited to determining whether an appeals officer abused his discretion,but also to conclude that the appeals officer committed such an abuse by failing to weigh information that was never even presented to him.see magana comm r,wl i t would be anomalous and improper for us to conclude that respondent appeals office abused its discretion under section c in failing to grant relief,or in failing to consider arguments,issues,or other matter not raised by taxpayers or not otherwise brought to the attention of respondent appeals office.congress has employed the abuse of discretion standard of review in various settings,and in each case,judicial review under that standard has been limited to the administrative record.see,e b b.we think it unlikely that congress meant anything different here 
the tax court seemed to believe that because it traditionally has conducted de novo proceedings in deficiency proceedings,and because congress did not change that practice when it passed the apa in,congress should likewise be presumed to have intended de novo proceedings in the tax court in connection with the review of decisions by an appeals officer under.we do not think the proposed conclusion follows from the history.collection due process hearings under were administrative proceedings in,and the statute provided for a corresponding new form of limited judicial review.the nature and purpose of these proceedings are different from deficiency determinations,and it is just as likely that congress believed judicial review of decisions by appeals officers in this context should be conducted in accordance with traditional principles of administrative law.indeed,that congress provided for judicial review in either the tax court or a united states district court,depending on the type of underlying tax liability involved,indicates that traditional principles of administrative law should apply.every district court to consider an appeal under has limited its review to the record created before the agency,see olsen,at,and it would be anomalous to conclude that congress intended in d to create disparate forms of judicial review depending on which court was reviewing the decision of an irs appeals officer in a collection due process proceeding 
that the collection due process hearings are informal does not suggest that the scope of judicial review should exceed the record created before the agency.agencies typically compile records in the course of informal agency action,and t he apa specifically contemplates judicial review on the basis of the agency record compiled in the course of informal agency action in which a hearing has not occurred.power light lorion,d.we thus find unpersuasive robinette reliance on commissioner,cir,which was premised on a understanding that informal agency action can not be reviewed based on an administrative record.id.at.of course,where a record created in informal proceedings does not adequately disclose the basis for the agency decision,then it may be appropriate for the reviewing court to receive evidence concerning what happened during the agency proceedings.citizens to overton park volpe,d.the evidentiary proceeding in those circumstances,however,is not a de novo trial,but rather is limited to the receipt of testimony or evidence explaining the reasoning behind the agency decision.camp,at.
robinette asserts that the record created by the appeals officer here was inadequate to permit judicial review,but he points to no specific deficiencies.the appeals officer examined robinette file and obtained relevant documents,including the original compromise and the letters sent by the irs.he also kept a log detailing the dates and times of contact with the taxpayer representative,along with brief notes about the subjects discussed in those conversations,and wrote a memorandum explaining his reasons for recommending the levy.the tax court supplemented this record with testimony from the appeals officer that further elucidated his rationale.this record is sufficient to permit a determination whether the appeals officer abused his discretion.we will therefore limit our review to that information which was before the irs.see olsen,at finding adequate a record that contained,inter alia,an original,the irs communications and the taxpayer responses,and the appeal officer conclusions.
basing our review on the information that was before the appeals officer,we next consider whether the irs abused its discretion in proceeding with collection of robinette tax liability.the tax court believed that the appeals officer did not have an open mind to robinette arguments,and that he should have independently analyzed whether the had been materially breached.at.we disagree.
the tax court cited arkansas case law and the restatement of contracts for the proposition that a party obligation to perform under a contract is discharged only by a material breach.at it is generally true that a material failure to perform excuses the other party obligations under the contract.see restatement second of contracts.it is not true,however,that only material failures to perform excuse the other party nonperformance.in fact,material failures merely operate as the of a condition,the condition being the obligation to perform under the contract.id.at cmt.where a condition is not a constructive term of the contract,but an express obligation upon which a party performance depends,performance subject to that condition can not become due unl
