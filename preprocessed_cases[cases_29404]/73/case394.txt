four federal trust and three of its a district court decision that they were not entitled to tax deductions for fees paid to investment advisors.scott united states,d,memorandum opinion the opinion.in particular,the taxpayers maintain that a trust fees should be fully deductible under e of the internal revenue code because such fees are incurred as a result of the fact that the property is held in trust.for the reasons explained below,we agree with the government that such fees are not fully deductible,and we affirm,albeit on alternate grounds,the district court award of summary judgment.
this appeal involves the trust under the will of john stewart bryan the bryan trust or the trust and three of its income beneficiaries.in,these four taxpayers collectively,the taxpayers filed four separate lawsuits in the eastern district of virginia,seeking refunds for taxes paid in the and tax years.the suits were consolidated because they all raise the same issue whether a trust is entitled to deduct,in full,fees paid for investment advice.
to resolve this issue,it is necessary to understand certain essential legal principles governing federal taxation of trusts and estates.first and foremost,an individual taxpayer is entitled to deduct fees for investment advice only to the extent that the sum of those fees,plus the taxpayer other miscellaneous itemized deductions,exceeds of the taxpayer adjusted gross income.a under e of the internal revenue code the estates and trusts are subject to this same floor,except to the extent that administrative costs would not have been incurred if the property were not held in such trust or estate.id.e if the fees qualify for the exception created by e,they are fully deductible in calculating adjusted gross income.
our sister circuits have split over the proper resolution of the legal issue presented here,that is,whether a trust fees are fully deductible under e.in commissioner of internal revenue,cir,the sixth circuit held that such fees are fully deductible because trustees incur them in performing their fiduciary duties,duties which do not affect ordinary individual taxpayers.conversely and more recently,the federal circuit,in mellon bank,united states,held that such fees are subject to the floor regardless of a trustee fiduciary duties,because such fees are commonly incurred by individuals.id.at.according to the federal circuit,fees do not qualify for the exception established by e 
between and,john stewart bryan became a grandfather to four girls all sisters.these granddaughters include taxpayers shelah scott,hope childs,and anne mcguire on october,pursuant to bryan will,the bryan trust was established under virginia law.the trust directed the payment of all of its current income in quarterly installments to a series of lifetime beneficiaries,ending with bryan granddaughters.when a granddaughter dies,her share of the trust income passes to her husband and children as directed in her will or,if there is no provision in her will,to her descendants per stirpes.upon the death of the last granddaughter,each granddaughter share of the trust principal is to be distributed to her husband and children as directed in her will or,if there is no provision in her will,to her descendants per stirpes.
the bryan trust authorized its trustees to make a broad variety of investments whether or not any investment shall produce income,without regard to any statute or other law concerning the investment of trust funds,and without incurring liability for losses as a result of such investments.it also directed the trustees to keep in mind possible changes in monetary or other standards which might affect the purchasing power of trust assets.the trust authorized its trustees to employ investment advisors and to pay those advisors reasonable charges and fees for their services.
in,the trustees of the bryan trust retained brundage,story and rose,llc bs r,an firm in new york city,which provides its clients with a full spectrum of investment advice and monitoring services.bs r clients include not only institutions such as trusts,endowments,foundations,and pension plans,but also wealthy individuals and families.bs r provides an identical range of services to both institutional and individual clients.
during and,the tax years at issue in this case,the bryan trust had assets worth approximately million.the income beneficiaries were scott,childs,mcguire,and their sister who lived in ohio.the trustees were three.cotesworth pinckney a partner at troutman sanders llp,which was known as mays valentine,llp during the tax years at issue,lucius bracey,a partner at mcguirewoods llp,and richard taylor a former partner at cadwalader,wickersham taft llp.the taxpayers allege that the trustees lacked expertise in the investment of large sums of money and that they would not have served without outside investment advice.
in and,respectively,the bryan trust paid bs r and in fees for investment advice.the trust also paid custodian fees,trustees fees,and fees for the preparation of income tax returns and accountings.
on their and income tax returns,the taxpayers reported the fees paid to bs r as other deductions,not subject to the floor for miscellaneous itemized deductions.after an audit,the irs determined that the fees were,in fact,miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the floor.a.consequently,the irs concluded that the taxpayers owed additional income taxes for the and tax years.in early,the taxpayers paid the additional taxes and interest.they then filed refund claims with the irs,contending that the fees that the bryan trust had paid to bs r were not subject to the floor applicable to miscellaneous itemized deductions.the irs denied the refund claims.
thereafter,the taxpayers filed their four refund suits in the eastern district of virginia.after the suits were consolidated,the government filed a motion for summary judgment in which it maintained,consistent with the federal circuit decision in mellon bank,that the trust fees were subject to the floor.the taxpayers filed a cross motion for summary judgment contending,in accordance with the sixth circuit decision in,that the fees qualified for e exception from the floor.at oral argument on the motions,the court raised a new is,the immunity afforded under virginia law to trustees who invest trust assets in a statutory list of approved investments.see ann.michie the virginia legal list the court sought additional briefing on the potential impact of that immunity on the deductibility of fees.
after further briefing and argument on the virginia law issue,the court granted the government motion for summary judgment.opinion at the court explained that,under virginia law,trustees could fully satisfy their fiduciary duties by limiting themselves to certain investments specifically authorized by the virginia legal list.opinion at see also ann.michie.the court acknowledged that investments authorized by the virginia legal list might not be the best investments from a financial perspective and that trustees would probably be better served by seeking investment advice.opinion at.the court concluded,however,that the trustees were under no obligation to do so.id.accordingly,the court concluded that when a virginia trustee seeks investment advice he is doing nothing different than what an individual investor might do in that a trustee need and an individual need for investment advice both spring from the same increase profitability.id.
pursuant to this reasoning,the court decided that the trust fees were subject to the floor of a,and it awarded summary judgment to the government.opinion at.the taxpayers have filed a timely notice of appeal,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
