defendant patrick roxworthy,in his capacity as vice president of tax at yum brands,yum,appeals the district court order enforcing an internal revenue service irs administrative summons demanding production of two memoranda that yum argues are protected by work product privilege.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the district court order to compel their production and remand to the district court for entry of an order granting roxworthy motion to quash.
the irs is conducting an investigation of yum tax liability for fiscal years,and.as part of yum response to an informal document request,it produced a privilege log listing seven documents that it believed were protected from turnover to the irs by the work product doctrine.the irs thereupon issued an administrative summons to roxworthy in his capacity as vice president of tax at yum,seeking production of the seven documents that appeared on the privilege log.five of the seven documents were ultimately produced to the irs after the parties entered into a limitation of waiver agreement.the remaining two documents are memoranda prepared by kpmg,llp,an audit and consulting firm,analyzing the tax consequences of certain transactions entered by yum pertaining to the creation of a captive insurance company and related stock transfers,including possible arguments that the irs could mount against yum chosen tax treatment of the transactions and possible.the irs filed a petition in the united states district court for the western district of kentucky to enforce its summons as to the kpmg memoranda.after a hearing,a magistrate judge entered a report and recommendation that the summons be enforced,concluding that the kpmg memoranda were created not in anticipation of litigation but rather to assist yum in the preparation of its taxes and yearly audit.
roxworthy filed objections to the magistrate judge findings of fact,conclusions of law,and recommendation,and moved to expand the record to include additional affidavits and deposition testimony.the district court granted roxworthy motion to expand the record.roxworthy introduced additional affidavits clarifying that the memoranda at issue were not prepared to assist yum in the preparation of its taxes,but rather were created because yum anticipated litigation due to its upcoming recognition of a million loss for tax purposes but not book purposes,the conspicuousness of such a tax treatment,the certainty of an irs audit due to yum size,the unsettled nature of the law in that area,and yum belief that the irs was inclined to litigate such matters.after hearing oral arguments on roxworthy objections,the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation as the opinion of the court.roxworthy filed a motion for a stay pending appeal,which the district court denied.roxworthy filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal in this court,which we granted on july.this appeal follows.
standard of review 
we review a district court work product privilege determination for abuse of discretion.toledo edison g a,cir the district court abuses its discretion if it becomes clear that the judge has applied an improper standard,or has failed to follow the established legal rules or has based the decision on a record devoid of facts to support that decision.toledo edison,at.although roxworthy correctly observes that the district court decided the matter upon the parties papers and arguments without hearing any testimony evidence,we have recognized that a district court factual determinations are subject to clear error review even where no live testimony was heard.see steel fuhrman,cir.
meaning of in anticipation of litigation 
the work product privilege was first recognized by the supreme court in hickman taylor.the doctrine rationale,as originally articulated,was to permit an attorney to assemble information,sift what he considers to be the relevant from the irrelevant facts,prepare his legal theories and plan his strategy without undue and needless interference to promote justice and to protect his clients interests.id.at.the current doctrine,as set forth in federal rule of civil procedure b,protects from discovery documents and tangible things prepared in anticipation of litigation by or for a party or by or for that party representative.a party asserting the work product privilege bears the burden of establishing that the documents he or she seeks to protect were prepared in anticipation of litigation.in re powerhouse licensing,llc,cir toledo edison,at.
we have yet to define in anticipation of litigation.other circuits have adopted the standard first articulated in wright and miller federal practice and procedures,asking whether a document was prepared or obtained because of the prospect of litigation.united states adlman adlman ii,cir accord union fire ins.of pittsburgh murray sheet metal,cir binks presto,cir in re grand jury proceedings,cir.we have articulated and applied the because of standard in our unpublished cases,see stampley state farm fire cas,cir arkwright mutual ins.nat.union fire ins,wl,at,and district courts from our circuit have also applied this test,see in re om group sec,guardsmark,blue cross blue shield of.today,we join our sister circuits and adopt the because of test as the standard for determining whether documents were prepared in anticipation of litigation.
adopting this standard prompts the further question of when documents can be said to have been created because of the prospect of litigation.it is clear that documents prepared in the ordinary course of business,or pursuant to public requirements unrelated to litigation,or for other nonlitigation purposes,are not covered by the work product privilege.b advisory committee notes union,at in re sealed case.thus,a document will not be protected if it would have been prepared in substantially the same manner irrespective of the anticipated litigation.adlman ii,at.furthermore,courts applying the because of test have typically recognized both a subjective and objective element to the inquiry that is,a party must have had a subjective belief that litigation was a real possibility,and that belief must have been objectively reasonable.in re sealed case,at see also martin bally park place hotel casino,cir requiring anticipation to be objectively reasonable union,at same guardsmark,at following in re sealed case.we therefore embrace the test used by a number of the district courts in our circuit,including the district court in this case,which asks whether a document was created because of a party subjective anticipation of litigation,as contrasted with an ordinary business purpose,and whether that subjective anticipation of litigation was objectively reasonable.see,in re om group sec,at guardsmark,at.
subjective anticipation of litigation 
the two memoranda at issue here were made available to us for in camera review.the documents appear to be two versions of the same memorandum.both are dated march,and are addressed from kpmg to matthew preston,identifying him as the corporate counsel of tricon global restaurants,tricon,which was yum predecessor company.the memoranda are similar in content but differ in length one is pages,and the other is pages.both bear a designation of privilege but do not bear any designation.
yum argues that the documents themselves are the best evidence that they were created in anticipation of litigation.indeed,apart from eleven pages of background facts regarding tricon creation of a captive insurance company and subsequent transfer of stock,both of which occurred prior to the memoranda completion,the memoranda contain dense legal analysis of current tax law,including arguments and in certain areas of law that the memoranda argue are unsettled.the conclusions portion of each memo states that it is more likely than not that the following federal tax consequences among others will result from the transactions described herein and that such consequences will be supported by substantial authority within the meaning of reg.d.the conclusions that follow include statements about the tax treatment of the premium payment and loss payment,calculation of the basis of tricon stock,and the proper recognition of taxable income and capital loss resulting from the transaction.the discussion section of each memo sets forth the rationale for kpmg conclusions and some of the more likely theories that could be asserted by the irs in challenging kpmg conclusions.the discussion section in each of the memoranda expresses legal conclusions throughout,using language such as the following w e believe that it is likely that a court would agree with it would seem that unless certain events occur,this issue may not be contested we believe that it is more likely than not that a court would agree that it appears reasonable to rely on a lthough not free from doubt,we believe that the hypothetical argument would be rejected by a court and i t is possible that the application of certain tax rules could be raised 
as in delaney,migdail young,chartered irs,the kpmg memoranda advise the withholding party of the types of legal challenges likely to be mounted,potential defenses available,and the likely outcome.in upholding the asserted protection,the court in delaney noted that the requesting party sought the attorneys assessment of the program legal vulnerabilities in order to make sure it does not miss anything in crafting its legal case,which was precisely the type of discovery the court refused to permit in hickman taylor.id.so too here,the irs would appear to obtain an unfair advantage by gaining access to kpmg detailed legal analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of yum position.this factor weighs in favor of recognizing the documents as privileged.
nevertheless,the key issue in determining whether a document should be withheld is the function that the document serves.coastal states gas dep t of energy.because documents are not protected if they were created for nonlitigation purposes,regardless of content,d etermining the driving force behind the preparation of each requested document is therefore required in resolving a work product immunity question.union,at.thus we must examine not only the documents themselves,but the circumstances surrounding the documents creation.
the original affidavits available to the magistrate judge contained for the most part conclusory assertions that the documents were created in anticipation of litigation.for instance,matthew preston,the vice president,associate general counsel,and assistant secretary of yum and addressee of the kpmg memoranda,asserted that it was anticipated that there would be a tax controversy,including potential litigation,between the company and the internal revenue service,that he sought opinion letters from kpmg in anticipation of litigation with the irs,and that he would not have obtained the opinion letters from kpmg but for the anticipation of federal income tax controversy proceedings,including litigation,between yum and the irs.joint appendix at preston aff.june.greg engel,a partner at kpmg,provided an affidavit substantially similar to preston.see engel aff.june.
the magistrate judge concluded that yum bare,conclusory affidavit allegations failed to show it had a subjective belief that litigation was a real possibility at the time the memoranda were completed.report and recommendation at.the magistrate judge further concluded that the memoranda were more likely prepared to assist yum in the preparation of its taxes and the avoidance of understatement penalties if the irs disagreed with yum tax treatment,and therefore concluded that the documents were part of the regular course of business and would have been created irrespective of any potential for litigation.report and recommendation at.the district court adopted these findings when it adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation as the opinion of the court.dist.order at.
the parties disagree as to the primary rationale underlying the district court determination that yum has not satisfied its burden of demonstrating subjective anticipation of litigation.the irs argues that the magistrate judge report and recommendation and the district court opinion rest on yum simple failure to fulfill its burden of coming forth with evidence that the documents were created in anticipation of litigation.yum,on the other hand,stresses that the magistrate judge improperly determined that the memoranda could not be privileged if created in part to assist in an audit,and argues that the district court adoption of this conclusion constitutes an error of law.we need not determine which of these two rationales of the magistrate judge report and recommendation forms the primary basis of the district court conclusion that yum memoranda are not privileged,because we conclude that the district court adoption of either of these grounds constitutes an abuse of discretion.
the magistrate judge concluded that yum failed to provide adequate proof that the two documents were prepared because of the prospect of litigation,and surmised that the more likely use of the documents was to buttress yum federal income tax return to the irs should the irs assess penalties for a substantial understatement,and that the documents were therefore created irrespective of the potential for litigation.report and recommendation at.in reaching this conclusion,the magistrate judge placed particular emphasis on the dubious time sequence of the transaction closing prior to yum obtaining the memoranda,and the coinciding of the memoranda completion with the march deadline for corporate tax filings.report and recommendation at.the magistrate judge also inferred from the record that preston,the individual who had requested the report,was the company tax lawyer,not an or law firm litigation counsel.id.the magistrate judge concluded that yum ha d not provided proof to contravene the obvious inference that the opinions were provided in connection with kpmg regular responsibilities in the preparation of the corporate tax return due immediately after the opinions were rendered.id.
after the district court granted yum motion to expand the record,yum introduced affidavits clarifying that yum did not file its taxes on march but rather received a extension every year,roxworthy aff,preston aff,that the march tax deadline was of no significance to yum,that preston duties were those of a general counsel and not primarily those of a tax attorney,preston aff,that roxworthy and other members of the tax department prepare yum tax returns,roxworthy aff,that kpmg has never played any part in yum tax return preparation,roxworthy aff,that this was the first and only time that anyone in yum legal department sought a written opinion from kpmg on a federal tax issue,preston aff,and that the memoranda at issue were not prepared to assist in the preparation of tax returns,preston aff,roxworthy aff.
the additional affidavits also provided further details explaining why,exactly,yum anticipated litigation.specifically,preston stated that engel advised him that the tax treatment of captive insurance companies,including the treatment of premium payments to captive insurance companies,was very unsettled and had been the subject of considerable litigation between the internal revenue service and other large corporate taxpayers like yum.preston aff.he also stated that he expected litigation concerning a million loss recognized by yum in connection with the transaction,because the loss was recognized for tax purposes but not book purposes and because he was informed that the irs had a history of attacking transactions and litigating cases where a loss was only recognized for tax purposes.preston aff.while the original record may have left doubts regarding whether yum subjectively believed litigation was likely,and whether yum commissioned the kpmg memoranda because of that belief or merely to assist with a business purpose,the affidavits introduced to expand the record clarify these questions.
we have stated that a party may satisfy its burden of showing anticipation of litigation in any of the traditional ways in which proof is produced in pretrial proceedings such as affidavits made on personal knowledge,depositions,or answers to interrogatories,and that the showing can be
