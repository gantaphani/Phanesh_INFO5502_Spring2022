in this case,we examine whether federal labor law preempts the city of pittsburgh decision to condition a grant of tax increment financing upon the recipient acceptance of a labor neutrality agreement.we must address how labor law preemption analysis applies when local government seeks to affect labor relations on a publicly financed development project.for the reasons stated below,we hold that the city is not preempted from requiring parties receiving tax increment financing to sign a labor neutrality agreement.
in early,sage hospitality resources,llc sage began development of a hotel construction project in pittsburgh,pennsylvania the city.as part of its financing strategy,sage approached the urban redevelopment authority of pittsburgh ura for tax increment financing tif to support the construction of the hotel.
authorized under pennsylvania tax increment financing act.et,tifs were created to provide an alternative method for use by authorities in pursuing redevelopment efforts under the urban redevelopment law,id.et.id.a.in a traditional tif scheme,a locality issues tax increment bonds to finance the redevelopment of a chosen district.these bonds are secured by tax revenues generated from the expected increase in property,the tax the district.see generally frank london,note,the use of tax increment financing to attract private investment and generate redevelopment in virginia.tax.that is,tif pledges future increases in tax revenues generated by a project to finance certain eligible costs for the project 
the ura approved the creation of the fulton building tif district and issued the tif bonds.sage was apportioned million in tif support for the hotel development project.the plan provided that some sixty percent of revenues from the tax increment would go toward the repayment of the tif notes.the remaining forty percent of the revenue from the tax increment would be provided to the three taxing bodies,the city,the school district,and allegheny county.
on february,following the approval of the tif funds,the city passed resolution,which required sage,inter alia,to enter into a certified labor agreement with a bonified sic labor organization recognized by the national labor relations board.app.emphasis omitted.approximately five months later,on july,the city passed ordinance to supplement chapter under title one,article vii of the pittsburgh code the ordinance added section,requiring contractors and employers of employees hired to staff hospitality operations to be signatory to collective bargaining agreements where the city of pittsburgh has a financial or proprietary interest.app.emphasis omitted.
this section provides,in pertinent part 
each and every contractor and employer of employees hired to staff hospitality operations shall be or become signatory to valid collective bargaining agreements or other contracts under section with any labor organization seeking to represent hospitality workers employed in the contractor employer hospitality operations in a capital project as a condition precedent to its contract with the city of pittsburgh.each collective bargaining agreement or contract must contain a provision prohibiting the labor organization and its members,and in the case of a collective bargaining agreement,all employees covered by the agreement,from engaging from any picketing,work stoppages,boycotts or any other economic interference with the hospitality operations of contractor or any persons under contract to it for the duration of the time required for the repayment of public indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition or development of such capital project,or for the duration of contractor contract or contracts with the city for the operation of such capital project,whichever period of time is more extensive the pledge.each agreement must provide that during this time period,all disputes relating to employment conditions or the negotiation thereof shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration.each and every contractor and employer of employees hired to staff hospitality operations shall require that any work under its contract or contracts with the city to be done by the contractor or employer contractors,subcontractors,tenants or subtenants shall be done under collective bargaining agreements or other contracts under section containing the same provisions as specified above.
by february,construction of the hotel had been completed,but sage had not yet entered into a labor agreement with any labor union.on february,the city passed a resolution dissolving the fulton building tif district and withdrawing the issuance of the million tif funds because sage had not entered into a labor agreement under resolution and ordinance.
one week after the passage of the resolution,sage signed a labor and neutrality agreement the neutrality agreement or the agreement with the hotel employees and restaurant employees union local,here.the neutrality agreement contained,inter alia,a promise and a provision that union representation would be determined using a procedure.the agreement provided that disputes arising under it would be settled by arbitration.following the agreement,the mayor vetoed the city council february repeal of the fulton building tif district,and sage received funding.
following the opening of the hotel on march,here asked that sage hold a card count to obtain recognition of its union pursuant to the terms of the neutrality agreement.on june,the city concluded that a majority of employees at the hotel has not designated the hotel employees,restaurant employees union,local as their sic exclusive collective bargaining representative.app.citing the neutrality agreement,here sought to arbitrate the outcome of the card count and requested a second card count in june of,but sage refused to comply with the request,claiming that the neutrality agreement was void.
on september,here filed a complaint in the district court seeking to compel sage to arbitrate issues arising pursuant to the neutrality agreement.sage defended by arguing that the neutrality agreement was illegal and void ab initio.
in may,both parties filed motions for summary judgment.in a memorandum issued on september,the district court rendered a decision in favor of here and directed the parties to submit their dispute to arbitration pursuant to the neutrality agreement.the district court held that both parties were within their rights to reach a private agreement to provide an alternative method of deciding union representation and that such chosen method,card check procedures,was not illegal under federal law the agreement provisions for card check procedures did not constitute payment of things of value prohibited by section of the labor management relations act lmra,and economic duress could not be used as a reason to invalidate the agreement.the district court ordered the parties to submit their dispute to arbitration pursuant to the agreement.
we are presented with a final order of a district court to review.accordingly,we have appellate jurisdiction.our review of a district court grant of summary judgment is plenary.see fed.home loan mortgage scottsdale ins,cir.we assess the record using the same summary judgment standard that guides district courts.see farrell planters lifesavers,cir.to prevail on a motion for summary judgment,the moving party must demonstrate that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
in this appeal,sage claims that the agreement here seeks to enforce is void ab initio,or voidable at its option,as having been secured in violation of federal law,specifically the national labor relations act nlra,et the terms of the agreement require sage to provide things of value to here in violation of section of the lmra and the agreement is void ab initio because pennsylvania home rule charter statute.f,prohibited the city from imposing the requirements set out in its ordinances and resolutions.
sage first argument is that the neutrality agreement signed with here is unenforceable,as a matter of law,because it intrudes into a field governed by federal labor law.specifically,sage argues that ordinance is preempted by section of the nlra.
the district court declined to address the federal preemption question,holding that b ecause the legality of the city actions is not dispositive in this case and because the city is not,itself,a party to this action,we need not decide this issue.hotel employees rest.employees union,local sage hospitality,d.instead,the district court examined the validity of the neutrality agreement on its face and rejected sage argument that the agreement should be rendered void because sage entered into the agreement under economic duress.id.at.
although the city is not actually party to the neutrality agreement,the issue of federal preemption can not be so easily bypassed.if,for example,private parties entered into a neutrality agreement because a city mandated it as a matter of law or regulation,there is no doubt that the question of federal preemption would be presented.see golden state transit city of los angeles,d preemption bars city from coercing party to enter into labor agreement.the fact that the government is not party labor agreement would not insulate the government actions from preemption scrutiny.
by the same token,preemption issues are implicated where,as here,the impetus for a agreement is that the city demands it as a condition of public financing.while such an arrangement may turn out to escape or survive preemption analysis on the merits,we may not simply assume the question away by limiting our focus to the four corners of the neutrality agreement.see,hotel employees rest.employees union,local marriott,wl.thus,we begin our examination of whether the neutrality agreement is valid by looking to the city ordinance.if the city efforts to promote the agreement are preempted by federal labor law,then the executed agreement between the parties may be deemed void.
it is by now a commonplace that in passing the nlra congress largely displaced state regulation of industrial relations.dep t of industry,labor human relations gould,d.section of the nlra protects,inter alia,the right of employees to,to form,join,or assist labor organizations,and to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing.section of the nlra enumerates unfair labor practices,including interference with an employee exercise of rights guaranteed under section domination or interference with the formation or administration of a labor organization discrimination in hiring or employment to encourage or discourage membership in a labor organization the refusal to bargain collectively forcing or requiring an employer to join a labor organization forcing an employer to bargain with a particular labor organization as the collective bargaining agent of its employees if another labor organization has been certified as the representative of such employees and forcing or requiring a person to stop using,selling,or dealing in the products of any employer,producer,or manufacturer.see.
though the nlra contains no express preemption provision,we will find a state or local rule to be preempted by implication if it conflicts with federal law or would frustrate the federal scheme,or if we discern from the totality of the circumstances that congress sought to occupy the field to the exclusion of the states.lueck,d quotation marks omitted.
the supreme court has carved out two distinct doctrines around the nlra.the first,garmon preemption,forbids state and local regulation of activities that are protected by of the nlra,or constitute an unfair labor practice under.san diego.trades council garmon,d when an activity is arguably subject to or of the act,the states as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the national labor relations board see also gould,at.the state law may be a law of general application or a law directed specifically toward labor relations.garmon,at.garmon preemption prohibits regulation even of activit ies that the nlra protects,prohibits,or arguably protects or prohibits.gould,at.
this rule of is designed to prevent conflict between,on the one hand,state and local regulation and,on the other,congress integrated scheme of regulation embodied in and of the nlra,which includes the choice of the nlrb,rather than state or federal courts,as the appropriate body to implement the act.

the second preemption principle,set out in lodge,international association of machinists aerospace workers wisconsin employment relations commission,precludes state and municipal regulation concerning those aspects of relations that congress intended to be controlled by the free play of economic forces,d quotation marks omitted.this form of preemption recognizes congress desire to balance the power between employers and workers.id.at.under this rule,states are prohibited from imposing additional restrictions on economic weapons of,such as strikes or lockouts,unless such restrictions were presumably contemplated by congress.see id.at.
the garmon and machinists preemption doctrines grew in the context of state laws that regulated the relationship between employers and labor.but what happens when the state acts not as a regulator,but as a market participant that deals as an employer or developer with its own labor force 
in boston harbor,the supreme court faced a massachusetts water resources authority mwra requirement that all contractors working on the boston harbor cleanup project must sign a prehire collective bargaining agreement that recognized a specific union and compelled all employees to become union members.boston harbor,at.although the requirement impinged upon collective bargaining that is normally governed by the nlra,the court ruled that mwra actions were not preempted by the federal labor statute.the court reasoned that the mwra was acting in its capacity as a proprietor,market participant,and not as a regulator.id.at.in that sense,the agency was on the same footing as any private employer dealing with its own subcontractors and their labor force.
there is no reason to expect these defining features of the construction industry to depend upon the public or private nature of the entity purchasing contracting services.to the extent that a private purchaser may choose a contractor based upon that contractor willingness to enter into a prehire agreement,a public entity as purchaser should be permitted to do the same in the absence of any express or implied indication by congress that a state may not manage its own property when it pursues its purely proprietary interests,and where analogous private conduct would be permitted,this court will not infer such a restriction.
id.at.the court sustained the mwra mandatory labor agreement because it was not an effort to regulate the conduct of others,but an attempt to ensure an efficient project that would be completed as quickly and effectively as possible at the lowest cost.id.at.
in short,after boston harbor,preemption analysis only comes into play when the state activity in question constitutes regulation.id.at.but a state will not be subject to preemption analysis when it acts as a market participant.see id.when a state owns and manages property,it must interact with private participants in the marketplace.in so doing,the state is not subject to by the nlra,because doctrines apply only to state regulation.
boston harbor raises the issue that is pivotal in this case what is the distinction between government acting as a regulator and government acting as a proprietor or market participant 
we begin by rejecting the notion that the line between regulation and proprietary action can be drawn simply by determining whether the state seeks to affect labor relationships through mandatory or prohibitive regulation on the one hand,or through the coercive effect of government spending power on the other.the mere fact that government affects labor relations by imposing conditions under its power to procure or to spend does not automatically mean that the state is acting in a proprietary capacity that is immune from preemption review.
that is the teaching of wisconsin department of industry,labor human relations gould,at.applying preemption analysis in that case,the supreme court rejected any facile distinction between regulation by mandate and regulation by conditioning public spending.the wisconsin statute provided that state procurement officers were statutorily forbidden to purchase any product known to be manufactured or sold by any person or firm included on the list of labor law violators.id.at.quotation marks omitted.notably,the prohibition was not limited to firms that violated labor laws on a particular project,or even on a number of projects.rather,it debarred contractors who had violated labor laws on projects inside or outside the state.the court rejected the claim that the statute escapes because it is an exercise of the state spending power rather than its regulatory power.id.at.observing the fact that debarment could be triggered by misconduct wholly unrelated to any transactions with the state itself,the court held that by flatly prohibiting state purchases from repeat labor law violators wisconsin simply is not functioning as a private purchaser of services for all practical purposes,wisconsin debarment scheme is tantamount to regulation.id.at.quotation marks and citation omitted.preemption analysis therefore applied,and the court held that b ecause wisconsin debarment law functions unambiguously as a supplemental sanction for violations of the nlra,it conflicts with the board comprehensive regulation of industrial relations.id.at.
accordingly,the line between state regulation that is subject to preemption and market participation that escapes preemption must be drawn more finely than by simply distinguishing between regulation through mandatory laws and regulation achieved through the spending or procurement power.in describing where to draw this line,we begin by reviewing several seminal decisions.
as we have noted,gould itself involved a provision that broadly disqualified firms with multiple past labor law violations from doing business with the state.because the predicate violations were historical,and were not limited to transactions with the state itself,the supreme court easily discerned that the statute was not related to the state proprietary interest in ongoing projects,but was simply punitive.in boston harbor,by contrast,the municipal authority bid specification on a particular project required successful contractors to enter into a prehire labor agreement on the project itself.this requirement was specifically tailored to one particular job and served to protect the municipal authority interest in labor peace on that job.at.
gould and boston harbor,therefore,reflect polar outcomes despite the fact that both involved an exercise of spending or procurement power.the pivotal difference is that in the former case the state deployed its spending authority to achieve a goal far broader than merely protecting or fostering its own investment or proprietary interest,while in the latter instance the public agency limited its spending conditions to the protection of its investment or proprietary interest.
other appellate courts that have examined the distinction also focus on the fit between the challenged state requirement and the state proprietary interest in a particular project or transaction.in chamber of commerce of the united states reich,the circuit addressed an executive order barring the federal government from contracting with employers who hire permanent replacements during a lawful strike.the executive order swept broadly,effectively forcing companies doing business with the federal government to avoid permanent replacements even if the strikers are not the employees who provide the goods or services to the government.id.at.indeed,even subsidiaries that did not do business with the government would be forced to comply with the order if an affiliated business organization sought a federal contract.as in gould,this was a procurement condition that reached far more widely than what would be necessary to protect against disruption of those contracts in which the government had a direct proprietary interest.not surprisingly,therefore,the circuit held that the executive order was a regulatory effort to set a broad policy governing the behavior of thousands of american companies and affecting millions of american workers.id.at preemption analysis therefore applied.
in building construction trades department allbaugh,however,the circuit declined to find preemption applicable to a much more specific executive order that required federal agencies and private entities to maintain neutrality regarding project labor agreements in federally funded construction contracts.even though the executive order applied to all federally funded contracts,it applied only to those contracts.the order did not speak to the behavior of contractors on other,nongovernment projects.the circuit reasoned that b ecause the executive order does not address the use of project labor agreements on projects unrelated to those in which the government has a proprietary interest,the executive order establishes no condition that can be characterized as regulatory.id.at.preemption analysis,therefore,did not apply.
more recently,the ninth circuit has also addressed the distinction.in chamber of commerce of the united states lockyer,the ninth circuit confronted a california statute forbidding employers who received a certain amount of state funds from using those funds to advocate for or against union organizing.cir.the statute applied to all employers who accepted state grants in excess of,and it imposed separate accounting requirements on any business that either received state funds or entered into a contract with the state for more than.id.at.it also contained a provision for civil penalties and made employers subject to private civil suits.id.critically,the statutory restriction did not confine itself to state financing of projects employing workers who might be unionized.it affected employers in the use of state funds they had received for any reason.analyzing the statutory language and its broad effect,the ninth circuit concluded 
the statute scope indicates a general state position,not a narrow attempt to achieve a specific goal.thus,there is no question that the statute is designed to have a broad social impact,by altering the ability of a wide range of recipients of state money to advocate about union issues 
cardinal towing auto repair,city of bedford,cir treating municipal decision to award single contract for towing as proprietary action exempt from preemption under federal motor carrier statute.
these cases confirm that whether a government condition of funding constitutes market participation that falls within the boston harbor exception to preemption review depends upon the following two step test first,does the challenged funding condition serve to advance or preserve the state proprietary interest in a project or transaction,as an investor,owner,or financier second,is the scope of the funding condition specifically tailored to the proprietary interest boston harbor,at.if a condition of procurement satisfies these two steps,then it reflects the government action as a market participant and escapes preemption review.but if the funding condition does not serve,or sweeps more broadly than,a government agency proprietary economic interest,it must submit to review under labor law preemption standards.we think this test faithfully embodies the teachings of gould and boston harbor,and is consistent with the approaches taken by our sister circuits.see lockyer,at quoting cardinal towing,at allbaugh,at 
is ordinance specifically tailored to advance or protect a proprietary financial interest of the city in the fulton building tif district project the best argument for sage challenge is as follows the city has an economic interest in the success of the fulton building tif district.but that interest is in the projected stream of increased tax revenue which the city hopes to receive if the project is successful.this kind of economic interest is governmental,not prop
