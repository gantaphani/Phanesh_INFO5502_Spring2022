background 
fpl is an electric utility company that uses a fleet of various types of specially designed vehicles to operate and maintain its power distribution system.fpl filed heavy vehicle use tax returns and paid excise taxes pursuant to a on these vehicles for the annual periods from july,to june,and from july,to june.on june,fpl sought a partial refund of those payments in the amounts of for the period ending june,and for the period ending june,asserting that it had paid the excise tax on vehicles that were not subject to the tax because they fell under the mobile machinery exception to the tax set forth in a d i this dispute involves vehicles operated by fpl,including vehicles equipped with pintle hooks these vehicles are used to elevate personnel to work on poles and power lines,to lift materials,to pull and push cable,and to dig holes and set poles.the pintle hook is used to attach a trailer to the vehicles to haul materials such as transformers,generators,and large coils of wire.the other type of vehicle in dispute is an insulator washer vehicle that is equipped with a capacity water tank and is used to clean energized utility lines.
on february,the internal revenue service irs notified fpl that it intended to disallow the claims,stating that fpl vehicles did not satisfy the requirements of part c of the regulation because the pintle hooks allowed the vehicles to haul a load other than the permanently mounted machinery or equipment without substantial modification.at.fpl appealed the proposed disallowance,and the irs formally disallowed the claim on august.
on april,fpl filed suit in the court of federal claims seeking recovery of in claimed overpayments.the government moved for summary judgment with respect to all but three of the vehicles at issue.however,the government did not rely on the irs determination that the vehicles did not satisfy the requirements of part c of the regulation.rather,it argued that the vehicles did not satisfy the requirements of part b because the addition of a pintle hook or water tank precludes a finding that the vehicles chassis have been specially designed to serve only as a mobile carriage and mount for the particular machinery or equipment involved.power light.at quoting a d i emphasis in original.
the court of federal claims agreed with the government,holding that the addition of a pintle hook or water tank precludes the application of the mobile machinery exception.id.at.the court of federal claims also rejected fpl assertion that,even if its vehicles were not encompassed by the mobile machinery exemption,it nonetheless was entitled to recover the excise taxes pursuant to international business machines united states,ibm,because the irs,in private letter rulings,had exempted from the tax other similarly situated utility companies with which fpl competes.the court distinguished ibm,holding that it did not apply because fpl,unlike the taxpayer in ibm,had never requested its own private letter ruling from the irs.power light,fed.cl.at accordingly,the court of federal claims granted summary judgment for the government with respect to the vehicles at issue.after the parties stipulated that fpl was entitled to a refund of for the remaining three vehicles,the court entered judgment on june.power light united states.june.

discussion 
we review the court of federal claims grant of summary judgment without deference.agwiak united states.
the first question is whether the court of federal claims properly held that the appellant vehicles were subject to the federal excise tax.the pertinent statute provides a tax is hereby imposed on the use of any highway motor vehicle which together with the semitrailers and trailers customarily used in connection with highway motor vehicles of the same type as such highway motor vehicle has a taxable gross weight of at least pounds a.the irs implementing regulation provides an exception for c ertain specially designed mobile machinery for nontransportation functions.a d i.on appeal,the parties contest the meaning of subsection b of the regulation,which provides 
a vehicle,or trailer or,is not a highway vehicle if b the chassis has been specially designed to serve only as a mobile carriage and mount and a power source,where applicable for the particular machinery or equipment involved,whether or not such machinery or equipment is in operation 
both parties agreed at oral argument that the irs has not rendered an interpretation of the regulation that is entitled to deference under the supreme court decision in united states cleveland indians baseball,d according substantial judicial deference to the irs reasonable longstanding interpretation of its own regulations,or our own decision in american express united states.earlier decisions of our court have addressed the tax,but not the precise question before us.see.gas united states.power light united states.thus,we must interpret the regulation without the benefit of an agency or judicial interpretation.
both parties focus on the requirement in subsection b that the chassis be specially designed to serve only as a mobile carriage and mount for the particular machinery or equipment involved.a d i b.the appellant contends that the word chassis has a meaning,relying on the society of automotive engineers sae definition,which states motor vehicle chassis means the basic operating motor vehicle including engine,frame,and other essential structural and mechanical parts,but exclusive of body and all appurtenances for the accommodation of driver,property,or passengers,appliances,or equipment related to other than control.society of automotive engineers,sae glossary of automotive terms ed.the appellant thus argues that the pintle hook and water tank are not part of the chassis because they are not part of the engine,frame,or other essential structural and mechanical parts,as is required by the sae definition,but instead are appurtenance s attached to the frame even assuming that the pintle hook and water tank are not part of the chassis,the fact remains that an attachment need not be part of the chassis,so long as the chassis is modified to accommodate the attachment.
both parties agree that the pintle hooks are bolted to the chassis.br.for appellee at reply br.for appellant at.the appellant design specifications for the vehicles at issue expressly require that t he structure of the pintle hook assembly be rigidly affixed to the vehicle frame,at.the pintle hook assemblies are bolted to a beam that is welded to,and operates as a rear of,the chassis frame rails.thus,the attachment requires a modification to the chassis,albeit a minor one,to accommodate the bolted connection the chassis so modified is not used to transport only the described machinery or equipment but also to transport materials for use with the machinery or equipment,such as trailers carrying transformers,generators,or large coils of wire.in other words,the chassis has been modified to serve also as a towing device.as such,the chassis has not been specially designed to serve only as a mobile carriage and mount for the particular machinery or equipment involved.a d i b emphasis added.
the appellant urges that,if an attachment to the chassis is sufficient to constitute a chassis modification,bolting anything to the chassis that is not a modification designed to transport only the designated machinery and equipment would make the exception inapplicable.we agree,but we think that is exactly the meaning of the regulation.any special modification of the chassis to enable transportation of items
