the superintendent of insurance for the state of new york,in his capacity as liquidator of first central insurance company fcic,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york denis hurley,which affirmed a decision of the united states bankruptcy court for the eastern district of new york carla craig,granting summary judgment to first central financial corporation fcfc and fcfc chapter trustee,martin ochs the trustee.the principal issue on this appeal is whether the bankruptcy court and the district court erred in declining to impose a constructive trust on a tax refund that the trustee received from the irs and held as property of fcfc.such a trust would have kept the refund out of fcfc estate and would have required it to be paid to fcic.we hold that because a written agreement exists between fcic and fcfc covering how taxes were to be allocated,and because fcfc estate was not unjustly enriched by the trustee retention of the refund,a constructive trust is not an appropriate remedy.consequently,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
background 
fcfc is the parent corporation of fcic,a new york insurance company.in the,the two companies executed a tax allocation agreement the agreement,which prescribed how tax charges and refunds were to be apportioned between fcfc and fcic.from at least as far back as through,fcfc filed consolidated tax returns on behalf of itself,fcic,and another subsidiary collectively,the group.the agreement provided that if any tax refunds were generated,fcic was entitled to receive at least the amount that it could have claimed on its own behalf had it filed individual returns and claimed refunds on a stand alone basis.in and,fcic was the only member of the group to earn taxable income and,consequently,paid the group entire tax liability for those years.after,the group as a whole and fcic,on a stand alone basis,suffered losses.in and,fcfc applied for and received refunds of taxes paid by the group in prior years.the irs sent the refunds directly to fcfc,which then paid them to fcic pursuant to the agreement.
in january,fcic became insolvent and was placed in rehabilitation proceedings under the control of the new york state department of insurance.fcfc itself filed for bankruptcy in march.in december,fcfc chapter trustee,martin ochs,applied to the irs for a refund of the remainder of the taxes that the group had paid in and.the irs sent the trustee a refund of approximately million.instead of turning over this refund to fcic as the agreement required,and as fcfc had done in prior years,the trustee kept it,claiming that the funds belonged to fcfc bankruptcy estate.the superintendent subsequently commenced an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court seeking a declaration that,because the refund was held in trust for fcic,it was not property of fcfc estate.see d.
following for summary judgment,the bankruptcy court granted judgment to fcfc and the trustee.in re first cent.fin.the court concluded that the refund was not held in trust for two reasons.first,the agreement itself did not give rise to a trust or agency relationship because it did not require the refund to be segregated or restricted in use.id.at second,a constructive trust was not warranted under new york law because the relationship between the parties was governed by a written agreement.id.at.accordingly,to the extent that fcic was entitled to any portion of the refund,the bankruptcy court ruling effectively required it to pursue the funds as an unsecured creditor in the bankruptcy proceedings.id.at.the bankruptcy court also concluded that fcic was not entitled to the full amount of the refund under the terms of the agreement,but only to the amount it would have received if it had filed taxes on a stand alone basis.id.at.fcic appealed to the district court,which affirmed the bankruptcy court in all respects.in re first cent.fin.fcic appeals and we affirm.
discussion 
a district court affirmation of a bankruptcy court judgment is subject to plenary review.cody,county of orange in re cody,cir.here,we review conclusions of law de novo,and findings of fact under a clearly erroneous standard.id.
section a of the bankruptcy code provides that the estate created by bankruptcy proceedings includes all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property that the debtor holds as of the commencement of the case.a.section d provides that p roperty in which the debtor holds,as of the commencement of the case,only legal title and not an equitable interest becomes property of the estate only to the extent of the debtor legal title to such property,but not to the extent of any equitable interest in such property that the debtor does not hold.id.d.
the superintendent contends that the refund,which resulted from taxes that fcic alone paid and which was principally generated by fcic losses,is being held in constructive trust for fcic,and consequently is not part of the bankruptcy estate.in making the determination as to whether a constructive trust applies,new york law controls.in re howard appliance,cir.
new york law generally requires four elements for a constructive trust a confidential or fiduciary relationship a promise,express or implied a transfer of the subject res made in reliance on that promise and unjust enrichment.united states coluccio,cir see also bankers sec.life ins.soc y shakerdge,simonds simonds.the fourth element is the most important since the purpose of the constructive trust is prevention of unjust enrichment.simonds,at,see also counihan allstate ins,cir a constructive trust purpose is to prevent unjust enrichment.in re koreag,controle et revision,cir stating that unjust enrichment constitutes the key factor in determining whether a constructive trust should be imposed.
whether a party is unjustly enriched is a legal conclusion.see brand brand,cir a conclusion that one has been unjustly enriched is essentially a legal inference drawn from the circumstances surrounding the transfer of property and the relationship of the parties.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we therefore review de novo the bankruptcy court conclusion that the retention of the tax refund in fcfc estate results in no unjust enrichment.
a.the existence of a valid and enforceable contract 
a threshold question for us is whether a constructive trust is an appropriate remedy when the rights of the parties are structured by a written agreement.the bankruptcy court concluded that it was not in the absence of a tax allocation agreement,the superintendent might be correct that retention of the tax refund would unjustly enrich the bankruptcy estate of fcfc.however,fcfc and fcic did enter into the tax allocation agreement,which governs their respective rights and responsibilities.in re first cen.fin,at internal citations omitted.
the test for unjust enrichment was promulgated in miller schloss,which held that unjust enrichment would only exist where no prior agreement governed the rights of the parties a quasi or constructive contract is an obligation which the law creates,in the absence of any agreement,when and because the acts of the parties or others have placed in the possession of one person money,or its equivalent,under such circumstances that in equity and good conscience he ought not to retain it.id.at,emphasis added.for claims,this principle has become formalized into a rule that generally bars a finding of unjust enrichment in the face of a valid and enforceable written agreement.for example,in,long island,the new york court of appeals held that t he existence of a valid and enforceable written contract governing a particular subject matter ordinarily precludes recovery in quasi contract for events arising out of the same subject matter.id.at.in macdraw,cit group equip,cir,we recognized this rule as one of the principles of new york law.id.at.in in re chateaugay,cir,we applied this rule to find that a plaintiff successful assertion of its contractual right to certain funds was fatal to any quasi contractual claim.id.at 
although schloss specifically addressed quasi or constructive contracts,we conclude that this the existence of a written agreement precludes a finding of unjust applies to constructive trust claims for two reasons.first,the distinction under new york law between remedies and constructive trust remedies has disappeared and is now viewed as historical and technical in nature rather than substantive.see equity groves,a constructive trust is analogous to a obligation and indeed the subject is treated by the american law institute in a separate restatement in connection with the subject of quasi contracts rather than in connection with the restatement of the law of trusts.internal quotation marks and citations omitted schloss,at,implied or constructive contracts of this nature are similar to the constructive trusts of courts of equity.accordingly,the principles that apply to remedies also apply to constructive trusts.see scott,the law of trusts ed.the general principles with reference to unjust enrichment that are the basis of constructive trusts are also at the basis of obligations.
second,courts have subsequently extended schloss to supply the rule of decision for finding unjust enrichment in constructive trust cases.for example,in brand,we considered a request to impose a constructive trust on assets for the benefit of two brothers following the death of their father.relying on schloss,we found unjust enrichment because the appellant held title to property under such circumstances that in equity and good conscience he ought not to retain it.at quoting schloss,at.in the matter of wieczorek,relied on schloss for the proposition that t he ultimate purpose of a constructive trust is to prevent unjust enrichment and it will be imposed where a party holds property under such circumstances that in equity and good conscience he ought not to retain it.id.at.although these decisions only applied the good conscience and equity test of schloss,discussion of the requirement of the absence of an agreement was not necessary since it was not at issue in those cases.nevertheless,because the reasoning of schloss has been repeated with respect to its agreement principle and in the context of constructive trust claims,we conclude that its agreement principle applies to constructive trusts 
fcic suggests,however,that new york courts do not strongly adhere to the agreement principle.superficially,it might appear that the new york court of appeals has relaxed this principle in the matrimonial context,insofar as it has permitted constructive trusts for the benefit of first wives when husbands breached contractual obligations to maintain life insurance policies naming them as beneficiaries.for example,in simonds,a husband,as part of a separation agreement and divorce decree,promised to maintain life insurance policies naming his former wife as beneficiary.at.he subsequently violated the decree by permitting the policies to lapse.id.at.the husband remarried and purchased new policies naming his new wife and daughter as beneficiaries.id.when he died bankrupt,the first wife sued the second and obtained a constructive trust on the insurance proceeds.id.at.in a second matrimonial case,rogers rogers,the new york court of appeals,relying on simonds,again granted a former wife request for a constructive trust on the insurance proceeds received by a second wife after the husband breached a separation agreement obligating him to maintain life insurance for the benefit of his first wife.id.at.
however,simonds and rogers differ from our case in important respects.they involved willful breaches of family obligations arising from matrimonial relationships and willful breaches of separation agreements and divorce decrees.by contrast,fcfc failure to meet its obligations under the agreement essentially resulted from its insolvency.the trustee held on to the refund because of his understanding of the obligations imposed on him by the bankruptcy code no suggestion has been made of bad faith or malfeasance of any kind on his part.
moreover,neither simonds nor rogers permitted a constructive trust between parties to the contract at issue.consequently,neither the agreement principle nor its rationale applied in those cases.it is under new york law that equity will not entertain jurisdiction where there is an adequate remedy at law.boyle kelley.with respect to constructive trusts specifically,new york courts have clarified that a s an equitable remedy,a constructive trust should not be imposed unless it is demonstrated that a legal remedy is inadequate.bertoni catucci,see also evans winston strawn,plaintiffs claim for a constructive trust was properly dismissed since plaintiffs do not claim that defendant is unable to repay plaintiffs capital contributions,and it does not otherwise appear that the legal remedy of damages will be inadequate.the connection between this principle and the agreement principle announced in schloss is obvious where a valid agreement controls the rights and obligations of the parties,an adequate remedy at law typically exists.
in simonds and rogers,constructive trusts were required because adequate legal remedies were unavailable.the first wives had no contracts with the second wives and,consequently,no contract claims against them.thus,the agreement principle simply played no part in those cases.see simonds,at.fcic,on the other hand,has a contractual claim directly against out of the can be pursued in the bankruptcy proceeding.we concede that fcic,like many other creditors,will not,in all probability,be made whole in the proceedings but that does not mean its remedy is legally inadequate,simply that it is imperfect.
b.the absence of fraud or other wrongful conduct 
a constructive trust is not an appropriate remedy for an additional reason.while a showing of actual fraud or wrongful conduct is not strictly required for a constructive trust,new york law is clear that a constructive trust is an equitable remedy intended to be rather than.bankers sec.life ins.soc y,at,see also george basch blue coral,cir.for example,in binenfeld binenfeld,the court affirmed the denial of the appellant counterclaim for a constructive trust on the house of his deceased mother.the court noted that i n the instant case the appellant does not allege that his deceased mother perpetrated an actual or constructive fraud upon him.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.rather,the appellant basic position was that his mother intended to convey the house to him,but failed to do so.id.after observing that new york c ourts have uniformly held that a constructive trust is a remedy rather than an one,id.quoting bankers sec.life ins.soc y,at,the court concluded although the facts may reveal a case of unrealized expectations,we may not,without more,fashion a constructive trust decedent may well have had a moral obligation to give the property to the appellant but such an obligation is not enough to set a court in motion to compel the devolution of property in a certain way.id.at,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
plotnikoff finkelstein,involved an appeal from the imposition of a constructive trust on a condominium held in the defendant name.while acknowledging that unjust enrichment does not require the performance of any wrongful act by the one enriched,the court found that the schloss standard for unjust enrichment had not been met because there was no evidence of fraud or overreaching by the defendant with respect to taking title in her name.see id.at.given that a constructive trust is rather than,the court determined that in these circumstances,the invocation of equity can not be justified.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also bazerman edwards,sperrazza kail.
the significance of this authority is clear.fcic does not allege fraud or other misconduct in connection with the trustee determination to hold on to the refund.no one disputes that the trustee conduct is fully consistent indeed,required obligation imposed by the bankruptcy code to marshal and preserve estate assets.see cent.states,areas pension fund cent,d one of the fundamental duties of a trustee is to preserve and maintain trust assets the trustee is thus expected to use reasonable di
