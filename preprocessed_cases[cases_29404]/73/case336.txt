opinion of the court 
this tax case presents two questions.first,are delay damages,received by the plaintiff in a personal injury tort action pursuant to pennsylvania rule of civil procedure,exempt from federal income taxation as damages received on account of a personal injury a.second,if delay damages are taxable,how should their amount be determined when the plaintiff has agreed to a settlement that fails to allocate the recovery between compensation for the injury and delay damages 
we hold that the personal injury exemption of a does not extend to delay damages under pennsylvania rule of civil procedure and thus the recovery of those damages by taxpayers is taxable.while we acknowledge the practical difficulty of determining delay damages when they are subsumed as an unidentified component of a comprehensive settlement agreement,we nonetheless conclude that the district court reasonably found delay damages to be an element of the settlement at issue in this case.we therefore affirm its judgment.
charles francisco and his wife cecilia collectively,the taxpayers brought an action in the court of common pleas of philadelphia county to recover damages for personal injuries francisco sustained in a automobile accident in march,a jury returned a verdict in favor of the francisco in damages and francisco for loss of consortium.delay damages in the amount of were then added to that award by the court pursuant to pennsylvania rule of civil procedure,resulting in a total judgment in favor of the taxpayers of the defendants in the personal injury action appealed to the pennsylvania superior court,which affirmed the trial court judgment in july.
while the defendants petition to the pennsylvania supreme court for allowance of appeal was pending,the parties agreed to and executed a settlement agreement and release the settlement agreement on january.the settlement agreement provided for payment to the taxpayers of in exchange for releasing the defendants from liability.it contained no admission of liability and was entered for the sole purpose of avoiding further costly litigation.taxpayers counsel later submitted an affidavit to the district court in this action explaining that neither the payment of prejudgment interest nor the tax consequences of the settlement was considered during settlement negotiations.instead,he suggested that the verdicts were considered only for the purpose of establishing the dollar exposure around which negotiations with defendants centered.no specific part of the verdicts was considered in establishing interest as a component of the settlement.after attorneys fees and costs were subtracted,the taxpayers received.
the taxpayers did not include any of the settlement as income on their tax return.the internal revenue service the irs audited the taxpayers and assessed a tax deficiency of the deficiency was calculated by first determining what component of the net settlement recovery represented delay damages.the irs assumed that of the recovery was taxable as delay damages because was the same ratio of delay damages to the total award awarded to the taxpayers in court.it then multiplied the net recovery of the taxpayers by and concluded that of the settlement was taxable as delay damages.the irs assessed a deficiency of on the in taxable income received by the taxpayers.
ii.jurisdiction 
the taxpayers paid the deficiency,with interest,and then filed a timely claim with the irs for a refund on march.see a.the irs denied their administrative claim and taxpayers brought this refund suit against the government in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.because the suit was filed within two years of the irs denial of their claim,it was timely.see a.jurisdiction in the district court was proper pursuant to a and a.
on june,the district court ruled that delay damages were taxable and granted part of the government motion for summary judgment.the court declined to address what portion of the settlement should be properly allocated to delay damages and requested further briefing on the subject.on may,the district court granted final judgment in favor of the government after concluding that the irs method of apportioning the delay damages was proper.
this court has jurisdiction over the taxpayers timely appeal of both rulings pursuant to.the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the government is entitled to plenary review by this court.see greenberg united states,cir.
iii.taxability of delay damages 
gross income is defined for purposes of the internal revenue code the code in.that section states that e xcept as otherwise provided in this subtitle,gross income means all income from whatever source derived.a.the statute provides an illustrative list of various sources of income.one example is interest.a.the supreme court has long acknowledged the comprehensiveness of defining income in this manner.the broad sweep of this language indicates the purpose of congress to use the full measure of its taxing power helvering clifford.see also commissioner glenshaw glass.the definition of gross income has been simplified,but no effect upon its present broad scope was intended.given the breadth of,it is undoubtedly true that the taxpayers recovery is gross income under this definition and they do not argue otherwise.this court has held that any accession to wealth is presumed to be gross income,unless the taxpayer can demonstrate that the accession fits into one of the specific exclusions created by other sections of the code.rickel commissioner,cir citing glenshaw glass,at.the question is how much of the taxpayers increase in wealth is specifically exempted from income by other provisions of the code.
taxpayers assert that the entire proceeds of the settlement are exempt from income under the personal injury exemption,a.in,that exception excluded from taxation the amount of any damages whether by suit or agreement and whether as lump sums or as periodic payments on account of personal injuries or sickness.id.the supreme court has noted that the effect of the broad construction of definition of gross income is that exclusions from income must be narrowly construed.united states burke,d.for that reason,courts interpreting the personal injury exception have required a showing by taxpayers.first the taxpayer must demonstrate that the underlying cause of action giving rise to the recovery is based upon tort or tort type rights and second,the taxpayer must show that the damages were received on account of personal injuries or sickness.commissioner schleier,d.
it is undisputed that taxpayers underlying jury award was for a tort or tort type rights and that those damages were received on account of personal injury.for damages to be excludable under section a,the taxpayer underlying claim must be for tortlike personal injury.kovacs commissioner,wl citing burke,at.we are presented with the more exacting questions of whether delay damages added to the underlying award by the pennsylvania court pursuant to rule are based upon tort or tort type rights and whether they were received on account of a personal injury.schleier,at.resolution of these questions requires us to examine the genesis of a.
the principle underlying a is known as the human capital rationale.as recently explained in united states,d,it has its roots in several early tax opinions of the supreme court establishing the principle that a restoration of capital was not income.see doyle mitchell.southern pac.lowe.the statute that eventually became a resulted from an extension of the restoration of capital principle to personal injuries.as an opinion of the attorney general described it,a recovery for personal injury merely take s the place of capital in human ability which was destroyed by the accident.op,cited in,at.this replenishment of human capital,in the form of damages,aim s to substitute for a victim physical or personal assets that the government does not tax and would not have taxed had the victim not lost them,at.the supreme court recently emphasized the importance of fidelity to the human capital rationale,the original moorings of a.this history and the approach it reflects suggest there is no strong reason for trying to interpret the statute language to reach beyond those damages that,making up for a loss,seek to make a victim whole,or,speaking very loosely,return the victim personal or financial capital.id.
obviously,we can not determine whether delay damages make a victim whole or return the victim personal or financial capital without understanding the purpose served by delay damages under pennsylvania law.this is not to say,however,that we are deciding an issue of state law.while pennsylvania law describes the character of the legal right to delay damages,the tax consequences of the taxpayers receipt of delay damages are governed solely by federal law,in this case the considerations underlying a see helvering stuart.lyeth hoey.a court therefore must look first to state law to ascertain the existence and nature of the interests the irs wishes to tax.while state law creates legal interests and defines their incidents,the ultimate question whether an interest thus created and defined falls within a category stated by a federal statute requires an interpretation of that statute,which is a federal question.lancaster main line,cir applying this principle to irs tax liens citations omitted.having recognized the function state law serves in informing our judgment,we proceed to discuss the nature of delay damages under pennsylvania law.
to ascertain the character of delay damages awarded pursuant to rule,we must begin with a discussion of prejudgment interest in pennsylvania common law.traditionally,prejudgment interest,also called interest eo nomine,was only available when a fixed or liquidated sum was due on a certain date.see pollice tax funding,cir.interest,as such,is recoverable only where there is a failure to pay a liquidated sum,due at a fixed day,and the debtor is in absolute default.citizens natural gas richards.in these contractual cases,prejudgment interest is a matter of right and is calculated from the time the money becomes due or payable.american enka wicaco mach,cir see also penneys pennsylvania,citing restatement first of contracts palmgreen palmer garage,frank bozzo,electric weld div.of fort pitt div.of spang.
yet pennsylvania law did not completely deny to tort victims a remedy for the passage of time.in citizens natural gas richards,the pennsylvania supreme court established that in some property tort cases,such as unintentional conversion or destruction of property,prejudgment interest may be awarded.at.the court explained 
into these cases the element of time may enter as an important factor,and the plaintiff will not be fully compensated unless he receive not only the value of his property,but receive it,as nearly as may be,as of the date of his loss.hence it is that the jury may allow additional damages in the nature of interest for the lapse of time.it is never interest as such,nor as a matter of right,but compensation for the delay,of which the rate of interest affords the fair legal measure.
id.the award of such compensation for delay in property torts is not a matter of right but is an issue for the finder of fact,the resolution of which depends upon all the circumstances of the case.marrazzo scranton nehi bottling,see also american enka,at.under either theory,interest or compensation for delay,the plaintiff was compensated at the statutory legal rate of interest of six percent from the date the cause of action accrued.see american enka,at.stat.ann.tit.
however,neither prejudgment interest nor compensation for delay was awarded for personal injuries under the common law in pennsylvania.conover bloom.where real property has been taken,injured,or destroyed,compensation for delay is an allowable element,and the same is true where the damage is inflicted upon personal property but not where the claim is for personal injuries,for then the damages are assessed as of the date of the trial,and not of the injury.id.at citations omitted see also witmer bessemer,mcgonnell pittsburgh rys,in a personal injury case the damages are assessed as of the date of the trial and not of the injury.hence there can be no general compensation for delay.pittsburgh ry.taylor,in a personal injury action,i t was also error to permit the jury to allow interest from the date of the accident to the time of trial upon the amount they might ascertain plaintiff damages to have been.thus at common law in pennsylvania a victorious plaintiff was only entitled to interest from the date of the claim accrual if that claim arose as a contractual obligation for a fixed sum due on a particular date or if the claim resulted from tortious damage to property.no party to this case has brought to our attention any actions in which prejudgment interest or compensation for delay was granted on a personal injury award prior to the enactment of rule.
pennsylvania rule of civil procedure was enacted in to provide successful plaintiffs in actions for damages for personal or property injuries with compensation for the delay preceding judgment.its primary provision states 
at the request of the plaintiff in a civil action seeking monetary relief for bodily injury,death or property damage,damages for delay shall be added to the amount of compensatory damages awarded against each defendant or additional defendant found to be liable to the plaintiff in the verdict of a jury,in the decision of the court in a nonjury trial or in the award of arbitrators,and shall become part of the verdict,decision or award.
civ.a.it goes on to award damages in an amount that shall be calculated at the rate equal to the prime rate as listed in the first edition of the wall street journal published for each calendar year for which the damages are awarded,plus one percent,not compounded.civ.a.these delay damages are only available to certain plaintiffs and for certain periods of delay.delay damages are unavailable during periods in which the plaintiff caused delay of the trial or if the defendant made a reasonable written settlement offer and the plaintiff did not recover more than percent of that offer after trial.civ.b.
because the damages awarded pursuant to rule are determined by reference to prevailing interest rates,pennsylvania courts have frequently characterized the rule as providing for prejudgment interest.in one of the first cases addressing the rule,the pennsylvania supreme court described it as follows.rule pertains to prejudgment interest granted in certain instances to plaintiffs who receive jury verdicts in excess of any settlement offer made by a defendant prior to trial.laudenberger port auth.of allegheny county.the court recognized that the rule source was pennsylvania common law heritage of allowing prejudgment interest in cases concerning liquidated damages and breach of contract cases,and to recover compensation for delay in payment after loss in tort cases.id.at.nevertheless,the court noted that rule extended those doctrines and undeniably imposes an additional duty upon defendants in the form of prejudgment interest.id.rule provides compensation to a plaintiff for delay in receiving the monetary damages owing as a result of a defendant tort.this serves to indemnify the plaintiff for the money he would have earned on his award if he had promptly received it.id.at.it is thus transparently clear that rule established a new duty for defendants to provide additional compensation to as additional damages for their to remedy the time value of their award lost during the period preceding judgment.see costa lauderdale beach hotel,
having concluded that rule permits the awarding of prejudgment interest,we must recognize one caveat.as the taxpayers repeatedly assert,delay damages are not available to all successful tort plaintiffs as a matter of right,but can only be awarded either when the defendant did not make a reasonable settlement offer or for periods of time for which the plaintiff is not responsible for causing delay.see schrock albert einstein med.delay damages thus serve a secondary purpose to hasten the settlement and conduct of tort actions.see laudenberger,at.delay damages are incentive to settle and to avoid delay of trial because the defendant may limit the size of the compensation award by settling the case or by choosing not to engage in dilatory pretrial tactics.costa,at.in this context,rule serves two related purposes.undeniably,rule serves to compensate the plaintiff for the inability to utilize funds rightfully due him,but the basic aim of the rule is to alleviate delay in the disposition of cases,thereby lessening congestion in the courts.laudenberger,at.to accomplish that aim,the pennsylvania courts do not apply rule without regard for the defendant fault in hampering early settlement and adjudication 
in making a decision on a plaintiff entitlement to delay damages,the mere length of time between the starting date and the verdict is not to be the sole criterion.the fact finder shall consider the parties respective responsibilities in requesting continuances the parties compliance with rules of discovery the respective responsibilities for delay necessitated by the joinder of additional parties and other pertinent factors.
craig magee memorial rehabilitation.the pennsylvania supreme court has described these considerations as procedural fault.costa,at.the considerations that the craig court listed as relevant to fault are all factors relevant to the delay of trial.id.rule thus exists as a hybrid prejudgment interest statute,attempting to make whole the tort victim who has been denied use of his or her money rightfully due when the cause of action accrued,but conditioning the grant of that remedy on the parties relative procedural fault in delaying adjudication of the underlying tort.
three other courts of appeals have addressed whether prejudgment interest on a personal injury award is entitled to exemption from taxation pursuant to a because it is received on account of personal injury.see rozpad commissioner,cir discussing laws brabson united states,cir.discussing,cert.denied,d kovacs commissioner,wl discussing.comp.laws,aff without opinion,cir,cert.denied,d.all have found that prejudgment interest is taxable.
in kovacs,the first of the prejudgment interest cases,the tax court parsed the traditional distinction between damages and interest and noted that damages are the principal sum on which the interest is owed,and ordinary usage suggests the two are separate.kovacs,at.the court went on to cite extensively from the long tradition of taxing postjudgment interest without regard to the fact that it was earned on a personal injury award.see see also aames commissioner,wl the nature of interest is that it is paid because of delay in the receipt of funds,in this case the principal amount awarded to plaintiff and designated damages by the massachusetts supreme judicial court.as interest,it is taxable to petitioner.riddle commissioner,the rule that we draw from the above cases is that interest is properly allowable as income upon a judgment or award of damages for personal injuries when the amount of the damages has been ascertained and reduced to judgment.lacking any indication in michigan law that prejudgment interest should be considered differently from interest generally,the court concluded that prejudgment interest was not exempted from income simply because it was earned on a personal injury award and the sixth circuit affirmed.kovacs,at.
the tenth circuit in brabson was critical of the kovacs opinion overt reliance on the labels damages and interest in determining the taxability of prejudgment interest.brabson,at.brabson rejection of kovacs was due,in part,to the fact that the colorado supreme court had characterized prejudgment interest as a component of damages,thus blurring meaningful distinction between the two concepts.see allstate ins.starke,prejudgment interest is an element of compensatory damages in actions for personal injuries,awarded to compensate the plaintiff for the time value of the award eventually obtained against the tortfeasor.nonetheless,the court in brabson found prejudgment interest to be taxable for two reasons.
first,it noted that p rejudgment interest was rarely available under the common law,and never for personal injuries.brabson,at.because the common law in colorado had never provided for prejudgment interest on personal injuries until the amendment of.to that effect in,the tenth circuit concluded that congress could not have intended prejudgment interest to be included among those damages exempt from taxation in the predecessor provisions to today a.id.this conclusion was,for it is beyond cavil that congress in the early twentieth century was cognizant of the common law prohibition on the award of prejudgment interest in personal injury actions.see monessen ry.morgan,d discussing whether congress provided for prejudgment interest in the federal employers liability act of fela and noting that congress was aware that the common law did not allow prejudgment interest in suits for personal injury or wrongful death this was the rule in the federal courts.the brabson court thus discounted the characterizations of the colorado supreme court that prejudgment interest was an element of compensatory damages.it instead recognized congress provided no indication that prejudgment interest should be exempted from taxation as received on account of a personal injury.brabson,at.while the colorado statute may contemplate a different understanding of the concept of damages,we believe it contrary to the concept of damages for personal injuries as understood in the revenue act of and maintained ever since.id.
secondly,the tenth circuit in brabson recognized that delay damages did not fit easily within the human capital rationale that underlies a.c ompensation for the lost time value of money is caused by the delay in attaining judgment.time becomes the relevant factor,not the injury longer the procedural delay,the higher the amount.brabson,at.the brabson court noted that the quantity of prejudgment interest turns not on the personal injury itself,but instead on the time value of money.it concluded that the time value of money is not received on account of a injury and therefore can not satisfy the second showing required by schleier,at.in short,though prejudgment interest is related to the injury,both in terms of existence and computation,the award of prejudgment interest is not linked to the injury in the same direct way as traditional tort remedies.brabson,at.
lastly,the first circuit in rozpad,at,neatly synthesized the kovacs and brabson decisions.the court agreed with the conclusion in kovacs that there is no distinction between prejudgment and postjudgment interest.
it is true that many of the cases discussed in kovacs deal with the petitioners fail to persuade us that this distinction makes a meaningful difference.interest,whether pre or,compensates for delay in payment,and is specifically included in the litany of income items subject to taxation under section.
rozpad,at.the first circuit also credited brabson application of the second requisite showing under the damages were received on account of personal injuries or sickness.schleier,at.applying the test of schleier,rozpad concluded,much like brabson,that prejudgment interest is not damages received on account of a personal injury,and is,therefore,taxable.rozpad,at.the court thought it important that,under rhode island law,interest is separate and distinct from damages,and is awarded mainly to compensate for a delay in payment.id.this delay in payment is not caused by the personal injury,but rather the injury causes damages,thus creating the fund on which interest for delay in payment is owed.id.the first circuit then reiterated brabson conclusion that congress could not have intended that prejudgment interest be included in the predecessor to a,because prejudgment interest was unavailable at the common law in personal injury torts.id.at.
we discern no meaningful distinction between delay damages received pursuant to rule and the prejudgment interest statutes in cases such as kovacs,brabson and rozpad the common law in pennsylvania is no different from that in colorado or rhode island with respect to prejudgment interest.personal injury plaintiffs in neither of these states were entitled to prejudgment interest as a component of their remedy at the common law.see conover,at pennsylvania brabson,at colorado rozpad,at rhode island.prejudgment interest in personal injury cases 
was in when congress enacted the direct lineal ancestor of section a,section b of the revenue act of,ch,stat.since the exclusion for personal injury awards has been handed down almost verbatim from forward,congress could not conceivably have intended the exclusion to apply to prejudgment interest.
rozpad,at.as noted above,the supreme court used similar reasoning in concluding that fela,enacted in,did not provide for the award of prejudgment interest because the common law did not allow for it and it was unpersuaded that congress intended to abrogate that doctrine sub silentio.monessen,at.concluding that pennsylvania courts may not award prejudgment interest pursuant to rule in fela actions.we must similarly conclude that congress did not intend a to exempt prejudgment interest when no pennsylvania plaintiff recovering for personal injury would have been awarded such interest at common law.
the taxpayers attempts to argue otherwise are unpersuasive.they would have us draw a distinction between interest,awarded as of right for the failure to pay a liquidated sum on a fixed day,and compensation for delay,which was sometimes available in property torts such as unintentional conversion or destruction of property.citizens natural gas,at.from this distinction,the taxpayers argue that while interest was not awarded in personal injury cases at the common law,compensation for the delay was awarded when the circumstances demanded,and thus it is proper to assume that the award of compensation for the delay should be exempted from taxation.this argument is unpersuasive for two reasons.one,this court has previously noted that the distinction between interest and compensation for the delay is minimal a charming legal fiction,in the true ancient roman ficto,fictiones,sense.american enka,at.two,even acknowledging the distinction between interest and compensation for the delay,neither of these theories of recovery would have entitled the taxpayers in this case to the recovery of prejudgment interest prior to the enactment of rule because neither extended to personal injuries.see conover,at witmer,at mcgonnell,at pittsburgh ry.at.thus,irrespective of any distinction between interest and compensation for delay,the common law history in pennsylvania is no different than that announced in brabson 
prejudgment interest was rarely available under the common law,and never for personal injuries the requirement of a liquidated sum,fixed and known,posed the greatest obstacle towards recovery of such interest.
thus prejudgment interest,when awarded at all,generally compensated for pecuniary harms,most often easily determinable contractual ones.it is only more recently,pursuant to certain statutes,that prejudgment interest has become recoverable in personal injury suits on nonpecuniary harms.
brabson,at.lacking any basis in common law for the award of prejudgment interest,in any form,for cases such as the taxpayers,it can not be said that congress,in enacting a and its predecessors,intended the exclusion of prejudgment interest,such as rule delay damages,from income.
in contrast,it is well established that the exclusion for personal injury was intended to exempt from income damages that substitute for any normally untaxed personal or financial quality,good,or asset,at.the supreme court recognized in that the rationale is founded on,that is,establishing that an injured person is no better or worse off,from a tax perspective,as a similar person who had not been injured.id.holding that punitive damages are not received on account of a personal injury see also glenshaw glass,at.damages for personal injury are by definition compensatory only.while the court in recognized that a does not accomplish this purpose perfectly because it excludes from taxation both the traditionally untaxed damages that aim to substitute for a victim physical or personal and the traditionally taxed damages that substitute for lost wages,nevertheless the court emphasized that the human capital rationale was the original mooring of a,at.that original mooring dictates that there is no strong reason for trying to interpret the statute language to reach beyond those damages that,making up for a loss,seek to make a victim whole,or speaking very loosely,return the victim personal or financial capital.id.
while taxpayers repeatedly assert that delay damages are intended to make a victim whole,see costa,at the essence of this duty was merely to extend the compensatory damages necessary to make a plaintiff whole,we must recognize that the purpose they serve is more specific than that simple generalization.as stated in laudenberger,the essence of rule is to provide compensation to a plaintiff for delay in receiving the monetary damages owing as a result of a defendant tort.this serves to indemnify the plaintiff for the money he would have earned on his award if he had promptly received it.at.it can not be rationally contended that the money he would have earned on his award is anything but interest.interest is the compensation fixed by agreement or allowed by law for the use or detention of money black law dictionary ed.
as noted in kovacs,since the case of riddle commissioner,interest received after judgment is taxable.see kovacs,at.since riddle,the exclusion for personal injury damages has been reenacted and amended numerous times.nevertheless,the statute continues to exclude only damages and omits any mention of interest.this implies a continuing acceptance by congress of the existing interpretation of the exclusion.id.at.
we are unable to divine a meaningful distinction between postjudgment interest and delay damages.both compensate the plaintiff for the delay in payment of the jury damage award.see rozpad,at.unless the intervention of the judgment somehow changes the nature of that additional compensation,delay damages or prejudgment interest should be taxable in the same way as postjudgment interest.see a.
taxpayers distinguish rule delay damages from interest generally because they are not awarded in every case as a matter of right,but instead only when the defendant caused delay or failed to make a reasonable settlement offer.see laudenberger,at t his rule serves to compensate the plaintiff for the inability to utilize finds rightfully due him.their argument posits that the harm caused to the plaintiffs by delay in receiving compensation for their injury is a separate wrong that pennsylvania has chosen to compensate with damages.they argue that pennsylvania courts have established that rule protects the personal right of the plaintiff to have his day in court and not to suffer the increment to the indignity,pain,embarrassment and humiliation of his bodily injuries caused by the delay in receiving just compensation for those injuries taxpayers opening br.at.the defendant liability for this compensation is described as a procedural fault.costa,at.
we find this argument unavailing because the taxpayers can not establish that a remedy for the harm incurred in this respect is based on tort or rights see schleier,at.there is no doubt that the taxpayers suffered some difficulties and harms resulting from the delay of more than ten years in receiving recompense for the automobile accident,but t he fact that an action causes harm to individuals does not automatically imply,however,that there exists a personal injury for purposes of federal income tax law.united states burke,d.instead,the supreme court in burke emphasized the consideration of traditional tort principles in evaluating the a exemption and stated that one of the hallmarks of traditional tort liability is the availability of a broad range of damages to compensate the plaintiff fairly for injuries caused by the violation of his legal rights.id.at.citation omitted.rule delay damages do not fit within this injury compensation rubric.instead,they only compensate for the additional economic opposed to the injury by the deprivation over a period of time of the underlying remedy.see laudenberger,at.
recognizing that the narrow remedial scheme of rule is persuasive evidence that delay damages are not based in tort or rights,taxpayers argue that delay damages should be analogized to liquidated damages that serve a compensatory function.the supreme court noted in schleier,while discussing the taxability of the liquidated damages permitted by the age discrimination in employment act of adea,that if congress had intended the adea liquidated damages to compensate plaintiffs for personal injuries,those damages might well come within a exclusion.schleier,at.from this taxpayers argue that rule is a liquidated damages scheme,intended to compensate plaintiffs for personal injuries,and that such damages are therefore exempt from taxation under a.we reject this argument,however,for the same reason that the supreme court rejected the argument in delay damages nor liquidated damages in the adea compensate for a personal,as opposed to economic,harm.the court noted in both schleier and burke that compensation exempt from taxation under a must be for traditional harms associated with personal injury,such as pain and suffering,emotional distress,harm to reputation,or other consequential damages.burke,at.schleier,at.citing burke.while we recognize that the deprivation of a monetary remedy for an underlying personal injury may,of itself,cause additional emotional distress and other damages,rule provides only for compensation for the economic harm caused by the defendant refusal to settle reasonably and expediently a meritorious claim and not for the potential harm on which taxpayers assert we should exempt all delay damages.because compensation for economic harm in the form of interest is usually taxable and thus is not a substitute for any normally untaxed personal or financial quality,good,or asset,we see no reason why either the statutory text of a or its rationale would support exempting delay damages from income,at.
nor is our conclusion that delay damages are not included within the scope of a swayed by the taxpayers argument that the amendments to that statute alter our analysis.in,congress passed the small business job protection act,which expressly made punitive damages taxable and limited the exemption to physical personal injuries and physical sickness.see stat,august.because the taxpayers settlement was agreed upon before the effective date of the amendment,it is undisputed that the additions to a do not apply to this case.nonetheless,the taxpayers argue that language from the house report on the amendments to a,when read in conjunction with the supreme court decision in schleier,demonstrates a congressional intent that courts construe the personal injury exemption broadly to include delay damages.
the passage on which taxpayers rely states in its relevant portion that i f an action has its origin in a physical injury or physical sickness,then all damages other than punitive damages that flow therefrom are treated as payments received on account of physical injury or physical sickness.at emphasis added.we ignore for the moment that the amendments are inapplicable to the taxpayers action.their argument is that the use of all damages that flow therefrom indicates a congressional intent to expand a to include delay damages.
this is unpersuasive for two reasons.one,the house report on which the taxpayers rely does not mention interest at all,but instead was intended to emphasize that damages for emotional distress,defamation,discrimination and other torts do not result in recoveries under a.id.thus,the legislative history is not clearly in support of the taxpayers suggested interpretation of the statute.two,the supreme court opinion in forecloses the possibility that all damages that flow from a personal injury are exempt from taxation.at.in,decided in but interpreting the same version of a with which we are concerned,the court held that the on account of language of the statute can not be interpreted to require only a connection between the underlying personal injury and the award at issue.id.it cautioned that such a broad scope would thereby bring virtually all personal injury lawsuit damages within the scope of the provision,since but for the personal injury,there would be no lawsuit,and but for the lawsuit,there would be no damages.id.thus,the court rejected a formulation of on account of that is substantially identical to the language used in the house all damages that flow therefrom should be exempt.even if we were to assume that this lone statement from the legislative history of the amendment applied to prior versions of the statute,the supreme court has rejected such an expansive interpretation of a.
having considered both the language of a and its rationale,we are not persuaded that rule delay damages can be meaningfully distinguished from prejudgment interest in general simply because they are only available when the defendant has delayed the trial or not made an adequate settlement offer.for this reason,we affirm the district court ruling that the taxpayers recovery of delay damages should have been taxed.
iv.allocating delay damages in settlement 
having concluded that delay damages received pursuant to pennsylvania rule of civil procedure are not exempt from taxation as damages received on account of personal injury,we proceed to whether the district court allocated the proper measure of delay damages from the total recovery received in settlement.the irs suggested,and the district court found,that of the million received in settlement was properly allocated to delay damages because that was the same proportion of the trial court total award apportioned to delay damages.after reducing the taxable income to the amount actually received by the taxpayers after payment of attorneys fees and costs the irs proposed to tax of the net settlement received by the taxpayers.using this formula,the irs determined that was taxable income.
before proceeding to the taxpayers assignments of error on this point,we note that the taxpayer bears the ultimate burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the irs assessment is erroneous.sullivan united states,cir.because irs tax assessments are presumed to be correct,i t is not enough for the taxpayers to demonstrate that the assessment of the tax for which refund is sought was erroneous in some respects.united states janis,d.instead,the taxpayer bears the burden of proving the amount he is entitled to recover.see also freck internal revenue,cir irs tax assessments are generally presumed to be correct.
the taxpayers burden in this respect is made more difficult by the reasonableness of the irs allocation.it is a tenet of federal tax law that income received in settlement of a claim should be taxed in the same manner as if it had been received on that claim in court.see lyeth hoey.we think that the distinction sought to be made between acquisition through such a judgment and acquisition by a compromise agreement in lieu of such a judgment is too formal to be sound,as it disregards the substance of the statutory exemption.to maintain tax equality between settlements and court awards,we determine the tax implications of a settlement by ascertaining the obligation or claim initially resolved by judgment in lieu of which the settlement was made.see alexander internal revenue,cir getty commissioner,cir raytheon prod.commissioner,cir.the test is not whether the action was one in tort or contract but rather the question to be asked is in lieu of what were the damages awarded,cert.denied.because it is the defendant who chooses to pay settlement of the plaintiff claims,several courts have held that,in the absence of a written settlement agreement parsing the claims that comprise a general settlement,it is the intent of the payor that is the most persuasive evidence of the nature of claims settled by that party to avoid litigation.see knuckles commissioner,cir agar commissioner,cir ray united states,aff,table metzger commissioner,wl,aff,cir table bent commissioner,wl,aff,cir glynn commissioner,wl,aff,table cir.if the settlement agreement lacks express language stating that the payment was or was not made on account of personal injury,then the most important fact in determining how section a is to be applied is the intent of the payor as to the purpose in making the payment.metzger,at.
the taxpayers aver that the settlement agreement in this case lacks any express language parsing the payment of the defendants between personal injury damages and delay damages.lacking any evidence of allocation in the settlement agreement,they maintain that the only evidence presented to the court was the affidavit of don foster,taxpayers counsel in the personal injury litigation,in which he asserts that no consideration was given to delay damages in the settlement negotiations and that the tax consequences of the agreement were never considered by the parties.therefore,their argument proceeds,the district court erred in refusing to credit the only evidence with which it was presented on the subject of allocation.
we are unpersuaded.because the intent of the payor is paramount in determining the nature of the settled claims,it is admittedly difficult to discern the nature of settled claims in an agreement that fails to distinguish the separate elements of recovery.yet in situations like this where there has been a judgment in a trial court that preceded settlement of the claims,the most persuasive evidence of the payor intent in settling the case is the previous damages award of that court.recognizing this logic,the first circuit has stated that 
when the interest component of a personal injury settlement can be delineated with accuracy and when there has been a jury verdict and an ensuing judgment that contains separate itemizations of damages and subsequent settlement that does not purport to make a different allocation is quite logically viewed as including a pro rata share of interest.
rozpad,at.this logic is convincing.in rozpad,two sets of plaintiffs had settled personal injury suits after successfully prosecuting their actions and receiving jury awards for personal injury damages to which prejudgment interest was added by the trial court.id.at.neither of the settlements allocated the settlement award between personal injury damages and prejudgment interest.id.the tax court rejected plaintiffs argument that,because the settlement agreement did not allocate between taxable and damages,none of the settlement award was taxable and the first circuit affirmed.id.when the parties have settled a claim for a liquidated amount it is not unfair to assume,in the absence of a contrary allocation that interest and damages compose the same proportion of the settlement as of the antecedent judgment.id.at.
the irs and district court were thus justified in assuming,under the facts of this case,that the proportion of interest to damages reflected that of the preceding judgment.as previously noted,the settlement was for million,just fractionally less than the taxpayers combined judgment awarded at trial and affirmed on appeal thus,the foster affidavit was not the district court only evidence on allocation.it was not even the best evidence.
nor was it error for the district court to have rejected foster assertions that the settlement contained no delay damages.according to the affidavit,settlement amounts were derived at solely from a consideration on behalf of the plaintiffs of the risks to which they would be subjected by refusing to settle the case while an appeal was pending.emphasis added.this statement is not probative of any fact relevant to our inquiry instead it is the payor intent the defendants in the taxpayers personal injury is relevant.on the subject of the defendants intentions,the affidavit states,discussions with defendants representatives concerned the considerable exposure to a larger verdict,in the event defendants prevailed on the their appeal and a new trial was granted,because of francisco continuing and worsening condition.this statement does not help the taxpayers argument.for even if the defendants were concerned with the possible exposure to a larger damages award on remand,that does not support the inference that the defendants sought to allocate its payments in this settlement entirely to personal injury,as opposed to some pro rata portion of both personal injury damages and delay damages.that is,the defendants concern with a later,larger judgment supports the inference that they wished to settle sooner for less money it does not support the inference that they intended only to pay personal injury compensation in the settlement indeed,if the defendants were motivated by their future exposure in the event of a possible new trial,they nonetheless had every reason to believe that any future increased judgment would include increased delay damages commensurate with the increased compensatory damages.
furthermore,even had the district court accepted the foster affidavit to establish the proposition that the settlement agreement was intended by the payor to provide no compensation for delay damages,it was within the court province to reject that evidence.the general rule is that a trial court may reject the parties allocation of claims,even when that allocation is contained within the settlement itself.see delaney commissioner,cir.in delaney,that court was presented with a postjudgment settlement literally allocating nothing to statutory prejudgment interest notwithstanding the prejudgment interest component concededly included in the superior court judgment.delaney,at.faced with a settlement agreement so markedly different in allocation from the underlying judgment,the tax court rejected the parties allocation of the settlement components and instead substituted,for tax purposes,the irs allocation of the ratio of prejudgment interest to the total award.id.at.the first circuit affirmed the tax court reallocation,holding that it supportably ruled that the taxpayers had not overcome the presumption of correctness to which the commissioner allocation is entitled,and that the allocation of of the settlement amount to statutory prejudgment interest,substantially based upon the aforementioned parallelism to the trial court award,did not constitute error.id.at.in rejecting the settlement allocation of no value to prejudgment interest,the court in delaney relied on cases that established a duty to look beyond the language subscribed to by the parties,and to determine if the presumption of correctness attending the irs allocation is overcome.id.at.these cases recognize that parties rarely have a bona fide dispute over the allocation of damages within the settlement agreement,and thus the written allocation may be driven by tax considerations and not reflect the true value of settled claims.see robinson commissioner,cir holding that the settling parties were not adversaries in determining the allocation of the settlement for tax purposes and that its allocation to taxable punitive damages,after a sizable punitive damages judgment,was not credible,cert.denied,d taggi united states,cir the tax court consistently has stressed the importance of a bona fide dispute over excludable damages.threlkeld commissioner,wl the specific allocation contained in the settlement agreement does not necessarily control in deciding whether the claim being settled arises from a personal injury,aff,cir glynn commissioner,wl rejecting the settlement agreement implication that the settled claims might have been for personal injury when the claims asserted by plaintiff were wholly contractual,aff,cir table.
it is thus well established that in cases in which the settlement agreement allocation of damages does not reflect the true nature of the underlying award,the district court has a duty to look behind the agreement of the parties to discern the true nature of the payor intent in settling claims.similarly,when a party,such as the taxpayers here,asserts that the allocation intended by the payor is different than that contained in the underlying judgment which,if adopted by the irs,enjoys a rebuttable presumption status,courts are obliged to measure the veracity of,and support for,that assertion.s
