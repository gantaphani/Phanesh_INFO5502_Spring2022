labor code section,subdivision a,requires an employer to indemnify its employees for expenses they necessarily incur in the discharge of their duties may an employer satisfy this statutory obligation by paying employees increased wages or commissions instead of separately reimbursing them for their actual expenses 
we conclude that an employer may satisfy its statutory reimbursement obligation by paying employees enhanced compensation in the form of increases in base salary or increases in commission rates,or both,provided there is a means or method to apportion the enhanced compensation to determine what amount is being paid for labor performed and what amount is reimbursement for business expenses.
as we will explain,our conclusion differs somewhat from that reached by the trial court and the court of appeal,and the differences affect the analysis of another issue presented here,whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying class certification.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeal judgment and remand the matter to that court for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.
defendant shopper,is a california corporation that prepares and distributes advertising booklets and leaflets in california,including the pennysaver and the california shopper.the company is organized geographically in three business units the northern california unit,the southern california unit,and the san diego or sutton unit.to sell advertising space in its publications,employs both outside and inside sales representatives.outside sales representatives meet customers in person at their places of business in assigned geographical territories,while inside sales representatives contact customers by telephone.outside sales representatives must drive their own automobiles to contact customers,while inside sales representatives work in their employer offices using telephone equipment.compensates both outside and inside sales representatives by commissions on advertising sales or by a combination of base salary and commissions.with few exceptions does not separately reimburse outside sales representatives for their automobile expenses.
plaintiff frank gattuso is an outside sales representative in southern california unit.plaintiff ernest sigala was an outside sales representative in the same unit until january,when his employment with terminated.they brought this action on behalf of themselves and other outside sales representatives seeking indemnification under section for expenses incurred in using their own automobiles to perform their employment duties.in response to the complaint,took the position that it satisfies its obligation under section to compensate outside sales representatives for automobile expenses by paying them higher base salaries and higher commission rates than it pays to inside sales representatives 
the trial court asked the parties to brief this issue does labor code section permit an employer to pay increased wages or commissions instead of indemnifying actual expenses necessarily incurred in the discharge of an employee duties after receiving briefing and hearing oral argument,the trial court issued an order accepting argument that section permits an employer to pay increased salaries or commissions instead of separately reimbursing the employee for actual expenses necessarily incurred in discharging employment duties.the trial court further concluded that the amount or rate of reimbursement could be determined by agreement between employer and employee or,in the absence of an agreement,could be any reasonable amount.
plaintiffs then moved the trial court to certify a plaintiff class defined as all current and former outside sales representatives who were not reimbursed for the expenses they incurred in using their own automobiles after january,to discharge their employment duties to certify themselves as the class representatives and to appoint their attorneys as class counsel.after receiving evidence in the form of declarations and depositions,the trial court denied the motion for class certification.the court took the view that plaintiffs had not shown common questions of fact and law,giving this explanation plaintiffs claim for unpaid business expenses under section turns on the determination of two issues whether each individual outside sales representative has an agreement about the manner in which he is compensated for expenses,or whether the compensation paid to each individual sales representative is reasonable to compensate for business expenses incurred.the determination of whether there was a meeting of the minds and whether reimbursement was reasonable necessarily requires an individualized inquiry as to each outside sales representative.the requirement of commonality therefore is not met,and plaintiffs claim for unpaid business expenses can not be maintained as a class action.
plaintiffs appealed from the order denying class certification,and on appeal they also challenged the earlier order interpreting section.the court of appeal affirmed,agreeing with the trial court interpretation of section and concluding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiffs motion for class certification.the court of appeal denied plaintiffs petition for rehearing,and we granted plaintiffs petition for review.
section,subdivision a,provides an employer shall indemnify his or her employee for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties,or of his or her obedience to the directions of the employer,even though unlawful,unless the employee,at the time of obeying the directions,believed them to be unlawful.subdivision c of section defines necessary expenditures or losses as including all reasonable costs 
a related provision,section,expressly prohibits waiver of the rights afforded under section.section provides any contract or agreement,express or implied,made by any employee to waive the benefits of this article or any part thereof,is null and void,and this article shall not deprive any employee or his personal representative of any right or remedy to which he is entitled under the laws of this state.

appellate decisions construing or applying section 
relatively few appellate decisions have construed or applied section,and none of those decisions has much relevance to the issue here.not relevant here,for example,are decisions concerning an employer obligation under section to pay legal expenses that an employee incurs in defending a third party action based on the employee conduct,plancarte guardsmark th,d jacobus krambo th,d devereaux latham watkins th,d grissom vons companies,th,d douglas los angeles herald examiner d.also unhelpful here are decisions concerning section application to public entity employers,in re work uniform cases th,d public entities not required to pay the cost of employee uniforms los angeles police protective league city of los angeles th,d public entities not required to pay expenses for defending criminal charges.
also of doubtful relevance are other decisions concerning nonrecurring business expenses.for example,in machinists automotive trades dist.lodge utility trailer sales d,the court of appeal held that when the custom of the trade required the employee to supply his own tools and the tools were too heavy to be transported routinely to and from the place of employment,section required the employer to reimburse the employee for the loss suffered when the employee tools where stolen from the employer premises.machinists automotive trades dist.lodge utility trailer sales,supra,at.that case disagreed with an earlier court of appeal decision earll mccoy d,that had reached the opposite conclusion in a similar situation,where the employee tools were destroyed by a fire on the employer premises.machinists automotive trades dist.lodge utility trailer sales,supra,at.

interpretive bulletin 
on january,the labor commissioner issued a revision to interpretive bulletin.as relevant here,it stated under labor code section,an employer who requires an employee to furnish own car or truck to be used in the course of employment would be obligated to reimburse the employee for the costs necessarily incurred by the employee in using the car or truck in the course of employment.the rate of reimbursement can be that agreed to by the employer and employee,or,if there is no such agreement,any reasonable amount.ibid.

on february,thomas cadell,as dlse chief counsel,wrote an advice letter to an attorney.as relevant here,it stated t he payment of a reasonable mileage reimbursement covers all reasonable operating costs incurred by the employee in the operation of the vehicle.the dlse accepts the mileage reimbursement used by the irs as reasonable.those operating costs would include damages or loss due to accident or theft unless the damage to or the loss of the vehicle due to accident or theft was the result of the negligence of the employer.in the absence of an agreement to pay a reasonable mileage reimbursement,the employer would be required to reimburse the employee for the actual costs incurred in operating the vehicle while that vehicle was being used in the service of the employer.those costs would include,of course,losses due to accident or theft while the vehicle is being used for the purposes of the employer.
july dlse update 
the dlse embodied the substance of the february,opinion letter in a bulletin update issued in july.it reads 
t he payment of a reasonable mileage reimbursement covers all reasonable operating costs incurred by the employee in the operation of a personal vehicle for business purposes.the dlse accepts the mileage reimbursement used by the irs as reasonable.those operating costs would include damages or loss due to accident or theft,unless the damage or loss was the direct result of the negligence of the employer.
in the absence of an agreement to pay a reasonable mileage reimbursement,the employer would be required to reimburse the employee for the actual costs incurred in operating the vehicle while that vehicle was being used in the service of the employer.those costs would include losses due to accident or theft while the vehicle is being used for business purposes.
opinion letter 
on august,thomas cadell,as dlse chief counsel,wrote an opinion letter to an attorney to clarify and confirm a previous telephone conversation.as relevant here,the letter stated i stated,i am sure,that the dlse has long recognized the irs rate for automobile reimbursement as a presumptively reasonable rate the policy of the dlse continues to be that the irs rate is presumptively reasonable for purposes of reimbursement of automobile expenses.
opinion letter 
on november,michael villeneuve,as dlse staff counsel,wrote an opinion letter to respond to a question asking whether labor code section requires employers to reimburse employees for automobile insurance premiums for coverage above the legal minimum.as relevant here,the letter stated 
as long as the employer reimburses the employee for the cost of the insurance and does not dictate which company supplies the insurance,the labor code does not prevent the employer you describe from requiring its employees to obtain insurance coverage beyond the legal minimum.those expenses which an employer causes an employee to incur,however,must be reimbursed,since labor code requires that the employer indemnify the employee for such loss or expenditure which is in direct consequence of the discharge of his duties.thus the question becomes whether a reasonable mileage reimbursement covers operating expenses incurred.
the application of the internal revenue service mileage allowance as a deduction from income for taxation purposes,which has been previously viewed by dlse as reasonable as a measure of expenses,is not dispositive with respect to the issue of indemnification of expenses actually incurred.the irs figure is a national average of the cost of operating a motor vehicle without respect to initial cost of purchase or lease which affects depreciation allowance,repairs and maintenance,fluctuating fuel costs,and,of course,cost of insurance,which varies widely state to state,and locality to locality.
prior enforcement of section where employers paid less than the irs mileage rate viewed such compensation as being rebuttably presumed not to comply with section.thus,if the employer could prove that the actual costs incurred by the employee were less than the irs rate,no violation of section occurs if the employee is indemnified for actual expenses incurred.conversely,payment of the irs allowance rate confers no irrebutable presumption of compliance with section.rather,the burden shifts to the employee to prove that actual expenses incurred exceeded the amount tendered by the employer.if the employee successfully demonstrates that additional insurance coverage raises the cost of operating the vehicle beyond the irs mileage figure,the employer will be obligated to cover such costs.naturally this determination must be made on a case by case basis,as insurance costs will vary depending on the domicile and use locations.
thus while the division generally finds the irs mileage rate as reimbursement to be reasonable,no overall exemption from liability under section can be given.since the irs mileage rate is based,in part,on average costs of insurance premiums as applied to drivers with average driving records,a particular driver may be able to demonstrate that higher costs were necessarily incurred in the purchase of such insurance.
letter dated september,
on september,patricia huber,as deputy labor commissioner,wrote a letter to a corporation general counsel.as relevant here,the letter stated the cost of operating a vehicle is a reimbursable expense under labor code section.if there is no specific agreement as to the mileage rate,the irs rate is considered reasonable and is used.otherwise,the employer is responsible for the actual costs incurred in operating the vehicle.
letter dated december,
on december,anne hipsham,as staff counsel for the labor commissioner,wrote a letter to this court urging depublication of the court of appeal opinion in this case.in relevant part,the letter stated 
the labor commissioner has developed an enforcement position that the internal rev en ue service irs rate of reimbursement is the acceptable level for reimbursement of mileage for an employee use of a personal vehicle the dlse reached this conclusion after many decades of enforcement in the area of reimbursement for mileage for personal vehicles required to be driven for activities,because of the difficulty in accurately determining the precise amount an employee should be reimbursed for purposes of meeting the indemnification language contained in section.
the mileage reimbursement rate is compiled by the irs by taking into account all factors involved with the use of a vehicle fuel,maintenance,repairs,depreciation,insurance,by annually conducting a national survey and coming up with appropriate averages.
the dlse enforcement position also allows for a deviation from the irs rate where appropriate.if an employer wants to pay less than this established irs rate,the employer bears the burden of proving that the employee costs of operating the vehicle for work is actually less.if the employee seeks a rate of reimbursement higher than the irs rate,the employee bears the burden of proving that his or her actual operating costs are higher.

here,the parties agree that section,which requires an employer to indemnify its employees for expenses they necessarily incur in the discharge of their duties,requires to fully reimburse its outside sales representatives for the automobile expenses they actually and necessarily incur in performing their employment tasks.they disagree only on whether section permits an employer to do so through an increase in overall compensation rather than through a separately identified reimbursement payment.
the parties agree that one method an employer may use for automobile expense reimbursement is to calculate the automobile expenses that the employee actually and necessarily incurred and then to separately pay the employee that amount.this actual expense method is the most accurate,but it is also the most burdensome for both the employer and the employee.the actual expenses of using an employee personal automobile for business purposes include fuel,maintenance,repairs,insurance,registration,and depreciation.to calculate the reimbursement amount using the actual expense method,therefore,the employee must keep detailed and accurate records of amounts spent in each of these categories.calculation of depreciation will require information about the automobile purchase price and resale value or lease costs.in addition,the employee must keep records of the information needed to apportion those expenses between business and personal use.this is generally done by separately recording the miles driven for business and personal use.the employee then must submit all of this information to the employer for calculation of the reimbursement amount due.
in calculating the reimbursement amount due under section,the employer may consider not only the actual expenses that the employee incurred,but also whether each of those expenses was necessary,which in turn depends on the reasonableness of the employee choices.see grissom vons companies,supra,th at,d under,ascertaining what was a necessary expenditure will require an inquiry into what was reasonable under the circumstances.for example,an employee choice of automobile will significantly affect the costs incurred.an employee who chooses an expensive model and replaces it frequently will incur substantially greater depreciation costs than an employee who chooses a lower priced model and replaces it less frequently.similarly,some vehicles use substantially more fuel or require more frequent or more costly maintenance and repairs than others.the choice of vehicle will also affect insurance costs.other employee choices,such as the brand and grade of gasoline or tires and the shop performing maintenance and repairs,will also affect the actual costs.thus,calculation of automobile expense reimbursement using the actual expenses method requires not only detailed record keeping by the employee and complex allocation calculations,but also the exercise of judgment by the employer,the employee,and officials charged with enforcement of section to determine whether the expenses incurred were reasonable and therefore necessary.
because of the onerous burdens that the actual expense method imposes on both employer and employee,few employers use this method to determine reimbursement for use of employees own automobiles,and both parties here agree that the actual expense method is not the only method that an employer may use to satisfy its reimbursement obligations under section.both parties agree that an employer may also use the mileage reimbursement method.
when an employer uses the mileage reimbursement method to determine the amount of reimbursement due under section for use of an employee own automobile,the employee need only keep a record of the number of miles driven to perform job duties.the employee submits that information to the employer,who then multiplies the miles driven by a predetermined amount that approximates the cost of owning and operating an automobile.as indicated in the dlse opinion letters and policy statements previously quoted,the federal internal revenue service irs has calculated an automobile mileage rate for federal income tax purposes,based on national average expenses for fuel,maintenance,repair,depreciation,and insurance,and this irs mileage rate is also widely used and accepted by private business employers for calculating reimbursable employee automobile expenses.here,both parties agree that section permits use of the irs mileage rate to calculate automobile expense reimbursement under the mileage reimbursement method.
because a mileage rate used in the mileage reimbursement method is merely an approximation of actual expenses,the mileage reimbursement method is inherently less accurate than the actual expense method.because section requires the employer to fully reimburse the employee for all expenses actually and necessarily incurred,both parties here agree that if an employer uses the mileage reimbursement method,the employee must be permitted to challenge the resulting reimbursement payment.if the employee can show that the reimbursement amount that the employer has paid is less than the actual expenses that the employee has necessarily incurred for automobile use as calculated using the actual expense method,the employer must make up the difference.
the dlse interpretive bulletin see ante,d at,at said that the mileage rate could be set by agreement of the parties,and the trial court stated that it independently reached the same conclusion.we agree that,as with other terms and conditions of employment,a mileage rate for automobile expense reimbursement may be a subject of negotiation and agreement between employer and employee.under section,however,any agreement made by the employee is null and void insofar as it waives the employee rights to full expense reimbursement under section.therefore,the existence of an agreement concerning a mileage reimbursement rate would not relieve the employer of the statutory obligation to provide complete reimbursement,nor would it preclude an employee from challenging the sufficiency of a reimbursement payment that was calculated using the agreed mileage rate.
another automobile expense reimbursement method is the use of a payment.under this method,the employee need not submit any information to the employer about miles driven or automobile expenses incurred.the employer merely pays a fixed amount for automobile expense reimbursement.the fixed amount may take various forms and have various labels,including per diem,car allowance,and gas stipend.the amount is generally based on the employer understanding of the employee job duties,including the number of miles that the employee typically or routinely must drive to perform those duties.although the parties here agree that an employer may use either the actual expense method or the mileage reimbursement method,they do not agree on whether section permits an employer to use a method to reimburse employee automobile expenses.
plaintiffs contend that section does not permit an employer to use the method for automobile expense reimbursement.they argue that compliance with section requires that an employer must correlate the employee reimbursement to the incurred expenses because c orrelation is necessary to guarantee reimbursement of employee expenses.argues,to the contrary,that section does not require employers to use a correlated reimbursement plan,that section does not restrict the methods by which the employer may calculate reimbursement,and that section requires only that whatever method is used result in full reimbursement for actual expenses necessarily incurred by the employee.
we agree with,and also with the trial court and the court of appeal,that section does not prohibit an employer use of a method to reimburse employees for automobile expenses,provided that the amount paid is sufficient to provide full reimbursement for actual expenses necessarily incurred.nothing in the language of section restricts the methods that an employer may use to calculate reimbursement,and we are required to construe section in a manner that produces a workable and reasonable result.if,for example,an employee drives exactly the same route day after day,so that the mileage driven varies little if at all from one day to the next,it would be unreasonable to require a meticulous record of actual miles driven.in that situation,an employer should be able to dispense with actual mileage reports and calculate a payment based on the employer knowledge of the distances that an employee must drive to perform the duties of the employee job.
in support of their argument that section requires a method of automobile expense reimbursement that is correlated to actual expenses incurred or miles driven,plaintiffs cite no authority apart from section itself.they argue only that correlation is necessary to allow effective enforcement of employees rights under section.
of course,an employee must be permitted to challenge the amount of a payment as being insufficient under section.an employee may do so by comparing the payment with the amount that would be payable under either the actual expense method or the mileage reimbursement method.if the comparison reveals that the lump sum is inadequate,the employer must make up the difference.as with mileage rates,an employer and an employee may agree on a particular lump sum to be paid as automobile reimbursement.but,under section,the existence of an agreement between an employer or employee regarding a reimbursement payment would not relieve the employer of the statutory obligation to pay full reimbursement,nor would it bar an employee challenge to a payment as being insufficient under section to provide full reimbursement.
as points out,an employer decision to use a method rather than a mileage reimbursement system may have income tax consequences,affecting whether the resulting payments are exempt from withholding requirements see,shotgun delivery,united states cir,and,ultimately,the extent to which they are taxable as income or instead treated as deductible business expenses.we agree with,however,that section does not require an employer to use a reimbursement method that is congruent with any tax law or has any particular tax consequence.of course,as concedes,and as the court of appeal also concluded,any tax consequences that result from the employer choice of reimbursement method should be considered in determining whether a particular payment provides the full measure of reimbursement that section requires.
having concluded that section permits an employer use of a method to reimburse an employee for automobile expenses,we next consider whether the employer must segregate the lump sum from other compensation or whether,as the trial court and the court of appeal concluded,the employer instead may pay the lump sum in the form of an increase to the employee base salary or commissions.plaintiffs argue that the reimbursement amount must be kept entirely separate from salary and commissions,for these reasons the statutory definition of wages in section excludes reimbursement payments section,which requires employers to itemize their wage payments,does not contemplate inclusion of business expense reimbursement within wage payments and allowing business expense reimbursement payments to be combined with wage payments contradicts the dlse interpretation of section.we consider these objections in turn.
plaintiffs argue first that expense reimbursements can not be wages,and reimbursement payments therefore must be separated from base salary and commissions.they rely on section,subdivision a,which states that a s used in this article w ages includes all amounts for labor performed by employees of every description,whether the amount is fixed or ascertained by the standard of time,task,piece,commission basis,or other method of calculation.italics added.plaintiffs argue that because wages are paid for labor performed whereas payments under section are reimbursement for expenses the employee has incurred,a wage payment,whether in the form of salary or commission,can not be used to discharge an employer obligation under section.
section highlights a valid and important distinction between wages as payment for labor performed and business expense reimbursement.the amount payable as wages is subject to various statutory restrictions,including minimum wage laws,which operate independently of,and in addition to,section obligation of an employer to fully reimburse an employee necessary business expenses.the amount payable as wages may also be fixed by a contract of employment,and contractual agreements regarding employee compensation may or may not include specific terms governing business expense reimbursement.because wages and expense reimbursement are conceptually distinct and subject to different statutory and sometimes also contractual constraints,an employer may not combine the payments for both in a way that would seriously hamper or effectively preclude enforcement of the various statutory and contractual obligations.
