mary robert appeals the district court adverse grant of summary judgment in her action to quash four separate irs summonses.we agree with robert that the summonses issued as a result of improper ex parte communications between the irs appeals office and examination division.see internal revenue service restructuring and reform act restructuring act of,stat.charging the commissioner of internal revenue with the duty to provide an independent appeals office and prohibit ex parte communications that appear to compromise the independence of the appeals office,setting forth guidelines for implementation of the restriction on ex parte communications.we find,however,that in this case,the ex parte communications do not prevent enforcement of the summonses.the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
robert,in her capacity as the trustee and income beneficiary of a marital trust established by her late husband,owned approximately seven million shares out of a total of twelve million outstanding shares of,in,she transferred shares from the trust to her children in exchange for promissory notes structured as debt.she secured the notes with stock and established a mechanism to execute on the stock through a stock redemption agreement between herself,and her children.robert claimed that the promissory notes were worth as much as the transferred stock and characterized the transfers as related party sales under.also,during and,she transferred shares to her children and other relatives.she characterized these additional transfers as gifts.
robert listed minority share values of and for the stock on her and gift tax returns,respectively.robert used a private appraiser to arrive at these values.although she maintains that her valuation was accurate,she concedes that,if inaccurate,any resultant increase in valuation of the transferred stock must be treated as a gift.
in,the irs began an audit of robert and gift tax returns.robert cooperated and provided financial information.the irs estate tax examiner assigned to robert case,paul latt,disagreed with robert valuation and determined that an irs appraisal was needed.irs financial analyst ernest gruenfeld conducted an appraisal and determined that the appropriate minority share prices for the and transfers were and,respectively.based on gruenfeld appraisal and the number of shares that robert transferred,latt determined that robert owed the irs a deficiency payment of approximately million regarding the transfers and regarding the transfers.latt was aware of a one million share decrease in the number of outstanding shares during but did not know what happened to those shares.latt did not incorporate this share decrease into his valuation and deficiency determination as set out in his examination report.
on march,latt sent robert a letter to propose these deficiencies.the letter was accompanied by latt examination report and gruenfeld appraisal.the march,letter was not a statutory deficiency notice.
on april,robert replied with a letter of protest in which she set forth arguments contesting the irs findings and requested an appeals conference.on may,the appeals office assigned irs appeals officer daniel mannion to handle robert appeal.mannion previously had worked on a gift tax case that involved robert deceased husband and a dispute over the value of stock.in addition,mannion was familiar with the opinions from this court and the eastern district of missouri in which we approved a method for determining the fair value of stock.see swope,d,aff in part and rev in part by cir.
mannion claims that,on august,he conducted an initial review of robert file and determined that gruenfeld appraisal was inadequate because it did not follow the methodology set forth in the swope case.shortly after this review,mannion contacted latt on an ex parte basis to tell latt that gruenfeld appraisal was inadequate.in addition,mannion sent latt a copy of robert protest with instructions to forward the protest to gruenfeld for review so that gruenfeld could revise the irs appraisal.
on september,robert attorney called mannion to request a meeting.mannion did not tell robert attorney about the august ex parte communications with latt.robert attorney stated that mannion set a meeting date for october,because mannion claimed it would take approximately three weeks to review robert file.
at the october meeting,two of robert attorneys discussed the case with mannion and provided a written critique of gruenfeld appraisal.mannion asked about the one million share decrease in outstanding stock during.robert attorneys stated that the marital trust redeemed the one million shares of stock for cash so that the trust could diversify its holdings.mannion believed this redemption potentially raised a new gift tax issue.in addition,he suggested that the irs obtain an outside appraisal to value the stock.again,mannion did not tell robert attorneys about the august ex parte communications with latt,nor did he tell them of his intention to conduct future ex parte communications with latt.mannion concluded the meeting by telling robert attorneys that he would contact them in january of to discuss resolution of the protest.
on october,after meeting with robert attorneys,mannion called latt to tell him about the new information concerning the one million share decrease and to let him know that robert attorneys had submitted a written critique of gruenfeld appraisal.on october,latt met with mannion and received a copy of the written critique.on october,mannion referred the new information regarding the one million share decrease to latt irs examination supervisor,chris mezines,and suggested that this decrease might involve the same bargain issues already under examination.
on october,latt sent a letter to robert attorneys to ask for information about the one million share decrease.latt letter referred to the fact that the appeals office requested that he gather information about the one million share transfer.in december,latt sent robert attorneys another letter to explain that the irs had retained a private appraiser and to request additional financial information.in a call,latt told robert attorneys that mannion believed gruenfeld initial appraisal was inadequate.robert attorneys challenged latt authority because the appeals office had jurisdiction over the case and mannion had last told them that he would contact them in january to resolve the case.
on january,latt called robert attorneys and left a telephone message.robert attorneys saved the recorded message and prepared a transcript of the message.in the message,latt made clear that mannion was still in charge of the case the examination division was going to be doing the leg work for mannion to collect financial data and obtain a private party appraisal and mannion had stated the in house appraisal was not going to do the job as far as the irs was concerned.
robert attorneys then arranged a january,meeting with mannion and his supervisor,chris roth,to discuss the ex parte communications between mannion,latt,and mezines.at the january meeting,mannion stated that,during the october,meeting,robert successfully refuted the valuation that gruenfeld prepared for the irs.on january,robert attorneys met again with mannion and roth.latt,mezines,and irs counsel were present for this meeting.robert attorneys suggested that,as a remedy for the ex parte communications,the irs should either assign a different appeals officer to review the record independently or issue a statutory notice of deficiency.roth stated that he would coordinate the irs response to these proposals.several days later,roth called robert attorneys and stated that instead of assigning a new appeals officer,the irs would assign a new examiner and start a new audit.
the irs assigned a new examiner,john crowe,to conduct the new audit.crowe requested the financial records necessary for a appraisal of the stock.he then issued the four summonses that are the subject of the current action.crowe directed these summonses to and its president,and treasurer.
on march,robert petitioned the district court to quash the summonses.robert argued that the summonses were issued as a direct result of the ex parte communications,to prepare the case for litigation,and as a direct result of mannion failure to review the case independently and impartially.she specifically argued that the summonses were issued in bad faith and that court enforcement of the summonses would be an abuse of the court process.robert requested discovery and an evidentiary hearing.
on june,the government responded and simultaneously filed a motion for summary judgment to seek enforcement of the summonses.the government provided affidavits from mannion,latt,mezines,and crowe.robert claims that,through these affidavits,the irs disclosed numerous previously undisclosed ex parte communications.in particular,robert and her attorneys claim that prior to receipt of the government motion and the accompanying affidavits,they knew only of the october,discussion between mannion and latt.robert claims she learned of the following allegedly improper ex parte communications only through the government affidavits the august,discussion between mannion and latt an august,discussion between latt and gruenfeld the october meeting between latt and mannion an october,discussion between latt and mezines the october,discussion between mannion and mezines and discussions on an unknown date between an examiner and personnel at the private appraisal firm that the irs hired in late.
on july,robert filed a motion under.f to strike the government motion for summary judgment or,in the alternative,for an extension of time that would allow for a period of discovery.on november,the district court denied robert motion,denied her request for discovery and an evidentiary hearing,and ordered her to respond to the government outstanding motion for summary judgment.on january,the district court granted the government motion,finding that petitioner has cited no cases for the proposition that violation of the irs internal regulation against ex parte communications by an appeals officer invalidates any summons for information.finally,the district court found that the facts suggested neither that enforcement of the summonses would be an abuse of the court process nor that the ex parte communications suggested bad faith by the irs.

iii.violation of the restriction on ex parte communications 
as an initial matter,we may dispense with the irs argument that the ex parte communications were permissible and not in violation of the restructuring act and.congress passed the restructuring act to ensure that taxpayers would have adequate protections when the agency exercised its powers in an improper fashion.national commission on restructuring the internal revenue service,report of the national commission on restructuring the internal revenue service,a vision for a new irs,at june.one method congress chose to provide these protections was to direct the commissioner of internal revenue to enhance the independence of the irs appeals office by restricting certain types of ex parte communication between the appeals office and other areas of the irs.congress mandated,among other things,that 
the commissioner of the internal revenue shall develop and implement a plan to reorganize the internal revenue service.the plan shall ensure an independent appeals function within the internal revenue service,including the prohibition in the plan of ex parte communications between appeals officers and other internal revenue service employees to the extent that such communications appear to compromise the independence of the appeals officers.
restructuring act a.
in revenue procedure,promulgated under the restructuring act,the irs set forth its own position regarding which communications appear to compromise the independence of the appeals officer.the irs distinguished between ministerial,administrative,and procedural matters,on the one hand,and substantive matters,on the other.id.as to the former,the irs does not consider ex parte communications to be prohibited under the restructuring act.the irs provided examples of communications considered to be permissible questions regarding whether certain information was requested and received questions regarding whether a document referred to in the work papers but not found in the file is available questions to clarify illegible documents questions about case controls on the irs management information systems and questions regarding tax calculations that are purely mathematical in nature.id,at q a.as clearly demonstrated through this list,the irs itself set forth a limited view of communications that would be considered ministerial and that could occur on an ex parte basis between the appeals office and other divisions.
at least some of the communications in the present case did not involve merely ministerial,administrative,and procedural matters,but rather,involved the substance of robert appeal.accordingly,under the restructuring act and the irs own procedures,at least some of the communications in the present case should not have taken place on an ex parte basis.mannion should not have expressed his opinions regarding the sufficiency of gruenfeld appraisal to latt and mezines on an ex parte basis.in addition,he should not have shared with the examination division the written critique and additional information that robert attorneys provided without including robert attorneys in the communications.finally,he should not have recommended to mezines that the examination division hire an outside appraiser to value the stock.at a minimum,these communications appeared to compromise mannion independence.
the ex parte communications are made more troubling by the fact that the irs delayed disclosure of at least some of these communications until this matter reached the stage of litigation.further,even on appeal to this court,the irs did not willingly concede the improper nature of its ex parte communications.if anything,this denial by the irs suggests an institutional failure to embrace the ex parte restrictions and militates against our enforcement of the summonses.
nevertheless,as explained below,we will enforce the summonses in this case because congress did not specifically legislate a limitation on the irs summons power as a remedy for violation of the ex parte restrictions the irs did proscribe an administrative remedy to address violations of the ex parte restrictions the supreme court has cautioned that we should be slow to erect barriers to enforcement of irs summonses and,we discern no improper purpose or bad faith behind issuance of the irs summonses nor nexus between the improper communications and any improper purpose for the investigation.
iv.validity of the summonses 
the supreme court made clear in united states powell,d,that a court should not enforce an irs summons if enforcement will result in abuse of the court process.the court stated 
it is the court process which is invoked to enforce the administrative summons and a court may not permit its process to be abused.such an abuse would take place if the summons had been issued for an improper purpose,such as to harass the taxpayer or to put pressure on him to settle a collateral dispute,or for any other purpose reflecting on the good faith of the particular investigation.
id.at.footnote omitted.the above listing is not an exhaustive inventory of the potential improper purposes that might reflect on the good faith of an investigation and prevent enforcement of a summons.see id.stating that taxpayer may challenge the summons on any appropriate ground quoting reisman caplin,d.rather,courts may consider new situations as they arise to determine whether the enforcement of a summons would further an improper purpose,reflect on the good faith of the irs,or
