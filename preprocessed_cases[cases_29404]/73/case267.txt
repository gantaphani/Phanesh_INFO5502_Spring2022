opinion of the court 
this case arises from a corporate reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code,et the code,and puts at issue whether a company decision to abandon its classification as an s corporation for federal tax purposes,thus forfeiting the tax benefits that it and its debtor subsidiary had enjoyed,is void as a postpetition transfer of property of the bankruptcy estate,or is avoidable,under,and of the code.this appears to be a question of first impression in the federal courts of appeals.
barden development,bdi,john chase,as the personal representative of the estate of don together with bdi,the barden appellants,and the internal revenue service the irs appeal an order of the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware granting summary judgment to the majestic star casino,llc and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates collectively majestic or the debtors on their motion to avoid bdi termination of its status as an s corporation or,an entity type that is not subject to federal taxation.in november,the debtors,which had been controlled by barden,filed petitions for relief under chapter of the code.after the bankruptcy filing,barden,as sole shareholder of bdi,successfully petitioned the irs to revoke bdi status.under the internal revenue code,that revocation also caused majestic star casino ii,msc ii,an indirect and bdi subsidiary and one of the debtors,to lose its status as a qualified subchapter s subsidiary or qsub,which meant that it,like bdi,became subject to federal taxation.
the debtors were by then effectively controlled by their creditors and,naturally,did not agree with shouldering a new tax burden.they filed an adversary complaint asserting that the revocation of bdi status caused an unlawful postpetition transfer of property of the msc ii bankruptcy estate.the bankruptcy court agreed and ordered the barden appellants and the irs to reinstate both bdi status as an and msc ii status as a qsub.the case was certified to us for direct appeal.for the reasons that follow,we will vacate the bankruptcy court january,order and remand this matter to the court with directions to dismiss the complaint.
background 
the parties 
defendant appellant bdi is an indiana corporation with its headquarters in detroit,michigan.defendant appellant barden was,at all pertinent times,the sole shareholder,chief executive officer,and president of bdi.at the time of the complaint,bdi qualified as a small business corporation under b,and,presumably at barden direction,had elected under a to be treated as an for purposes of federal income taxation.as an,bdi was not subject to federal taxation,see a or state taxation rather,its income and losses were passed through to its shareholder,barden,who was required to report bdi income on his individual tax returns.see b,a 
plaintiff appellee msc ii is a delaware corporation that owns and operates the majestic star ii casino and the majestic star hotel in gary,indiana.msc ii generates income from those operations.bdi acquired msc ii in and was,at all times relevant to this dispute,the ultimate owner of percent of its stock prior to the debtors bankruptcy petition,bdi elected to treat msc ii as a qsub for federal tax purposes,pursuant to b b that meant that msc ii was not treated as a separate tax entity from bdi,but rather that all of its assets,liabilities,and income were treated for federal tax purposes as the assets,liabilities,and income of bdi.see id.b a.as a result,msc ii paid no federal taxes and all of its income and losses flowed through to barden through bdi,and he was required to report them on his individual tax returns.see reg.a.bdi was able to elect to treat msc ii as a qsub because the latter met the statutory requirement that it was wholly owned by an,ultimately bdi.see b b supra notes and.
the majestic bankruptcy and the revocation of msc ii qsub status 
on november,the petition date,msc ii and the other debtors filed voluntary petitions for bankruptcy relief under the code,and the bankruptcy court subsequently ordered that their chapter cases be jointly administered.the debtors became of their respective bankruptcy estates,and thus had,with limited exceptions not relevant here,all of the powers and duties of a bankruptcy trustee in a chapter case.at the petition date,both bdi and msc ii retained their status as,respectively,an and a qsub.barden and bdi did not file bankruptcy petitions,nor did they participate as debtors in any of the petitions at issue in this case.
in addition to certain events that automatically revoke an entity election to be treated as an that tax status may also be revoked if more than half of the corporation shareholders consent to the revocation.d b.if status is revoked,the entity can not elect such status again within five years of the revocation without the consent of the secretary of the treasury.id.g 
sometime after the petition date,barden,bdi sole shareholder,caused and consented to the revocation of bdi status as an,and bdi filed a notice with the irs to that effect.the revocation was retroactively effective to january,the first day of bdi taxable year as a result,msc ii qsub status was automatically terminated as of the end of the prior tax year the revocation,because it no longer met the requirement that it be wholly owned by an.thus,both bdi and msc ii became as of january.as a consequence of becoming a,msc ii became responsible for filing its own tax returns and paying income taxes on its holdings and operations.
neither bdi nor barden sought or obtained authorization from the debtors or from the bankruptcy court for the revocation.the debtors did not learn of the revocation until july,which is believed to be at least four months after barden and bdi filed the revocation with the irs.see supra note.the debtors allege that,because msc ii was not informed of the revocation,it was unaware that it had a new obligation to report and pay income taxes.they also allege that,due to the change in msc ii tax status,msc ii had to pay approximately million in estimated income tax to the indiana department of revenue for that it otherwise would not have had to pay.however,as of april the first date federal taxes would have been due following the revocation,the debtors had paid no federal income taxes as a result of the revocation.
confirmation of the majestic plan and its effect on msc ii 
on december,prior to the debtors filing of the adversary complaint that initiated this action,the bankruptcy court issued an order permitting the debtors to convert msc ii from a delaware corporation to a delaware limited liability company llc.on march,the court entered an order confirming the debtors second amended plan of reorganization the plan.pursuant to the plan,as of december,the effective date,new membership interests representing all of the equity interests in msc ii were to be issued to holders of certain senior secured debt.on november,just prior to the effective date,the debtors went ahead and caused msc ii to convert to an llc.that conversion meant that msc ii would no longer have qualified for qsub status,even if the revocation had not already occurred.see b b requiring that a qsub be a domestic corporation also,as part of the plan of reorganization,msc ii ceased to be wholly owned by an,so that,even absent the llc conversion,and independent of the revocation,msc ii would no longer have qualified as a qsub.the debtors plan of reorganization was substantially consummated on december,and msc ii emerged from bankruptcy together with the other debtors on that date.
procedural history 
on december,the debtors filed an adversary complaint in the bankruptcy court,asserting that the revocation caused an unlawful postpetition transfer of msc ii estate property,in violation of and of the bankruptcy code.the complaint sought recovery of that property under code,through an order directing the irs and the indiana department of revenue to restore bdi status as an s corporation and msc ii status as a qsub retroactively effective january.app.at.
the irs moved to dismiss the debtors adversary complaint on february,contending that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction and that the debtors failed to state a claim under federal rules of civil procedure b and b incorporated by federal rule of bankruptcy procedure b.more particularly,the irs argued that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction under code a because the debtors had not alleged that msc ii had actually paid any federal corporate income taxes or filed any federal income tax returns prior to initiating their adversary proceeding,so that their claims were not ripe.the irs also argued that the debtors had failed to state a claim because msc ii status as a qsub was not property of the msc ii estate because msc ii never had a right to claim,continue,or revoke that status either before or after it filed its bankruptcy petition app.at,and that no transfer of estate property occurred when bdi terminated its election and triggered the loss of msc ii qsub status,app.at.
barden and bdi answered the debtors adversary complaint on february,and moved for judgment on the pleadings under federal rule of civil procedure c.they contended that because a qsub has no separate tax existence,msc ii had no cognizable property interest in that status.they also argued that,because a subsidiary qsub status depends entirely on elections made by its parent,even if msc ii qsub status were a species of property,it was property that belonged to bdi and barden.
the debtors moved for summary judgment on march,and,on january,the bankruptcy court granted their motion and denied both the irs motion to dismiss and the barden appellants motion for judgment on the pleadings.the court held that msc ii status as a qsub was the property of msc ii,and that,as such,it belonged to msc ii bankruptcy estate.the court therefore concluded that the revocation by bdi of its status as an,and the resulting termination of msc ii status as a qsub,were void and of no effect.finally,the court ordered the defendants,including the irs,to take all actions necessary to restore the status of msc ii as a qsub of bdi.
that order,of course,has significant practical implications for the parties.as with many bankruptcy reorganizations,the debtors emergence from bankruptcy resulted in the cancellation of a substantial amount of indebtedness,which,in turn,generated cancellation of debt cod income equal to the amount by which the debt was reduced in bankruptcy.at oral argument before us,the irs said that the amount of that cod income was million.cod income is generally subject to federal taxation.see a including in the definition of gross income income from the discharge of indebtedness.if bdi is restored to status,then it,and ultimately barden,is the taxpayer and would be liable for the taxes on the cod income.see prop.reg,providing that,when the debtor is a disregarded entity,such as an,then the owner of that entity is the taxpayer.normally,under the bankruptcy exception,a taxpayer in bankruptcy does not recognize cod income on debt that is cancelled or written down as part of a plan of reorganization.a a.however,in this case,neither barden nor bdi was part of the majestic bankruptcy,so they may not qualify for the bankruptcy exception and could be liable for the tax on the cod income.see prop.reg.limiting the bankruptcy exception to entities under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.also,the bankruptcy court order caused the irs to lose the benefit of msc ii tax liabilities being treated as an administrative expense of the bankruptcy estate,which would have allowed the government to be paid before most other creditors.see b b.
by contrast,the debtors or,more precisely,their former creditors who replaced bdi as the holders of msc ii equity benefit in at least two dramatic ways if the revocation is deemed to have been void or is otherwise avoided.first,if msc ii remains a qsub even after having emerged from bankruptcy,then it and its new equity holders will continue to enjoy its status,while bdi retains liability for msc ii income taxes,even though bdi no longer has access to msc ii income and cash flow to fund the tax payments.second,by shifting the tax liability for cod income to bdi,msc ii need not make use of the bankruptcy exception,which would ordinarily come with a substantial cost.under the,a debtor that makes use of the bankruptcy exception must reduce the value of other tax attributes by the amount of cod income excluded from gross income.see b.that means that the reorganized debtor loses the value of various deductions and credits that would have been available to reduce taxes in the future.see id.b.as a consequence of the bankruptcy court order,however,the debtors avoid liability for cod income without the adverse impact on their tax attributes.
the bankruptcy court granted the irs and the barden appellants leave to appeal on march,even though the court judgment and order had left open the calculation of the damages for which barden and bdi were liable as a result of the court conclusion that they had violated the automatic stay.the united states district court for the district of delaware certified the appeals to us on may,and we authorized the appeals on july.
ii.jurisdiction and standards of review 
the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction over the adversary proceeding pursuant to b,a b.we have jurisdiction over this direct appeal under d a.we reject the barden appellants argument,raised for the first time in this appeal,that the bankruptcy court,as an article i court,lacked jurisdiction to order the irs to reinstate bdi status as an and msc ii status as a qsub.leaving aside that arguments not raised below are normally waived on appeal,see in re american biomaterials,cir,that argument is without merit.the bankruptcy code gives bankruptcy courts the power to issue any order,process,or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out its provisions.official comm.of unsecured creditors of cybergenics ex rel.cybergenics chinery,cir quoting a.the irs is subject to that power as an entity referred to in specific provisions of the code,because that term expressly includes a governmental unit.the court ability to exercise jurisdiction over the irs has been affirmed in a number of contexts.see united states energy res,d holding that a bankruptcy court has the authority to order the irs to apply the payments made by a debtor to trust fund liabilities if the bankruptcy court determines that this designation is necessary to the success of a reorganization plan united states whiting pools,d concluding that the code authorizes a bankruptcy court to recover property seized to satisfy a lien prior to the filing of a petition for reorganization,and noting that w e see no reason why a different result should obtain when the irs is the creditor.transactions to which the irs is a party are also subject to the general rule that they are void if they violate the automatic stay.see united states galletti,d noting that the automatic stay barred the irs from bringing suit against a debtor in bankruptcy in re schwartz,cir holding that an irs tax assessment that violated the automatic stay was void.
although we reject the barden appellants argument that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction,we note that this case raises a jurisdictional question of standing that the parties did not raise and the bankruptcy court did not consider.we address that question in parts and,infra,in the context of the merits.

iii.discussion 
this appeal requires us to answer two related questions.as a threshold matter of justiciability,we must decide whether the debtors have standing to challenge the revocation of msc ii qsub status.that,however,requires us to address the merits of whether the msc ii bankruptcy estate had a property interest in msc ii qsub status such that the debtors had the right to challenge what they characterize as the postpetition transfer of that interest.
front and center in this case is the question of whether a debtor subsidiary entity tax status is property at all,and,if so,whether it is property belonging to that subsidiary or to its corporate parent.that implicates standing,even though the issue was not addressed before this appeal.inasmuch as the s tanding doctrine embraces judicially limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction,allen wright,d,we turn to it first.
the doctrine of standing focuses on the party seeking to get his complaint before a federal court and not on the issues he wishes to have adjudicated.valley forge christian coll.ams.united for separation of church state,d quoting flast cohen,d internal quotation marks omitted.it involves both constitutional limitations on jurisdiction and prudential limitations on its exercise.warth seldin,d.one of those prudential limits demands that the plaintiff generally assert his own legal rights and interests,and not rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.id.at.
the debtors effort to pursue claims under code,and is dependent upon code,which provides that a bankruptcy estate succeeds only to legal or equitable interests of the debtor as of the commencement of the case.a.it is a given that t he trustee or can assert no greater rights than the debtor himself had on the date the bankruptcy case was commenced.guinn lines in re trans lines west,quoting collier on bankruptcy ed internal quotation marks omitted.
as discussed in more detail in part,infra,a corporation can not alter its tax status through election,revocation or rescission,without some form of shareholder consent,so that the corporation,standing alone,can not challenge the validity of a prior subchapter s revocation without the consent of at least those shareholders who consented to the revocation.trans lines west,at.as a result,a trustee or who attempts to challenge the validity of a revocation without such consent is asserting the rights of a third party,the equity holder,and does not have standing simon.welfare rights,d declining to decide whether a third party ever may challenge irs treatment of another.
following that reasoning,if we assume that a subsidiary entity tax status,its existence as a entity,is property but hold that such status belongs not to the subsidiary itself but rather to its parent,then the right to challenge the revocation of qsub status belongs solely to the parent corporation,and the bankruptcy estate of a qsub does not succeed to that right under code.if that is the case,then a debtor subsidiary that challenges a revocation,as msc ii has done in this case,is endeavoring to assert the rights of a third party,namely its parent,which is contrary to general principles of standing.
the prohibition on third party standing,however,is not invariable and our jurisprudence recognizes standing under certain circumstances.psychiatric soc y green spring health servs,cir.we have recognized that the principles animating prudential standing concerns are not subverted if the third party is hindered from asserting its own rights and shares an identity of interests with the plaintiff.id.citing craig boren,d singleton wulff,d plurality opinion eisenstadt baird,d.more specifically,standing requires the satisfaction of three preconditions the plaintiff must suffer injury the plaintiff and the third party must have a close relationship and the third party must face some obstacles that prevent it from pursuing its own claims.id.at citing campbell louisiana,d powers ohio,d pitt.news fisher,cir.
if the entity tax status of msc ii is property that belongs to bdi,then the present case does not satisfy the third condition for standing.nothing in the record suggests that bdi,as the former shareholder of msc ii and the third party with standing,is unable to protect its own interests.the term third party is actually something of a misnomer here because bdi,as well as its ultimate shareholder barden,are both defendant parties in the present action and have vigorously fought to protect their interests.sticking with that nomenclature,though,it is settled that third parties themselves usually will be the best proponents of their own rights,singleton,at,and the fact that bdi chose not to backtrack and challenge the revocation does not mean that msc ii or the debtors have standing to do so.
we thus find ourselves in a circumstance where what is ordinarily the preliminary question of standing can not be answered without delving into whether the entity tax status of msc ii is property and,if so,whether it belongs to msc ii.in short,we must consider the merits.
qsub status claimed as property of the msc ii bankruptcy estate 
referring to msc ii qsub status,the bankruptcy court said that because the subchapter s status provided the the ability to capital gains tax liabilities to its principals,the right to make or revoke its subchapter s status had value to the debtor and constituted property or an interest of the debtor in property.in re majestic star casino,llc.the barden appellants argue that the bankruptcy court erred in that conclusion because the court applied a general overarching bankruptcy principle that anything that brings value into a bankruptcy estate must be a property right barden appellants opening br.at,despite the fact that the bankruptcy code by itself does not constitute a source of property rights id.at.likewise,the irs asserts that simply because an election means that the corporation may use and enjoy the benefits of a entity tax status,it does not follow that the postpetition revocation of that election is a transfer of estate property.irs opening br.at.
in their adversary proceeding,the debtors sought relief under,and of the code section provides that a or trustee may avoid a transfer of property of the estate that occurs after the commencement of the case and that is not authorized by the court.a.section permits the or trustee to recover,for the benefit of the estate property whose transfer has been avoided under.id.a.finally,provides for an automatic stay such that the filing of a chapter petition operates as a stay,applicable to all entities,of,inter alia,any act to obtain possession of property of the estate or of property from the estate or to exercise control over property of the estate.id.a.section also provides that an individual injured by any willful violation of the stay shall recover actual damages,including costs and attorneys fees,and,in appropriate circumstances,may recover punitive damages.id.k.
section operates differently than and.those latter sections authorize the bankruptcy court to avoid the violative transfer,but the or trustee must commence an adversary proceeding.see fed.requiring that a proceeding to recover money or property be brought as an adversary proceeding in re doll doll motor,denying bank motion seeking an order to recover property sold by a chapter debtor because the bank had not filed an adversary proceeding against the buyer.by contrast,a transfer that violates the automatic stay is generally considered to be void without any action on the part of the debtor.in re myers,cir citing in re siciliano,cir t he general principle is that any creditor action taken in violation of an automatic stay is void ab initio.
notwithstanding that difference,all three sections have three elements in common for purposes of the problem before us.for the revocation to be void under or avoidable under and,qsub status must be property of the bankruptcy estate that has been transferred.though a lack of any one of those elements is dispositive,we choose to consider in the alternative only the first two.
qsub status as property 
section a of the bankruptcy code defines property of the estate as all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.a.w e have emphasized that section a was intended to sweep broadly to include all kinds of property,including tangible or intangible property,and causes of action.in re kane,cir second alteration in original quoting westmoreland human opportunities,walsh,cir internal quotation marks omitted.t he term property has been construed most generously and an interest is not outside its reach because it is novel or contingent or because enjoyment must be postponed.in re fruehauf trailer,cir quoting segal rochelle,d internal quotation marks omitted.it is also well established that the mere opportunity to receive an economic benefit in the future is property with value under the bankruptcy code.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
however,f iling for bankruptcy does not create new property rights or value where there previously were none.in re messina,cir butner united states,d noting that the holder of a property interest is afforded in federal bankruptcy court the same protection he would have had under state law if no bankruptcy had ensued.consequently,t he estate is determined at the time of the initial filing of the bankruptcy petition kollar miller,cir.
this appears to be a matter of deliberate congressional choice.although the constitutional authority of congress to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the united states,art.i,cl,could,in theory,encompass a statutory framework defining property interests for purposes of bankruptcy,congress has generally left the determination of property rights in the assets of a bankrupt estate to state law,butner,at see also in re brannon,cir w e generally turn to state law for the determination of property rights in the assets of a bankrupt estate.internal quotation marks omitted.however,if some federal interest requires a different result,butner,at,then property interests may be defined by federal law.mckenzie irving trust.noting that,i n the absence of any controlling federal statute,a creditor may acquire rights to property transferred by a debtor only by virtue of state law.
given the importance of federal tax revenues,one might assume that the internal revenue code determines whether tax status constitutes a property interest of the taxpayer,but it does not do so explicitly and the case law is not entirely clear.see drye united states,d considering whether state law is the proper guide to property or rights to property under a provision of the and noting that the court decisions in point have not been phrased so meticulously.on one hand,the creates no property rights but merely attaches consequences,federally defined,to rights created under state law.united states bess,d.thus,i n the application of a federal revenue act,state law controls in determining the nature of the legal interest which the taxpayer had in the property.united states bank of commerce,d quoting aquilino united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.on the other hand,o nce it has been determined that state law creates sufficient interests in the taxpayer to satisfy the requirements of the federal revenue statute,state law is inoperative,and the tax consequences thenceforth are dictated by federal law.id.second alteration in original quoting bess,at internal quotation marks omitted.in drye united states,the supreme court ultimately concluded that the and interpretive case law place under federal,not state,control the ultimate issue whether a taxpayer has a beneficial interest in any property subject to levy for unpaid federal taxes.at.also,the does address the handling of tax attributes in the bankruptcy context,at least when the debtor is an individual,see a,and provides that the e state succeeds to tax attributes of the debtor determined as of the first day of the debtor taxable year in which the case commences g see also united states sims in re feiler,cir determines what tax attributes of the debtor rightfully belong to the bankruptcy estate.the bankruptcy code itself defers to the with respect to the creation and character of certain tax attributes of the bankruptcy estate.see a providing that the governs whether the creation of a bankruptcy estate creates a tax entity separate from the debtor.thus,we conclude that the,rather than state law,governs the characterization of entity tax status as a property interest for purposes of the bankruptcy code.
with this background,we review the case law that the debtors say supports their claim that msc ii qsub status was property.
s corp status as property 
the bankruptcy court reasoned that qsub status is analogous to status and,based on a few cases holding that the latter is property for purposes of the code,concluded that the former is property too.the principal case is in re trans lines west,which concerned whether a corporation revocation of its status prior to filing for bankruptcy was a prepetition transfer of property avoidable by the trustee pursuant to code the bankruptcy court in that case acknowledged that,i n the absence of controlling federal law,the question of whether a debtor possesses an interest in property is governed by state law,but the court reasoned that,b ecause the subject of the alleged transfer is the debtor status as a subchapter s corporation,a status created under title of the united states code,federal law,and more specifically the internal revenue code,determines whether a debtor holds a property interest in its status.at the court observed that property refers to the right and interest or domination rightfully obtained over an object,with the unrestricted right to its use,enjoyment,and disposition.id.quoting d property internal quotation marks omitted.it then jumped to the conclusion that,
once a corporation elects to be treated as an s corporation.c guarantees and protects the corporation right to use and enjoy that status until it is terminated under d.moreover,d a provides that a n election under subsection a may be terminated by revocation.d a thus,d a guarantees and protects an s corporation right to dispose of that status at will.
id.first alteration in original.
the court also noted that c provides that an election shall be effective for all succeeding taxable years of the corporation,until such election is terminated,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,and it reasoned that the thus affords a corporation which has elected the subchapter s status a guaranteed,indefinite right to use,enjoy,and dispose of that status,id.at.from that,the court concluded that the debtor possessed a property interest,a guaranteed right to use,enjoy and dispose of that interest in its subchapter s status id.at.other courts that have considered the issue of status as a property right have all come to the same conclusion.see halverson funaro in re funaro,cir a corporation right to use,benefit from,or revoke its subchapter s status falls within the broad definition of property under the code.parker saunders in re bakersfield westar,cir concluding that the holding in trans lines west is consistent with the ninth circuit definition of property hanrahan walterman in re walterman implement,wl,at may,t he right to revoke a subchapter s election is property as defined in and the revocation of debtor subchapter s status is also voidable under as a postpetition transfer.
the trans lines west decision and those that follow it base their conclusion that status is property on a series of precedents holding net operating losses nols to be property in segal rochelle,the supreme court declared that the right to offset nols against past income a loss carryback is property of an individual debtor,because it entitles the debtor to a refund of taxes already paid.at.the court decided that a debtor nols,because they arise from prior losses,are sufficiently rooted in its past that,when carried back to generate a tax refund,they should be regarded as property under the code.id.at.
subsequent cases extended the holding in segal to the right to use nols to offset future tax liability a loss carryforward.for example,in official committee of unsecured creditors pss steamship in re prudential lines,cir a corporate subsidiary had million of nols attributable to its past operations when an involuntary petition for reorganization under chapter was filed against it.its corporate parent attempted to take a million worthless stock deduction,based on the anticipated loss of its investment in the subsidiary,which would have eliminated the value of its nol for future use,but creditors of the subsidiary sued the parent to enjoin it from doing so.the bankruptcy court held that the nol carryforward was property of the subsidiary bankruptcy estate and that the parent planned tax deduction would violate the automatic stay.the court thus granted the injunction.in re prudential lines.the united states court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed,holding that the right to carryforward the million nol to offset future income is property of the subsidiary estate within the meaning of.at.accord in re feiler,at holding that a prepetition election to carry forward nols,making them unavailable to the debtor to claim a refund of past taxes,constituted a preference payment avoidable under the code gibson united states in re russell,cir same.the second circuit also held that the parent proposed worthless stock deduction was barred by the automatic stay because,where a action with respect to an interest that is intertwined with that of a bankrupt debtor would have the legal effect of diminishing or eliminating property of the bankrupt estate,such action is barred by the automatic stay.prudential lines,at 
trans lines west and the decisions that follow it extended prudential lines,saying that the ability to make an election,like the ability to elect whether to carry forward or carry back nols,is property.we think that extension untenable,though,for several reasons first,in applying the principle,which had been extended once already by prudential lines,see supra note,the decision in trans lines west and the other cases fail to consider important differences between the two putative property interests in holding that tax status is property,the cases reason from the premise that the prospective nature of a right does not place it outside the definition of property.bakersfield westar,at.even accepting that this will sometimes be the case,not all contingencies are of equal magnitude or consequence.nols when carried back are hardly contingent at all.in all events,a debtor in possession of nols has a defined amount of them at the time of the bankruptcy filing they are a function of the debtor operations prior to bankruptcy and are not subject either to revocation by the shareholders or termination by the irs.see segal,at noting that t he bankrupts in this case had both prior net income and a n nol when their petitions were filed prudential lines,at noting that the subsidiary had a million nol attributable to its operation when it filed for chapter reorganization.by contrast,the shareholders of an can terminate its status at will,regardless of how long it has been an and whatever its operating history has been.the tax status of the entity is entirely contingent on the will of the shareholders.
nols also have value in a way that status does not.the value of an nol is readily determinable as a tax refund immediately available to the bankruptcy estate to the extent that it is applied to prior years earnings,and it is still subject to relatively clear estimation if the debtor decides to carry it forward against future earnings.the value of the election,however,is dependent on its not being revoked,as well as the amount and timing of future earnings.moreover,nol carryforwards may be monetized in a manner that continuing status can not.a corporation that does not expect to generate sufficient future earnings to use its nols may be purchased by another more profitable corporation which may then use the nols to shelter its own income,a transaction expressly contemplated by the see setting forth certain limitations on the use of nol carryforwards after a change in the corporation ownership.by contrast,the sale of an will generally result in the termination of its status.see b setting forth the requirements for small business corporation status and providing that the sale of an to most corporate purchasers would terminate its s status.thus,the analogy of status to nols is of limited validity.
a further flaw in the cases is that they presume that once a corporation elects to be treated as an s corporation,the guarantees and protects the corporation right to use and enjoy that status and guarantees and protects an s corporation right to dispose of that status at will.trans lines west,at.that reflects an incomplete and inaccurate understanding of the law.the does not,and can not,guarantee a corporation right to status,because the corporation shareholders may elect to revoke that status at will.see d b providing for termination of status by revocation with the approval of shareholders holding more than the corporation shares.even if the shareholders do not vote to revoke their corporation status,any individual shareholder may at any time sell his interest without hindrance by the code or the to another corporation,or to a nonresident alien,or to a number of new individuals sufficient to increase the total number of shareholders to more than any of those sales would trigger the automatic revocation of the company s status because the corporation would no longer qualify as a small business corporation.see a,b.thus,the trans line west line of cases is incorrect in concluding that status is a right that is guaranteed under the 
perhaps recognizing those flaws,some courts holding that status is property have defaulted to the argument that such status must be property because it has value to the estate.see prudential lines,at w e must consider the purposes animating the bankruptcy code and congress intention to bring anything of value that the debtors have into the estate.internal quotation marks omitted bakersfield westar,at the ability to not pay taxes has a value to the in this case.indeed,the bankruptcy court in this case essentially defined the debtors property interest as the right to prevent a shifting of tax liability from the shareholders to the qsub through a revocation of the s corporation status.majestic star casino,at.but defines property only in terms of legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.a.it goes without saying that the right of a debtor to place its tax liabilities on a may turn out to have some value,but that does not mean that such a right,if it exists,is property.capacious as the definition of property may be in the bankruptcy context,we are convinced that it does not extend so far as to override rights statutorily granted to shareholders to control the tax status of the entity they own.t he code property definition is not without limitations westmoreland,at.even accepting that an interest that is novel or contingent may still represent property under the code,segal,at,a tax classification over which the debtor has no control is not a legal or equitable interest of the debtor in property for purposes of.
finally,aside from their flawed reasoning,trans lines west and its progeny and the bankruptcy court decision in this case also produce substantial inequities.taxes are typically borne and paid by those who derive some benefit from the income.imposing taxes on the taxable income of the parties listed in that section.as the irs observes in its brief,i n the typical case where an s corporation or receives income,the shareholder has the ability to extract the income from the corporation in order to pay the taxes due on that income.irs opening br.at.see also supra notes and discussing the nature of.if a bankruptcy trustee is permitted to avoid the termination of a debtor or qsub status,then any income generated during or as part of the reorganization process such as from the sale of assets is likely to remain in the corporation,and ultimately in the hands of creditors,but the resulting tax liability must be borne by the shareholders.the trans lines west decision,despite its flaws,clearly recognized that unfairness 
the trustee successful challenge of the debtor revocation of its subchapter s status in the present case would have dire tax consequences to the shareholder.upon the trustee sale of the debtor real estate,the liability for any capital gain would be passed on to the shareholder.conversely,in its present c corporation status,the debtor estate will be liable for the capital gains tax.
at.trans lines west treated that inequitable outcome as indicating a problem with the bankruptcy trustee standing to challenge the transfer of a supposed property interest in a debtor status without the consent of the company shareholders.id.at.that bit of trans lines west is true enough.but the inequity also calls into question the soundness of the court holding that an entity tax status is property in the first place.under the scheme contemplated by the bankruptcy code,a debtor creditors are typically compensated to the extent possible and in as equitable a fashion as possible after the trustee marshals the debtor bankruptcy property westmoreland.it would be impossible for a trustee or a to marshal a debtor status and use it to compensate creditors,as that status is not controlled by the debtor and has no realizable value.
for all these reasons,we decline to follow the rationale of trans line west and its progeny,and we conclude that status is not property within the meaning of the code.
ii.msc ii qsub status as property 
qsub status is an a fortiori case.as with status,the does not and can not guarantee a qsub the unrestricted right to the use,enjoyment and disposition of that status,see trans lines west,at,because it depends on a variety of factors that are entirely outside the qsub control.the qsub has an even weaker claim to the control of its status than does an.the use and enjoyment of its entity tax status is not only dependent on its parent continuing to own percent of its stock,see b b i,b c i,but also on the parent decision to not revoke the qsub election,see id.b b ii,as well as the parent continuing status as an,see id.b b i.that last contingency,in turn,depends on the contingencies already discussed therefore,a qsub use and enjoyment of its tax status may be terminated by factors not only outside its control,but outside the control of its parent.
nor can the qsub transfer or otherwise dispose of its qsub status.as a practical matter,rights to which a debtor asserts a property interest must be readily alienable and assignable,westmoreland,at,to fulfill the equitable purpose of bankruptcy,which is to generate funds to satisfy creditors.see id.at holding that a license for which few entities other than the debtor would qualify was not a property interest of a bankruptcy estate because it is dubious,as a practical matter,that any potential buyers would actually bid for that right.qsub status itself is neither alienable nor assignable,and an that wishes to sell its qsub and preserve its tax status can only sell it to another that is willing to purchase percent of its shares and to make the qsub election.see b b setting forth the requirements for qsub status.the subsidiary would no longer qualify as a qsub after any other type of sale,and the expressly provides for the loss of qsub status as a result of a sale of the subsidiary stock.see id.b c ii.thus,a qsub can hardly be said to control the disposition of the alleged property interest in its entity status.again,a tax classification over which a debtor has no control and that is not alienable or assignable is not a legal or equitable interest of the debtor in property.a.we therefore hold that msc ii qsub status was not property and that the bankruptcy court contrary conclusion was error.
qsub status as property of the estate 
even if qsub status were property,it would still have to be property of the estate for a transfer of that status to be void under code or avoidable under.the code defines property of the estate as all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.a emphasis added.notwithstanding congress intention to bring anything of value that the debtors have into the estate,prudential lines,at internal quotation marks omitted,the legislative history of also demonstrates that it was not intended to expand debtor rights against others more than they exist at the commencement of the case,at,reprinted in,see also collier on bankruptcy ed.although a includes choses in action and claims by the debtor against others,it is not intended to expand the debtor rights against others beyond what rights existed at the commencement of the case the trustee can assert no greater rights than the debtor himself had on the date the case was commenced.
as discussed above,whether a tax attribute is property of a corporate entity for purposes of code is a function of the.and related regulations.even if it were proper to think of status in terms of ownership,the ownership question would rightly be decided by considering the treatment for tax purposes.see supra note.for example,an nol may belong to a debtor that is a c corporation,such as in prudential lines,or to an individual debtor,as in feiler and russell,because when a c corporation individuals file for bankruptcy,the estate created contain s all of their assets,and i ncluded therein are their tax attributes,including nols.official comm.of unsecured creditors of forman,forman in re forman.however,when an files for bankruptcy,its estate can not contain any nols because u nder the provisions of the,the nol and the right to use it automatically passed through by operation of law to the s corporation shareholders.id.any tax benefits resulting from the nol and the right to use it inure solely to the benefit of shareholders and would not be available to satisfy claims of the corporation creditors.id.
the same can be said of an entity tax status itself.the debtor is merely a conduit for tax benefits that flow through to shareholders.the corporation retains no real benefit from its status in that,while there is no tax,all of its income is passed on to its shareholders.see a providing that an is a disregarded entity for federal tax purposes and is not taxed on its income united states tomko,cir en banc noting that the shareholders of an receive their individual shares of the corporation income,deductions,losses,and tax credits.
for its part,a qsub does not even exist for federal tax purposes.if an makes a valid qsub election with respect to an existing subsidiary,the subsidiary is deemed to have liquidated into the parent under and.reg.a as a result,a qsub is generally not treated as a corporation separate from its parent.id.a if a subsidiary ceases to qualify as a qsub because,for example,its corporate parent is no longer an the subsidiary is treated as a new corporation acquiring all of its assets and assuming all of its liabilities from the parent immediately before termination,in exchange for stock of the new subsidiary corporation,under.b c reg.b.lastly,a qsub that loses its qsub status can not return to that status for five years,at which time a new qsub election by the parent is required.b d treas reg.c.pertinent regulations thus strongly suggest that a qsub tax status is not owned by the qsub.
if qsub status were property at all,it would be property of the subsidiary parent.because t he desirability of a subchapter s election depends on the individual tax considerations of each shareholder,t he final determination of whether there is to be an election should be made by those who would suffer the tax consequences of it.kean comm r,cir.trans lines west was correct in that regard.it acknowledged that a corporation election and revocation of the s corporation status under is shareholder driven,and a lthough the corporation is the sole entity that makes the election or revocation under,both acts are contingent upon various degrees of consent by the corporation shareholders.at citing a,d b.
moreover,allowing qsub status to be treated as the property of the debtor subsidiary rather than the parent,as the bankruptcy court did in this case,places remarkable restrictions on the rights of the parent,restrictions that have no foundation in either the or the code.first,the corporate parent loses not only the statutory right to terminate its subsidiary qsub election,see b b,d,but also its right to terminate its own election,see id.d.second,the corporate parent loses the ability to sell the subsidiary shares to any purchaser other than an,and would then be required to sell percent of the shares,because any other sale would trigger the loss of the subsidiary qsub status.see id.b b.third,the parent and its shareholders lose the ability to sell the parent to a,partnership,or other entity,to a nonresident alien,or to more than shareholders,because any of those transactions would also trigger the loss of the subsidiary qsub status.see id.b b,c,a.filing a bankruptcy petition is not supposed to expand or change a debtor interest in an asset it merely changes the party who holds that interest.in re saunders,cir.but under the bankruptcy court holding in this case,a qsub in bankruptcy can stymie legitimate transactions of its parent as unauthorized transfers of property of the estate,even though the qsub would have had no right to interfere with any of those transactions prior to filing for bankruptcy 
the debtors argue that the manner in which an or qsub obtains or maintains its status is not determinative of who holds the property right.debtors br.in resp.to barden appellants opening br.at.they say that the proper focus is on the fact that,under the internal revenue code,the corporation possesses and enjoys the benefits that result from such status at the time of its chapter petition.id.in support of that contention,they cite in re atlantic business community,cir,for the proposition that mere possession of property at the time of filing suffices to give an interest in property protected by section a.id.at quoting atl.bus.cmty,at internal quotation marks omitted.
there are two problems with that argument.first,the holding in atlantic business community was,by its own terms,limited to possessory interests in real property.see at holding that a possessory interest in real property is within the ambit of the estate in bankruptcy under section id.w e hold that a debtor possession of a tenancy at sufferance creates a property interest as defined under section,and is protected by section.the case does not support the broad principle that any interest that benefits the debtor or that the corporation possesses and enjoys debtors br.at is necessarily property of the estate rather than property of a.a limiting property of the estate to legal or equitable interests of the debtor.second,the qsub parent and the parent ultimate shareholders have at least as strong an argument that they possess and enjoy the benefits that result from the subsidiary qsub status due to the of income,the of losses which may be used to shelter other income,and the elimination of tax at the qsub.
based on the foregoing,we conclude that,even if msc ii qsub status were property,it is not properly seen as property of msc ii bankruptcy estate,and the contrary conclusion of the bankruptcy court can not stand 
standing revisited 
having determined that a debtor qsub status is not property of its bankruptcy estate,we return to the question of whether such a debtor has standing to challenge the revocation of that status by its corporate parent.as discussed in part,supra,an,standing alone,can not challenge the validity of a prior subchapter s revocation without the consent of at least those shareholders who consented to the revocation.trans lines west,at.a trustee or who attempts to challenge the validity of such a revocation without such consent is asserting the rights of a third party,its shareholders,and does not have standing id.by analogy,a debtor qsub that seeks to challenge the revocation of its tax status is asserting the rights of a third party,its shareholder,and can do so only if it can claim standing.that,in turn,requires that the qsub plaintiff demonstrate both that its parent is hindered from asserting its own rights and shares an identity of interests with the plaintiff.psychiatric soc y,at.
neither of those conditions exists in this case.far from being hindered,bdi and its ultimate shareholder barden are both parties to this suit and have effectively defended bdi right to revoke its own status and,by extension,the qsub status of msc ii.and far from having an identity of interests,the interests of msc ii and the other debtors are diametrically opposed to those of barden and bdi,onto whom they would like to shift substantial ongoing tax liabilities.the extent of potential conflicts of interests between the plaintiff and the third party whose rights are asserted matters a good deal.amato wilentz,cir.while it may be that standing need not be denied because of a slight,essentially theoretical conflict of interest,genuine conflicts strongly counsel against third party standing.id.we therefore hold that the debtors lacked standing to initiate an adversary proceeding to seek avoidance of the alleged transfer of msc ii qsub status.
iv.conclusion 
sections,and of the code set forth guidelines to determine whether a voidable transfer of estate property has occurred.the bankruptcy court decision,like the cases on which it relied,was based in part on the conclusion that a broad range of property should be included in the estate,due to the congressional goal of encouraging reorganizations and congress choice of methods to protect secured creditors.majestic star casino,at.but,as the supreme court recently observed,nothing in the generalized statutory purpose of protecting secured creditors can overcome the specific manner of that protection which the text of the code contains.radlax gateway hotel,llc amalgamated bank,d.
given that principle,and for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we will vacate the bankruptcy court january,order and remand this matter with directions to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.

the internal revenue code presumes that a business entity incorporated under any federal or state statute is taxable as a c corporation,the letter designation having reference to the subchapter of the which governs the tax treatment of various corporate transactions and interests.see,covering corporate liquidations id.corporate organizations and reorganizations id.treatment of corporate interests as stock or indebtedness reg.a,b defining a business entity that is recognized for federal tax purposes.subchapter s of the creates an exception for a business entity that qualifies as a small business corporation and whose shareholder or shareholders elect status for that entity.see a providing that any corporation is a taxable unless it qualifies for,and elects,status id.a providing for the s election.to qualify as a small business corporation,the business entity must be a domestic corporation that does not have more than shareholders,has only individual persons as shareholders,does not have a nonresident alien as a shareholder,and has only a single class of stock.id.b.as discussed in more detail infra,an is a disregarded entity for federal tax purposes and is not taxed on its income.id.a see also reg.c v c providing that an entity that elects status is treated as an association rather than as a corporation for tax purposes so that only its shareholders are taxed on the entity income.
indiana follows the federal entity classification rules for state tax purposes,so that an entity classified as an for federal tax purposes is automatically classified as such for indiana state tax purposes.ann.bdi was therefore treated as a disregarded entity by indiana tax authorities as well.
an is sometimes referred to as a passthough or entity because the entity itself pays no tax but its income,deductions,losses,and credits to its shareholders,who must report those amounts in their personal income tax returns.united states tomko,cir en banc.
msc ii was a subsidiary of the majestic star casino,llc,which in turn was by majestic holdco,llc.bdi owned percent of the stock of majestic holdco,llc.due to the percent tiered ownership of majestic holdco,llc and the majestic star casino,llc,those intermediate subsidiaries are treated as disregarded entities for federal income tax purposes,see reg.b ii,and bdi is treated as the owner of msc ii.
the amendments to the enacted as part of the small business job protection act of,stat,introduced qsubs as a new tax entity.an may elect qsub status for its subsidiary if the parent holds percent of the subsidiary stock,the subsidiary is otherwise eligible to qualify as an on its own,but for the fact that it has a corporate shareholder,and the parent makes the appropriate election on irs form.see generally the s corporation handbook peter fass barbara gerrard,eds.treasury regulations provide that a qsub is generally not treated as a corporation separate from its parent.reg.a.if an makes a valid qsub election with respect to an existing subsidiary,as in this case,the subsidiary is deemed to have liquidated into the parent under and.reg.a.if a subsidiary ceases to qualify as a qsub for example,because its corporate parent is no longer an the subsidiary is treated as a new corporation acquiring all of its assets and assuming all of its liabilities from the parent immediately before termination,in exchange for stock of the new subsidiary corporation,under.b c reg.b.

an llc may opt to elect to be taxed as a partnership,see reg.c,so the conversion of msc ii to an llc effectively reinstated its status as a entity.but the conversion of msc ii,at that time a as a result of the revocation,into an llc may itself have been a taxable event to the extent the conversion could have been treated as a corporate liquidation.see.the debtors were aware of the possible taxable nature of the conversion to an llc when it occurred.
specifically,the debtors sought an order voiding the avoidable transfer under section of the bankruptcy code,and,pursuant to section of the code,orders directing all of the defendants to return any transferred property and directing the irs and indiana department of revenue to return any tax payments made by msc ii as a result of the avoidable transfer,an order invalidating the revocation,and an order voiding the avoidable transfer under section a and section k of the bankruptcy code app.at.

courts that have followed trans lines west have reached the same conclusion.see,parker saunders in re bakersfield westar,cir a debtor subchapter s status is a creation of,and federal law therefore determines whether a debtor holds a property interest in its subchapter s status.
net operating lossesare created when the taxpayer deductible business expenses for a given year exceed her net income for that year.c.once nols are sustained,the taxpayer may carry the loss back three years and use it as a deduction in that year.nols that remain are applied to the next two years and deducted accordingly.id.b a,b.if any loss remains at the end of the carryback period,it is carried forward and deducted from the taxpayer income over the next fifteen years or until it is exhausted,beginning with the year after the loss was initially sustained.id.b b.alternatively,the tax code permits the taxpayer to forego the carryback option and instead use the nols exclusively in future years.id.b c.such an election,once made,is irrevocable for that tax year.united states in re russell,cir.an nol carryback against past earnings therefore generates a claim for a refund of taxes paid on those earnings,while an nol carryforward represents the ability to shelter future income from taxation.
although prudential lines and cases that followed it extended segal holding,the segal court expressly reserved judgment on whether future tax benefits,such as loss carryforwards or carryovers would also constitute bankruptcy estate property.the court observed that a carryover into years can be distinguished both conceptually as well as practically from a benefit available against past taxes because the supposed would still need to be matched in some future year by earnings,earnings that might never eventuate at all.segal,at.despite that dictum,the court in prudential lines concluded that t he fact that the right to a n nol carryforward is intangible and has not yet been reduced to a tax refund does not exclude it from the definition of property of the estate.at.that conclusion relied on the segal court reasoning that postponed enjoyment does not disqualify an interest as property,and that contingency in the abstract is no bar to finding that an interest is property of a bankruptcy estate.at.but that reasoning in segal was addressed only to the argument that an nol carryback was not property of the estate at the commencement of the proceeding because no refund could be claimed from the government until the end of the year of filing,during which earnings by the bankrupt might diminish or eliminate the refund claim id.it does not support the broad proposition that any contingent tax attribute can necessarily be labeled as property.
we have not yet addressed the question of whether nol carrybacks or carryforwards constitute property.the closest we have come to deciding the question was an issue arising under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,rather than the.in in re fruehauf trailer,cir,a debtor made an irrevocable election to increase pension benefits that denied the bankruptcy estate the ability to recoup an accumulated surplus in plan assets.we held that t his recoupment right is a transferable property interest because,a lthough the right to recover the surplus from an retirement plan is a future estate,the reversion itself is a present,vested estate.as a result,the employer reversionary interest falls within the broad reach of section a of the bankruptcy code and is considered property id.at second alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted see also id.property of the estate includes all interests,such as contingent interests and future interests,whether or not transferable by the debtor.quoting prudential lines,at internal quotation marks omitted.
