factual and procedural background 
as is generally the case in great dissolution appeals,the facts are undisputed and merely serve to provide a contextual framework.our analysis is concerned principally with statutory interpretation.
the city established its former redevelopment agency the winters community development agency in,and adopted a redevelopment plan for the project area which consists of about percent of the total land area of the city.in,the city voted to extend the expiration date of the plan to,and the authority of the redevelopment agency to receive tax increment and pay related debts until.in its redevelopment plan,the city noted that the sacramento area council of governments had identified a need in the project area for units of subsidized housing as of that date,none had been built with money from the housing fund.
in order to satisfy its constitutionally mandated minimum funding obligation,the legislature directed redevelopment agencies to transfer tax increment to school and community college districts in funds created for educational revenue augmentation or supplemental educational revenue augmentation on multiple occasions between and california redevelopment matosantos cal th,matosantos i california redevelopment matosantos th,matosantos ii.in imposing this obligation,the legislature authorized the redevelopment agencies to borrow from their annual for their subsidized housing funds,requiring the loans to be repaid within years,subd.b fiscal year,subd.b fiscal year,subd.b fiscal year and fiscal year,subds.a a c fiscal year,to be repaid by june,subds.a a c fiscal year,to be repaid by june.in addition,the redevelopment agencies were authorized generally to defer if there was insufficient tax increment to satisfy other obligations.plaintiffs do not appear to contend that any such sums are owed to the subsidized housing fund from the former redevelopment agency.
the amount of tax increment to which a redevelopment agency is entitled is limited to the amount of its total indebtedness both existing and executory,less available revenue.thus,the redevelopment agency must annually prepare a statement of its total indebtedness and submit it to the county auditor or other responsible officer.matosantos i,supra,cal th at matosantos ii,supra,th at glendale redevelopment agency county of los angeles th,subd.b.as noted in the state controller final annual report on redevelopment agencies for the fiscal year ending june,the definition of indebtedness for the purposes of this form is not limited to the formal accounting definition of indebtedness,but is expanded to include all redevelopment obligations,including obligations to the housing fund.this statement of indebtedness is perhaps the least understood aspect of redevelopment finance.it itemizes all future tax increment requirements for the purpose of repaying indebtedness.italics added.the statement is accompanied by a reconciliation document that identifies all changes from the prior year statement.moreover,pursuant to the state controller instructions for preparing the statement,total indebtedness is increased by the percent obligation for the housing fund as well as percentages for other similar statutory obligations so that sufficient revenue is available for the remaining redevelopment obligations,subd.f for purposes of this statement the amount an agency will deposit in its housing fund shall constitute an indebtedness of the agency,italics added.when the statement is filled out as directed,an agency will have disclosed the total amount of tax increment an agency will need to satisfy any and all uses for the life of the project in addition to the use of tax increment for the current year.
the city former redevelopment agency filed its final indebtedness statement in for the tax year.at that point,the legislature had enacted the great dissolution in june,which the supreme court subjected to a stay while it undertook original review of its legality.matosantos i,supra,cal th at.in accordance with the controller instructions and statutory directive,the statement showed the debt to the housing fund listed in the previous statement of,with a d ecrease in passthrough required and in payments from tax increment,leaving a balance of of what is designated as due during tax year.all sums herein are rounded to the nearest dollar.
following the great dissolution,redevelopment agencies and tax increment per se were abolished as of february,subd.a,subd.a matosantos i,supra,cal th at,all provisions of the community redevelopment law that depend on the allocation of tax increment to redevelopment agencies shall be inoperative upon the effective date of the act,subd.a.instead,a county simply allocates to a trust fund an amount of property tax equal to the enforceable obligations of the former redevelopment agency that the successor agency will use to pay the obligations,subd.d,subd.c.

the city elected to become the successor agency to its former redevelopment agency.it also elected to become the successor housing agency for purposes of administering the housing asset fund,which is the successor to the previous fund for subsidized housing.in its initial rops for the period of january through june,the city listed the roughly million amount identified on its indebtedness schedule as an outstanding debt to the former housing fund,with a payment due of.it submitted this rops to the department in april.in response to an inquiry from the department about the basis of this obligation,the city cited section.it explained that it had based its calculation on the amount the former redevelopment agency would have deposited into the former housing fund over the remaining life of the project.the department notified the city that the was not required any longer and returned the rops for reconsideration.the city filed an amended rops i omitting this debt,and did not include it in the rops ii and iii for the period of july through june.
in what we will call rops iv for consistency july through,the city once again included the million as an outstanding debt to the former housing fund.when the department requested documentation of the debt,the city responded with a letter from one of the attorneys for plaintiffs,which demanded inclusion of the in rops iv,asserting the opinion that the entire amount of for the housing fund over the life of the project area was due ab initio and simply paid in annual increments much like a mortgage.the department again rejected the inclusion of this debt because the obligation expired with the end of redevelopment.this action followed in september.
