background 
medimarts was established in as a nonprofit collective under the name bay pacific care.bay pacific care paid the marijuana business tax hereafter,mbt from march through july.in august the collective changed its name to medimarts,and it continued paying the tax through april.in may of,however,medimarts discontinued paying the mbt,instead submitting tax returns showing no money due.the city began sending tax assessments and overdue notices,while armstrong maintained that the tax itself was illegal under federal law.after a hearing before the acting director of finance,medimarts was found to owe as of august,along with the future accrual of penalties and interest.armstrong continued to protest the assessments to wendy sollazzi,a revenue management division manager in the city finance department.another hearing took place on november.on july,the director of finance found that medimarts owed as of the november hearing date.
the city then brought this action against armstrong and medimarts to collect the unpaid business taxes due under the mbt,chapter of the san jose municipal code hereafter,sjmc or the code.in its first amended complaint,filed december,it alleged that defendants were subject to the mbt and that by failing to pay the tax they had incurred collection costs,interest,and penalties.the complaint specifically alleged that armstrong was an agent of medimarts acting in the scope of such agency and with the permission and consent of medimarts.together the taxes,interest,and penalties claimed by the city totaled as of october.
defendants answered the complaint and filed a under sections and.in this pleading they alleged that payment of the mbt would subject d efendants to self incrimination,because the law forces defendants to admit to the sale or possession for sale of marijuana.the tax also violated defendants due process rights by failing to provide for notice or a hearing before declaring medimarts a nuisance and by forcing it to cease operations.armstrong specifically was denied due process because he was not afforded a hearing on whether he should be personally liable for the taxes of medimarts.finally,the alleged a violation of defendants equal protection rights under the fourteenth amendment,because the mbt unjustly treats collectives and medical marijuana patients differently from other similarly situated individuals and organizations.defendants sought damages as well as a judicial determination as to whether the mbt is due and payable and the mbt violates constitutional rights.
defendants then applied for a preliminary injunction to restrain the city from taking any action to shut down the collective or declare it a nuisance,to compel the city to reinstate medimarts business registration,and to require the city to remove its classification of medimarts as a nuisance per se during the pendency of the action.defendants cited the same grounds as in their and predicted great and irreparable injury from the closing of medimarts,not only to the collective but also to the patient members who needed the medical marijuana to cope with their illnesses.medimarts as well as armstrong could assert the fifth amendment here,they argued,because it functioned only to serve its that is,it existed not merely as an organization,but as a collective of members who were all acting in their own personal interest and on behalf of all members.like the other members,armstrong himself could assert the fifth amendment because he was not acting solely as a representative of medimarts but was always acting in a partially personal capacity.defendants also argued that the mbt was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.
the superior court was not persuaded.applying the collective entity rule,the court determined that neither medimarts nor armstrong was entitled to assert the fifth amendment to resist the tax.see braswell united states,braswell.the court rejected the argument as to medimarts that it existed only to serve its member patients it was nonetheless a separate incorporated legal entity with all the powers,benefits and responsibilities accorded to it by law.armstrong claim that he could invoke the fifth amendment because he was not acting solely as a representative of the collective was also deemed unavailing.from the court june,order,defendants filed this timely appeal.
