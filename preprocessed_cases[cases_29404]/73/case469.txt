in this estate tax case,david kimbell,the executor of the estate of his mother ruth kimbell,appeals the judgment of the district court denying his request for a refund of estate taxes and interest paid by the estate.the district court decided on for partial summary judgment that the value of assets the decedent transferred to the kimbell property,partnership was includible in her gross estate under because the transfer was not a bona fide sale for full and adequate consideration.we conclude that the district court erred in finding as a matter of law that family members can not enter into a bona fide transaction,and a transfer of assets in return for a pro rata partnership interest is not a transfer for full and adequate consideration.the district court also erred in failing to consider uncontroverted record evidence to support the taxpayer position that the transfer was a bona fide sale.we therefore vacate and remand.
ruth kimbell kimbell or the decedent died testate on march.she was years old.the plaintiff,david kimbell,is the decedent son and the executor of her estate.in the years prior to her death,the decedent transferred a large portion of her estate in a series of transactions to three entities.in,kimbell created the kimbell living trust the trust,which was a revocable living trust administered by kimbell and her son as.in january,the trust,david kimbell and his wife formed a limited liability company,the kimbell management,the llc.the trust contributed for a interest.david kimbell and his wife each contributed for interests each.david kimbell was the sole manager of the llc.
later in january,the trust and the llc formed the kimbell property,a limited partnership under texas law the partnership.the trust contributed approximately million in cash,oil and gas working interests and royalty interests,securities,notes and other assets for a limited partner interest.the oil and gas properties were a continuation of an oil and gas business that the decedent late husband had founded in the.the llc contributed approximately in cash for a general partner interest.at inception,approximately of the assets of the partnership were oil and gas working and royalty interests.as a result of these transfers,kimbell,through the trust and the llc,owned of the partnership.david kimbell managed kimbell business interest before and after the creation of the llc and the partnership.not all of kimbell assets were conveyed to the llc and the partnership.she retained over in assets outside of the llc and the partnership for her personal expenses.the primary focus of this appeal is on this transfer from the llc and the trust to the partnership.because of kimbell control of the trust assets,the transfer by the trust is viewed as a transfer by kimbell.
under the stated terms of the partnership agreement,the purposes of the partnership were to increase family wealth establish a method by which annual gifts can be made without fractionalizing family assets continue the ownership and collective operation of family assets and restrict the right of members to acquire interests in family assets provide protection to family assets from claims of future creditors against family members prevent transfer of a family member interest in the partnership as a result of a failed marriage provide flexibility and continuity in business planning for the family not available through trusts,corporations or other business entities facilitate the administration and reduce the cost associated with the disability or probate of the estate of family members promote the family knowledge of and communication about family assets provide resolution of any disputes which may arise among the family in order to preserve family harmony and avoid the expense and problems of litigation and consolidate fractional interests in family assets.paragraph numbers omitted.these purposes were supported by the deposition testimony of david kimbell and micheal elyea,kimbell business advisor.the term of the partnership was years.
the llc,as general partner,managed the partnership and had exclusive authority to make distributions.the partnership agreement provided that the general partner owed no fiduciary duty to the partnership or to any partner but owed a duty of loyalty and a duty of care to the partnership.the trust,as limited partner,had no right to withdraw from the partnership or receive a return of contributions until the partnership was terminated,which could occur only by unanimous consent of the partners.the partnership agreement provided that in interest of the limited partners had the right to remove the general partner.a majority in interest of the limited partners had the right to elect a new general partner.
the estate filed its federal estate tax return in december.at the time of kimbell death,the value of the partnership assets was approximately million.on the return,the estate claimed a discount on the value of kimbell interest in the partnership and her interest in the llc for lack of control and lack of marketability of the partnership interest.it reported her interest in the partnership as having a fair market value of approximately million and her interest in the llc as having a fair market value of approximately.
the irs audited the estate.it found that the value of the assets transferred to the partnership and the llc,rather than kimbell interest in these entities,was includible in the gross estate under a of the internal revenue code and increased the tax due accordingly.the estate paid the additional tax and then filed for a refund,claiming that the irs overvalued kimbell interests in the partnership and the llc.
on for summary judgment,the district court found that the government had demonstrated,as a matter of law,that kimbell transfers of assets to the partnership and the llc were subject to a,which recaptures certain assets transferred prior to death in the gross estate.therefore,the district court found that the irs correctly included the value of the assets kimbell transferred to the partnership and the llc in the estate and granted partial summary judgment to the government.the estate appeals.
this court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.browning odessa,cir.
whether the assets kimbell transferred to the partnership must be recaptured into her estate for estate tax purposes depends on the application of internal revenue code section a.internal revenue code section a provides 
a general rule.the value of the gross estate shall include the value of all property to the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer except in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money worth,by trust or otherwise,under which he has retained for his life or for any period not ascertainable without reference to his death or for any period which does not in fact end before his death 
the possession or enjoyment of,or the right to the income from,the property,or 
the right,either alone or in conjunction with any person,to designate the persons who shall possess or enjoy the property or the income therefrom.
the statute recognizes that some assets transferred prior to death must be recaptured into the estate.by recapturing these transfers into the estate,this section of the code prevents the circumvention of federal estate tax by the use of inter vivos transactions which do not remove the lifetime enjoyment of property purportedly transferred by a decedent.estate of wyly commissioner,cir.regarding this provision,this court has stated 
section is part of a congressional scheme to tax the value of property transferred at death,whether the defendant accomplishes the transfer by will,by intestacy,or by allowing his substantial control over the property to remain unexercised until death so that the shifting of its economic benefits to the beneficiary only then becomes complete.

the statute provides two exceptions that will allow a transfer to escape the operation of a.first,if the transfer is a bona fide sale for full and adequate consideration,then a does not apply.see reg.a,as amended in.if the transfer is not a bona fide sale for full and adequate consideration,then the transfer may still be excluded from the estate of the decedent under the second exception,if the decedent did not retain either the possession,enjoyment or rights to the transferred property,or the right to designate the persons who would possess or enjoy the transferred property.estate of stone comm r,cch,wl a.
bona fide sale for adequate and full consideration.
the first exception allows a transfer to escape the reach of a if it is a bona fide sale for adequate and full consideration for money or money worth.a.the district court found that kimbell transfer of assets to the partnership did not qualify for this exception.relying on estate of harper comm r,wl,cch,the district court stated that the applicability of the bona fide sale exception rests on two requirements a bona fide sale,meaning an arm length transaction,and adequate and full consideration.the court defined an arm length transaction as one involving two parties who are not related or not on close terms,citing black law dictionary ed.because kimbell,or at least family members,were present on both sides of the transfer to the partnership,the district court found that the transfer was not at arm length and therefore not a bona fide sale.
the district court also found that,even if one could assume that the transfer of assets to the partnership was the result of a bona fide sale,the pro rata interest in the partnership that kimbell received was not adequate consideration for the assets she transferred to the partnership.the district court viewed the transaction as a paper transaction resulting in a mere recycling of value.in coming to this determination,the district court again relied on harper and distinguished this court decision in wheeler united states,cir.
the only case addressing the exception for a bona fide sale for full and adequate consideration in this circuit,and indeed the only appellate level case cited to us on this point,is wheeler united states,cir.in wheeler,the decedent sold a remainder interest in his ranch to his adopted sons.the sale was in return for a price based on the ranch actuarial value from the tables established in treasury regulations for valuing future interests in property where the measuring life was that of a person of the seller age.id.at.applying the bona fide sale exception of a,the executor of the decedent estate did not include the ranch in the gross estate.id.at.the internal revenue service disagreed and assessed a deficiency which the estate paid and then challenged.id.at.the government position in wheeler was that the sale of the remainder interest in the ranch to the decedent sons was part of a testamentary plan designed to reduce estate taxes.id.it argued that,although the price paid for the remainder interest was equal to the then fair market value of the ranch multiplied by the present value factor from the treasury regulations for a person of the decedent age,this price was not adequate and full consideration because it was less than the value of the full fee interest.id.
addressing the question of what constitutes adequate and full consideration,the wheeler court noted the reason the term presents such persistent conceptual difficulty is the lack of a statutory definition for the term combined with the competing interests of tax litigants.id.at.after synthesizing prior estate and gift tax cases,the court concluded that adequate and full consideration under a requires only that the sale not deplete the gross estate.id.at.
the following rule emerges unless a transfer that depletes the transferor estate is joined with a transfer that augments the estate by a commensurate monetary amount,there is no adequate and full consideration for the purposes of either the estate or gift tax.we thus come full circle to the equilibrium rule set forth in united states allen and cited in gradow.
id.at.in other words,the asset the estate receives must be roughly equivalent to the asset it gave up.
wheeler also makes it clear that whether a transaction was made for adequate and full consideration is an objective inquiry.addressing the government argument that transactions between family members should be necessarily treated differently for estate tax purposes,this court stated 
t he present transfer tax scheme eschews subjective intent determinations in favor of the objective requirements of the statute.therefore,section a permits the conclusion that a transfer was testamentary when,and if,the objective requirement that the transfer be for an adequate and full consideration is not met.section a does not,however,permit a perceived testamentary intent,ipse dixit,to determine what amount constitutes an adequate and full consideration.
id.at.the court pointed out that before its amendment in,the estate tax contained a provision recapturing into the gross estate transfers intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after the decedent death and those made in contemplation of death.id.at.after experience showed that this rule resulted in inordinate litigation by taxpayers attempting to establish life motives for transfers,the rule was eventually changed to its present form to eliminate the requirement for difficult fact findings designed to determine subjective motive.id.thus,in this circuit,since wheeler,a taxpayer testamentary or tax saving motive for a transfer alone does not trigger a recapture if objective facts demonstrate that the transfer was made for a full and adequate consideration.
wheeler also defines the requirements of a bona fide sale.after concluding that the actuarial value paid for the remainder interest was adequate and full consideration,the court stated that,once the appropriate value is paid for the property transferred,the only possible grounds for challenging the legitimacy of the transaction are whether the transferor actually parted with the interest and the transferee actually parted with the requisite adequate and full consideration.id.at.
in wheeler,the government argued that the requirement that a sale be bona fide takes on heightened significance in intrafamily transfers and this court agreed.id.at.based on this heightened scrutiny,we concluded that a court should inquire beyond the form of a transaction between family members to determine whether the substance justified the claimed tax treatment.id.however,we made it clear that just because a transaction takes place between family members does not impose an additional requirement not set forth in the statute to establish that it is bona fide.id.at.a transaction that is a bona fide sale between strangers must also be bona fide between members of the same family.in addition,the absence of negotiations between family members over price or terms is not a compelling factor in the determination as to whether a sale is bona fide,particularly when the exchange value is set by objective factors.id.at.in summary,the wheeler case directs us to examine whether the sale was,in fact a bona fide sale or was instead a disguised gift or a sham transaction.id.at.
this definition is consistent with the language of the statute and regulations.according to treasury regulations,a transaction is a bona fide sale if it is made in good faith.reg.a,a.black law dictionary defines a bona fide sale as a completed transaction in which seller makes sale in good faith,for a valuable consideration without notice of any reason against the sale.black law dictionary ed.bona fide is defined as in or with good faith honestly,openly,and sincerely without deceit or fraud and real,actual,genuine,and not feigned.id.at.
when examining a transaction to determine if it is real,actual,genuine and not feigned,we are again constrained to objective factors.as stated previously,congress eliminated the decedent subjective intent from direct consideration under a.a transaction motivated solely by tax planning with no business or corporate purpose is nothing more than a contrivance without substance that is rightly ignored for purposes of the tax computation.see gregory helvering.however,tax planning motives do not prevent a sale from being bona fide if the transaction is otherwise real,actual or genuine.wheeler,at.
in church united states,ria,wl,aff without published opinion,cir per curiam table,unpublished opinion available at cir,a mother and her children formed a texas limited partnership to consolidate their undivided interests in a family ranch.id.at.the mother and the children were limited partners and a limited liability company was the general partner.id.all parties contributed their undivided interests in the ranch to the partnership.id.the mother also contributed approximately million in securities to finance ranch operations and the purchase of interests in the ranch owned by.id.at.each partner received a interest in the partnership.id.at.under these circumstances,the court found that the character of the assets transferred to the partnership changed dramatically 
prior to its formation the several family members owned undivided interests in the ranch,with each interest carrying the right to use and enjoy the property,or force partition or possible sale.the partnership eliminated these individual rights and placed ownership of a majority of the ranch in a partnership that was not controlled by any single person.
id.at.the court also found that the partnership was created for a genuine business purpose.p reserving the family ranching business for themselves and their descendants was a valid motivating reason to form the partnership.id.at.preservation of their interests in the ranch was effectively accomplished by placing the property in the partnership which allowed division of ownership to be recognized by ownership of partnership interests rather than by direct ownership of undivided interests in the ranch.this structure also permanently consolidated operating decisions and management of the property.the court held that the property transferred to the partnership was a bona fide sale to exclude it from application of.
another case in which the transfer qualified as a bona fide sale is estate of stone comm r,cch at.in stone,the assets transferred to the several family limited partnerships were going concern businesses operated for a profit.the partnerships were formed for two main reasons as a means to currently transfer management of the parents estates to the children,who as general managers of the partnerships,began to actively manage the partnerships and to settle disputes among the children related to the operation of the businesses.the decedents retained enough assets to maintain their standard of living.id.at.the court concluded that these transfers were bona fide sales for adequate and full consideration.
other cases relied on by the government,have as a common element the conclusion that w hen a family partnership is only a vehicle for changing the form in which the decedent held his mere recycling of value the decedent receipt of a partnership interest in exchange for his testamentary assets does not qualify as a bona fide sale for adequate and full consideration because the transfer was only a paper transaction and without substance.estate of thompson comm r,cch,wl.see also estate of harper,cch estate of stangi comm r,cch,wl.however,even these cases recognize that family partnerships can qualify for this exception if the transaction includes elements that indicate that the exchange was more than a sham or a disguised gift.see harper,at this transaction involves only the genre of value recycling and does not appear to be motivated primarily by legitimate business concerns.thompson,at n one of the individual partners was involved in the conduct of an active business none of the parties involved in the partnerships joined together with the intent to either form business enterprises or otherwise to conduct any trade or business the activities of the partnership were not for business purposes.stangi,at the partnership patently fails to qualify as the sort of functioning business enterprise that could potentially inject intangibles that would lift the situation beyond mere recycling.
in summary,what is required for the transfer by kimbell to the partnership to qualify as a bona fide sale is that it be a sale in which the actually parted with her interest in the assets transferred and the actually parted with the partnership interest issued in exchange.in order for the sale to be for adequate and full consideration,the exchange of assets for partnership interests must be roughly equivalent so the transfer does not deplete the estate.in addition,when the transaction is between family members,it is subject to heightened scrutiny to insure that the sale is not a sham transaction or disguised gift.the scrutiny is limited to the examination of objective facts that would confirm or deny the taxpayer assertion that the transaction is bona fide or genuine.we now turn to the application of these principles to today case.
the district court found that the exchange of a limited partnership interest for the assets kimbell transferred to the partnership was not a bona fide sale for adequate and full consideration.it did not separately analyze the two requirements.rather it concluded that kimbell contribution of more than of the assets into the partnership to be managed as they were before the transfer by her son was nothing more than a recycling of value and the interest in the partnership kimbell received not a transfer of consideration.the government adopted that position and argues in addition that it is inconsistent for the estate to assert,on one hand,that the value of kimbell interest in the partnership is worth only of the assets she transferred as discounted for lack of control and marketability,and on the other hand claim that the partnership interest kimbell received in exchange for the assets transferred was adequate and full consideration for the transfer.
the tax court has expressly rejected the argument that a discounted valuation of a pro rata partnership interest precludes a finding that the interest is adequate consideration for the assets transferred.in estate of stone comm r,cch,the tax court held that this argument 
in effect reads out of section a the exception for a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money worth in any case where there is a bona fide,arm length transfer of property to a business entity a partnership or a corporation for which the transferor receives an interest in such entity a partnership interest or stock that is proportionate to the fair market value of the property transferred to such entity and the determination of the value of such interest takes into account appropriate discounts.
we would only add to the tax court rejection of the government inconsistency argument that it is a classic mixing of apples and oranges the government is attempting to equate the venerable willing seller test of fair market value which applies when calculating gift or estate tax with the proper test for adequate and full consideration under a.this conflation misses the mark the business decision to exchange cash or other assets for a,interest in a limited partnership involves financial considerations other than the purchaser ability to turn right around and sell the newly acquired limited partnership interest for cents on the dollar.investors who acquire such interests do so with the expectation of realizing benefits such as management expertise,security and preservation of assets,capital appreciation and avoidance of personal liability.thus there is nothing inconsistent in acknowledging,on the one hand,that the investor dollars have acquired a limited partnership interest at arm length for adequate and full consideration and,on the other hand,that the asset thus acquired has a present fair market value,immediate sale potential,of substantially less than the dollars just classic informed.
as this principle applies to wholly unrelated buyers and sellers of interests in limited partnerships,it must be equally true of buyers and sellers of such interests who happen to be related by blood or affinity,unless the evidence demonstrates the absence of good faith,a sham transaction motivated solely by tax avoid
