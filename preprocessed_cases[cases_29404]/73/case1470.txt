thomson multimedia thomson appeals from the united states court of international trade grant of summary judgment in favor of the united states.thomson multimedia united states,d.int l trade.the court granted summary judgment because it held that the harbor maintenance tax hmt,as applied to imports,was constitutional in light of both the uniformity,art.i,cl,and port preference,art.i,cl,clauses of the constitution.cf industries,cf industries appeals from a separate grant of summary judgment in favor of the united states by the court of international trade.the trial court granted summary judgment in that case because,based upon its interpretation of the uniformity and port preference clauses in thomson,the hmt as applied to domestic unloadings was also constitutional.given their interdependency,we address these two,separate appeals in a single decision.because we hold that the hmt as applied to imports and domestic unloadings is a user fee rather than a tax and because we hold that the various exemptions in the hmt do not violate the port preference clause of the constitution,we affirm the court of international trade decisions in both cases.
background 
the hmt was enacted as part of the water resources development act of wrda,stat.congress intended the hmt to help finance the general maintenance and improvement of ports in the united states,at,reprinted in.the hmt imposes an ad valorem charge of percent of the value of the commercial cargo involved in any port use.b.the statute defines the term port as any channel or harbor or component thereof in the united states,which i is not an inland waterway,and ii is open to public navigation.id.a a see also id.a b c.the statute defines port use as,in the case of imports and domestic shipments,the unloading of commercial cargo from,a commercial vessel at a port.id.a b see also id.c.the statute sorts commercial cargo into three categories cargo entering the united states,imports cargo to be exported from the united states,exports and any other case,domestic cargo.id.c.a separate statute establishes the harbor maintenance trust fund hmt fund for revenue raised by the hmt to be expended on the operation and maintenance of channels and harbors.id.
importantly for these appeals,the hmt contains several implicit and explicit exemptions.first,the statute effectively exempts inland waterway s from hmt liability by excluding them from the statute definition of port.a a ii.second,the statute effectively exempts from the hmt part of the columbia river by including channels of that river only up to the downstream side of bonneville lock and dam.id.a c.third,the statute explicitly exempts from the hmt domestic cargo excluding crude oil either unloaded in hawaii,alaska,or possessions or unloaded in the continental united states and shipped from alaska,hawaii,or a possession.id.b.
in the trial court,the two challenged the hmt as applied to domestic unloadings and imports.thomson is an importer of consumer electronic products and pays over million per year in hmts.thomson argued the hmt is unconstitutional because the unconstitutional export provision is not severable from the rest of the statute it violates the uniformity clause of the constitution because it causes a geographical bias by exempting alaska and hawaii,a mile segment of the columbia river,and inland waterways and it violates the port preference clause of the constitution by exempting alaska and hawaii,a mile segment of the columbia river,and inland waterways.
cf industries is a domestic shipper of phosphate fertilizer that paid a total of in hmts from december to june.cf industries argues only that the hmt as applied to domestic unloadings violates both the uniformity and port preference clauses of the constitution because it exempts domestic unloadings of cargo in alaska and hawaii.
the court of international trade dealt with these issues in its thomson opinion granting summary judgment in favor of the government.at.first,it held that the import clause was severable from the hmt on exports because the federal circuit has specifically held that the unconstitutional export provision in the hmt is severable from the remainder of the statute.id.at quoting amoco oil united states,see also princess cruises,united states,carnival cruise lines,united states.second,the trial court held the hmt as applied to imports was a tax rather than a user fee based upon its decision in united states shoe united states.int l trade holding the hmt as applied to exports was a tax because it did not satisfy the second and third prongs of the test established in massachusetts united states,d.third,the trial court interpreted both the uniformity and port preference clauses of the constitution as prohibiting only geographic or port distinctions effectively designed to promote state versus state or region versus region favoritism or discrimination.thomson,d at.as such,the court held the exemptions at issue did not violate either clause because the alaska and hawaii exemptions were narrowly tailored attempts by congress to address the geographically isolated problem of those two places being heavily dependent on ocean transportation for domestic consumption the columbia river exemption was more likely an oversight or a simple geographic distinction between inland waterways and ports and there was no evidence of actual benefit to the exempted ports the exemption of the inland waterway ports did not indicate any state or regional discrimination.subsequently,the court of international trade applied these holdings to cf industries and granted summary judgment in favor of the government.cf,united states.trade lexis,at.int l trade.
on appeal,thomson challenges each holding of the trial court except for the holding that the hmt was a tax and cf industries challenges the court holding that the alaska and hawaii domestic exemptions do not violate the uniformity or port preference clause.the government supports the trial court rulings and also argues that the hmt is a user fee rather than a tax.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
we review the court of international trade grant of summary judgment and conclusion of the constitutionality of the hmt de novo.princess,at.we also review the interpretation of a statute,including questions of severability,de novo.id.
the trial court held that the import and domestic unloading portions of the hmt were severable from the unconstitutional export provision.thomson,d at citing amoco oil,at princess,at carnival,at.thomson argues that the prior decisions holding the hmt severable should not be treated as binding precedent because the panel s in princess and carnival relied upon an observation that the world trade organization wto had not taken final action on whether the states shoe hmt on imports and not exports violated international agreements.because the executive branch had already conceded in the wto that there was a violation,thomson argues,the basis for the panels decisions was wrong.we disagree with thomson and hold that our decisions in princess and carnival are binding precedent on this panel.
contrary to thomson argument,our prior decisions did not turn on the wto position on the hmt as applied to imports.those decisions relied,instead,on the presence of a severability clause in the wrda of which the hmt was a part and the fact that the legislative history of the statute does not show that congress would not have imposed the hmt without applying it to exports.carnival,at.indeed,in dismissing the specific argument that congress did not intend to make the application of the hmt to exports severable from the hmt as applied to imports because of possible conflicts,this court first noted that,in a different case,the court of international trade had found the legislative history on point insufficient to rebut the strong presumption of severability.id.at citing amoco oil united states,d.int l trade.further,the court noted that if the wto were to take final formal action against the import portion of the hmt and the result were to create serious problems,either the executive or the legislative branch presumably will take appropriate action.id.this latter statement makes evident the court view that subsequent action by the wto is irrelevant to the question of whether congress would have enacted only the import provision,because the action by the wto could only take place after congress enacted the provision.in short,we are bound by our precedent in carnival to hold that the export provision of the hmt is severable from the remaining provisions of the statute.
the trial court held that the hmt as to imports and domestic unloadings is a tax rather than a user fee.thomson,d at.the court applied the test prescribed by the supreme court in massachusetts united states,d the charge must not discriminate against the interest the implementing authority must base the charge upon a fair approximation of the use of some system and the charge must be structured to produce revenue fairly apportioned to the total cost to the government of the benefits conferred.thomson,d at citing massachusetts,at.the trial court held that the hmt,as applied to imports and domestic unloadings,failed the second and third prongs,relying entirely on the court prior analysis of the hmt as applied to exports in united states shoe united states.int l trade,aff,aff,d.thomson,d at.in that case the trial court held that the hmt failed the second prong because bulk importers use ports more,but pay less than importers and failed the third prong because the hmt is used to fund projects yet to be commenced,rather than repay the government for services rendered.united states shoe.at.
on appeal the government argues that the trial court reliance on united states shoe was misplaced,as the standard and the analysis involving the export clause of the constitution is far stricter than that involved in the uniformity clause because of the different clauses at issue,and,consequently,the different standards applicable,the government argues that the hmt as applied to imports and domestic unloadings is a user fee.we agree.
in united states shoe this court applied the massachusetts test to hold that the hmt as applied to exports is not based on a fair approximation of use and,as such,is not a permissible user fee.united states shoe,at.in doing so,this court distinguished united states sperry,d holding that a fee of of all awards recovered from the states claims tribunal was a valid user fee,based upon the fact that sperry did not deal with a challenge under the export clause.united states shoe,at.indeed,this court specifically noted that the supreme court viewed the inquiry under the export clause as very strict.id.at citing united states int l bus.mach,d the text of the export clause,on the other hand,expressly prohibits congress from laying any tax or duty on exports.
the importance of the strictness of the export clause inquiry was confirmed by the supreme court affirmance in united states shoe.in affirming that decision,the court noted ibm plainly stated that the export clause simple,direct,unqualified prohibition on any taxes or duties distinguishes it from other constitutional limitations on governmental taxing authority.united states shoe,at.the supreme court distinguished three other supreme court cases upholding ad valorem charges as user fees solely because t hose decisions involved constitutional provisions other than the export clause.id.in addition,the supreme court did not even apply the massachusetts test and instead relied on a different,more stringent standard specific to the export clause.id.at.applying the test announced in pace burgess.in sum,the supreme court opinion not only makes clear the importance of the strictness of the export clause to its decision,it implicitly rejects this court analysis under the massachusetts test.
now we must analyze the hmt,as applied to imports and domestic shipping under the more flexible massachusetts test.we first note that although many of the indicia point to the hmt as being a tax,congress seemingly intended the hmt to be a user fee.united states shoe,at mayer,dissenting citing and quoting multiple sources of legislative history,at,reprinted in,the taxes and fees in this legislation are not for the purpose of raising revenue.rather,they are to repay costs related directly to the servicing of commerce.these fees and taxes offset services rendered to vessels.
the first prong of the massachusetts test asks whether the charge unfairly discriminates against the interest implicated by the charge.at.neither appellant makes any argument under this prong,but we address it briefly.in this case,the only possible constitutional interests implicated are those embodied in the uniformity and port preference clauses.the charge itself,however,implicates is only the exemptions in the hmt that possibly implicate either clause.that being the case,we do not see how the charge could be viewed as discriminating against any interest associated with either clause.
the second prong asks whether the charge is a fair approximation of the importers and domestic shippers use of united states harbors and ports.id.appellants argue that the hmt as applied to imports and domestic unloadings does not correlate reliably with the federal harbor services used or usable.united states shoe,at.appellants point us to the arguments embraced by this court in united states shoe,where the appellant in that case argued 
t he amount of the hmt has no relationship to the size or weight of the vessel or the necessary depth of the port required by the vessel e ven though the bulk cargo exporters generally require a larger vessel and a deeper port,and therefore use the port to a greater extent,they pay a lower tax than high value,low bulk cargo exporters.moreover,a ship that docks but does not load or unload cargo is not required to pay a fee,even though that ship otherwise utilizes the port.additionally,there is apparently no correlation between the amount of fees collected at a particular port and the expenditure of funds from the trust fund to maintain that particular port finally,it is not consistent with a true user fee that so many users are exempted,such as those carrying bunker fuel,ship stores,equipment necessary for the operation of the vessel and fish and other aquatic animal life not previously landed on shore,since ships carrying these products use the port facilities to the same extent as ships carrying products subject to the hmt.
at citations omitted.as noted above,because the cases show that ad valorem charges are generally upheld in contexts outside of the export clause and because this court prior analysis depended upon the strictness of the inquiry in the export clause context,we disagree with appellants,and hold that the hmt as applied to imports and domestic unloadings is a fair approximation of the use of the ports.
to satisfy the second prong of the massachusetts test,a user fee must only reflect a fair,if imperfect,approximation of the use of facilities for whose benefit they are imposed.airport auth.dist.delta airlines,d.user fees need not be precisely calibrated to the use that a party makes of government services.sperry,at.indeed,when the federal government applies user charges to a large number of parties,it probably will charge a user more or less than it would under a perfect system.id.at.nonetheless,the supreme court has declined to impose a requirement that the government give weight to every factor affecting appropriate compensation for the corresponding use.id.quoting massachusetts,at.in addition,the supreme court has considered the administrative costs associated with a corresponding increase in the closeness of the approximation of use.massachusetts,at.capitol greyhound lines brice.each additional factor adds to administrative burdens of enforcement we have recognized that such burdens may be sufficient to justify ignoring key factors,although the result may be a tax which on its face appears to bear with unequal weight upon different carriers.citations omitted.
applying those standards,we hold that the hmt ad valorem charge is based upon a fair approximation of the cost of the benefits provided for port users.although imperfect in its application,congress rationally determined
