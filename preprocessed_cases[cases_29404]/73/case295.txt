appellants john saybolt and kenneth welch were convicted of crimes stemming from their participation in a conspiracy to file multiple false,fictitious,or fraudulent claims with the internal revenue service irs,in violation of,and.on appeal,both challenge the district court failure to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that it did not allege materiality,which they argue is an essential element of both sections and.welch also asserts that the district court committed reversible error by not instructing the jury on materiality.based on our reading of the statutory language and the relevant case law,we hold that materiality is an essential element of the charged section offense,but is not required to show a section violation.nevertheless,we will affirm appellants convictions and sentences because the indictment sufficiently alleged facts that warrant an inference of materiality,and the deficiency in the jury instructions was harmless error 
on october,a grand jury indicted welch and saybolt on one count each of conspiring to defraud the united states by obtaining and aiding others to obtain the payment of false,fictitious,and fraudulent tax refunds,in violation of,and counts each of making and presenting,and aiding and abetting the making and presenting of,false,fictitious,and fraudulent tax returns to the irs,in violation of and.the indictment alleged that,from to,welch and saybolt filed tax returns that falsely claimed refunds for excess federal wage withholdings and excise taxes on gasoline use in fake farming and fishing businesses.welch and saybolt also allegedly solicited and obtained from third parties the identification information necessary to file the included names,addresses,dates of birth,and social security exchange for some or all of the proceeds from the refund checks.all tolled,welch and saybolt allegedly claimed about in undeserved refunds for individuals and entities from pennsylvania,ohio,massachusetts,and new york,of which the irs paid approximately.
before trial,saybolt filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for failing to charge materiality as an element of the alleged violations of sections and.the district court denied saybolt motion,holding that following neder united states,d,and united states wells,d,sections and neither explicitly nor implicitly included materiality as an element of the offense.focusing its analysis on section,the court pointed out that while neder and wells conclude d that fraud crimes include an implied element of materiality,the statute prohibits making a claim knowing such claim to be false,fictitious or fraudulent.the court reasoned that the disjunctive connector gave the government the option of charging prohibited acts that both included or presenting fraudulent those that did or presenting false and fictitious claims.accordingly,the district court concluded that materiality was not an essential element of either sections or.
on january,the appellants joint jury trial began.during the trial,the government adduced evidence that in the appellants met each other when they were both incarcerated in the same pennsylvania prison.while in prison,welch recruited other prisoners to participate in a scheme to file false tax returns.after he was released,saybolt obtained names and identifying information from individuals by promising that he could get them money with that information.welch then prepared the false tax returns using the information that saybolt obtained.these returns either claimed that the individual was entitled to a refund for excess federal wage withholdings,or that the individual was a fisherman entitled to a credit for federal taxes paid on fuel used for business.when the irs issued a refund check,saybolt would split the proceeds into thirds to the individual providing the identifying information,to welch,and for himself.
before the end of the trial,the court,upon the government motion,dismissed six of the counts alleging violations of sections and against saybolt.the court also denied the appellants request to instruct the jury that materiality was a required element of all the offenses charged.
the jury found the appellants guilty of all remaining charges.after the jury verdict,welch filed a motion for a new trial and motion to arrest judgment that,inter alia,joined,for the first time,in saybolt pretrial argument that the indictment was insufficient in failing to allege materiality.the district court denied welch motion,dismissing welch challenge to the indictment for the same reasons it rejected saybolt.
the court sentenced saybolt to months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release,and ordered him to pay a special assessment,fine,and in restitution.the court sentenced welch to months of imprisonment and years of supervised release,and ordered him to pay a special assessment and in restitution.the appellants filed timely appeals.
the district court had jurisdiction under,and we have jurisdiction under and.our review of both the sufficiency of the indictment and the district court failure to instruct the jury on materiality is plenary.united states yusuf,cir the sufficiency of an indictment to charge an offense is a legal question subject to plenary review.quoting united states conley,cir united states tupone,cir because the defendant challenge to the jury instructions turns on a matter of statutory interpretation,our review is plenary as to that issue.
the appellants challenge to the sufficiency of the indictment and welch jury instruction claim share one common issue whether violations of sections and always require proof of materiality.accordingly,we begin our analysis with a review of the two statutes.
w e first look to the text of the statutes at issue to discern whether they require a showing of materiality.neder united states,d.all parties agree that neither sections nor explicitly mentions materiality.but w here congress uses terms that have accumulated settled meaning under the common law,a court must infer,unless the statute otherwise dictates,that congress means to incorporate the established meaning of these terms.id.at.quoting nationwide mut.ins.darden,d.at this point in our analysis,two supreme court cases are of particular relevance in neder,the court held that the common law could not have conceived of fraud without proof of materiality,id.at.and in united states wells,d,the court determined that the term false statement did not have a settled common law meaning that required proof of materiality,see id.at.see also neder,at.t he term false statement does not imply a materiality requirement citing wells,at.
section provides 
whoever makes or presents to any person or officer in the civil,military,or naval service of the united states,or to any department or agency thereof,any claim upon or against the united states,or any department or agency thereof,knowing such claim to be false,fictitious,or fraudulent,shall be imprisoned not more than five years and shall be subject to a fine in the amount provided in this title.
all parties agree that,following neder and wells,section inclusion of the term fraudulent suggests the incorporation of a materiality requirement.the parties disagree,however,on the extent of such an incorporation.
according to the government,the use of the disjunctive connector or between the terms false,fictitious,and fraudulent compels one conclusion proof of materiality is not always necessary to establish a section violation.we agree.canons of construction ordinarily suggest that terms connected by a disjunctive be given separate meanings unless the context dictates otherwise reiter sonotone,d.here,section connects the terms false,fictitious,and fraudulent with the disjunctive or.giving these terms separate meanings,we read section to demand a showing that the claim was known to be either fraudulent,which would require proof of materiality,or false or fictitious,which would not require proof of materiality.this means that proof of materiality is not always required to establish a section violation.
our reading of section is consistent with the supreme court interpretation of the phrase false or fraudulent used in other statutes.in neder,the government argued that the presence of the term material in some federal fraud statutes but not others indicated that materiality should not be implied where the term was absent.at.specifically,it pointed to a a,which prohibit s the furnishing of false or fraudulent material information in documents required under federal drug laws and a a,which criminaliz es the making of a statement regarding investment tax benefits that an individual knows or has reason to kno w is false or fraudulent as to any material matter.id.the court noted that those two statutes prohibit both false and fraudulent statements or information.id.it then remarked that b ecause the term false statements does not imply a materiality requirement the word material limits the statutes scope to material falsehoods.id.internal citation omitted.
the neder court comments indicate that it read the phrase false or fraudulent in a way that gave the two disjunctively connected terms separate meanings.if,as the appellants suggest,the use of the phrase false or fraudulent were sufficient,by itself,to always require proof of materiality,then the neder court statement that the word material limits the statutes scope to material falsehoods would be nonsensical the scope of the statutes mentioned in neder already would be implicitly limited to material falsehood even without the word material.therefore,in neder,the court must have given the disjunctively connected terms false and fraudulent separate meanings.such a reading is consistent with our reading of the similar false,fictitious,or fraudulent language found in section.
the appellants rely on legislative history to show that section always requires proof of materiality.but we look to legislative history only if the text is ambiguous.in re mehta,cir see also united states knox,cir i f the statutory language is clear,it is not necessary to glean congressional intent from legislative history.here,we see no textual ambiguity,nor have the appellants identified any 
accordingly,resort to legislative history is inappropriate 
in conclusion,section clear and unambiguous text is dispositive because the terms false,fictitious,and fraudulent are connected with the disjunctive or,the terms must be given separate meaning and thus,proof of materiality is not necessary to establish a violation of section.
according to section 
whoever enters into any agreement,combination,or conspiracy to defraud the united states,or any department or agency thereof,by obtaining or aiding to obtain the payment or allowance of any false,fictitious or fraudulent claim,shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years,or both.
the appellants argue that since section expressly provides that the conspiracy must be to defraud,proof of materiality is required to establish a section violation clearly,section does not require proof that any material falsehoods were actually made or presented.t he common law understanding of conspiracy does not make the doing of any act other than the act of conspiring a condition of liability.united states shabani,d quoting nash united states.nor does section text require any proof of overt acts.accordingly,section does not require proof that the participants actually made or presented any falsehoods,let alone any material ones.id.at.a bsent contrary indications,congress intends to adopt the common law definition of statutory terms.
nonetheless,section specifies that only conspiracies with a particular purpose are criminal under the statute the conspiracy must be to defraud.following neder and wells,we must presume that congress incorporated a materiality requirement when it used the term defraud.but the government argues that no such materiality element is necessary because section describes the means through which the conspiracy to defraud must be accomplished.according to the government,since the intended fraud can be accomplished through the use of any false,fictitious or fraudulent claim,materiality can not be a required element.the government asserts that if materiality were required,false and fictitious would be rendered surplusage.we disagree.
the government is correct that subsequent terms used in the statute can unmoor defraud from its settled common law meaning.indeed,we infer the incorporation of established common law meanings unless the statute otherwise dictates.neder,at.internal quotations and citation omitted.the supreme court interpretation of is instructive.section criminalizes conspir acies to defraud the united states in any manner or for any purpose.although it uses the term defraud,the court has held that the statute is not confined to fraud as that term has been defined in the common law.dennis united states,d.instead,i t reaches any conspiracy for the purpose of impairing,obstructing,or defeating the lawful function of any department of government.id.quoting haas henkel.thus,the meaning of defraud must be interpreted in the context of the particular statute that uses the term.united states menon,cir.
nevertheless,the government focus on the phrase false,fictitious or fraudulent claims is incomplete it ignores that a section conspiracy to defraud must be to obtain or aid to obtain the payment or allowance of such claims.because the purpose of a section conspiracy must be to obtain payment of a claim,the conspirators must understand,at least implicitly,that the methods of accomplishing the fraud are capable of causing the payment of a claim where,as here,the alleged conspiracy involves the making of false statements or representations,the conspirators must have agreed to make statements or representations that would influence the government decision on whether to pay a claim.such statements or representations are,by definition,material.see wells,at.understanding materiality to mean hav ing a natural tendency to influence,or being capable of influencing,the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed quoting kungys united states,d see also restatement second of torts accordingly,where the government alleges that the conspirators agreed to make false statements and representations as part of the conspiracy to defraud,section requires proof that the conspirators agreed that those statements or representations would have a material effect on the government decision to pay a false,fictitious,or fraudulent claim 
our reading is consistent with the supreme court interpretation of a similarly worded statute that was at issue in allison engine company,united states ex rel.sanders,d.there,the court reviewed a provision in the false claims act that imposed civil liability on any person who conspires to defraud the government by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid.a,amended by fraud enforcement and recovery act of,a,stat.the court pointed out that where it was alleged that the conspirators agreed to make a false record or statement,it must be shown that the conspirators had the purpose of getting the false record or statement to bring about the government payment of a false or fraudulent claim.at.this meant that it must be established that the conspirators agreed that the false record or statement would have a material effect on the government decision to pay the false or fraudulent claim.id.at.
here,section language concerning the purpose of the prohibited conspiracy to defraud closely resembles that of the statute analyzed in allison engine.compare b y obtaining or aiding to obtain the payment or allowance of any false,fictitious or fraudulent claim,with a b y getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid.the term obtain is synonymous with get,webster third new int l dictionary see also id.at listing get as a synonym of obtain,so we see no substantive difference between the phrases obtaining payment or allowance of any false,fictitious or fraudulent claim and getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid.thus,we read section in a manner consistent with allison engine where it is alleged that the conspirators agreed to make false statements or representations as part of the conspiracy to defraud,it must be established that the conspirators agreed
