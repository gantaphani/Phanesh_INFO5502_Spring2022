the department argues the agreements are not enforceable obligations because the definition specifically excludes agreements between former redevelopment agencies and sponsoring entities,subd.d.the department asserts that the statutory power of an oversight board to authorize a successor agency to reenter into this type of agreement is contrary to legislative intent,and to june legislation.we disagree and shall affirm the trial court judgment and writ directing the department to treat two county redevelopment agency agreements as enforceable obligations.
factual and procedural background 
this case turns on the legal issue of statutory interpretation.consequently,even though the parties have supplied an exhaustive account of the nature of the projects that underlie the challenged reentry agreements and the path their dispute has taken on the way to the courthouse,the specific underlying facts are mostly immaterial.
in january,the sonoma redevelopment agency and sonoma entered into agreements under which the sonoma redevelopment agency agreed to fund the acquisition of a former shopping center for redevelopment including the cleanup of toxic wastes,and improvements to state highway.in january,sonoma adopted a resolution to accept the role of successor agency to the sonoma redevelopment agency.in march,sonoma oversight board adopted a resolution that authorized sonoma to reenter into these agreements.it found these were in the best interests of the county taxing entities because they would both ameliorate adverse conditions in the project areas and result in increased property values in surrounding areas sonoma executed reentry agreements for the two projects effective as of the date of the oversight board resolution.
in february,sonoma prepared a recognized obligation payment schedule rops for the period of january to june that included the two projects in items as enforceable obligations of the sonoma redevelopment agency.the oversight board march resolution had approved this rops rops i.sonoma transmitted copies of rops i to the department,subd.l b,subd.g.the department asserted its authority,subd.h to review one or more items,after which it disallowed inter alia items and as contracts between a former redevelopment agency and its sponsoring entity.the department thereafter also disallowed inclusion of the two projects as enforceable obligations and in the approved rops for the period of july to december rops ii for the same reason.
this brings us to the rops at issue for the period of january to june rops iii,approved in august,which yet again included the two projects as enforceable obligations and.the department eventually disallowed them one more time in december,expanding upon its previous rationale it recognized that oversight boards had statutory authorization to approve a reentry agreement with a sponsoring entity as an enforceable obligation,but the department asserted that the definition of enforceable obligations in section did not itself expressly include reentry agreements,and sections and did not expressly contain a notwithstand reference to section.
sonoma filed its petition for writ of mandate in january.it sought a declaration that the two projects were enforceable obligations and a writ of mandate directing the department to approve their inclusion in rops iii.sonoma also sought a ruling that it was entitled to reimbursement for the department incorrect classification of certain expenditures as administrative expenses incurred in connection with the rops iii,and for a payment of million rounded that its assessed against it in july pursuant to section which subjects tax increments distributed solely to former redevelopment agencies prior to the effective date of the great dissolution legislation to the distribution mechanism of section,which sonoma had paid under protest.the trial court found the two agreements were enforceable obligations.it also concluded that sonoma failed to satisfy its burden of proof in its challenge to the designation of the expenses as administrative a ruling not at issue on appeal,and the payment while valid another ruling not at issue on appeal required recomputation of the total assessment in order to deduct the amount that was attributable to these additional enforceable obligations the trial court directing the department to reimburse the amount in adjustments to future rops.

the exclusion of agreements between the former redevelopment agencies and their sponsors in the definition of enforceable obligations,subd.d also listing exceptions not relevant in the present case and the express legislative invalidation of these agreements,subds.a b latter also including exceptions not relevant in the present case reflect legislative recognition that often these agreements were not the product of arm length negotiations because the two bodies had conjoined membership that was not reflective of the interests of the other taxing entities.matosantos,supra,cal th at,fn,d.from this premise,the department argues that an interpretation of the version of sections and see chapter,that would allow the reentry agreements to become enforceable obligations with the permission of an oversight board is contrary to the overall intent behind the great dissolution legislation 
this type of legislative spirit interpretation is not well taken.n o legislation pursues its purposes at all costs.deciding what competing values will or will not be sacrificed to the achievement of a particular objective is the very essence of legislative choice and it frustrates rather than effectuates legislative intent simplistically to assume that whatever furthers the statute primary objective must be the law.where,as here,the language of a provision is sufficiently clear in its context and not at odds with the legislative history,we should not examine the additional considerations of policy that may have influenced the lawmakers in their formulation of the statute.rodriguez united states,d,accord,foster workers comp.appeals bd.th,d purpose of law can not supplant legislative intent expressed in particular statute.
