specifically,mcn filed suit against both otc and its tax commissioners,the latter in their official capacities the individual defendants are sued in their official capacities as officers of the otc charged with enforcement of oklahoma tax laws.mcn asserted jurisdiction under,which provides the district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions,brought by any indian tribe wherein the matter in controversy arises under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.at the outset of its amended complaint,mcn complains of defendants for causing plaintiff trucks to be illegally stopped,illegally searched,and for illegally seizing plaintiff property.consistent therewith,count i of mcn amended complaint only substantively labeled a violation of mcn civil rights pursuant to,specifically that otc and its commissioners conduct denied mcn due process of law and deprived mcn of rights protected by the fourth and fourteenth amendment to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.the remaining counts of mcn amended complaint sought only remedial relief and were so labeled.count ii sought a declaratory judgment that otc stops and searches of mcn vehicles and seizures of their lading were unlawful.count iii sought a prohibitory injunction directing otc to cease interfering with mcn vehicles and their lading.count iv requested mandatory injunctive relief directing the return of the seized cigarettes.count v,in the alternative,sought damages to compensate mcn for the monetary value of the cigarettes.
in a thorough order,the district court granted otc and its commissioners rule b motion and dismissed mcn amended complaint in its entirety.as to otc,the court dismissed the complaint for want of subject matter jurisdiction based on otc defense of sovereign immunity.see republic of austria altmann,recognizing a claim of sovereign immunity raises a jurisdictional defense.the court rejected mcn argument that in enacting congress abrogated otc eleventh amendment immunity.as to mcn official capacity suit against the commissioners,the district court concluded that,despite the eleventh amendment bar,it possessed subject matter jurisdiction under the fiction of ex parte young,but only to the extent that counts ii and iii of mcn amended complaint sought prospective relief in the form of a declaratory judgment and prohibitory injunction.the court held,however,that such relief was unavailable to mcn because its claim,upon which those and all other counts depended,failed to state a cause of action.the court reasoned that because mcn claim to relief as alleged in the complaint depended on its sovereign status,mcn did not constitute a person entitled to maintain suit under.

the supreme court has interpreted the eleventh amendment to mean states may not be sued in federal court unless they consent to it in unequivocal terms or unless congress,pursuant to a valid exercise of power,unequivocally expresses its intent to abrogate the immunity.green mansour.this prohibition encompasses suits against state agencies.see puerto rico aqueduct and sewer auth.metcalf eddy.suits against state officials acting in their official capacities similarly fall within the amendment proscription because a suit against a state official in his or her official capacity is no different than a suit against the state itself.will.of state police.because does not abrogate a state sovereign immunity,see quern jordan,and oklahoma has not consented to mcn suit against otc and its commissioners in their official capacities,we first address whether mcn can establish that congress abrogated otc and its commissioners immunity through enactment of see sydnes united states,cir noting the party asserting jurisdiction has the burden of overcoming a sovereign immunity defense 
in blatchford native village,the supreme court held did not foreclose a state official sovereign immunity defense to a tribe suit challenging implementation of a state statute.the court opined that does not reflect an unmistakably clear intent to abrogate immunity,made plain in the language of the statute.blatchford,at internal quotations omitted.and the fact that congress grants jurisdiction to hear a claim does not suffice to show congress has abrogated all defenses to that claim.id.at emphasis omitted.the court further rejected the proposition that represents not an abrogation of the state sovereign immunity,but rather a delegation to tribes of the federal government exemption from state sovereign immunity.id.at emphasis omitted.the court reasoned assuming that delegation of exemption from state sovereign immunity is theoretically possible,there is no reason to believe that congress in enacting ever contemplated such a strange notion.id.at.mcn all but ignores blatchford only mentioning it in passing in its reply brief,and instead relies on our decision in sac fox nation pierce,cir,to support its argument that the eleventh amendment does not proscribe this action against otc and its commissioners.mcn,however,reads pierce far too broadly and fails to account for the substantial narrowing effect blatchford has upon our holding in that case.
in pierce,we relied on the supreme court decision in moe confederated salish kootenai tribes,a case involving an indian tribe access to federal court for the purpose of obtaining injunctive relief from state taxation,to hold the eleventh amendment did not bar an indian tribe suit against a state official to enjoin the state of kansas from collecting taxes on motor fuel distributed to the tribes retail stations within indian country.pierce,at quoting blatchford,at see also winnebago tribe stovall,cir relying on pierce to hold the eleventh amendment did not bar a tribe suit against a state official to enjoin a fuel tax assessment on a corporation owned by the tribe and transacting business within indian country.most certainly,blatchford noted the jurisdictional defense of eleventh amendment immunity was not at issue in moe,and moe did not hold that eliminated the constitutional bar of sovereign immunity.blatchford,at.rather,in moe the state of montana posed only the tax injunction act as a jurisdictional defense to the complaint.see.blatchford pointed out that a willingness to eliminate a congressional obstacle to suit in no way bespeaks a willingness to eliminate a constitutional impediment to suit.blatchford,at.nonetheless,in analyzing,the court in moe reasoned that congress contemplated that a tribe access to federal court to litigate a matter arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties would be at least in some respects as broad as that of the united states suing as the tribe trustee.moe,at.the court based its view on the legislative history of in which the house judiciary committee characterized as providing the means whereby the tribes are assured of the same judicial determination whether the action is brought in their behalf by the government or by their own attorneys.id.at quoting,reprinted in.
plainly,sovereign immunity would not have barred the united states acting as the tribe trustee from suing pierce in her official capacity,the equivalent of suing the state itself.see united states mississippi,recognizing the eleventh amendment does not bar the united states from suing a state.reason suggested that neither should sovereign immunity bar the tribe from suing pierce if,as moe said,the tribe at least in some respects was assured of the same judicial determination when suing on its own behalf under.moe,at.cardinal to our decision in pierce was blatchford observation that t he respect at issue in moe was access to federal court for the purpose of obtaining injunctive relief from state taxation the very respect at issue in pierce.blatchford,at emphasis added.based on the sweep of moe language in respect to a tribe suit to enjoin state taxation within indian country,we opined surely if an indian tribe may maintain suit on its own behalf in federal court to enjoin collection of a state cigarette sales tax,it may maintain a similar suit on its own behalf to enjoin collection of a state motor fuel distribution tax.pierce,at.but that is as far as pierce went.
neither moe nor pierce may be read to stand for the proposition that provides an indian tribe access to federal court identical to that of the united states in all respects.blatchford makes this painfully apparent.see osage nation oklahoma ex rel.oklahoma tax comm n,wl,at cir unpublished pierce certainly recognized that providing the tribe access to federal court via to seek injunctive relief from state taxation within indian country was consonant not only with moe,but also with the supreme court unique indian tax immunity jurisprudence,a jurisprudence that relies heavily on the doctrine of tribal sovereignty which historically gave state law no role to play within a tribe territorial boundaries.wagnon prairie band potawatomi nation,emphasis added internal quotations and ellipses omitted.but neither moe nor pierce purported to say that equated tribal access with the united states access generally,but only at least in some respects.blatchford,at.mcn urges us,in effect,to eliminate this limitation utterly.id.even if we were so inclined,we are powerless to do so given blatchford 
our decision in pierce simply does not apply here because mcn amended complaint,even under a generous reading,does not seek to enjoin state taxation within the tribe territorial boundaries.wagnon,at.rather,mcn amended complaint seeks ultimately to impugn,as contrary to the fourth amendment,otc stops and searches of mcn vehicles and seizures of their lading outside the tribe territorial boundaries.mcn amended complaint most assuredly does not request the district court to adjudicate the validity of oklahoma cigarette tax as applied to mcn lading paragraph of the amended complaint states but a truism the nation right to engage in indian commerce includes purchasing tobacco products manufactured by indian tribes in indian country that are then transported to the nation indian country.paragraph then claims nothing less for mcn outside indian country than a blanket exemption from oklahoma cigarette tax enforcement scheme because t obacco products being moved between the nation indian country are not subject to state taxation nor properly considered as contraband.paragraph posits the otc attempt to exercise taxing and civil authority against the nation violates the nation sovereign immunity and impermissibly burdens indian commerce in violation of the constitution.all this adds up to the gravamen of mcn amended complaint,namely mcn fourth amendment claim that otc and its commissioners are acting unreasonably in interfering with mcn vehicles while those vehicles are in transit between indian country.paragraphs and,a part of the declaratory judgment and prohibitory injunction counts respectively,assert otc can not lawfully stop vehicles owned by the nation without probable cause to believe a crime has been committed nor search the nation property without a search warrant or permission of the nation,nor seize the nation property while traveling in indian commerce.emphasis added.
though mcn pleading is hardly a model of clarity,its theory of the case as set out within the four corners of its amended complaint is,as best we can discern,this cigarettes in transit between indian country are not subject to the state of oklahoma tax enforcement scheme because that scheme interferes with indian commerce therefore otc searches of mcn vehicles and seizures of their lading absent probable cause constitute a violation of the fourth amendment reasonableness requirement redressable pursuant to.mcn,in effect,seeks to render nugatory,via the fourth amendment,the state cigarette tax enforcement scheme as an affront to indian sovereignty.this is precisely what mcn tells us on page fifteen of its opening brief 
as the amended complaint makes clear,this is not just an action seeking to enjoin the state from civil rights violations,but also an action to enjoin the state from continuing its tax scheme which seeks to impose a tax on the creeks by simply seizing creek property.such stops,searches,and seizures unduly burden indian commerce and wrongfully interfere with the creek sovereignty.
but mcn approach sounds the death knell of mcn amended complaint as to otc and its commissioners sued in their official capacities because blatchford tells us does not constitute a general waiver of the state of oklahoma sovereign immunity and any limited waiver based on pierce does not extend beyond an indian tribe direct challenge,sufficiently alleged in a complaint,to the imposition of a state tax within indian country.the district court was quite correct in deciding the eleventh amendment bars mcn action against otc and its commissioners sued in their official capacities.that is the end of our jurisdictional inquiry as to otc.see seminole tribe florida,for over a century we have reaffirmed that federal jurisdiction over suits against unconsenting states was not contemplated by the constitution when establishing the judicial power of the united states.internal quotations omitted.as to otc tax commissioners,however,we must look beyond the foregoing eleventh amendment analysis to determine whether the fiction first recognized in ex parte young,serves,at least for the moment,to salvage any aspect of mcn suit.
in young,the supreme court held the eleventh amendment did not bar an action by railroad stockholders against a state attorney general sued in his official capacity to enjoin an ongoing violation of federal law 
if the act which the state official seeks to enforce be a violation of the federal constitution,the officer in proceeding under such enactment comes into conflict with the superior authority of that constitution,and he is in that case stripped of his official or representative character and is subjected in his person to the consequences of his individual conduct.the state has no power to impart to him any immunity from responsibility to the supreme authority of the united states.
young,at.in hill kemp,cir,we carefully considered the rationale behind and subsequent history of young as reflected in a century of supreme court jurisprudence.we need not repeat that here.suffice to say that today,i n determining whether the doctrine of young avoids an eleventh amendment bar to suit against state officers sued in their official capacities,a court need only conduct a straightforward inquiry into whether the complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.verizon maryland.pub.serv.comm n,internal brackets omitted quoting idaho coeur tribe,plurality,concurring in part.in verizon,the court held the eleventh amendment did not bar a telecommunication carrier federal claim for prospective declaratory and injunctive relief against the state utility commission because no past liability of the state,or of any of its commissioners,is at issue verizon prayer for injunctive state officials be restrained from enforcing an order in contravention of controlling federal satisfies our straightforward inquiry.insofar as the exposure of the state is concerned,the prayer for declaratory relief adds nothing to the prayer for injunction.id.at.
here,count iii of mcn amended complaint requests a preliminary and permanent injunction restraining otc from further interference with indian commerce.emphasis added.count iii easily satisfies verizon straightforward inquiry.that count seeks a judgment,based on an ongoing violation of federal law,that otc,and necessarily its commissioners,may not henceforth employ oklahoma cigarette tax enforcement scheme to interfere with mcn vehicles.mcn prayer for declaratory relief contained in count ii adds nothing to the state exposure because it too asserts an ongoing violation of federal law and asks for a declaration that otc interference with mcn vehicles is unlawful.the district court properly applied the fiction of young and exercised subject matter jurisdiction over mcn claim contained in count i as against the commissioners to the extent that claim,by way of counts ii and iii,sought prospective relief based on an ongoing violation of federal law 
counts iv and v of mcn amended complaint,however,are of a different ilk.those counts,which respectively request return of the seized cigarettes or,in the alternative,their monetary value,undoubtedly bring into issue the past liability of otc commissioners,and thus seek retrospective relief.when a state official is sued in his or her official capacity,the eleventh amendment bars retrospective relief,usually in the form of money damages,because any such judgment is deemed directed at the state as the real party in interest rather than the nominal officer.see edelman jordan,holding the eleventh amendment barred the retroactive payment of state benefits wrongfully withheld.here,the oklahoma state treasury would be bound to satisfy any judgment directing the commissioners in their official capacities to tender mcn the monetary value of the seized cigarettes,and thus,count v does not avoid the eleventh amendment bar.while mcn request for return of the seized cigarettes presents a somewhat different question given a judgment on count iv directing otc to return the cigarettes would not directly impact the state treasury,neither can that count meet verizon straightforward inquiry because the relief it seeks most assuredly can not be characterized as prospective the district court therefore properly determined the eleventh amendment deprived it of subject matter jurisdiction over mcn claim against the commissioners as to counts iv and v of mcn amended complaint,both of which seek retrospective relief.that leads us to our next inquiry,that is,the viability of mcn claim insofar as its seeks prospective relief against the commissioners.
section permits citizen s and other person s within the jurisdiction of the united states to seek legal and equitable relief from person s who,under color of state law,deprive them of federally protected rights.emphasis added.we have just seen that a suit for prospective relief against state officials named in their official capacities,based upon an ongoing violation of federal law,is not considered an action against the state within the meaning of the eleventh amendment because,under such circumstances,the officials are stripped of their representative character.oddly enough,however,such officials constitute persons acting under color of state law within the meaning of.see will,at.but whether a claimant constitutes a person within the jurisdiction of the united states entitled to maintain suit under is an entirely separate inquiry.
in inyo county indians,the court addressed the sufficiency of an indian tribe suit seeking to establish the right,based on its sovereign status,to be free from a state criminal process.specifically,the court considered whether the tribe could sue under to prevent law enforcement officers from executing search warrants to seize tribal records.the court held under the facts presented that the tribe did not qualify as a person who may sue under.inyo county,at.explaining the tribe claimed immunity from state law enforcement processes because of its asserted sovereign status,the court reasoned section was designed to secure private rights against government encroachment,not to advance a sovereign prerogative to withhold evidence relevant to a criminal investigation.id.at internal citation omitted.the court concluded the tribe could not sue under to vindicate its alleged sovereign right to be free from state law enforcement processes.id.the court suggested,however,that an indian tribe status as a sovereign entity did not per se foreclose its ability to bring suit as a person under.instead,the viability of a tribe suit depended on whether the tribe asserted right was of a sovereign nature there is in this case no allegation that the county lacked probable cause or that the warrant was otherwise defective.it is only by virtue of the tribe asserted sovereign status that it claims immunity from the county processes.id.at.
mindful of inyo county,we read those portions of mcn amended complaint over which the district court had subject matter jurisdiction as seeking prospective relief to vindicate its status as a sovereign immune from state processes under federal law.id.at.to be sure,mcn alleges otc lacked probable cause to stop and search mcn vehicles and seize their lading.and of course,as mcn points out,an entity right to insist on compliance with the fourth amendment,assuming it has the capacity to do so,does not depend on its sovereign status but a prospective injunction instructing state officials to comply with the this case the fourth something more,serves no useful purpose beyond the law itself,which such officials are already bound to obey.as we have already observed,the something more mcn seeks to achieve in this case is an injunction that not only directs otc to comply with the fourth amendment,but also effectively enjoins otc from exercising against mcn what the latter refers to in its amended complaint as the taxing,prosecutorial and civil authority of the otc,in other words,the state cigarette tax enforcement scheme from which mcn claims exemption due only to its sovereign status.see supra at.
referring on multiple occasions in the amended complaint to its sovereign status,mcn,as we read its amended complaint,in effect seeks to vitiate oklahoma cigarette tax enforcement scheme to the extent it authorizes interference with mcn vehicles and seizure of their lading while those vehicles are in transit between indian country because such seizures purportedly interfere with indian commerce.as mcn tells us on page two of its reply brief here,the creek are challenging the oklahoma taxing authority stop,searches and seizures of creek property while in transit between indian country.emphasis added.this most certainly is not a personal challenge to otc activity.no exemption from the state statutory scheme based on indian commerce would be available to mcn suing as a person.the final two paragraphs of the amended complaint general allegations well illustrate the sovereign element of mcn claim.paragraph alleges the intrusion of the taxing,prosecutorial and civil authority of the otc into indian commerce violates and threatens the nation sovereign rights as those rights have been defined and guaranteed by the treaties,statutes and court decisions of the united states.paragraph follows subsequently repeated verbatim in paragraph the otc attempt to exercise taxing and civil authority against the nation violates the nation sovereign immunity and impermissibly burdens indian commerce in violation of the constitution.of course,a person within the meaning of possesses neither sovereign rights nor sovereign immunity.the district court correctly construed mcn claim as designed to vindicate mcn status as a sovereign immune from oklahoma cigarette tax enforcement scheme,and thus correctly held mcn did not constitute a person entitled to bring suit for prospective relief against the commissioners under.this brings us to the final section of our discussion in which we address mcn argument that the district court erred in refusing to read the amended complaint as containing,apart from its claimed civil rights violations,a claimed violation of the indian commerce clause,const.art.i.
we have no quarrel with the district court sound construction of mcn amended complaint because,given the applicable law,the complaint contains no claim under the indian commerce clause that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal.in its reply brief,mcn analogizes its supposed claim to one a state might make under the dormant interstate commerce clause and argues the checkerboard pattern of indian country,referred to in its amended complaint,necessarily must give rise to an implied right of movement of goods without state interference.in other words,mcn roundabout claim that otc commissioners may not invoke oklahoma cigarette tax enforcement scheme to interfere with mcn vehicles while transporting cigarettes between indian country rests upon a strict,absolutist view of indian commerce clause preemption.james watt,cir breyer.but the supreme court has admonished us that t ribal reservations are not states,and the differences in the form and nature of their sovereignty make it treacherous to import to one notions of preemption that are properly applied to the other.white mountain apache tribe bracker.in holding a state may levy severance taxes on oil and gas production by lessees despite the simultaneous imposition of a tribal severance tax,the court explained t he fact that states and tribes have concurrent jurisdiction over the same territory makes it inappropriate to apply commerce clause doctrine in the context of commerce among states with mutually exclusive territorial jurisdiction to trade with indian tribes.cotton petrol.new mexico.rather,bracker informs us 
c ongressional authority to regulate tribal affairs under the indian commerce clause and the position of indian tribes have given rise to two independent but related barriers to the assertion of state regulatory authority over tribal reservations and members.first,the exercise of such authority may be preempted by federal law.second,it may unlawfully infringe on the right of reservation indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them.the two barriers are independent because either,standing alone can be a sufficient basis for holding state law inapplicable to activity undertaken on the reservation or by tribal members.
bracker,at internal quotations and citations omitted.
as to the first barrier,the court observed in washington.confederated tribes,that i t can no longer be seriously argued that the indian commerce clause,of its own force,automatically bars all state taxation of matters significantly touching the political and economic interests of the tribes.necessarily then,mcn can not seriously argue that the indian commerce clause,of its own force,automatically bars or preempts a state from enforcing its tax laws outside indian country,even if such enforcement significantly touches the political and economic interests of mcn.to the extent mcn amended complaint alleges otherwise,it fails to state a claim under the indian commerce clause.because mcn points to no federal law other than the indian commerce clause that might override or preempt the authority of the commissioners to seize mcn unstamped cigarettes outside indian country pursuant to oklahoma state law,mcn must rely on the second barrier and sufficiently allege the commissioners execution of the state tax enforcement scheme infringes on mcn right to make their own laws and be ruled by them.but mcn amended complaint fails to contain any factual allegations as to why this might be.instead,mcn alleges indian sovereignty makes it just so.but confederated tribes tells us that is not so.
in confederated tribes,the supreme court held the state may validly require the tribal smokeshops to affix tax stamps purchased from the state to individual packages of cigarettes prior to the time of sale to nonmembers of the tribe.confederated tribes,at.importantly,the court further held that notwithstanding the fact a tribe cigarettes in transit are as yet exempt from state taxation,a state may seize as contraband a tribe unstamped cigarettes outside indian country if the tribe does not cooperate in collecting state cigarette taxes validly imposed 
we find that washington interest in enforcing its valid taxes is sufficient to justify these seizures.although the cigarettes in transit are as yet exempt from state taxation,they are not immune from seizure when the tribes,as here,have refused to fulfill collection and remittance obligations which the state has validly imposed.it is significant that these seizures take place outside the reservation,in locations where state power over indian affairs is considerably more expansive than it is within reservation boundaries.by seizing cigarettes en route to the reservation,the state polices against wholesale evasion of its own valid taxes without unnecessarily intruding on core tribal interests.

a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to.b may take one of two forms.a facial attack looks only to the factual allegations of the complaint in challenging the court jurisdiction.a factual attack goes beyond the factual allegations of the complaint and presents evidence in the form of affidavits or otherwise to challenge the court jurisdiction.see stuart colorado interstate gas,cir.while neither the parties nor the district court identified it as such,we construe otc and the commissioners motion as a facial challenge based on our reading of the district court dispositive order as limited to the four corners of mcn amended complaint.as such,we apply the same standards under rule b that are applicable to a rule b motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action.
