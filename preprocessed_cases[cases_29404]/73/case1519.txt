the record here demonstrates that in publishing its agenda with respect to its consideration of an agreement under which a developer would be paid a subsidy in the form of remission of million for transient occupancy tax tot collected from a luxury hotel the developer agreed to build,as well as other concessions,the city council of defendant and respondent city of oceanside the city met the requirements of the brown act code et.under the agreement,the city was initially obligated to pay the developer percent of tot receipts generated by the hotel and,thereafter,smaller percentages of tot receipts from the hotel,until the city million tot obligation had been satisfied.when the agreement was presented to the city council for approval,the council agenda stated that the council would consider the developer agreement to guarantee development of the subject property as a full service resort an agreement to provide a mechanism to share transient occupancy tax tot generated by the project and a report,required by statute documenting the amount of subsidy provided to the developer,the proposed start and end date of the subsidy,the public purpose of the subsidy.as we explain more fully below,the language of the agenda,considered as a whole,gave the public and press more than a clue see moreno city of king th,d moreno the city planned to provide the project developer with a substantial and ongoing financial subsidy for the resort project.accordingly,the trial court did not err in finding the agenda met the requirements of the brown act.
we also find that the city subsidy report study substantially complied with the separate provisions of section.thus,we affirm the trial court judgment in favor of the city.

discussion 
ia.the brown act 
with respect to the brown act,we begin by noting that where,as is the case here,the facts are undisputed,we determine a local agency compliance de novo.castaic lake water agency newhall county water dist.th,d castaic.importantly,we also recognize that an agency fulfills its agenda obligations under the brown act so long as it substantially complies with statutory requirements.castaic,at,d,subd.d.substantial compliance means actual compliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective of the statute.castaic,at,d,quoting north pacifica llc california coastal com.th,d.
when the legislature enacted the brown act,it declared that the public commissions,boards and councils and the other public agencies in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people business.it is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly.the people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them.the people,in delegating authority,do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know.the people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created.see stats,ch.in order to fully protect the people right to be informed,the brown act,by its terms,requires the agenda of a regular meeting of a local agency,such as the city council,be posted hours before the meeting commences and contain a brief general description of each item of business to be transacted or discussed at the meeting,including items to be discussed in closed session.a brief general description need not exceed words,subd.a,italics added.importantly,with exceptions not pertinent here,n o action or discussion shall be undertaken on any item not appearing on the posted agenda.id.subd.b.
although there is not a great deal of direct authority with respect to what satisfies the brown act requirement of a brief general description of items to be considered by a local agency,we can discern from the statute itself,cases discussing the statute as well as closely related statutes,and other authority,a general principle that agenda drafters must give the public a fair chance to participate in matters of particular or general concern by providing the public with more than mere clues from which they must then guess or surmise the essential nature of the business to be considered by a local agency.thus,in moreno,supra,th,d,although a city was considering taking disciplinary action against its finance director,including possible termination,its agenda item was inadequate because it merely stated that in closed session the city would consider per government code section public employee employment contract.id.at,d.in finding this failed to give notice to either the public,or the finance director,that the council was considering disciplining or terminating him,the court stated it was undisputed that at least a quarter of the meeting was actually devoted to a discussion of the finance director and whether to terminate him the agenda description provided no clue that the dismissal of a public employee would be discussed at the meeting.id.at,d.importantly,the court went on to point out how easily the city council could have met the requirements of the brown act a n agenda th
