opinion of the court 
these consolidated cases stem from a single lawsuit by two married couples and their affiliated entities.they sued the virgin islands and its tax agency seeking a determination of the source of certain income and the united states seeking tax refunds.the united states district court of the virgin islands the district court or simply the district court dismissed their claim against the virgin islands and transferred their claims against the united states to the united states district court for the southern district of florida.the plaintiffs have directly appealed the district court dismissal of their claim against the virgin islands,and they have filed a petition for a writ of mandamus concerning their claims against the united states for the reasons that follow,we affirm the holding of the district court and deny the mandamus petition.
background and procedural history 
harvey and diane birdman formed a virgin islands corporation,barclay associates,barclay.herbert and bonita hirsch also formed a virgin islands corporation,kingsbridge associates,kingsbridge.during the relevant time period,tax year,barclay and kingsbridge were among the limited partners in a virgin islands limited liability limited partnership,four points management lllp four points.barclay and kingsbridge derived all of their income from their stakes in four points.
the birdmans and the hirsches assert that they were not bona fide residents of the virgin islands in.see a.however,they claim that a portion of their income was derived from sources within the virgin islands.see id.a a ii.specifically,harvey birdman tax return indicates that of his income was derived from the virgin islands for herbert hirsch,it was.the men,who filed jointly with their wives,claimed that all of their virgin islands income came from barclay and kingsbridge,respectively.
taxpayers situated like the birdmans and the hirsches that is,taxpayers who are not bona fide residents but claim to have derived some income from the virgin islands must file two tax returns.id.a.their virgin islands tax return should include taxes payable on all income derived from sources within the virgin islands.id.b,b b.their united states tax return should include taxes payable on the remaining income.id.a,b.
both couples in our case filed the proper tax returns,one with the united states and one with the virgin islands.but they each made only one payment.rather than paying the virgin islands its share,as requires,both couples paid both their united states taxes and their virgin islands taxes to the united states.the taxpayers allege that they did so with the good faith belief that the united states irs would pay the amount s due to the virgin islands to the virgin islands bureau of internal revenue vibir,or,alternatively,that the vibir would obtain the amounts from the irs.compl.the united states,though,has neither paid those sums to the virgin islands nor refunded them to the taxpayers.nor has the virgin islands sought to claim those sums from the united states.caught between scylla and charybdis,the birdmans and the hirsches complain that they owe debts to the virgin islands that equal their overpayments to the united states.
the birdmans,the hirsches,barclay,and kingsbridge collectively,the appellants brought this suit in in the district court.they named both the virgin islands including its agency,the vibir and the united states as defendants but sought different relief from each.against the virgin islands,they requested a negative injunction that would compel the vibir to declare whether the income in question was derived from sources within the virgin islands.they claim that the income was so derived,but the united states irs has challenged that claim in other proceedings.against the united states,they requested refunds of the amounts they contend they initially should have paid to the virgin islands.
the virgin islands moved to dismiss appellants claim against it pursuant to rules b lack of subject matter jurisdiction and b failure to state a claim of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court granted its motion to dismiss,holding that appellants had failed to state a claim against the virgin islands.in the alternative,the court held that appellants claim against the virgin islands was not ripe for decision.this dismissal is before us on direct appeal as case.
the united states moved to dismiss appellants claims against it pursuant to rule b,asserting that venue was improper.in the alternative,it moved to sever those claims and transfer them to the district court for the southern district of florida,where the birdmans and the hirsches live.the district court granted the united states alternative motion,transferring this part of the case to the florida venue pursuant to a.before the court entered its transfer order,appellants moved it to certify an interlocutory appeal of that order to our court under b they maintained that,under a,jurisdiction and thus venue is proper only in the district court.the district court for the southern district of florida stayed the case but it to the district court for the limited purpose of ruling on appellants motion to certify an interlocutory appeal.the district court then denied that motion.appellants,however,petitioned us for a writ of mandamus to compel the district court to accept jurisdiction and venue.that petition is before us as case.
we have consolidated case with case,so all counts of appellants complaint are involved in this case.but the issues are distinct.we must decide,first,whether appellants have stated a claim against the virgin islands,and second,what the proper venue is for appellants claims against the united states.the latter question requires that we determine which courts have jurisdiction over virgin islands tax matters under a.

iii.discussion 
claim against the virgin islands 
appellants have asked the district court to compel the virgin islands and the vibir to issue a determination of the source of income for tax year as to barclay and kingsbridge.compl.in support of this request,they cite delays by the united states irs in its challenge to their source of income for and other tax years.id.
the virgin islands moved the district court to dismiss this count of the complaint for failure to state a claim.in response to its motion,appellants stated that they relie d upon that court equitable powers to issue a negative injunction against the vibir for a determination of source of income pursuant to.chief judge gomez of the district court at oral argument attempted to clarify appellants position.he asked appellants counsel four times to state their cause of action.at.each time,counsel responded that it was a negative injunction.when chief judge gomez reminded counsel that an injunction is a remedy,not a cause of action,and that plaintiffs must have a cause of action to seek a remedy,counsel nonetheless responded injunctive relief is a remedy.and under the law where it at it also a cause of action.id.at.
the district court granted the virgin islands motion to dismiss on the basis that appellants had not satisfied the administrative requisites for a redetermination of their virgin islands tax liability.it held in the alternative that any claim appellants might have against the virgin islands was not ripe.
on appeal,appellants urge that the district court misconstrued the nature of their claim.a t no point did the appellants attempt to litigate their respective income tax liabilities the appellants complaint stated in no uncertain terms that they were seeking a negative injunction.appellants br.at.they based no part of their appeal on the cause of action that the district court ascribed to them.yet appellants now recognize that they must have a cause of action to merit an injunction.they proffer two on appeal breach of contract and.
appellants did not present these causes of action to the district court.nowhere in their complaint or trial memoranda on this issue does the word contract appear,nor did they mention it in responding to chief judge gomez repeated questioning.those sources likewise do not suggest how the virgin islands might be in breach as the operative paragraph of the complaint lists grievances only against the irs,or how it might have been unjustly enriched as appellants paid the irs,not the virgin islands,for the year in question.if appellants intended to make a contract claim,their pleadings do not give the defendant s fair notice of what the claim is.twombly,at.quoting conley gibson,d.rather,the pleading must contain something more by way of a claim for relief than a statement of facts that merely creates a suspicion that the pleader might have a legally cognizable right of action.charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure ed.supp.
it is axiomatic that arguments asserted for the first time on appeal are deemed to be waived and consequently are not susceptible to review in this court absent exceptional circumstances.tri m,llc sharp,cir quoting united states petersen,cir.the only causes of action that appellants present for our review were not argued before the district court.thus,they have waived any ground on which they might state a claim against the virgin islands 
we also agree with the district court that any claim appellants might have against the virgin islands is not ripe to decide.f ederal courts are only empowered to decide cases and controversies as our article iii jurisprudence defines them.felmeister office of att y ethics,cir.ripeness is among the requirements for a case or controversy to exist.id.to determine whether a dispute is ripe,we must evaluate the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.abbott labs.gardner,d,abrogated on other grounds by califano sanders,d.
ripeness questions often arise when an agency has announced a decision to take a certain action,but that action remains tentative at the time of suit.the seminal cases of abbott laboratories,cited above,and toilet goods ass gardner,d,presented such facts.a dispute generally is not ripe if the agency action reflect s the tentative nature of its conclusion,in which the the agency expressly reserve s the possibility that its opinion might change.natural res.def.council faa,quoting ny.stock,bloom.for example,we held that a proposal to audit a hospital was not fit for decision,and thus not ripe,because a n investigation,even one conducted with an eye to enforcement,is quintessentially as a form of agency action.of med.dentistry of corrigan,cir quoting ass of am.med.colls.united states,cir.this is so because the possibility that no enforcement action may be taken is real for several reasons,not least of which is that the agency may change its mind on one or more issues along the way.id.
in our case,appellants claim is not ripe because the virgin islands has taken no action whose legality we can resolve.the virgin islands tax returns of the birdmans and the hirsches indicate that they owe certain taxes.the virgin islands has sent those taxpayers automated notices reflecting their own assertion that the taxes are due.however,it has made no formal determination of the amounts that are in fact owed indeed,that determination is the relief that appellants seek.much less has it begun any enforcement action.at oral argument,counsel for the virgin islands indicated that the vibir has declined to take action pending the outcome of this and other lawsuits.oral arg.tr.hence,the record presents us with a real possibility that the virgin islands will never seek to collect the disputed taxes 
the causes of action that appellants have pressed against the virgin islands in our court are waived,and in any event their claim is not ripe in the unique context of this case.we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of appellants claim against the virgin islands.
mandamus petition concerning jurisdiction over virgin islands tax matters 
we also must determine the appropriate forum for appellants claims against the united states.to repeat,the district court held that those claims fall within the category of claims defined by a,which governs certain claims against the united states.appellants do not challenge that conclusion.the proper venue for a claims is,with exceptions not relevant,in the judicial district where the plaintiff resides.id.a.the district court therefore transferred these claims to the district court for the southern district of florida,where the birdmans and the hirsches live.see id.a permitting district courts to transfer cases to the proper venue.it denied appellants motion to certify an interlocutory appeal of this venue transfer order pursuant to b.
appellants petition us for a writ of mandamus to compel the district court to decide these claims.under a,they maintain,no other trial court has subject matter jurisdiction.
the writ of mandamus is a drastic remedy that a court should grant only in extraordinary circumstances in response to an act amounting to a judicial usurpation of power.hahnemann.hosp.edgar,cir quoting will united states,d.for the writ to issue,the petitioner must have no other adequate means to attain the relief sought,and the right to the writ must be clear and indisputable.united states higdon,at citing cheney united states dist.court for,d.even when these prerequisites are met,however,the issuance of a writ is largely discretionary.id.quoting hahnemann,at.
we have established that a writ of mandamus may issue to compel a district court to vacate an order transferring a case to another district.in re united states,cir issuing writ and citing three prior cases in which we issued the writ for that purpose.thus,m andamus is the appropriate mechanism for reviewing an allegedly improper transfer order.id.quoting sunbelt noble,denton,cir.
appellants petition for a mandamus writ requires that we construe the terms of the revised organic act of the virgin islands,et.it is the virgin islands equivalent of a constitution,and as such,it is the body of law that defines the jurisdictional boundaries of the virgin islands courts.brow farrelly,cir citations omitted.in particular,it defines the jurisdiction of the district court,which congress established pursuant to article iv,of the united states constitution.see callwood enos,cir.
prior to,the revised organic act provided considerable overlap between the jurisdictions of the district court and the territorial court now the superior court of the virgin islands.w hen congress acted to establish the district court of the virgin islands,it established it as a court of original and general jurisdiction.edwards hovensa,llc,cir quoting carty beech aircraft,cir.under this jurisdictional framework,the district court of the virgin islands heard the majority of cases brought in the virgin islands,whether those cases were brought under federal law or local law,civil law or criminal law.callwood,at.hence,we resolved numerous disputes about the overlap in jurisdiction between the district court and the territorial court.see,excavation,quinn,cir pan am.world airways,duly authorized gov t of,cir.
