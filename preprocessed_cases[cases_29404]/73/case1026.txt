introduction 
this suit arises out of a failed tax shelter,which defendants allegedly sold to theodore swartz,charging over a million dollars,even though they knew the scheme would be considered unlawful by the irs.among the named defendants were accounting firm kpmg,law firm sidley austin brown wood b w,deutsche bank ag and deutsche bank securities collectively db or deutsche bank,and presidio advisory services presidio.against all defendants,swartz asserted claims under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,under the washington consumer protection act wcpa.et,for fraud,and for civil conspiracy.swartz also sought a judicial declaration of defendants liability for interest and penalties that might have arisen during an irs audit,incomplete at the time he filed his lawsuit.swartz advanced separate claims against kpmg and b w for breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,and professional malpractice.in a published order the district court dismissed all causes of action against presidio and db concluding both that swartz complaint failed to state any claims upon which relief could be granted and that it contained insufficient allegations to establish personal jurisdiction swartz sought leave to cure the substantive and jurisdictional defects in the complaint and to add alternative securities fraud claims.believing amendment would be futile and that the request was procedurally improper,the district court denied leave to amend.swartz appeals each of these rulings 
with the exception of its holding that the allegations in the complaint ruled out reasonable reliance as a matter of law,the district court did not err in swartz i and we adopt its decision in large measure.specifically,we affirm the district court dismissal with prejudice of the rico and wcpa claims as well as the request for declaratory relief because each was properly resolved on grounds independent of the reasonable reliance inquiry and because amendment would be futile in each case.
however,we reverse the district court denial of leave to amend the fraud and conspiracy claims.whether swartz could demonstrate reasonable reliance on defendants alleged misrepresentations was not properly settled as a matter of law under the allegations in the complaint.furthermore,even if the original complaint otherwise failed to satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of federal rule of civil procedure b,it would not have been futile for swartz to amend.additionally,although the original complaint failed to allege sufficient jurisdictional facts,swartz should have been given an opportunity to cure this defect through amendment.finally,swartz should have been granted leave to add alternative claims for securities fraud.
ii.background 
in,swartz sold a business and realized an approximately million gain representing potentially taxable income.kpmg approached swartz and lured him into purchasing a product called blips bond linked issue premium structure,represented as a strategy that would allow swartz to claim a loss sufficient to offset his capital gain.kmpg advised swartz of the possibility of an audit,but assured him that kpmg and law firm b w would provide tax opinion letters testifying to the legitimacy of the scheme to the satisfaction of the irs.according to the complaint,the blips transactions had been devised by kpmg and b w as a means of charging unwarranted and excessive fees to a select audience of individuals who had sold large businesses or otherwise incurred large capital gains.swartz alleged presidio and db were active participants in the conspiracy and knew that the series of blips transactions were predetermined steps to generate sham losses for the purpose of obtaining tax benefits.swartz further alleged that presidio and db knew that kpmg and b w promoted the blips transactions through the allegedly fraudulent representations outlined above and that the defendants acted in concert and as mutual agents.
in fall,swartz entered into various contracts including an engagement letter,executed september,between himself and kpmg.the letter outlined kpmg role in the transactions,disclosed that the irs might question the blips losses,and stated that kpmg would not guarantee tax results,but would provide that there is a greater than percent likelihood that the promised tax benefits would be upheld if challenged by the irs.despite this caveat,swartz alleged that he reasonably relied on kpmg oral representations that blips would succeed in eliminating his income tax liability.
the transactions comprising the blips strategy occurred between september and december.because the details are largely irrelevant,they are recounted here in very rough form.kpmg and presidio facilitated the extension of a dollar line of credit from db to swartz.swartz created a new limited liability company,longs strategic investment fund longs,and engaged presidio as its manager.the credit facility was contributed to longs.longs held various assets including a number of shares of microsoft common stock.after engaging in two foreign currency transactions intended to give longs the appearance of a legitimate business,presidio directed that longs be dissolved.on december,the company was dissolved and the microsoft stock was transferred to swartz as part of his ownership assets.
the intended effect of these transactions was to artificially inflate swartz basis in the microsoft stock so that he could sell it and claim a capital loss in the amount of the difference between his inflated basis and the value of the stock.in this case,kpmg represented that the sale of shares of microsoft stock would trigger a purported capital loss of approximately million.swartz paid significant fees to defendants to implement these transactions including a management fee to presidio and more than in fees and interest to db.
according to the complaint,on december,the irs issued a notice concluding that blips did not produce bona fide losses for income tax purposes.nevertheless,on december,kpmg and b w issued opinion letters that purported to confirm the propriety of the scheme.
on august,before swartz filed his tax return,his independent tax preparation firm,moss adams,questioned the validity of the scheme,informing swartz it believed the irs would consider the blips losses to be improper.on september,the irs issued an additional notice reiterating its opinion that blips losses were illegitimate and warning that criminal penalties might attach to individuals who attempted to use them on their tax returns.on october,kpmg advised swartz that the promised tax benefits might be disallowed by the irs.in response,swartz sought recision of the blips agreements and a monetary refund.the defendants refused.on october,moss adams resigned from its engagement.kpmg then assisted swartz in preparing his return,which reflected deductions for blips losses.
at some point thereafter,the irs commenced an audit of swartz tax return swartz did not amend his tax return in or.
on february,kpmg informed swartz that it was under irs investigation in connection with the blips scheme and that the irs had announced an amnesty from certain penalties for individual tax filers who disclosed their involvement.kpmg advised swartz to make a full disclosure to the irs.b w sent a similar letter on march.the complaint does not indicate whether swartz took advantage of the irs initiative.
proceedings below 
on june,swartz initiated this lawsuit.on february,the district court issued swartz i granting several federal rule of civil procedure b motions including presidio and db.as to each cause of action,the court held there was no conceivable set of facts which could justify relief and dismissed with prejudice.the court also found swartz had not met his burden of pleading personal jurisdiction and dismissed presidio and db from the lawsuit under rule b.the court added,b ecause presidio and db were only named in regard to causes of action which are being dismissed with prejudice,there is no point in permitting plaintiff to amend and plead sufficient jurisdictional facts.swartz i,d at.
on march,swartz sought leave to amend.in support,he proposed an amended complaint adding significant detail to the dismissed claims,supplementing the jurisdictional allegations,and adding alternative causes of action for securities fraud under federal and washington state law.the district court disallowed amendment of the original claims relying on its february,order the court also denied leave to add new securities fraud claims.this appeal followed.

iv.discussion 
a.the rico claim 
a civil rico claim requires allegations of the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity that proximately caused injury to the plaintiff.sedima,imrex,d.swartz rico claim was predicated on allegations of mail and wire that the marketing and implementation of the blips scheme was carried out through the use of interstate mail and wire communications systems.
the district court dismissed the rico claim on two alternative grounds.first,the court held the alleged fraud was in connection with the sale of the microsoft stock and could not form the basis of a rico claim under section of the private securities litigation reform act pslra,stat.second,the court held that allegations in the complaint foreclosed a finding of reasonable reliance a necessary element for all species of fraud,including fraud.
we agree that the pslra bars swartz claim and hereby adopt the district court opinion in swartz i to that extent.swartz i,d at section iii.effect of private securities litigation reform act.swartz argument on appeal that the blips transactions were intended to be a swap agreement does not change the fact that the complaint alleges fraud in connection with the sale of securities.neither was the sale of securities incidental to the fraud.the sale of the microsoft stock was the lynchpin of the blips scheme.the entire purpose of setting up longs and funding it with the loan proceeds from db was that,on dissolution,longs would be able to transfer its assets the microsoft stock to swartz and his basis in those assets would be artificially inflated by the value of the loan.if swartz never sold the assets with the inflated basis the stock he would never realize the loss that he required to offset his real capital gains.as in sec zandford,the securities sales and appellees alleged fraudulent practices were not independent events,d.
because the pslra bar would apply under any internally consistent set of facts,it would be futile to amend the rico claim.consequently,it was not error to dismiss this claim with prejudice.see albrecht lund,cir if the allegation of other facts consistent with the challenged pleading could not possibly cure the deficiency,then dismissal without leave to amend is proper.internal quotation,citation omitted.the reasonable reliance holding is addressed below.
wcpa claim 
the district court properly dismissed the washington consumer protection act claim and we adopt its opinion on that issue.swartz i,d at section iii.washington consumer protection act.we note that a scheme marketed to a select audience of persons with millions of dollars of capital gains to shield from taxation lacks the capacity to deceive a substantial portion of the public.the claim was properly dismissed with prejudice because amendment would be futile.
fraud claim 
under washington law,a fraud plaintiff must plead and prove that he justifiably relied on the defendants misrepresentations.see stiley block.pattern jury instr.civ.wpi ed.whether a party justifiably relied upon a misrepresentation is an issue of fact.alejandre bull.
a party reliance is justified when it is reasonable under the surrounding circumstances.esca kpmg peat marwick.an analysis of the surrounding circumstances is necessarily and involves multiple considerations.washington courts have,for example,discussed the plaintiff education,skagit state bank rasmussen,her experience and relative sophistication with the subject matter of the representations,puget sound bank mcmahon,whether the defendant had special expertise,westby gorsuch,and whether oral misrepresentations were contradicted by written documents in the representee possession,williams joslin.
the district court first found that because the engagement letter between swartz and kpmg advised that blips was aggressive in nature and involved the possibility of a successful irs audit,swartz was precluded from establishing reasonable reliance.we are unaware of any washington authority creating a rule that oral representations can not establish reasonable reliance as a matter of law where there are written documents which contradict the oral statements.swartz i,d at to be sure,the existence of documents in a plaintiff possession ought to be relevant to the question of whether he reasonably relied on oral falsehoods.but this single factor will usually not be dispositive.see stewart estate of steiner,requiring consideration of multiple factors in context of securities fraud suit.
even if there were such a rule,it is not at all clear that the engagement letter contradicts any oral misrepresentations alleged by swartz.the gravamen of swartz complaint is that the defendants represented blips as an effective strategy and collected substantial fees to implement the scheme despite knowing that it had no chance of success.while the engagement letter acknowledges the possibility of an audit,it also contains assurances that the plan would more likely than not be upheld over an irs challenge.whether this contradicts any oral representations is not and should not result in a dismissal with prejudice at this stage in the litigation.in addition,swartz attempted to allege additional misrepresentations by defendants in his proposed amended complaint that may have demonstrated reasonable reliance even in the face of the engagement letter.although the engagement letter may undermine swartz claim of reasonable reliance,we are not prepared,at the motion to dismiss stage,to conclude that the letter demonstrates beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the claims that would entitle him to relief.osborne district attorney office for third judicial,cir emphasis added.
swartz also argues that the district court erred by considering the contents of the engagement letter in deciding the motions to dismiss.the letter itself was proffered in support of kpmg motion and was arguably a matter outside the pleadings and therefore not cognizable.
we reject swartz argument.first,it was not presented to the district court,and indeed was raised for the first time in swartz reply brief to this court.the claim was therefore waived.rui one city of berkeley,cir.in addition,the district court did not err here.in ruling on a b motion,a court may generally consider only allegations contained in the pleadings,exhibits attached to the complaint,and matters properly subject to judicial notice.jacobson schwarzenegger,d.however,in order to p revent plaintiffs from surviving a rule b motion by deliberately omitting documents upon which their claims are based,a court may consider a writing referenced in a complaint but not explicitly incorporated therein if the complaint relies on the document and its authenticity is unquestioned.parrino fhp,cir,superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in abrego dow chem,cir see also lee city of los angeles,cir.here,swartz brought a breach of contract claim against kpmg and referred explicitly to the engagement letter.the authenticity of the letter is not in dispute.therefore,the letter was properly considered on the b motions 
the district court also ruled that circumstances alleged in the complaint apart from the engagement letter precluded a finding of reasonable reliance.it highlighted that moss adams
