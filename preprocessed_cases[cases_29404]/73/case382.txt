defendant has little confidence in the legal profession defendant is aware of a few attorneys he trusts,but their dollar fees are out of the question he does not trust just any attorney out of a whom the government is willing to furnish neither would this defendant be satisfied with such an attorney concept of the constitution of the united states after the average attorney,full of brainwashing,thinks that the constitution is what the judges say it is,rather than what the constitution itself,says it is.
at a hearing regarding the motion,magistrate judge mcknight offered to appoint counsel for davis,but davis declined.the judge granted davis an additional days.

on november,united states district judge richard voorhees entered an order denying davis additional time to seek counsel.judge voorhees concluded that davis has been given ample time to secure counsel,and his failure to do so is a result of his unjustifiable failure to avail himself of the opportunities fairly given.id.at.
at a hearing regarding counsel on november,davis stated,
i of the opinion that this indictment is invalid and i do think that i should have to plead to an invalid indictment.it fails to state the specific tax that they are alleging i have never paid t he section that is listed on this indictment is a section that specifies the penalty for failing to obey some other section,but they did not specify the section that i have supposedly failed to comply with.
id.at.davis further asserted that even to plead not guilty would amount to accepting the validity of the government claim that there was a tax that davis owed.judge voorhees rejected this argument,noted that davis had had adequate time to obtain counsel,and stated that davis had the option of proceeding pro se with or without standby counsel or having counsel appointed.responding to davis protest,judge voorhees observed that davis seem ed to take an attitude that he was not going to do anything affirmatively that might help address the stalemate that now exists in the case and consequently the court has to take its own initiative in the matter.id.at.the court therefore appointed counsel.
