the district entered summary judgment partially in favor of north dakota state university and partially in favor of the united states in this federal insurance contributions act fica tax case involving north dakota state university early retirement program.the district court determined that payments to tenured faculty under the program were not wages within the fica definition of wages but that payments to administrators under the program were wages subject to fica taxation.the united states appeals the decision regarding the tenured faculty and north dakota state university the decision regarding the administrators,to the extent it applies to those administrators who north dakota state university asserts also had tenure rights.we affirm 
the material facts are generally undisputed in this case disposed of on cross motions for summary judgment.north dakota state university hereinafter ndsu offered an early retirement program to tenured faculty and to certain administrators whose age and years of service totaled or during some periods of time.participation in the program was voluntary by both the employee nor ndsu could force the other to enter into an early retirement agreement.once they agreed to enter into an early retirement agreement,ndsu and the employee negotiated the payment amount.the payment was capped at of the employee most recent annual salary,but the prospective retiree was not automatically entitled to the full amount.various factors were considered in setting the retirement payment,including past performance,current salary,curriculum needs,and budget restraints.these were not the only factors considered during the negotiations in fact,there was no restriction on the factors that could be considered.under the early retirement agreement,the employee agreed to give up any tenure,contract,other employment rights,agreed not to seek employment with a north dakota public university or college,and agreed to give up any claim against ndsu under the age discrimination in employment act.
the early retirement program was available to faculty who had received tenure.tenure was granted to a faculty member upon recommendation by ndsu to the north dakota board of higher education the board,which made the final tenure decision.ndsu had a tenure track of six years,during which time faculty members were evaluated annually.the track was not set in stone,however,and occasionally tenure was granted earlier,even upon hire.under ndsu and board policy,the probationary period could be waived for faculty having tenure at another university or having a record of outstanding achievement.the board considered various factors in making tenure decisions,including scholarship in teaching,contribution to a discipline or profession through research,other scholarly or professional activities,and service to the institution and society.
tenure was not a right that could be demanded by a professor.once tenure was granted,however,tenure gave the professor the right to continuous academic year employment in the specific program area for which the tenure was granted.the annual tenure contracts were automatically renewed each year unless termination was permitted under the policies.under the terms of the tenure program,which were,a tenured faculty member could be terminated based upon various fiscal reasons,including a demonstrably bona fide financial exigency,loss of legislative appropriations,loss of institutional or program enrollment,consolidation of academic units or program areas,or elimination of courses.additionally,tenured faculty could be terminated for adequate cause,which was defined as demonstrated incompetence or dishonesty in teaching,research,or other professional activities continued or repeated unsatisfactory performance evaluations substantial and manifest neglect of duty conduct which substantially impaired fulfillment of responsibilities physical or mental inabilities to perform duties and continued violations of ndsu or board policies.absent fiscal constraints or adequate cause,a tenured faculty member could not be terminated.the tenure policies required that specific due process rights and procedures be afforded a tenured faculty before any termination.
certain administrators were also eligible to participate in the early retirement program,including the president,vice presidents,deans and officers of the institution who we re members of,tffr and tirf.ndsu policy,appellant app.at.these administrators had certain employment rights pursuant to ndsu and board policy,including a right to extended notice before dismissal,depending on the administrator length of employment.three months notice was required during the administrator first year,six months during the second year,and twelve months notice thereafter.upon compliance with the early notice provisions,the administrators could be terminated without cause.ndsu policy,appellant app.at.
prior to,ndsu withheld the employee portion of fica taxes from early retirement program payments and paid its employer share of fica taxes.during,some early retirement program participants questioned ndsu payroll department about the applicability of fica taxes to the payments.both ndsu payroll director and general counsel researched the issue by reviewing privately published tax law treatises and attempting to contact the internal revenue service irs and the social security administration ssa ndsu posed a question to the ssa concerning whether ndsu tenure program,under which an employee is offered a sum of money to sell their tenure back to the university,is considered wages for fica purposes.appellant app.at.the ssa responded in a letter stating that,as described by ndsu,the program was in effect,a payment to secure the release of an unexpired contract of employment,and as such,under the social security procedure operations manuals,was not considered wages for purposes of determining benefit amounts or for deduction of benefits purposes.id.based on the ssa letter,and without seeking further outside advice or a private letter ruling from the irs,ndsu stopped both withholding and paying fica taxes on the early retirement program payments.
the irs audited ndsu on june,and assessed deficiencies in fica taxes for the years through with respect to the early retirement program payments.ndsu paid the assessment and thereafter began withholding and paying fica taxes on the early retirement payments.ndsu later filed for a refund of the fica taxes for the periods of through.upon denial of the refund claim,ndsu filed this suit.
the district court determined that the payments to the administrators were wages subject to fica taxation because the administrators were employees,subject only to the extended notice provisions.because the payments were based on factors traditionally used to determine compensation,the district court found that the payments were wages for fica purposes.the district court treated the tenured faculty members differently,however,because the faculty had a recognized property interest in their tenure.the district court concluded that the payments to tenured faculty were made in exchange for the relinquishment of a property or contract interest rather than for compensation and as such were not subject to fica taxation.the united states appeals the ruling regarding the tenured faculty.counsel for ndsu clarified at oral argument that ndsu is appealing the ruling only to the extent that payments made to administrators who ndsu alleges also had tenure rights were deemed wages for fica purposes.ndsu concedes that nontenured administrators were employees and subject to fica taxation.we affirm.
we review summary judgment dismissals de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.see melvin yale indus,cir.tax assessments made by the irs are presumed correct and the taxpayer bears the burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the assessment is erroneous.see boles trucking,united states,cir.the crux of this case is whether payments made to tenured faculty,in exchange for which the tenured faculty gave up their tenure rights,are subject to fica taxes as defined by the internal revenue code.this is,we believe,an issue of first impression in the federal circuit courts 
the internal revenue code imposes fica taxes on wages received by an employee with respect to employment.internal revenue code.the employer is required to withhold fica taxes from the employee wages and is required to pay an equal amount itself as an employment tax.see.the term wages is defined for fica purposes as all remuneration for employment with enumerated exceptions,none of which apply to this case.a.employment is defined as any service,of whatever nature,performed by an employee for the person employing him.b.these terms are worded so as to import breadth of coverage,mayberry united states,cir quoting soc.sec.bd.nierotko,to further the policies behind the social security act as originally codified in.see nierotko,at.holding that any service performed includes the whole relationship and is not limited to only productive activity.
although wages and employment are read broadly in the fica context,clearly not all payments by employers to employees constitute wages.wages usually are income,but many items qualify as income and yet clearly are not wages.cent.pub.serv.united states,d.the payments must be remuneration for services provided by the employee to his employer to be subject to fica taxes.
three closely related principles emerge from our review of the tax law relevant to this dispute.in revenue ruling an employee entered a employment contract.see rul,wl the employer and the employee agreed to cancel the contract in the second year.the employer paid the employee a lump sum in exchange for the employee relinquishment of his contract rights.the irs determined that the lump sum payment was not fica wages,or remuneration for employment,but consideration for relinquishing rights under the contract,the right to be employed for the full five years.thus,in the view of the irs,payments to relinquish rights under a contract are not wages for fica purposes.see also slotta,dist.lexis,at holding that payment to a professor for relinquishing tenure rights was not wages for fica purposes.abrahamsen united states,rejecting argument that exit incentive payments to employees were in exchange for agreement to release all claims against employer where there was no evidence that employees ever asserted claims against the employer,cert.denied,d associated,united states,rejecting argument that payments made to mine workers were in exchange for agreement not to strike where payments were offered to all employees,including nonunion employees.
in revenue ruling the irs determined that payments made to an employee after his employer terminated his employment contract were fica wages.see rul,wl.the contract provided that the employer could terminate the employee during the term of the contract as long as it paid the employee an additional six months salary,which it did.the irs distinguished revenue ruling by characterizing it as payment for the relinquishment of interests the employee had in his employment contract in the nature of property.conversely,the case before the irs in revenue ruling involved payments made under the contract.thus,in the irs view,payments made pursuant to an employment contract are wages for fica purposes.see also greenwald united states,wl,at,holding that a payment which essentially paid the employee for anticipated earnings pursuant to an employment agreement were fica wages.
in revenue ruling,a railroad employee received a payment in exchange for relinquishing seniority rights gained from his prior service under a general contract of employment.see rul,wl.the employee was an employee who had acquired the rights to security in his employment and to additional pay or other recognition based on longevity however,the railroad had no obligation to maintain the relationship.the railroad paid the employee a lump sum to transfer to a different position and to forego his seniority rights.the irs determined that the lump sum payment constituted remuneration for services for purposes of the railroad retirement tax act rrta,the equivalent of fica for railroad employees,because the rights given up were those earned by past seniority.the payment was similar to a severance package,which rewarded an employee for past service.thus,according to the irs,payments for past services,or seniority rights,are wages for fica purposes.see also abrahamsen,at if the payments at issue were merely severance payments that were not conditioned on a release of any claims,they would constitute wages because they would be compensation paid to the employees by their employer for the relationship.
thus,we must determine whether the payments made under ndsu early retirement program to tenured faculty in exchange for release of the faculty tenure rights are payments to relinquish contractual or property rights,payments pursuant to a contractual agreement,payments for past services,or something else.
tenured professors 
the parties agree that tenure is a protected property right.in this circuit,a tenured professor at a state institution not only has a constitutional right to procedural due process,but also has a substantive due process right to be free from discharge for reasons that are arbitrary and capricious,or in other words,for reasons that are trivial,unrelated to the education process,or wholly unsupported by a basis in fact.morris clifford,cir refusing to grant qualified immunity to university personnel for discharging a tenured professor at the university of north dakota because a tenured professor right to substantive due process was clearly established see also mueller regents of the of,cir requiring substantial evidence to support the university decision to terminate a tenured professor protected by substantive due process.ndsu policy also provided that tenured faculty could not be terminated absent fiscal restraints or adequate cause.thus,the faculty who gave up their tenure rights at ndsu in exchange for early retirement gave up the right not only to invoke proper procedure before tenure was lost,but a right not to lose tenure at all without justification.
despite the fact that tenure at a state institution is a constitutionally protected property interest and that the tenured faculty had clear contractual rights not to be terminated absent specific circumstances,the government argues that tenure rights are not contract rights that can be relinquished because the tenure rights have no economic value that can be bought and sold.we are unpersuaded by this argument.rarely would we expect to find an employment contract that would have recognizable economic value to anyone other than the employee lack of a market in which to sell tenure rights does not prevent those rights from having value to the faculty member to whom tenure has been granted.vail bd.of educ.of paris union sch.dist,cir posner,dissenting a contract that gives a teacher the right to be employed till he retires is special,for unless he is old or rich the present value of his tenure right is probably his biggest asset,aff,d.
the government next argues that tenure rights accrue over time,similar to seniority,making this case analogous to revenue ruling.although past service plays a part in the decision to grant tenure,tenure is much more than a recognition for past services.importantly,tenure is not automatic upon completing service for a specified time period,which is a hallmark of ordinary seniority rights.prior to an award of tenure,a professor is employed pursuant to contracts for a period of time,generally six years at ndsu.the six years during which a professor teaches before being granted tenure is not consideration for the grant of tenure.rather,it is ordinarily a prerequisite for tenure and serves as a probationary period during which the university may evaluate the professor to determine whether he or she has the qualities necessary to be worthy of tenure.after serving the probationary period,the professor must still qualify for tenure through his or her scholarship,research,and service to the university and society.the decision to award tenure rests on criteria that reflect the potential contribution of the f
