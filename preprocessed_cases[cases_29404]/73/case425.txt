willie clark,clark appeals his convictions on multiple counts of willfully aiding and assisting the preparation of false tax returns,in violation of,and presenting false claims for tax refunds,in violation of.he asserts that the district court should have dismissed his indictment with prejudice for violation of the speedy trial act,there is insufficient evidence to support the jury guilty verdict,and the district court abused its discretion by admitting certain evidence.for the following reasons,we affirm clark convictions.
factual and procedural background 
factual background 
in this tax fraud case,a jury found clark guilty of preparing fraudulent tax returns for fifteen taxpayers in exchange for a fixed fee and percentage of the refund obtained.clark actions with respect to each of the fifteen taxpayers were remarkably similar.we describe clark interactions with three representative taxpayers.
taxpayer mcdonald 
clark met taxpayer mcdonald mcdonald in a gym locker room in early.after discussing mcdonald tax situation,clark gave mcdonald his business card,led him to believe that he was a competent and experienced tax preparer,and offered to prepare his federal tax return in exchange for a set fee plus a percentage of his tax refund.mcdonald gave clark all of his and his financial documents and paid clark fee.clark then gave mcdonald specific tax advice on various tax topics and informed mcdonald that he could file amended returns for prior years for him to obtain additional refunds.clark prepared and amended returns for mcdonald.on the return,clark accurately reported mcdonald income but falsely listed a business loss of approximately,rendering his taxable income.as a result,mcdonald received a refund of,the entire amount of his federal withholding.clark did not indicate that he was the paid preparer of the return.
sometime before,the irs informed mcdonald that it would audit his return.mcdonald called clark to seek his advice.clark responded by telling mcdonald that he would be able to hold off the audit if he amended his return,and clark filed the amendment.
taxpayer myers 
in,clark met with taxpayer myers myers,a plumber,to prepare his federal tax return.clark provided myers with a business card that described clark as a paralegal tax consultant and chief executive of the tax people,and clark further described himself as a former irs agent.myers paid clark a fixed fee and,at clark request,signed a power of attorney.clark advised myers on various tax issues.
when clark presented myers his completed return,myers noticed that,although the return accurately listed his employment earnings,it falsely reported his filing status and reflected a totally false business loss of approximately.myers did not provide clark with any documentation that could support such a loss and told clark that it was pretty bogus.clark,however,assured myers that he knew the in s and outs,that w e send it in and you wo have to worry about no taxes,you know,and that people in business should have to be paying all these taxes.as a result of clark filing,myers reported taxable income of.clark later prepared myers return,which was similarly false.
taxpayers and halsell 
clark met with taxpayers and halsell the halsells and explained to them that he had special knowledge of doing the taxes so that people can get what was owed to them that the government does tell them.he gave them references and showed them prior returns on which he had obtained substantial refunds.the halsells provided clark with their tax documents and agreed to pay his fee and a percentage of their refund,and clark then told them that he would return home to input their information into a special computer that nobody else has.clark also had the halsells sign a power of attorney and blank tax forms.
clark subsequently prepared the halsells return and electronically filed it with the irs without ever showing it to them.the return accurately listed their wages but falsely reported a business loss of approximately.this rendered the halsells taxable income and resulted in a refund of approximately.notably,the halsells never provided clark with any information that could support the claimed business loss.clark further prepared amended returns for the halsells for and,totally wiping out their previously reported taxable income with false business losses.
the investigation 
beginning in,the irs contacted each of the fifteen taxpayers for whom clark had prepared returns and informed them that it would be auditing their returns.each attempted to contact clark to seek his advice as to how to proceed.however,clark refused to return their calls and engaged in stalling tactics.he also refused to return their financial records to them.
in may,irs criminal investigators began to look into clark alleged fraudulent activities.during the investigation,agents searched clark trash.the search revealed,inter alia business cards describing clark as a tax consultant and paralegal who offered tax advice and tax preparation for business individual returns and that described clark as the owner of his business numerous taxpayer documents and records,including the halsells electronic filing forms and myers wife unfiled separate return file folders with the names of various taxpayers a notice from the irs to another of the fifteen taxpayers and copies of processed checks payable to clark that were drawn on two of the taxpayers bank accounts.notwithstanding this evidence,clark denied preparing any tax returns or knowing any of these people.following audits,the irs determined that all fifteen taxpayers owed additional taxes.
procedural history 
this case followed a long,tortured path from indictment to eventual conviction,due almost entirely to clark requests for continuances and new counsel.because of its importance to clark speedy trial act claim,we detail this procedural history at some length.
on march,a grand jury indicted clark on five counts of willfully aiding and assisting the preparation of false tax returns,in violation of,and five counts of presenting false claims for tax refunds,in violation of.days later,on may,clark filed the first of five unopposed motions for continuances,resulting in delays that were excludable from speedy trial act calculations from may,to february.after two days elapsed,the at clark two additional continuances,resulting in excludable delays from february,to may.for each of the seven continuances,the court expressly found that the interest of justice necessitated the continuance.one of these continuance requests resulted from clark back surgery,and defense counsel jack carter carter requested the others to peruse the discovery,prepare for trial,and discuss possible pleas with the government because he felt he had an ethical obligation to present such an option to his client.
on may,clark filed a pro se motion to dismiss his indictment with prejudice for violation of the speedy trial act,to dismiss his counsel,and to be appointed new counsel.the court denied the motion on may.
on may,the government moved for a continuance because the may,rescheduled trial date conflicted with the prosecutor daughter graduation from the air force academy.the court granted the continuance in the interest of justice and set the trial for july.
on june,the government sought a second continuance.government counsel explained that the july,rescheduled trial date conflicted with another trial that government counsel was prosecuting in another city and that continuity of counsel was extremely important in the case because it involved complex evidentiary and proof issues.the court once again continued the trial,ultimately setting it for january.its order did not expressly note that the continuance was in the interest of justice.
on january,clark filed a second pro se motion to dismiss his attorney and request that the court appoint him new counsel,and on january,he again filed a pro se motion to dismiss on speedy trial act grounds,which the court denied.on january,clark attorney,jack carter,moved to withdraw as counsel,citing a total lack of communication,preventing an adequate defense,following clark repeated motions to dismiss him as counsel.the court permitted carter to withdraw and appointed albert rodriguez as new counsel.it reset the trial for march.
defendant filed a pro se interlocutory appeal of the court denial of his motion to dismiss,which this court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.see united states clark,cir.while the interlocutory appeal was pending,the district court permitted rodriguez to withdraw for medical reasons and appointed charles muller as defense counsel.the court reset the trial for june.
on april,defense counsel filed another motion to dismiss the indictment with prejudice on speedy trial act grounds.one week later,on may,clark,pro se,moved to dismiss his indictment based on ineffective assistance of counsel.muller moved to withdraw the following day,citing conflicts that made representation impossible.
on may,the district court held a hearing on clark speedy trial act motion.it noted that it would be very reluctant to dismiss the indictment with prejudice in light of the fact that it saw absolutely no impropriety in the way the government has tried to handle this matter and that clark bore responsibility for some of the delay.the court specifically noted clark unfortunate struggles with his o wn mental health and its difficulty find ing a lawyer to represent him through these episodes.it further explained,
w hat i have before me is a case that being initially handled by two outstanding lawyers,carter for the defendant,harris for the government.it is the practice in this jurisdiction for lawyers to work together.it the practice of lawyers to try to make sure that no case is prematurely pushed to trial while there are matters that need to be considered.you know,it would really,to me,be unfortunate if the kind of professional courtesies that were shown by attorneys to each other and which make the court system operate in a good way,if those courtesies lead to the dismissal of cases that at least need to be looked at by juries.
the government and the court expressed a willingness to move up the trial date to the following week,but clark declined.
on june,the court dismissed the indictment on speedy trial act grounds because of its uncertain ty that the june order sufficiently stopped the speedy trial clock.the court determined,however,after balancing the required statutory factors,see a,that the dismissal should be without prejudice.
on july,a grand jury clark for the same offenses.the court denied his subsequent motion to dismiss,in which clark asserted that the court should have previously dismissed his indictment with prejudice for violation of the speedy trial act.an jury trial commenced on october,and the jury found clark guilty on november.the court sentenced clark to concurrent terms of and imprisonment.following various motions,clark timely appealed.
ii.jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction over this case because clark was charged with violations of federal law.see.we have jurisdiction over clark appeal from the final judgment of the district court.see see also.
iii.discussion 
speedy trial act claim 
clark first asserts that the district court abused its discretion when it dismissed his original indictment for violation of the speedy trial act,without prejudice.he contends that the court improperly weighed the factors relevant to the decision to dismiss with or without prejudice for violation of the act.
standard of review 
we review a district court decision to dismiss an indictment without prejudice for noncompliance with the speedy trial act for an abuse of discretion.united states blevins,cir citing united states taylor,d.w hen the statutory factors are properly considered,and supporting factual findings are not clearly in error,the district court judgment of how opposing considerations balance should not lightly be disturbed.taylor,at.united states cobb,cir.the defendant has the burden of proving that dismissal of his case pursuant to a balancing of the statutory factors is appropriate.blevins,at.
the speedy trial act provides that if a defendant who enters a plea of not guilty is not brought to trial within seventy days from the filing date of his indictment,the indictment shall be dismissed on the defendant motion.c,a.such dismissal may be with or without prejudice a district court is not required to dismiss an indictment with prejudice for every violation of the speedy trial act.blevins,at accord taylor,at.t he decision whether to dismiss a complaint under the speedy trial act with or without prejudice is entrusted to the sound discretion of the district judge and no preference is accorded to either kind of dismissal.united states melguizo,cir quoting united states,cir omission in melguizo.we have explained that a lthough not as harsh a sanction as dismissal with prejudice,dismissal without prejudice is meaningful because it,inter alia,forces the government to obtain a new indictment if it decides to reprosecute as well as exposes the prosecution to dismissal on statute of limitations grounds.blevins,at.
in determining whether a dismissal of an indictment for noncompliance with the speedy trial act should be with or without prejudice,the district court at least must consider the seriousness of the offense,the facts and circumstances of the case which led to the dismissal,and the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of the speedy trial act and on the administration of justice.id.citing a.
factor one seriousness of the offense 
clark sole argument that the first seriousness of the in favor of dismissal with prejudice is that his conduct is less serious than other tax related matters which have been prosecuted in the federal courts.he contends that the seriousness of his alleged crime is limited because the tax loss to the government was only,whereas other frauds have resulted in millions or billions of dollars in losses to the government.moreover,he avers that the span of over a year during which he allegedly perpetrated his frauds is not significant because tax season is limited and returns are prepared only once a year.
we conclude,however,that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that clark crime was serious enough to favor dismissing without prejudice.the court noted that clark,charged with ten counts of felony tax fraud,conceded that his charged offenses are serious,and it considered that various courts have classified nonviolent crimes involving mendacity as serious offenses for speedy trial purposes.the court correctly recognized that even though some crimes may be more serious than clark criminal conduct,this does not require a finding that clark fraud was not serious.as the sixth circuit explained in another tax fraud case,
while a primary method of judging the seriousness of an offense is by comparing it to other crimes,that does not mean that a mechanical test based upon the guidelines must be used to label an offense serious or not serious.rather,the speedy trial act requirement that courts must consider the seriousness of the offense simply demands that the gravity of the crime be carefully considered as a factor in deciding whether to dismiss without prejudice.there are many crimes more serious than the defendant income tax evasion,as well as many less serious.the district court reasonably considered this factor and properly balanced it with the other factors.
united states pierce,cir.the district court here properly refused to apply a mechanical test to judge the seriousness of clark alleged offenses.it carefully considered the gravity of clark alleged crimes.the court further noted that clark alleged frauds occurred over the span of more than a year and that clark,therefore,allegedly persisted in illegal conduct over a span of time.the district court thus acted within its discretion in determining that clark offenses were serious for speedy trial act purposes.
factor two facts and circumstances of the case which led to the dismissal 
clark argues that the second of the facts and circumstances of his case which led to the in favor of dismissal with prejudice given the actual delay of this case from appearance to trial.however,as the supreme court recently explained,a n assigned counsel failure to move the case forward does not warrant attribution of delay to the state,and j ust as a state deliberate attempt to delay the trial in order to hamper the defense should be weighted heavily against the state,so too should a defendant deliberate attempt to disrupt proceedings be weighted heavily against the defendant.vermont brillon,d final alteration in original citation and internal quotation marks omitted.when considering delays for which the government is responsible,we look to whether the government sought the delays for ulterior purposes as well as whether the government failure to meet deadlines was repetitive,regular,and frequent with respect to this defendant.blevins,at.
here,the overwhelming majority of the delays resulted from the conduct of clark and his attorneys.indeed,clark does not argue that the government ever acted with bad faith to intentionally delay his trial.the district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting clark,post hoc testimony that his prior attorneys requests for continuances were contrary to his wishes.the court recognized that lawyers have a professional obligation to pursue all possible outcomes for their clients and refused to speculate as to the reasons for carter extensive plea bargaining.it noted that carter is an excellent attorney with the professional responsibility to investigate numerous and various forms of relief for his client.indeed,delays sought by counsel are ordinarily attributable to the defendants they represent.brillon.at.moreover,the district court specifically expressed concern that clark was attempting to use the speedy trial act as both a sword and a shield.see united states willis,cir noting concern that a defendant not be able to have it both ways by convincing the district court that delay was appropriate and then using that delay to obtain a dismissal.
the record further undermines clark claim that all of the continuances in this case were contrary to his personal position that he wanted to proceed to trial as soon as possible.as the district court found,clark pro se motions to dismiss his appointed attorneys contributed to the delay,and one continuance resulted from clark back surgery.furthermore,clark did not file his first pro se motion to dismiss on speedy trial act grounds until over a year after he was indicted.additionally,notwithstanding clark claim that he did not want to plea bargain,given clark attorney ethical duty of zealous representation,the attorney requests for continuances to peruse the discovery,prepare for trial,and satisfy an ethical obligation by discussing possible pleas with the government should not weigh in favor of dismissal with prejudice on speedy trial act grounds.
in light of these facts,the supreme court recent instruction in brillon,and clark failure to allege any governmental impropriety,the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that this factor weighed in favor of dismissal without prejudice.
factor three impact of a reprosecution on the administration of the speedy trial act and on the administration of justice 
the final speedy trial act factor encompasses three concerns t he defendant right to a timely trial the deterrent effect of a prejudicial dismissal on the government repeated violations of the speedy trial requirements and the public interest in bringing the accused to trial.united states,cir.it also implicates the presence or absence of prejudice to the defendant.id.
here,the district court found that,although the public has a great interest in bringing to trial defendants who have been accused of serious crimes,this factor weighs in favor of dismissal with prejudice,given clark suggestions that his own mental health has suffered as a result of prolonged prosecution,a condition which would worsen with reprosecution.notably,the court never suggested that clark suffered prejudice to his defense as a result of the delays.
after weighing each of the above factors,the district court determined that dismissal without prejudice was proper.clark does not assert that any of the court factual findings were clearly erroneous rather,he merely disagrees with the court decision to dismiss without prejudice given the facts it found.the supreme court has explained that a district court decision on a speedy trial act motion should not lightly be disturbed when the statutory factors are properly considered and supporting factual findings are not clearly in error.taylor,at.this is precisely the case here.moreover,we have admonished that w hen the charges are serious,courts should impose the sanction of dismissal with prejudice only for a correspondingly serious delay,especially in the absence of a showing of prejudice.united states may,cir accord,at.accordingly,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing clark indictment without prejudice for violation of the speedy trial act.
sufficiency of the evidence claim 
clark additionally challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction,arguing that the government failed to prove that he actually prepared the fraudulent tax returns or that he knew that the returns were false.these claims lack merit.
standard of review 
we have explained that our assessment of the sufficiency of the evidence is deferential to the jury verdict.united states holley,cir.we will affirm the jury decision if,viewing the evidence and the inferences that may be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the verdict,a rational jury could have found the essential elements of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt.id.quoting united states,cir accord jackson virginia,d.it is not necessary that the evidence exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt,provided a reasonable trier of fact could find that the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.united states bell,cir.unit b en banc accord holley,at.the factfinders may properly use their common sense and evaluate the facts in light of their common knowledge of the natural tendencies and inclinations of human beings.united states ayala,cir quoting united states henry,cir.in arriving at its verdict,a jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence.bell,at.t he standard for review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction is the same whether the evidence is direct or circumstantial.united states bryant,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
any person who w illfully aids or assists in,or procures,counsels,or advises the preparation or presentation under,or in connection with any matter arising under,the internal revenue laws,of a return,affidavit,claim,or other document,which is fraudulent or is false as to any material matter,whether or not such falsity or fraud is with the knowledge or consent of the person authorized or required to present such return,affidavit,claim,or document shall be guilty of a felony 
thus,a conviction under this section requires proof that the defendant willfully aided,assisted,counseled,or advised another in the preparation or presentation under the internal revenue laws of a document that is fraudulent or false as to any material matter.united states clark,cir.
notably,we have held that a person need not actually sign or prepare a false tax return to either conspire to or actually aid and abet the filing of a false income tax return.united states williams,cir see also united states coveney,cir a person need not actually sign or prepare a tax return to aid in its preparation.united states wolfson,cir noting that a defendant does not have to sign or prepare the return to be amenable to prosecution under.rather,the express words of the statute provide that a defendant need only knowingly assist or advise the preparation or presentation of a fraudulent or false return.see id.requiring a person to actually make and subscribe any return to be criminally liable under that subsection.as the sixth circuit has explained,relies on a theory of liability akin to complicity it criminalizes an act that facilitates another person c
