this case turns upon the interpretation of two interrelated,statutes.during the period from fiscal year fy through fy,welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c made the state payment of cost of living adjustments cola to calwork grants dependent each year upon california motorists receipt of any increase in tax relief pursuant to a separate statute,former revenue and taxation code former section in,tax offsets for motorists under revenue and taxation code section were first suspended and later reinstated by executive action.
respondents,a certified class of welfare recipients,petitioned for a writ of mandate to compel payment of a cola they alleged was due on october,pursuant to welfare and institutions code section.we conclude the trial court reached an incorrect interpretation of the relevant statutes and the judgment must be reversed.
background 
history of the applicable statutes 
california imposes an annual licensing fee on all vehicles registered in the state,et this fee,which is construed as a tax city of los angeles riley cal d,was set at percent of the vehicle market value before january,in,the fee was reduced to percent of market value,as amended by stats,ch.
legislation 
effective august,the legislature passed a tax relief measure that provided for a series of potential future offsets against the vehicle licensing fee vlf.stats,ch,enacting former.the enactment of section set up an intricate system through which various offset levels could be triggered based upon forecasts of the state general fund revenues.the statute dictated an offset of percent for vlf in and,and it established percent as the default offset for years through,subd.b.in,motorists could receive a percent offset if the forecast of general fund revenue for fy reached a designated level,subd.b.in,the statute provided for vlf offsets of percent or percent depending upon the amount of general fund revenues forecast for fy and the previous year offset level,subds.b.in years through,beyond the percent default,motorists could receive vlf offsets of,or,depending upon the amount of general fund revenues forecast for the fiscal year and the previous year offset level,subds.b.
contemporaneous with its enactment of the vlf statute,the legislature amended the statute governing adjustments to welfare grants made to reflect increases or,theoretically,decreases in the cost of living.stats,ch,amending former welf.these amendments to welfare and institutions code section,which went into effect one day after the vlf statute was enacted,made the state obligation to pay welfare cola in years through dependent upon the level of tax relief provided to motorists under the vlf statute.specifically,a new provision in the cola statute provided in any fiscal year commencing with the fiscal year to the fiscal year,inclusive,when there is any increase in tax relief pursuant to the applicable paragraph of subdivision a of section of the revenue and taxation code,then the increase pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall occur.in any fiscal year commencing with the fiscal year to the fiscal year,inclusive,when there is no increase in tax relief pursuant to the applicable paragraph of subdivision a of section of the revenue and taxation code,then any increase pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be suspended.welf,subd.c,as amended by stats,ch.previously,the statute directed that no cola be paid in fy through fy and that payment of the cola for fy be delayed by four months,until november,subd.c.the amendments also directed that cola were to be become effective on october of any year in which they were required,subd.a.
legislation 
after the amendments,the cola statute was not amended again until.stats,ch.in the meantime,the legislature amended the vlf statute twice and enacted a related statute.stats,ch,stats,ch,stats,ch.
effective july,the vlf statute was amended to provide that a percent offset would be applied to all vlf with a final due date in the calendar year beginning january.stats,ch,amending,subds.a b.statutory provisions for offsets in other years were left unchanged.
the vlf statute itself was not amended in however,on july,a new statute,revenue and taxation code section,went into effect,providing additional tax relief to motorists.stats,ch.this statute directed the department of motor vehicles dmv to calculate an additional offset for motorists during and if the vlf offset required by section was less than percent.former,subd.a,as amended by stats,ch.thus,payments from the dmv under former revenue and taxation code section were essentially rebates issued to bring the total vlf offset level in years and to percent.the statute further provided that vlf offsets implemented pursuant to revenue and taxation code section would be at least percent in and and would be equal to percent in and thereafter,former,subd.a.
the legislature revised the vlf statute substantially in.effective july,revenue and taxation code section,subdivision a was changed to designate only three vlf offset levels,and percent.stats,ch.a revision of subdivision b provided that the percent offset applied to vlf with a final due date in calendar year,the percent offset applied to vlf due after january,and before july,and the percent offset would apply to all vlf due on or after july.subd.b.in the same bill,the legislature repealed revenue and taxation code section stats,ch,thus ending the dmv obligation to increase vlf offsets through rebates.
finally,as part of a bill that amended many social welfare provisions,the legislature amended the cola statute effective september.stats,ch.the only change was the addition of a new subdivision c,which stated notwithstanding paragraph making cola payments dependent upon an increase in tax relief under the vlf statute,an adjustment to the maximum aid payments set forth in subdivision a of section shall be made under this section for the fiscal year,but the adjustment shall become effective june.welf,subd.c,as amended by stats,ch.
executive actions 
the state paid cola to calwork recipients on october,and october.by operation of the amendments to the cola statute,payment of the october,cola was postponed until june.welf,subd.c.
all versions of revenue and taxation code section provided that vlf offsets could be reduced during periods when insufficient moneys were available from the general fund to fund them,subd.a c,c c.citing this provision,on june,the director of the department of finance notified the dmv and the department of housing and community development that insufficient general fund moneys were available to fund any portion of vlf offsets.vlf offsets were thereby suspended beginning in june.in addition,no cola was paid to welfare recipients on october.
during his gubernatorial campaign in the fall of,arnold schwarzenegger promised to repeal the car tax increase,the suspension of vlf had recently occurred under governor gray davis administration.governor davis was recalled in a special election,and governor schwarzenegger took office on november.on his first day in office,governor schwarzenegger issued executive order number.the order stated that the june,letter from the director of finance suspending vlf offsets was rescinded and shall be of no force and effect.governor exec.order no.the order directed the dmv to reinstate the percent vlf offset provided by revenue and taxation code section,subdivision a a version as soon as administratively feasible and to refund to taxpayers all overpayments of vehicle license fees paid since june,in excess of amounts due after taking into account the offset provided by revenue and taxation code section,subdivision a a.governor exec.order no.
ii.writ of mandate proceedings 
on december,respondent class members filed a petition for writ of mandate seeking an order compelling the governor and rita saenz,director of the department of social services at that time to issue a supplemental cola for october through december and adjust all calwork grants beginning in january to reflect the addition of this other words,to pay a cola retroactive to october.the trial court sustained a demurrer to this petition with leave to amend.the amended petition set forth two theories under which the class claimed a cola was owed.first,the petition alleged the percent vlf offset mandated by the executive order was itself an increase in tax relief triggering payment under the cola statute.second,the petition alleged governor schwarzenegger order created an increase in tax relief requiring payment of the cola because it effectively raised the vlf offset from zero,which it had been under the davis administration,to percent.the trial court overruled a demurrer to this petition and granted a writ of mandate on the class first theory deeming the second moot.judgment was entered on may,and the court issued the writ on june,this appeal followed on june.
iii.subsequent statutory developments 
in august,the legislature amended the vlf and cola statutes again.effective august,revenue and taxation code section was amended to state that the percent offset would apply to vlf due between july,and january,and the vlf statute would be repealed effective january.stats,ch,amending,subds.a,b d.at the same time,the legislature amended revenue and taxation code sections and to reduce the vlf rate from percent of a vehicle market value to percent of market value,beginning january.stats,ch.thus,rather than continuing with a relatively high,fixed licensing fee and a system of reducing that fee by a series of offsets,the legislature did away with the offsets and simply reduced the licensing fee.
pursuant to the terms of welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c,payment of cola was linked to increased tax relief under the vlf statute only for the period between fy and fy.effective august,the legislature amended the cola statute to suspend for three months the cola for fy.stats,ch,amending welf,subd.d.then,in july,the legislature amended welfare and institutions code section again to suspend cola entirely in fy and.welf,subd.c.
discussion 
as of october,date respondents argue a cola should have been and institutions code section linked payment of cola to increased tax relief under revenue and taxation code section,and revenue and taxation code section provided that,from july,onward,all vlf would be offset by percent,subds.a,b,as amended by,ch.under the simple terms of the vlf statute that had been in effect since july,tax relief remained stable at percent during fy.thus,the vlf statute provided no increase in tax relief that year to trigger a cola under welfare and institutions code section.
according to the respondent class,however,matters were not so simple.respondents offered two arguments below for why a cola was required despite the plain language of the cola and vlf statutes,and they repeat these arguments here.in the first,respondents maintain that the cola statute made a specific reference to revenue and taxation code section as that statute was written in august.thus,respondents argue,when the cola statute linked the requirement of a cola to any increase in tax relief under the vlf statute,this meant any increase above the default level of percent that could be attained under the complicated scheme of offsets and triggers laid out in the vlf statute.in the second argument,respondents contend that even though no statutory increase in the vlf offset level occurred in,a cola was nevertheless required because,as a result of governor davis suspension of all offsets and governor schwarzenegger reinstatement of the percent offset,motorists received an actual increase in tax relief that zero to percent.the trial court accepted the first of these arguments and,having so decided,declined to address the second.
interpretation of a statute raises pure questions of law.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d.accordingly,we review the trial court resolution of these matters de novo.sneed saenz th,d.
interpretation of the cola statute 
the primary goal in construing a statute is to ascertain legislative intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the law,fair employment housing com.cal d.to do so,we first examine the language of the statute,giving the words their ordinary,commonsense meaning and according significance to all words used,if possible.id.at,lewis county of sacramento th,d.the statute words generally provide the most reliable indicator of legislative intent if they are clear and unambiguous,t here is no need for judicial construction and a court may not indulge in it.diamond multimedia systems,superior court cal th,d.lewis county of sacramento,supra,th at,d see also people pecci th,d.however,where the statutory language is ambiguous on its face or is shown to have a latent ambiguity such that it does not provide a definitive answer,we may resort to extrinsic sources to determine legislative intent.citations.lewis county of sacramento,supra,th at,d.
no cola required in under plain language of the statute 
as discussed,the cola statute was amended in to make the issuance of cola dependent upon the existence,in any fiscal year from to,of any increase in tax relief pursuant to the applicable paragraph of subdivision a of section of the revenue and taxation code.welf,subd.c,as amended by stats,ch.this revenue and taxation code statute,in turn,described a complicated series of offset levels,subd.a and triggers,subd.b,as amended by stats,ch,through which motorists could receive tax relief in fiscal years through.to determine whether a cola was statutorily required in october,we must discern what the legislature meant in by the phrase any increase in tax relief added to the cola statute.see people frawley th,d questions of legislative intent must be considered as of the time when the enactment under scrutiny was adopted see also people cruz cal th,d,the words of a statute are to be interpreted in the sense in which they would have been understood at the time of the enactment.did it mean an increase over the previous year tax relief,as appellants argue or,did it mean an increase over the baseline offset of percent laid out in the vlf statute,as respondents contend and,a related question,did the legislature intend to make a reference to the vlf statute,or did it intend the reference to incorporate future amendments that might be made to the vlf statute 
recently,in doe saenz th,d,we discussed the rules of construction that apply when a statute incorporates another statute that changes over time the matter essentially boils down to a question of legislative intent where,as here,the words of an incorporating statute do not make clear whether it contemplates only a incorporation in re jovan cal th,d,see also people anderson cal th,d,people frawley,supra,th at,d.respondents interpretation of increase in tax relief welf,subd.c as meaning any increase above the percent baseline offset in the vlf statute makes sense only if the legislature intended a reference to the version of revenue and taxation code section.in,the vlf statute was amended to eliminate the previous system of multiple offset levels and triggers,consequently rendering the percent baseline irrelevant.stats,ch,a,b.by october,the percent default no longer existed.in contrast,appellants interpretation of increase in tax relief as meaning increase over the prior year makes sense regardless of whether the reference to revenue and taxation code section was intended to be general,incorporating later changes or specific.the state obligation to pay a welfare cola depended upon whether motorists received increased tax relief,under any version of revenue and taxation code section,as compared with the year before.
the key question in this appeal thus centers on the meaning of the triggering phrase any increase in tax relief pursuant to the applicable paragraph of subdivision a of section of the revenue and taxation code.welf,subd.c.the plain meaning of increase is to grow larger in size or amount.webster new collegiate dict.to become progressively greater as in size,amount,number,or intensity.when a statute refers to an increase occurring i n any fiscal year.welf,subd.c,it is logical to construe increase as meaning an increase over the previous year therefore,appellants interpretation of increase as a growth in the vlf offset level from one year to the next has commonsense appeal.as the vlf statute was written in,it was conceivable that offset levels could fluctuate depending on the health of the general fund.under appellants interpretation,cola were required only when the vlf offset level was increased compared with the previous fiscal year if a lower offset was imposed,or if the offset level remained stable,cola would have been suspended.this,in our view,is a perfectly reasonable interpretation of how the statutes were intended to work.in any year when motorists received greater tax relief than they had the year before,welfare recipients would be entitled to a cola.
respondents encourage us to reject this plain meaning of increase,however,based on legislative history of the vlf statute describing the percent reduction as a permanent offset that would pertain each year unless specified contingencies permitted implementation of a higher offset an increase for purposes of the cola statute,according to respondents.legis.counsel,assem.bill reg.sess.stats,ch.legis.counsel,assem.bill reg.sess.stats,ch.none of the legislative counsel summaries or committee reports we have reviewed describe these higher offset levels as increases,however.if the legislature had intended its use of increase in the cola statute to mean the implementation of a superseding vlf offset level,one would expect the word increase to appear prominently in the legislative history of the vlf statute,if not in the statute itself.one report analyzing the bill that enacted revenue and taxation code section described the percent vlf reduction as permanent and noted that i n future fiscal years,the reduction in the vlf rate could be increased if certain conditions are met.assem.budget,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.but this report actually undermines respondents position because it explains how the complex system of superseding offsets created by the vlf statute provided for the implementation of new,higher,permanent offset levels.as the report explained the reduction in future vlf rate reductions is conditioned upon revenues reaching certain target amounts.if these targets are met for two consecutive years,the vlf rate reductions would become permanent.a fiscal year target amount would have to be met for two consecutive fiscal years before the tax reduction would become permanent.if the target is not met for two fiscal years the reduction would fall back to the previous vlf rate.assem.budget,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.in other words,although percent was the starting baseline,new baselines could be established in later years depending upon the state revenues.if the legislature intended the default vlf offset to be a moving target,growing in step with growth in general revenues,the idea that welfare cola were to be linked to increases from this evolving baseline becomes a system would have been hopelessly complicated.moreover,the fact that the vlf statute anticipated new permanent offset levels contradicts respondents view of the percent offset level as a static baseline,frozen in time for four years,from which any upward deviation would trigger the requirement of a welfare cola.
extrinsic evidence does not support a contrary interpretation 
to support of their interpretation,respondents raise several arguments based on facts and inferences external to the statutes themselves.we conclude none of this extrinsic evidence supports a departure from the commonsense meaning of the statutory language.
absurd results 
respondents assert the legislature could not have intended increase in the cola statute to mean increase over the prior year because such an interpretation could have led to perverse and absurd results.specifically,they note that,because of the way the triggers worked in the vlf statute,yearly increases in vlf offsets would have occurred only if state revenues grew at a gradual rate.if revenues grew faster,triggering high vlf offset levels that then leveled off,there would be fewer opportunities for welfare recipients to obtain cola.or,as respondents put it,welfare recipients would lose out because the state finances were stronger.to some extent,this argument puts the cart before the horse.although the literal meaning of statutory language may be disregarded to avoid absurd results,this exception should be used most sparingly by the judiciary and only in extreme cases else we violate the separation of powers principle of government.citation.citation.people pecci,supra,th at,d.
underlying respondents absurdity argument is the assumption that the legislature wished to provide yearly cola whenever state revenues were increasing.respondents cite no legislative history to support this view.in fact,the few indications we have of legislative intent appear to contradict any generous intent to provide cola by default.welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c specifically directed that no cola were to be paid from through.payment of the cola was delayed by four months.welf,subd.c,as amended by stats,ch.then,when it enacted assembly bill number in,the legislature made payment of a cola dependent for four years on the implementation of increased tax relief for motorists.welf,subd.c,as amended by stats,ch.although the trial court concluded this bill was intended to give welfare recipients increased benefits during a time of economic prosperity,no legislative history supports this share the wealth notion.the legislative counsel summary of assembly bill number noted only that the bill would revise the dates when cola would be made effective and would suspend the adjustments during specified fiscal years if there has been no increase in tax relief.legis.counsel,assem.bill reg.sess.stats,ch.no legislative history suggests an intention to grant cola more frequently 
nor have we found support for the trial court version of legislative intent.the court stated i t clear that the legislature in this case intended that any time a vehicle owner gets a decrease in the amount of vehicle tax that is otherwise due,that decrease becomes an increase in tax relief,which triggers the cola.under the trial court summary,a cola would have been required when there was any decrease in,when any tax relief was provided,not just when motorists benefited from increased tax relief.
the interpretation of welfare and institutions code section advanced by respondents and the trial court is not directly supported by legislative history,and in our view it contradicts the plain meaning of the statutory language.the language required a cola when there is any increase in tax relief under the vlf statute.welf,subd.c,as amended by stats,ch,italics added.under respondents interpretation,any tax relief under the vlf statute would have triggered a cola so long as it was above the floor of percent,subd.a.needless to say,this percent baseline appears nowhere in the welfare and institutions code statute.more importantly,respondents interpretation like the trial court summary of legislative intent essentially reads the word increase out of the cola statute.an appellate court should be loathe to construe a statute which has the effect of adding or subtracting language.citation.people pecci,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted see also jurcoane superior court th,d.if the legislature had intended to mandate welfare cola every time motorists received tax relief,or tax relief of greater than percent,it could easily have said so.
moreover,considering the plain meaning of increase,it is respondents appellants that carries the potential for absurd results.see sneed saenz,supra,th at,d a statutory construction leading to absurd consequences is disfavored jurcoane superior court,supra,th at,d same.if the vlf offset ever declined from one fiscal year to the next for example,going from percent to percent,a cola would be required under respondents construction of welfare and institutions code section even though california motorists clearly would have experienced a decrease in tax relief.
subsequent executive action 
respondents also contend legislative intent supporting their interpretation can be inferred from the fact that cola were paid to welfare recipients in,and despite a stable vlf offset level in two of these years.what happened to vlf tax relief during this period is complex.welfare and institutions code section linked cola to increased vlf tax relief in fiscal years through and required that they be made effective on october of any year in which they were required.welf,subd.a.as of october,first year of the statutory version of the vlf statute in effect stated that an unconditional offset of percent was to be provided in calendar year,subd.b,and an offset of percent was to be provided again in calendar year if the director of finance certified that a revenue target had been met,subd.b.the vlf statute on its own did not provide for increased tax relief,if increase is construed as increase over the prior year,because the statute dictated an offset of percent in both and.thus,appellants interpretation of the statutes suggests a cola was not required in nevertheless,the department of finance provided a cola on october.
this fact does not require us to reject appellants reading of the statutes,however.the reason a cola was provided in despite the existence of a stable vlf offset under revenue and taxation code section may lie in the legislature enactment that year of additional tax relief for motorists through a separate statute.effective july,revenue and taxation code section required the department of motor vehicles to provide rebates to increase motorists tax relief beyond the levels outlined in the vlf statute.stats,ch,enacting former.thus,in calendar year,motorists would receive an effective offset of percent by operation of revenue and taxation code sections and.it may have appeared that a cola was required due to this effective increase in vlf tax relief,even though the increase was not pursuant only to the applicable paragraph of subdivision a of section of the revenue and taxation code welf,subd.c.given the complexity of this statutory scheme,and the undeniable increase in tax relief motorists were slated to receive during calendar year,it is not surprising that payment of a welfare cola was authorized in october.under the circumstances,this extrinsic evidence does not convince us to abandon the plain language of the cola statute in favor of respondents ingenious interpretation.
the payment of a cola in october does not support respondents position because this cola was required in any event under appellants interpretation of welfare and institutions code section.effective july,the legislature amended the vlf statute to provide for three offset levels percent in,percent in,and percent after july,former,subd.b.accordingly,by the express terms of the vlf statute,there was an increase in tax relief from to percent in such that a cola was required.although the effective offset remained static,because of the rebate program previously in effect under,former welfare and institutions code section did not condition cola on actual tax relief received.cola were expressly conditioned on increased tax relief pursuant to the applicable paragraph of subdivision a of section of the revenue and taxation code.welf,subd.c,as amended by stats,ch.
a cola was paid again in october,when tax relief remained stable at percent by operation of revenue and taxation code section as amended in july.however,as we shall explain,this payment does not support respondents interpretation because the legislature expressly authorized a cola notwithstanding the requirement of an increase in vlf tax relief,which would otherwise have precluded the cola.welf,subd.c effective september.payment of the cola under such express authorization does not suggest the legislature believed a cola was due,because the vlf offset was higher than percent rather,it evidences the contrary belief that a cola was not otherwise required.
subsequent legislative action 
finally,although respondents direct us to legislative history surrounding its enactment,the september amendment to welfare and institutions code section lends support to appellants interpretation.although subsequent declarations of the legislature are not binding authority,they are appropriate for the court to consider as evidence of the original legislative intent for a measure.people cruz,supra,cal th at,d,eu chacon cal d.effective september,the legislature amended welfare and institutions code section to add a single paragraph,subdivision c.stats,ch.this new paragraph said notwithstanding paragraph,an adjustment to the maximum aid payments set forth in subdivision a of section shall be made under this section for the fiscal year,but the adjustment shall become effective june.welf,subd.c,italics added.at the time of this amendment,the vlf statute provided for a single offset level of percent,without condition,for all vlf with a final due date after july,subds.a,b,as amended by stats,ch.accordingly,tax relief provided under the vlf statute did not increase from year to year after july,and so,under appellants interpretation of the cola statute,no cola would have been due in october.the legislature seemed to share this interpretation because it directed that a cola was to be paid for n otwithstanding the requirement in subdivision c of an increase in vlf tax relief.welf,subd.c.this language suggests the legislature thought a cola was not required under subdivision c and had to be expressly authorized.true,the amendment also delayed the payment of this cola from october to june,and respondents assert this was the sole purpose of the amendment.however,this reading ignores the opening words of the amendment notwithstanding the link to the vlf statute,an adjustment to the maximum aid payments set forth in subdivision a of section shall be made a construction that renders statutory language superfluous or unnecessary is disfavored.dix superior court cal d,people frawley,supra,th at,d.moreover,if the only purpose of the amendment was to change the date when the cola was to be paid,the amendment would have referred to subdivision a,which set october as the effective date for cola in fy through fy,not subdivision a,which conditioned cola during these years on an increase in vlf tax relief.
as support for their interpretation,respondents rely on a statement in legislative committee reports noting that the amendment would d elay the statutorily required adjustment for recipients of calworks from october,to june.assem.budget,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended june,see also rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended june.respondents argue the phrase statutorily required suggests the legislature believed a cola was required under the prior law.we reject this interpretation because it contradicts the language of the amendment.although resort to legislative committee reports is appropriate when the meaning of a statute is unclear people cruz,supra,cal th at,fn,d,hogoboom superior court th,d,the actual language of a statute bears far more significance than statements by legislative committee members.i t is the language of the statute itself that has successfully braved the legislative gauntlet.it is that language which has been lobbied for,lobbied against,studied,proposed,drafted,restudied,redrafted,voted on in committee,amended,reamended,analyzed,reanalyzed,voted on by two houses of the legislature,sent to a conference committee,and,after perhaps more lobbying,debate and analysis,finally signed into law by the governor.the same care and scrutiny does not befall the committee reports,caucus analyses,authors statements,legislative counsel digests and other documents which make up a statute legislative history.citation.jurcoane superior court,supra,th at,d.
in short,because vlf tax relief was statutorily fixed at percent from july,forward,there was no increase in tax relief pursuant to the vlf statute during fy.thus,according to the plain meaning of welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c,the state incurred no obligation to pay a cola in october.
ii.effect of executive actions in 
setting aside their interpretation of the relevant statutes,respondents also claim they are entitled to a cola for fy because,after governor davis suspended all vlf offsets in june,governor schwarzenegger november,executive order reinstating the percent offset triggered the state obligation to pay a cola.since these executive actions created a genuine increase in tax relief for zero to argue they constituted an increase in tax relief for purposes of the cola statute.however,this argument ignores the specific language of former welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c.the statute required payment of a cola when there is any increase in tax relief pursuant to the applicable paragraph of subdivision a of section of the revenue and taxation code.welf,subd.c,as amended by stats,ch,italics added.any increase in tax relief california motorists experienced in was provided by governor schwarzenegger executive order,not by the terms of revenue and taxation code section.we need not decide whether the actions of governor davis and governor schwarzenegger were valid exercises of executive power questions the parties here dispute.the point is that the increased vlf offset level in resulted from executive,not legislative,action.welfare and institutions code section could have been written to provide cola whenever tax relief was increased by any means,but it was not the statute expressly describes the triggering mechanism as an increase in tax relief pursuant to the vlf statute.
moreover,as a practical matter,the tax relief actually provided to motorists in remained essentially stable.in his november,executive order,the governor not only reinstated the percent offset,but he also directed the dmv to refund taxpayers all overpayments of vlf made since offsets were suspended in june.governor exec.order no.as a result of these refunds,all vehicle owners benefited from a percent vlf offset in.the question is not whether offsets were eliminated at one time and then reinstated.clearly,they were.but,as a result of governor schwarzenegger order and the refunds,motorists did not experience a true increase in tax relief in let alone an increase pursuant to the vlf statute,as was required to trigger a cola.
finally,respondents rely upon statements from governor schwarzenegger supporting their argument that a cola was required for fy.as part of an agenda submitted to the legislature in november,just after he took office,governor schwarzenegger sought legislation to the calworks cola from the car tax in order to prevent payment of a calworks cola,retroactive to october.governor agenda to.this request was based on the governor understanding that a cola was not provided in october b ecause the car tax was increased,and his belief that a retroactive cola would be required since the car tax increase was being rescinded.likewise,respondents glean support from a november legislative analyst office report,which observed that an executive rollback of the vlf rate,a reinstatement of the vlf offset that had been suspended by governor davis would entail calwork costs.legis.analyst,on california fiscal outlook lao projections through,at.as respondents recognize,however,statements by the governor and the legislative analyst are not binding authority.nor are they even relevant,since the interpretation of law is a uniquely judicial function.people cruz,supra,cal th at,d,see marbury madison cranch.we are not bound to follow a misinterpretation of these complicated statutes voiced by individuals outside the legislature.see people cruz,supra,cal th at,d,refusing to adopt misinformation delivered to the legislature by the legislative counsel digest and other sources.
disposition 
the judgment is reversed and the writ of mandate entered in favor of the respondent class is dissolved.each side shall bear its own costs on appeal.
it is difficult to imagine a more byzantine interrelationship of statutory provisions than this case presents.however,i believe that the trial court correctly found its way through the maze and interpreted the provisions in a manner that conforms to the legislature obvious intent and makes sense of the statutory scheme.the trial court construed the principal section in question in the same manner that every branch of government,including the department of social services itself,had construed the section until the department and unexplained change of heart.the interpretation now urged by the attorney general and adopted by the majority produces a result that is not required by the language of the controlling statute and is irreconcilable with any rational explanation of the purpose behind the statute.hence,i respectfully dissent.
the key provision,as all agree,is welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c section c or the cola statute,as the provision read in and as it remained in in any fiscal year commencing with the fiscal year to the fiscal year,inclusive,when there is any increase in tax relief pursuant to the applicable paragraph of subdivision a of section of the revenue and taxation code,then the increase pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall occur.in any fiscal year commencing with the fiscal year to the fiscal year,inclusive,when there is no increase in tax relief pursuant to the applicable paragraph of subdivision a of section of the revenue and taxation code,then any increase pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be suspended.stats,ch.the dispute centers on the italicized phrase,and the problem arises because revenue and taxation code section section or the vlf statute was repeatedly amended in the manner described in the majority opinion,but section c remained unchanged.
there is no dispute over the basic proposition that what must be determined is what was intended by section c when it was enacted.the words of a statute are to be interpreted in the sense in which they would have been understood at the time of enactment.people cruz cal th,d.when section c was enacted in stats,ch,revenue and taxation code section had just been changed to provide for an offset from the vehicle licensing fee vlf of at least percent for every year from and after,and it contained a series of provisions under which the amount of the offset might be increased to percent,percent,percent or percent in future years depending on the size of forecasted general fund revenue stats,ch.the percent reduction was considered to be permanent,assem.floor analysis,conc.in amends.to assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,assem.floor analysis,conc.in amends.to assem.bill reg.sess.as amended june.when section c referred to any increase in tax relief pursuant to the applicable paragraph of section,it could only have been understood to refer to an increase over the base percent offset.there would have been no point to a specific reference in section c to an increase over the base percent because that is what section already said explicitly.indeed,it is not clear grammatically how or where this additional qualification could have been inserted.
