internal revenue code a authorizes a taxpayer to commence a tax refund suit against the government once a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the internal revenue service irs.section of the limits the government waiver of immunity under a by requiring a taxpayer to file a claim for refund or credit with the irs within a specified period of time.thus,the taxpayer timely filing of such claim with the irs is a jurisdictional prerequisite to maintaining a tax refund suit against the government.see united states dalm,d.in this case,we conclude the district court lacked jurisdiction over refund suit based upon their failure to timely file a refund claim with the irs.
defendant irs granted rolly and joann sorrentino a four month extension of time,or until august,to file their,income tax return.taxpayers,apparently awaiting an inpol report from the irs,maintain they mailed their return to the irs via regular united states postal mail in early march,two and years after its due date on their return,taxpayers claimed a refund of based on excess wage withholding during the taxable year.the irs disallowed taxpayers refund claim as untimely.the irs maintained it had no record of receiving taxpayers return until october.
taxpayers,appearing pro se,filed this lawsuit after the irs disallowed their refund claim.the irs moved for summary judgment based on taxpayers inability to establish the irs received their refund claim on or before august,over the irs objection,the district court applied the common law mailbox rule,which provides proof of mailing of a properly addressed communication bearing proper postage creates a rebuttable presumption the communication was received.accordingly,the district court denied the irs motion 
applying the common law mailbox rule to this case,the sorrentinos are entitled to a rebuttable presumption that they timely filed their refund claim for the tax year upon proof they properly mailed their tax return in time for it to be delivered to the irs before the august,deadline.sorrentino has testified he properly mailed the return in early march,which provided more than ample time for the return to reach the irs in the ordinary course of the mail before the august deadline.sorrentino account of an early march mailing is supported by the march signature date on the photocopied return the irs acknowledges receiving and by sorrentino testimony that he followed up on the status of the return before the october,filing date asserted by the irs.

at the district court encouragement,taxpayers also moved for summary judgment.see id.in response,the irs did not dispute the substance of taxpayers refund claim.rather,the irs argued,among other things,that sorrentino sworn statements of proper mailing in a deposition and affidavit were uncorroborated,and insufficient to establish actual mailing in march.the district court disagreed,holding the united states failed to produce evidence rebutting the presumption arising from the common law mailbox rule that the sorrentinos return was delivered to it and thus filed on or about march.sorrentino united states,d,sorrentino ii.the court entered judgment in favor of taxpayers,awarding them a refund of plus interest.
the irs appeals,arguing supplants the common law mailbox rule,and taxpayers statements are insufficient to establish actual mailing in march.our jurisdiction arises under.we apply the same summary judgment standard to our record examination as the district court and review its judgment de novo.see kinross utah ry,cir.applying this standard,we reverse and remand with instructions to dismiss taxpayers suit for want of subject matter jurisdiction.
the supreme court first acknowledged the common law mailbox rule in rosenthal walker.in rosenthal,a case involving fraud in bankruptcy,the court explained 
the rule is well settled that if a letter properly directed is proved to have been either put into the post office or delivered to the postman,it is presumed,from the known course of business in the post office department,that it reached its destination at the regular time,and was received by the person to whom it was addressed.
id.at.emphasis added.we subsequently applied the mailbox rule in crude oil commissioner,cir.crude oil was a tax deficiency suit arising out of a taxpayer alleged failure to make a timely capital stock election.although we did not describe the taxpayer evidence,we concluded the evidence presented was sufficient to establish the taxpayer enclosed his return in a properly addressed and stamped envelope that was deposited in time to have been received by the collector,in the ordinary course of mail,within the statutory filing period.id.at.we stated p roof of due mailing is prima facie evidence of receipt.id.emphasis added.when mail matter is properly addressed and deposited in the united states mails,with postage duly prepaid thereon,there is a rebuttable presumption of fact that it was received by the addressee in the ordinary course of mail.id.
in united states peters,cir,however,we rejected application of the mailbox rule in a tax refund suit without citing crude oil.instead,we applied the physical delivery rule which deems a tax document filed when it is delivered to and received by the irs 
the depositing of the claims for refund in the post office in time for them to reach the post office box or drawer of the collector in due course of mail before the expiration of the time fixed by law for the filing of such claims did not constitute the filing of them.they were not filed within the intent and meaning of the internal revenue code until they reached the collector.

after peters,taxpayers in the tenth circuit faced substantial uncertainty concerning the timely filing of tax documents.amidst this confusion,congress enacted in.as originally enacted,only applied to the filing of tax documents other than tax returns and payments.see internal revenue code of,ch,stat.in,congress amended to encompass tax returns and payments as well.see act of,a,stat.the current version of,which applies in this instance,provides in relevant part 
timely mailing treated as timely filing and paying 
a general rule.
date of any return,claim,statement,or other document required to be filed,or any payment required to be made,within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under authority of any provision of the internal revenue laws is,after such period or such date,delivered by united states mail to the agency,officer,or office with which such return,claim,statement,or other document is required to be filed,or to which such payment is required to be made,the date of the united states postmark stamped on the cover in which such return,claim,statement,or other document,or payment,is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment,as the case may be.
c registered and certified mailing electronic filing.
registered purposes of this section,if any return,claim,statement,or other document,or payment,is sent by united states registered mail 
a such registration shall be prima facie evidence that the return,claim,statement,or other document was delivered to the agency,officer,or office to which addressed and 
b the date of registration shall be deemed the postmark date.
certified mail electronic secretary is authorized to provide by regulations the extent to which the provisions of paragraph with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery and the postmark date shall apply to certified mail and electronic filing.
some courts have construed the current version of as supplanting the common law mailbox rule entirely.specifically,the second and sixth circuits have held,absent a physical postmark,the physical delivery rule applies to tax refund and deficiency suits subject only to the exceptions contained in subsection c regarding registered,certified,and electronic mail receipts.see deutsch commissioner,cir miller united states,cir.in deutsch,a tax deficiency suit,the taxpayer offered the affidavit of his accountant who stated he mailed a copy of the relevant tax document within the prescribed time period.the court held for the irs as a matter of law,stating t he exception embodied in demonstrate s a penchant for an easily applied,objective standard.deutsch,at.see also boccuto commissioner,cir stating the exceptions contained within the original version of are the only exceptions to the physical delivery rule.similarly in miller,a tax refund suit,the sixth circuit held the district court lacked jurisdiction over the taxpayer claim for refund where the irs records failed to establish a refund claim was ever received.the sixth circuit so held notwithstanding the taxpayer offer of proof of timely mailing to the irs.relying on deutsch,the court concluded the only exceptions to physical delivery rule are those found in the statute.miller,at accord surowka united states,cir 
other courts have held does not supplant the common law mailbox rule.instead,these courts have viewed the issue as an evidentiary matter,holding a taxpayer to a strict standard of proof before invoking a presumption of receipt.declarations of mailing,without more,are insufficient to invoke the presumption.see estate of wood commissioner,cir anderson united states,cir.in wood,a tax deficiency suit,the eighth circuit concluded did not completely displace the common law presumption of delivery.wood,at.there,the representative of the estate testified he watched the postmistress of a post office weigh the envelope,put postage on it,cancel it,and put it into the appropriate bundle of outgoing mail.id.at.the postmistress also testified,recalling she postmarked the envelope and placed it in the outgoing mail.the commissioner,on the other hand,adduced no evidence before the tax court that the irs did not receive the return.id.the court rejected the irs argument that requires actual delivery under subsection a or proof of delivery by the taxpayer under subsection c.id.at.in other words,the irs argued absent registration or certification the taxpayer bears the risk of loss as to any document which the irs claims not to have actually received.id.instead,the court read c as a safe harbor because congress intended to benefit the taxpayer.see,reprinted in.
whether or not the common law presumption continues to exist generally,we simply do not agree that by the enactment of,congress intended to foreclose application of a presumption of delivery within a in those cases in which the postmark requirements of the section can be conclusively established,as here.
id.at emphasis added 
the ninth circuit followed wood reasoning in anderson,a tax refund suit.in anderson,the taxpayer testified at trial that she witnessed the postal clerk postmark her return and place the envelope in the mailing pouch.additionally,a friend who accompanied the taxpayer to the post office testified she saw the taxpayer go into the post office with the return and come out of the post office without the return.the court rejected the irs argument that the provisions of set forth the exclusive means available to taxpayers who wish to prove timely filing of a federal tax return or claim for refund.anderson,at.rather,the court held a s applied to the facts of taxpayer case,the language of does not set forth an exclusive limitation on admissible evidence to prove timely mailing and does not preclude application of the common law mailbox rule.id.
we find that the facts in taxpayer case are analogous,and adopt the eighth circuit reasoning in wood.taxpayer provided direct proof of a timely postmark because she actually saw the postal clerk stamp her document.in such circumstances,we find that taxpayer was able to establish that her return was timely postmarked 
lastly,two unpublished circuit court decisions addressing the issue at hand are noteworthy.in davis united states,wl unpublished,the federal circuit held a taxpayer uncorroborated testimony was insufficient under any view of the law to establish timely filing of a refund claim 
even if taxpayer were given the benefit of the more liberal approaches of the eighth and ninth circuits,his own uncorroborated testimony would be insufficient to prove timely filing of his refund claim i n wood,the taxpayer triggered the presumption of timely receipt by the irs through testimony of the postal worker who handled,stamped,and postmarked the refund claim.the taxpayer in anderson offered corroborating testimony from a person who accompanied her to the post office.taxpayer presented no testimony,other than his own,to establish that he timely mailed his refund claim.thus he did not present evidence sufficient to trigger a presumption of receipt of the claim by the irs.
id.at.in wade commissioner,wl cir unpublished,we upheld the tax court finding the taxpayer did not mail his return in as he claimed 
a return is filed as a matter of law when it is delivered to and received by the irs.there are exceptions to the receipt by the irs requirement where the evidence is persuasive that the taxpayer did file the return.in the instant case,however,there is not nearly enough evidence to establish that the tax court clearly erred when it found taxpayer did not file his return.
taxpayer has presented a return dated.he has testified he remembers mailing the return immediately before lunch with his accountant in.the only evidence taxpayer presents to suggest the tax court erred,is his own testimony at trial.
as the case law illustrates,the question of what,if anything,remains of the common law mailbox rule after is not easily answered i do not question that a strict construction of,such as the approach of the second and sixth circuits and judge hartz,provides an easily applied,objective standard.deutsch,at.yet i am not prepared,based upon plain language,to hold a taxpayer may never prove delivery to the irs of the undelivered return in the absence of a registered,certified,or electronic mail receipt.in other words,given the uncertainty as to what extent,if any,congress intended to supplant the mailbox rule in enacting,i decline to hold the production of a registered,certified,or electronic mail receipt are the only means by which a taxpayer may establish timely delivery.
congress is the final arbiter of tax policy,not this court.if congress wishes to restrict the taxpayers means of proving delivery of tax documents,congress can easily amend to establish an easily applied,objective standard.section silence,however,is insufficient to entirely supplant the mailbox rule because i t is a principle of statutory construction that the common law ought not to be deemed to be repealed,unless the language of the statute be clear and specific for this purpose.norfolk redevelopment housing auth.chesapeake potomac,d internal quotations,brackets,and ellipses omitted.i decline to adopt the irs argument that abolishes the mailbox rule because,contrary to judge hartz view,the present language of does not compel such a result.congress must change the statute words if a different result is desired as a matter of tax policy.commissioner soliman,d blackmun,concurring 
at the same time,i deem unwise judge seymour apparent unconditional endorsement of the mailbox rule based solely upon a taxpayer uncorroborated testimony of mailing,especially where that taxpayer has a history of filing untimely returns.such an endorsement would necessarily result in a jury trial every time a taxpayer,regardless of the surrounding circumstances,alleges timely mailing.no circuit court has made such an endorsement and,unlike judge seymour,i decline taxpayers invitation to be the first.i agree with the eighth and ninth circuits narrow holdings in wood and anderson,which turned on evidence of an actual postmark,and evidence of mailing apart from the taxpayer testimony.like the eighth circuit,i would require more than mere proof of mailing,such as direct proof of postmark which is verifiable beyond any testimony of a taxpayer who claims that a document was timely mailed.wood,at.as the ninth circuit opined in lewis united states,cir the service,of course,does not have to take a taxpayer unsupported word,but when a taxpayer with an unblemished record for paying taxes produces circumstantial evidence supporting his word,the government needs more than a skeptical smile to support its doubt of credibility.emphasis added.
allegations of mailing are easy to make and hard to disprove.benavidez city of albuquerque,cir recognizing that proving a negative may be difficult.because the taxpayer,not the irs,controls the mailing of a tax return,the taxpayer,not the irs,has access to any evidence demonstrating the return has been mailed.to establish a presumption of delivery outside the exceptions to the physical delivery rule contained in,the burden in these types of cases thus rests on the taxpayer to make a meaningful evidentiary showing at the outset.national archives and records admin.favish,d 
to be sure,the irs loses tax returns nevertheless,the taxpayer is in the best position with the clock running to protect himself by procuring independent evidence of postmark mailing,whether by mail receipt,corroborating testimony,or otherwise.this is especially true where a refund or credit is involved because no cancelled check will exist to verify receipt.accordingly,i would hold that absent some proof of an actual postmark or dated receipt,a presumption that tax documents allegedly mailed to the irs were in fact received does not arise based solely upon a taxpayer testimony despite judge seymour contrary assertion,such a holding does not require a credibility determination.rather,such testimony alone,assuming its truth,is insufficient as a matter of law to establish a presumption of timely delivery.
in this case,taxpayers,who have a history of filing belated returns,offered no independent proof of a postmark or any evidence of mailing apart from sorrentino testament.unlike judge seymour,i do not believe sorrentino testament is sufficient to invoke the mailbox rule rebuttable presumption.judge seymour logic is flawed,in my opinion,because she apparently believes the mailbox rule creates the factual presumption.see dissent.op.at.to the contrary,as her recitation of the mailbox rule reveals,see id.at,proper and timely mailing raises a rebuttable presumption that the mailing was in fact received by the addressee.i simply would hold taxpayers to their burden of making a meaningful evidentiary showing of proper and timely mailing before invoking the presumption.
in their respective depositions,taxpayers stated they signed and dated their joint return on march.perhaps so,but unlike judge seymour,i do not find such particularly probative of proper and timely mailing.see id.at.importantly,on this point,sorrentino offers no did not mail the return or see sorrentino prepare the return for mailing or take the return to the post office.sorrentino could not recall the specific date he mailed the return,but stated he mailed it to the irs,postage affixed,sometime during the first five days of march.he did not use certified or registered mail nor did he see any postal worker stamp a postmark on the envelope.sorrentino further stated that in september,over six months after mailing his return,he contacted the irs to inquire on the status of the refund.when informed the irs had no record of receiving the return,he faxed the irs a copy of the return which was stamped received,irs,austin texas.under any view of circuit court precedent construing the current version of,sorrentino testimony,without corroborating evidence,is insufficient to raise a presumption the irs received taxpayers tax return prior to october.
accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions to dismiss taxpayers refund suit for want of subject matter jurisdiction.the district court order awarding fees and costs to the taxpayers pursuant to is vacated.
i concur with judge baldock in reversing the judgment of the district court and remanding with instructions to dismiss taxpayers refund suit for want of subject matter jurisdiction.i respectfully disagree,however,with respect to the grounds for reversal.
both judge baldock and judge seymour believe that the mailbox rule survives the enactment of.they apparently read that statute as merely providing a safe harbor for proving timely delivery of a tax document or taxpayer is home free if the taxpayer has a receipt for registered or certified mail,but the taxpayer may still be able to prove timely delivery by other evidence.i do not share that belief.
if c had only paragraph which states that proper registration of an item of mail is prima facie proof of timely might agree with the interpretation of shared by the other members of this panel.but it is too difficult to square c with their interpretation.in,c was amended by adding to the provision,the following language 
certified secretary of the treasury is authorized to provide by regulations the extent to which the provisions of paragraph of this subsection with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery and the postmark date shall apply to certified mail.
if the mailbox rule survived enactment of,this new paragraph is problematic in two ways.first,why did congress bother to enact a provision enabling the secretary to issue a regulation under a the secretary has general authority to prescribe all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement of the.this authority is frequently and forcefully exercised.an interpretative regulation under could have set forth how the mailbox rule applies to certified mail.i recognize that under current law an explicitly authorized regulation may be entitled to greater deference in the courts than a regulation authorized only by.see generally gregg polsky,can treasury overrule the supreme court.i do not,however,believe that such a subtlety could have motivated the congress.
second,if the mailbox rule survived,why did congress limit the secretary regulatory authority to promulgating regulations solely with respect to certified mail why not also give the secretary explicit authority to issue regulations concerning when evidence regarding regular mail constitutes prima facie proof of timely delivery there may be clever answers to my rhetorical questions concerning c but i suspect they would smell of the lamp.
judge baldock analysis of the matter invokes the principle of statutory construction that the common law ought not to be deemed to be repealed,unless the language of the statute be clear and specific for this purpose.op.at quoting norfolk redevelopment housing auth.chesapeake potomac,d.this canon of construction,however,can eviscerate the will of congress if not confined to its proper sphere.it is,at most,an aid in interpreting statutory language.there is no public policy against changing the common law.the canon should not be used misused,as it has been in the past,as a tool of courts hostile to legislative innovation.see generally roscoe pound,common law and legislation,harv.as dean pound wrote almost a century ago 
the proposition that statutes in derogation of the common law are to be construed strictly assumes that legislation is something to be deprecated.as no statute of any consequence dealing with any relation of private law can be anything but in derogation of the common law,the social reformer and the legal reformer,under this doctrine,must always face the situation that the legislative act which represents the fruit of their labors will find no sympathy in those who apply it,will be construed strictly,and will be made to interfere with the status quo as little as possible some regard this attitude toward legislation as a basic principle of jurisprudence.others are content to make of it an ancient and fundamental principle of the common law.in either event they agree in praising it as a wise and useful institution.it is not difficult to show,however,that it is not necessary to and inherent in a legal system that it is not an ancient and fundamental doctrine of the common law that it had its origin in archaic notions of interpretation generally,now obsolete,and survived in its present form because of judicial jealousy of the reform movement and that it is wholly inapplicable to and out of place in american law of today.
