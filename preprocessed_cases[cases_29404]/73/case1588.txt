introduction 
the principal issue we must decide is whether a levy imposed by the city of san diego the city,without a vote of the electorate,for the primary purpose of recovering the cost of collecting and administering a general tax called the rental unit business tax,is a fee or rather a void general or special tax that should have been approved by a vote of the electorate as required by the california constitution.we hold that this levy is a general tax that is void because it was not approved by a majority vote of the municipal electorate as required by article,section,subdivision b of the california constitution.
plaintiffs sidney weisblat and kenneth ledgerwood together plaintiffs appeal from a grant of summary judgment in favor of the city on their complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief,which challenges on state constitutional grounds a fee the city imposed on owners of residential real property who are engaged in the rental of their properties within the city limits.the city imposed the levy for the primary purpose of recovering the costs incurred by the city in collecting and administering the city rental unit business tax sometimes referred to as the rubt,a general tax that is levied on those same property owners but is not challenged in this appeal.the city and the plaintiffs brought separate motions for summary judgment or,alternatively,summary adjudication.
in granting summary judgment in favor of the city,the trial court determined that the undisputed material facts show the levy is not a general or special tax,but rather falls within the exception set forth in government code section and the levy does not violate article xiiid of the california constitution because it is not a tax,assessment,fee or charge imposed by the city upon any parcel of property or upon any person as an incident of property ownership within the meaning of that article.the court found the city alternative motion for summary adjudication,and the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment or,alternatively,summary adjudication,were moot.
this case presents the specific questions of whether the city levy is a fee that is exempt from the voter approval requirements of the california constitution or rather a void general or special tax that should have been approved by the voters in the city under proposition,which as we shall discuss,post amended our state constitution by adding articles xiiic and xiiid articles and and if it is a fee,whether it is a fee that requires voter approval under article.we specifically hold the levy is not a fee,but rather is a general tax that is subject to the voter approval limitation set forth in article,section,subdivision b,and is thus void because it was levied by the city council without approval by a majority vote of the qualified voters in the city.accordingly,we reverse the summary judgment granted in favor of the city and remand the matter with directions that the trial court reach the merits of the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication,and conduct such further proceedings consistent with this opinion as the court deems necessary.
factual background 
rental unit business tax 
pursuant to section of the san diego municipal code municipal code,the city charges all businesses operating in the city a business tax business tax,which was enacted for the sole purpose of raising revenue for municipal purposes.the rental unit business tax,which is codified in municipal code section is part and parcel of the business tax in the city council amended the municipal code to assess the rubt on all rental housing.
the treasury operations division of the city treasurer office administers the business tax program,which includes the rubt program.any increase in the business tax or the rubt must be approved by the voters.in those taxes generated million for the city general fund.
challenged resolution and fee 
in june the city manager issued a report manager report recommending to the city council that the city manager implement an annual business tax and rental unit tax processing fee in the amount of as one of the solutions to offset a million state budget reduction.the manager report informed the city council that the city annual cost to operate the business tax and rubt programs was about million.those costs included the collection and processing of the business tax and rubt payments,printing and postage fees,and computer systems and overhead costs.the manager report explained that spreading the million cost among the businesses operating in the city yielded the proposed processing fee.
on june,the city council followed the city manager recommendation and passed resolution no.the resolution authorizing the city treasury operations division to establish and collect a business tax application,business tax renewal,and rubt billing statement processing fee the levy in the annual amount of.the resolution stated that the purpose of the levy was to recover costs associated with processing applications and renewals for business tax certificates and rubt certificates.the resolution also stated among other things that the city manager was hereby directed to review the fees annually to ensure that all reasonable costs incurred in providing services are being recovered and to approve fee schedules whenever possible in accordance with city administrative regulation.the fee was imposed without voter approval.
robbin kulek,the city treasury operations division manager,was responsible for overseeing the business tax program and was involved in determining the actual costs incurred by this program for administering the business tax,including the rubt.kulek estimated that those costs for fiscal year totaled about million.in estimating that total cost,kulek included the salaries and overhead of the business tax program employees,who handle the seasonal task of sending out about rubt billing statements and processing rubt payments.it is undisputed that the responsibilities and services of those employees include responding to requests from the general public,whether those requests are made by landlords or nonlandlords,business owners or nonbusiness owners 
it is also undisputed that the purpose of the levy is to recover the costs associated with the administration of the business tax and rubt programs,including the cost of collecting and processing the business tax and rubt payments,printing and postage fees,and the cost of computer systems and overhead.the levy is not exacted in return for permits or other governmental privileges.
in fiscal year,the amount of the levy was.in january,it was reduced to.
city rejection of weisblat claim for a refund 
plaintiffs own residential rental property within the city and have paid the rubt for many years.in early,weisblat received from the city an rubt billing statement in the amount of,which included the levy.the statement characterized the levy as a processing fee.
weisblat submitted a claim against the city for a refund of the levy,claiming that it was an illegal tax that violated section and articles xiiia article,and.
in a letter signed by kulek and dated june,denial letter,the city denied weisblat claim for a refund.kulek indicated that the levy was authorized under section,it was not a special tax,and it was not an unauthorized increase in the business tax.she also indicated that although the levy was denominated a processing fee,it was a fee imposed for both services provided to,and regulatory activities related to,businesses that operate in the city.plaintiffs lawsuit against the city followed.
procedural background 
plaintiffs brought this action for declaratory and injunctive relief in august.they alleged in their first and second causes of action that the levy is an illegal general tax that violates article,section b because it is an increase in the rubt that has not been approved by a majority vote of the electorate in their third and fourth causes of action that the levy is an illegal special tax that violates article,section d because it is imposed,without approval of of the electorate,for the specific purpose of paying for the administrative functions related to the collection of the rubt in their fifth and sixth causes of action that the levy is not a fee under section,and thus is not exempt from being a special tax,because the revenue exceeds the reasonable cost of providing the service or regulatory activity for which the levy is charged within the meaning of that section in their seventh and eighth causes of action that the levy is not a fee under section,and thus is not exempt from being a special tax,because,as the city acknowledges in its denial letter,the revenue from the levy is being spent on a myriad of services,rather than on processing rubt applications and renewals as required by the resolution in their ninth and causes of action that the levy is not a fee under section,and thus is not exempt from the voter approval requirement of a special tax,because the only activity the resolution permits to be funded by the proceeds is levying and collecting the rubt,and thus the levy is not being collected for any activity that could legally be called a service in their and causes of action that the levy is a general tax that is not exempted under section because,like the rubt,it is charged for the general governmental purpose of raising tax revenue for the city general fund,the purpose of which is to fund a variety or a myriad of general public services,and thus it is levied for general revenue purposes within the meaning of section in their and causes of action that the levy violates article because it is a fee that was not approved by property owners or the voters in their and causes of action that the levy is either a tax in excess of the percent ad valorem tax in violation of article,section a,or it is a special tax imposed without approval of of the electorate in violation of article,section and in their and causes of action that the levy violates section of the city charter because it is a special tax created,without approval of of the electorate,for the special purpose of paying for the administration of an existing tax.
the city moved for summary judgment or,alternatively,summary adjudication,arguing that plaintiffs causes of action through and through,which are premised on the allegation that the levy is either a general tax or a special tax,have no merit because it is neither a general tax nor a special tax,but instead is a legitimate fee under section in that it does not exceed the reasonable cost of providing the service or regulatory activity for which the fee is charged and is not levied for general revenue purposes and plaintiffs causes of action and have no merit because the levy is not a fee that violates article due to lack of voter approval because it is not a tax,assessment,fee,or charge imposed by the city upon any parcel of property or upon any person as an incident of property ownership.
plaintiffs brought their own motion for summary judgment or,alternatively,summary adjudication,arguing that the levy is either an increase in the rubt and thus a general tax,or it is a new special tax,that violates article because it was imposed without voter approval if it is not an excise tax or part of the rubt,it is a fee imposed in violation of articles and because the purpose of the levy is to pay for the imposition and collection of the rubt,it does not provide a service or regulatory activity as those terms are used in section and the city can not prove the amount of the levy does not exceed the reasonable costs of providing the alleged service of mailing the rubt billing statements to landlords 
following oral argument on the parties motions,the court overruled various evidentiary objections made by the plaintiffs,granted summary judgment in favor of the city,and found moot the plaintiffs motion and the city alternative summary adjudication motion.the court found the undisputed facts showed that the levy is not a general or special tax it falls within the exception set forth in section and it does not violate article because it is not a tax,assessment,fee or charge imposed by the city upon any parcel of property or upon any person as an incident of property ownership.

constitutional and statutory framework 
although this appeal involves constitutional provisions discussed,post enacted when voters passed proposition in,it also involves legislation enacted to implement proposition,the predecessor initiative that voters passed in to constrain the taxation powers of state and local government.see city and county of san francisco farrell cal d,farrell neecke city of mill valley th,d.accordingly,we begin by reviewing the applicable constitutional and statutory framework that guides our analysis.
proposition 
determining whether a levy is a tax or a fee has been a recurring task since when california voters added article,commonly known as the property tax initiative or proposition article,to our state constitution.see sinclair paint state bd.of equalization cal th,d,sinclair paint california of professional scientists department of fish and game th,d.the purpose of the initiative was to assure effective real property tax relief.sinclair paint,supra,cal th at,d.
article consists of four major parts a real property tax rate limitation,a real property assessment limitation,a restriction on state taxes,and a restriction on local taxes.sinclair paint,supra,cal th at,d,collier city and county of san francisco th,d collier.
we are peripherally concerned here with section of article which restricts the ability of local governmental bodies to enact specified changes in local taxes,as follows 
cities,counties and special districts,by a vote of the qualified electors of such district,may impose special taxes on such district,except ad valorem taxes on real property or a transaction tax or sales tax on the sale of real property within such city,county or special district.italics added.
section of article thus prohibits cities,counties,and special districts from imposing local ad valorem real property taxes and sales or transaction taxes on the sale of real property,and it permits local governmental entities to impose special taxes only if approved by a vote of the qualified electors.pugh city of sacramento d.witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,taxation.
for purposes of section of article,the california supreme court has defined special taxes to mean taxes levied for a specific purpose rather than tax levies placed in the general fund to be used for general governmental purposes.sinclair paint,supra,cal th at,d,farrell,supra,cal d at.
in farrell,the supreme court explained that the language of article,section must be strictly construed and ambiguities therein resolved so as to limit the measures to which the requirement applies because the vote requirement in section is inherently undemocratic.farrell,supra,cal d at,see also collier,supra,th at,d carlsbad mun.water dist.qlc th,d.
unlike taxes,fees are not subject to the voter approval limitation of article,section.california of professional scientists department of fish and game,supra,th at,d.
in,after voters passed article,the california legislature enacted enabling legislation found at section et.collier,supra,th at,d.section declared the legislature intent to provide all california cities,counties,and districts with the authority to impose special taxes under section of article.carlsbad mun.water dist.qlc,supra,th at,d,citing it is the intent of the legislature to provide all cities,counties,and districts with the authority to impose special taxes,pursuant to the provisions of article of the california constitution.
section,the portion of the proposition enabling legislation with which we are concerned here,excludes from the term special tax in section of article any fee which does not exceed the reasonable cost of providing the service or regulatory activity for which the fee is charged and which is not levied for general revenue purposes.see sinclair paint,supra,cal th at,d.expressed another way,under section a fee may be treated as a special tax subject to the vote requirement of section of article only when one or both of the conditions set forth in that section are found to exist,that is,the fee exceeds the reasonable cost of providing the service or the regulatory activity for which it is charged,and or the fee is levied for general revenue purposes.carlsbad mun.water dist.qlc,supra,th at,d witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,taxation.
section on its face applies to fees imposed for services or regulatory activities provided by local entities.bay area cellular,supra,th at,d,italics added.thus,section does not apply unless the fee in question is imposed by a local governmental entity to provide either a service or a regulatory activity.bay area cellular,supra,at,d.
in carlsbad municipal water district qlc,supra,th at page,d,this court explained that e stablishing that the fee fits the exception of section to the broad constitutional restriction on the power of local agencies to impose special taxes is the burden of the local agency.
guidelines for distinguishing between a tax and a fee 
in sinclair paint,the california supreme court set forth general guidelines for determining whether taxes are involved in particular situations and pointed out that whether impositions are taxes or fees is a question of law for the appellate courts to decide on independent review of the facts.sinclair paint,supra,cal th at,d.the high court began by explaining the blurr y distinction between taxes and fees 
the cases recognize that tax has no fixed meaning,and that the distinction between taxes and fees is frequently blurred,taking on different meanings in different contexts.citations.in general,taxes are imposed for revenue purposes,rather than in return for a specific benefit conferred or privilege granted.citations.most taxes are compulsory rather than imposed in response to a voluntary decision to develop or to seek other government benefits or privileges.citations,italics added but see pajaro valley water management agency amrhein th,d pajaro valley describing the sinclair paint distinction between a tax and a fee as a false dichotomy.
the sinclair paint court then proceeded to review the following three general categories of fees or assessments that had been analyzed by the appellate courts in california to determine whether they constituted a special tax within the meaning of section of article special assessments,based on the value of benefits conferred on property development fees,exacted in return for permits or other government privileges and regulatory fees,imposed under the police power.sinclair paint,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.the high court determined that t he cases uniformly hold that special assessments on property or similar business charges,in amounts reasonably reflecting the value of the benefits conferred by improvements,are not special taxes under article a,section.citations.id.at,d.the supreme court also determined that,s imilarly,development fees exacted in return for building permits or other governmental privileges are not special taxes if the amount of the fees bears a reasonable relation to the development probable costs to the community and benefits to the developer.citations.id.at,d.
with respect to regulatory fees,the sinclair paint court acknowledged that the term special taxes in article a,section does not embrace fees charged in connection with regulatory activities which fees do not exceed the reasonable cost of providing services necessary to the activity for which the fee is charged and which are not levied for unrelated revenue purposes.citations.sinclair paint,supra,cal th at,d,quoting pennell city of san jose cal d.summarizing case law dealing with regulatory fees,the high court explained that to show a fee is a regulatory fee and not a special tax,the government should prove the estimated costs of the service or regulatory activity,and the basis for determining the manner in which the costs are apportioned,so that charges allocated to a payor bear a fair or reasonable relationship to the payor burdens on or benefits from the regulatory activity.sinclair paint,supra,cal th at,d,quoting san diego gas electric san diego county air pollution control dist.d,fn.omitted.noting that regulatory fees in amounts necessary to carry out the purpose of a regulation are valid despite the absence of any perceived benefit accruing to the payers of the fees,the sinclair paint court clarified that all regulatory fees are necessarily aimed at raising revenue to defray the cost of the regulatory program in question,but that fact does not automatically render those fees taxes.sinclair paint,supra,at,d.
the sinclair paint court then adopted a primary purpose test for determining whether a regulatory fee should be deemed a tax 
i f revenue is the primary purpose,and regulation is merely incidental,the imposition is a tax,but if regulation is the primary purpose,the mere fact that revenue is also obtained does not make the imposition a tax.sinclair paint,supra,cal th at,d,citing united business com.city of san diego d.united business.
in united business,this court explained that t he determination of whether the actual purpose of an ordinance is regulatory or in nature is a question of fact,and i n its determination,the court will look to the substantive provisions of the ordinance and not merely its title and form.united business,supra,d at.
the courts have also recognized that certain user fees are not taxes.bay area cellular,supra,th at,d,citing isaac city of los angeles th,d isaac.the isaac court described user fees as fees that are charged only to the person actually using the service the amount of the charge is generally related to the actual goods or services provided.isaac,supra,at,d.
special assessments and development,regulatory and user fees are generally not regarded as taxes,and thus are exempt from the reach of article,because with each of these levies,a discrete group receives a benefit,service,or public improvement that inures to the benefit of that discrete group.see bay area cellular,supra,th at,d evans city of san jose th,d evans.the courts have recognized that although the public as a whole may be incidentally benefitted by the expenditure of the proceeds of these levies,a discrete group is specially benefitted by the expenditure,and the public should not be required to finance through taxation an expenditure that benefits only a small segment of the population.evans,supra,th at,d bay area cellular,supra,th at,d.thus,the voter approval limitation of article is not implicated where the burden for these expenditures is borne by the group specially benefitted by them.evans,supra,th at,d.
although the classification of a device can be determinative of the lawfulness of the device,courts look to the actual attributes of the device as enacted in order to arrive at the proper classification the label attached to the device by the local government is not determinative.kern county farm bureau county of kern th,d,italics added.a revenue measure may have attributes of more than one of the traditional revenue devices,and may be valid despite the measure hybrid nature.ibid.
proposition 
in november california voters added articles and to the state constitution by approving proposition,the right to vote on taxes act.bay area cellular,supra,th at,d.proposition included the following statement of purpose 
the people of the state of california hereby find and declare that proposition was intended to provide effective tax relief and to require voter approval of tax increases.however,local governments have subjected taxpayers to excessive tax,assessment,fee and charge increases that not only frustrate the purposes of voter approval for tax increases,but also threaten the economic security of all californians and the california economy itself.this measure protects taxpayers by limiting the methods by which local governments exact revenue from taxpayers without their consent.bay area cellular,supra,th at,d see also historical notes,west ann.const.supp.foll.
proposition,like proposition,limits the power of local governments to impose taxes.pajaro valley,supra,th at,d.section of proposition required that the provisions of the act be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes of limiting local government revenue and enhancing taxpayer consent.bay area cellular,supra,th at,d,quoting ballot,elect,text of,currently reprinted at historical notes,west ann.cal.const.supp.foll.
article general versus special local government taxes 
proposition provides that a ll taxes imposed by any local government shall be deemed to be either general taxes or special taxes,subd.a and defines a general tax as any tax imposed for general governmental purposes,subd.a.a tax is general only when its revenues are placed into the general fund and are available for expenditure for any and all governmental purposes.citation.howard jarvis taxpayers city of roseville th,d city of roseville.under proposition,n o local government may impose,extend,or increase any general tax until the matter is submitted to the electorate and approved by a majority vote,subd.b.
proposition defines a special tax as any tax imposed for specific purposes,even if the proceeds are placed into a general fund,subd.d see bay area cellular,supra,th at,d.a tax is special whenever expenditure of its revenues is limited to specific purposes this is true even though there may be multiple specific purposes for which the revenues may be spent.city of roseville,supra,th at,d.under proposition,n o local government may impose,extend,or increase any special tax until the matter is submitted to the electorate and approved by a vote,subd.d.under proposition,c ertain kinds of impositions for specific purposes,however,are treated not as special taxes subject to the voter approval requirements but as fees not subject to those requirements.bay area cellular,supra,th at,d see also discussed,ante.
whether an imposition is a tax or a fee is a question of law for the appellate court to decide on an independent review of the facts.citations.bay area cellular,supra,th at,d.
article fees or charges imposed as an incident of property ownership 
the second component of proposition is article,which constrains the power of local governments to impose assessments,fees and charges,pajaro valley,supra,th at,d.
we are concerned here with the provisions of article that pertain to fees and charges.fee and charge,which are interchangeable terms,are defined as any levy other than an ad valorem tax,a special tax,or an assessment,imposed by an agency upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership,including a user fee or charge for a property related service,subd.e,italics added.article does not define the phrase incident of property ownership.see,definitions.property related service is defined as a public service having a direct relationship to property ownership,subd.h.
under article,a local government agency that proposes to impose or increase a fee or charge that comes within the foregoing definition must comply with specified procedures and requirements,subd.a.for example,the levying agency must identify the parcels upon which the fee or charge will be imposed,and to conduct a public hearing,subd.a.the hearing must be preceded by written notice by mail to affected record owners setting forth the amount of the fee or charge proposed to be imposed upon each parcel,the basis upon which that amount was calculated,the reason for the fee or charge,and the date,time and location of the public hearing,subd.a.
article also contains a voter approval limitation.with exceptions not relevant here,section,subdivision c of article provides that no property related fee or charge shall be imposed or increased until the matter is submitted and approved by a majority vote of the property owners of the property subject to the fee or charge or,at the option of the agency,by a vote of the electorate residing in the affected area.proposition also imposes various specified substantive limitations,including restrictions on the use of revenues derived from such charges,subd.b.
discussion 
i.the levy is a tax 
the first issue we must resolve is whether the levy is a fee or a tax that is subject to the voter approval limitations of articles or.application of the foregoing principles to the undisputed material facts of this case leads us to conclude that the levy is a tax that is subject to the voter approval limitation of article,section.
as already noted,the california supreme court,in discussing the blurr y distinction between taxes and fees,explained in sinclair paint that taxes are imposed for revenue purposes,rather than in return for a specific benefit conferred or privilege granted.sinclair paint,supra,cal th at,d.in deciding whether the levy at issue here is a tax,we look first to the substantive provisions of the resolution that authorized its imposition.see united business,supra,d at.in determining whether the actual purpose of an ordinance is in nature the court will look to the substantive provisions of the ordinance and not merely its title and form.
here,the language of the resolution is undisputed and unambiguous.it authorizes the imposition of a business tax application,business tax renewal,and rubt billing statement processing fee in the annual amount of which has since been reduced to.the resolution states that the purpose of the levy is to recover costs associated with processing applications and renewals for business tax certificates and rubt certificates,which under municipal code section a see fn,ante merely certify that payment of the tax has been made.nothing in the language of the resolution indicates that the purpose of the levy is to fund any regulatory activity or provide any municipal services beyond those involved in recovering the costs associated with processing the business tax and rubt certificate applications and renewals.
the parties summary judgment papers show it is undisputed that the sole purpose of the business tax,including the rubt,is to raise revenue for municipal purposes and the primary,if not the sole,purpose of the levy is to recover the costs associated with the administration of the business tax and rubt programs,including the cost of collecting and processing the annual business tax applications and rubt payments,the printing costs and postage fees,and the cost of computer systems and overhead,as shown by the declaration of robbin kulek,the city treasury operations division manager it is also undisputed that the levy is not exacted in return for permits or other governmental privileges.
the city claims,however,that it submitted ample evidence of many particularized benefits afforded to those who pay the levy.in support of this claim,the city relies on the declaration of kulek,who stated that unlike some cities in california,the cit
