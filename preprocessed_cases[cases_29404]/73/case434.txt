this case returns to this court for the second time for review of the tax court judgment that taxpayers robert lisle and his wife donna failed to declare and pay income tax on approximately in revenue earned as a result of robert lisle relationship with a series of real estate deals and related transactions.see estate of robert lisle comm r,cir lisle i.in this appeal,like the first,the tax court found that robert lisle,along with claude ballard and burton kanter,earned the unreported income through an elaborate kickback scheme involving the sale of influence by lisle and ballard through their positions in the real estate department at prudential life insurance of america.the commissioner asserted that kanter kicked back commissions he or his corporation earned to lisle and ballard in return for their influence.the unreported revenue allegedly arose from five arrangements,sometimes called the five,made between kanter and weaver also called the transaction,bruce frey,william schaffel,kenneth schnitzer,and john eulich also called the essex transaction in each instance,kanter dealt with clients who were seeking to do business with prudential.two of the deals involved hotel management contracts,another a property management contract,another involved the conversion of apartment complexes to condominiums,and still another involved assistance with selling and financing real estate transactions.the tax court further found that the kickbacks were distributed among lisle,ballard and kanter in a percent split through numerous transactions involving various corporations and trusts,favorable loans,and payments to lisle children.
in this appeal,unlike the first,we have the benefit of the fact findings and conclusions of the special trial judge that were rejected by the tax court and obscured in the first appeal.with the benefit of a complete record,our equivocal findings in the first appeal,and the findings of the eleventh circuit in the appeal of the related case affecting taxpayer ballard,ballard comm r,cir ballard iii,we conclude that the tax court reviewing the report of the special trial judge failed to give due regard to the factfindings of the trial judge and erred in issuing a judgment contrary to those findings.accordingly,for the reasons set forth below,we vacate the tax court judgment as to the lisles and remand with instructions to issue a final order adopting the special trial judge report.
the cases for income tax deficiencies against lisle,ballard and kanter were consolidated in the tax court.in the lisle case that proceeded through this circuit,the tax court ruled that the taxpayers fraudulently failed to declare and pay income tax on approximately of income.in lisle i,this court reversed the tax court finding of fraud,affirmed the tax court ruling sustaining the assessment of a deficiency for years,and,and remanded the case to the tax court for the limited purposes of recalculating the deficiencies and additions to the tax consistent with the opinion.lisle i.the supreme court later granted certiorari in two related cases from the seventh and eleventh circuits ballard comm r,cir ballard i,and estate of kanter comm r,cir and reversed.ballard comm r of internal revenue,d and,d.as we explain below,the basis for the supreme court reversal was the failure of the tax court to follow proper procedure.
in the tax court,prior to the first appeal to this circuit,the chief judge of the tax court had assigned the consolidated case to special trial judge irwin couvillion for trial.judge couvillion presided over a trial in the summer of.around september,judge couvillion submitted a page written report containing his findings of facts and opinions to the chief judge for subsequent review by a tax court judge.the parties were not provided a copy of judge couvillion report.the chief judge assigned the case to tax court judge dawson,for his review and final disposition.on december,judge dawson issued the opinion of the tax court.memo see investment research assocs.commissioner,memo,wl,tax.memo lexis,cch.judge dawson found that ballard,kanter and lisle had acted with intent to deceive the commissioner and held them liable for underpaid taxes and substantial fraud penalties.judge dawson opinion purported to adopt the findings contained in the report submitted by judge couvillion.but we now know that this was not entirely accurate.
as stated by the eleventh circuit 
we now know,based on new documents filed with this court,that the following events occurred in the tax court 
judge couvillion original report initially recommended that ballard nor kanter or lisle was not liable for the deficiencies in tax asserted against him.specifically,judge couvillion concluded that there were no kickback schemes,and none of the alleged kickback schemes payments by the five represented unreported income of kanter,ballard,and lisle.there was,therefore,no underpayment of tax.in fact,judge couvillion original report did not consider the government allegation of fraud as even rising to the level of suspicion of fraud.
after judge dawson was assigned to the case,he reviewed judge couvillion original report and advised the chief judge that he disagreed with it.approximately one week later,on or about august,then chief judge cohen advised judge dawson that she also disagreed with judge couvillion original report.
a conference was scheduled between chief judge cohen,judge dawson,and judge couvillion.it appears that shortly before this conference was to take place,judge couvillion was aware that both chief judge cohen and judge dawson disagreed with his report.
on september,judge couvillion withdrew his original report.
chief judge cohen assigned judge dawson and judge couvillion to write a collaborative report.this collaborative report stood in stark contrast to judge couvillion original report.in fact,the collaborative report now concluded that ballard as well as kanter and lisle should be liable for the deficiencies in tax asserted against him.
on october,judge dawson adopted the new collaborative report.
on november,chief judge cohen adopted the new collaborative report with some minor modifications.
on december,chief judge cohen formally assigned the case to judge dawson,and the new collaborative report was filed as the decision of the tax court.

the taxpayers suspected that the document labeled opinion of the special trial judge was not in fact judge couvillion original ruling.they filed motions in the tax court seeking access to judge couvillion original ruling,which motions were denied.the taxpayers appealed to their respective circuit courts,including this court,all of which treated judge dawson opinion as the opinion of the special trial judge.kanter and ballard appealed to the supreme court which granted certiorari to resolve the question whether the tax court may exclude from the record on appeal rule b reports submitted by special trial judges.
the supreme court held that tax court rule did not describe or authorize the collaborative effort with regard to the trial judge opinion and the tax court was not authorized to exclude from the record on appeal reports by special trial judges pursuant to rule b.rule further requires the tax court judge to give due regard to the circumstance that the special trial judge had the opportunity to evaluate the credibility of witnesses,and the findings of fact recommended by the special trial judge shall be presumed to be correct.tax court rule c ed,as cited in ballard,at.appellate review is impeded and the standards are meaningless when the tax court judge collaborates in the special trial judge opinion.the supreme court reversed the judgments affirming the tax court judgments which were rendered without giving proper deference to the trial judge findings and the cases were remanded for further proceedings.ballard,at.
in response to the supreme court opinion,this court recalled its mandate and remanded the case to the tax court with orders to 
strike the collaborative report that formed the basis of the tax court ultimate decision reinstate judge couvillion original report refer this case to a regular tax court judge who had no involvement in the preparation of the aforementioned collaborative report and who shall give due regard to the credibility determinations of judge couvillion,presuming that his fact findings are correct unless manifestly unreasonable,in dealing with the remaining issues of tax deficiency and adhere strictly hereafter to the amended tax court rule in finalizing tax court opinions.
estate of robert lisle comm r,cir lisle ii,adopting the eleventh circuit approach on remand in ballard ii,at.
on remand,the tax court assigned the case to judge haines.he adopted some of the special trial judge findings,rejected other recommended findings and credibility determinations as manifestly unreasonable and supplemented other recommended findings because he viewed them as incomplete.judge haines concluded that lisle was liable for income tax deficiencies.our remand in lisle ii did not disturb this court decision to reverse the imposition of fraud penalties against lisle,so the fraud issue is no longer part of this case.lisle now appeals the tax court judgment which it rendered following our remand.
lisle argues first that the tax court failed to give appropriate deference to the findings of the special trial judge.the tax court review of the opinion of the special trial judge is restricted by rule.in reviewing the report due regard shall be given to the circumstance that the special trial judge had the opportunity to evaluate the credibility of witnesses,and the findings of fact recommended by the special trial judge shall be presumed to be correct.ballard,at.the government asserts that because the special trial judge has no authority to decide the case,it is the tax court judge who must decide the case.thus,according to the government,just as the tax court factual findings are generally reviewed for clear error,so too should the tax court rejection of the special trial judge findings of fact and credibility determination be reviewed for clear error.
lisle argues that our focus should be on whether the findings of the special trial judge are supported by the record.we agree.as stated by the eleventh circuit in its opinion in the parallel case affecting taxpayer ballard,
after the tax court judge has conducted his review and issued a final opinion,we generally review this opinion for clear error.see stone,at a instructing courts of appeals to review tax court decisions in the same manner as district court decisions on civil cases tried without a jury.a instructing that courts of appeals can set aside the district court findings on cases tried without a jury if they are clearly erroneous.however,when the tax court judge rejects the special trial judge findings and we are faced with a conflicting report and opinion,we determine whether the tax court judge committed clear error by rejecting the special trial judge findings as clearly erroneous by reviewing the special trial judge report to determine if his findings were,indeed,without record support.matter of multiponics,cir applying rule a to bankruptcy proceedings,wherein the district court rejected the special master findings,and holding that we must review the findings of the special master and may affirm the d istrict c ourt reversal only if we also deem the master findings clearly erroneous.

this court adopted the position of the eleventh circuit that the tax court judge may disturb the special trial judge findings of fact and credibility determinations only if they are manifestly unreasonable.lisle ii,at in order remanding this case to the tax court,citing ballard,at and.
according to the supreme court,
the clear error standard plainly does not entitle a reviewing court to reverse the finding of the trier of fact simply because it is convinced that it would have decided the case differently.the reviewing court oversteps the bounds of its duty if it undertakes to duplicate the role of the lower court.in applying the clearly erroneous standard to the findings of a district court sitting without a jury,appellate courts must constantly have in mind that their function is not to decide factual issues de novo.if the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact,it would have weighed the evidence differently.where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.
anderson bessemer city,d internal quotation and citation omitted.further,
when a trial judge finding is based on his decision to credit the testimony of one of two or more witnesses,each of whom has told a coherent and facially plausible story that is not contradicted by extrinsic evidence,that finding,if not internally inconsistent,can virtually never be clear error.
id.at.at.a trial judge credibility determinations are due this extra deference because only the trial judge can be aware of the variations in demeanor and tone of voice that bear so heavily on the listener understanding of and belief in what is said.id.for these reasons,we agree with the taxpayer that the tax court did not give the required deference to the findings of the special trial judge.applying the correct standard of review,we turn now to review the special trial judge report.
we are aided at this stage by this court prior decision in this case and by the decision of the eleventh circuit reviewing the same and findings with respect to a different taxpayer,ballard,who like lisle was an executive at prudential.at the outset,it is important to note that when this court affirmed the original decision of the tax court and found that lisle was liable for the tax deficiencies,we found that much of the evidence is equivocal and concluded that when the burden of proof is by a preponderance of the evidence,we will not find clear error if the evidence supports either of two theories.lisle,at.since in lisle i this court understood that the special trial judge had made critical fact findings against the taxpayers,the balance tipped in favor of affirming the deficiencies.however,now that we know that the trier of fact actually found in favor of the taxpayers,that equivocal evidence is insufficient to overturn the special trial judge findings.
the special trial judge findings have also been upheld by the eleventh circuit in the related case against taxpayer ballard.ballard comm r,cir ballard iii.that ruling is relevant to this case against lisle because the deficiencies imposed by the tax court against ballard result from the same findings involving the same five transactions relied on for the deficiencies against lisle.also,the government theory against ballard and lisle was identical that both ballard and lisle,while they were executives at prudential,sold their influence in return for kickbacks that generated the alleged unreported income.the eleventh circuit concluded 
that judge couvillion findings of fact and credibility determinations were supported by the record and that his finding that ballard was not responsible for a deficienc
