background 
procedural history 
petitioners claimed losses on their income tax returns for,and investment and energy credits on their return,based upon an investment made in in a plastics recycling limited partnership tax shelter known as dickinson recycling associates dickinson.in september of,petitioners amended the returns in order to satisfy anticipated underpayments of tax attributable to the losses and credits they claimed in connection with the tax shelter.it is undisputed that the partnership transactions underlying the claimed tax benefits were shams,that the value of the plastic recycling machines was overstated for tax purposes,and that,as a result,until petitioners filed the amended returns,they had underpaid their taxes for.
the commissioner of internal revenue the commissioner issued petitioners notices of deficiency asserting additions to tax for negligence for all four years,in the respective amounts of,and internal revenue code irc a,plus fifty percent of the interest due on the portions of the underpayments attributable to negligence irc a,and an addition to tax for valuation overstatement irc for.the commissioner also charged petitioners in interest on the underpayment,as computed at the increased interest rate mandated by irc c for underpayments attributable to transactions.petitioners paid the c interest before commencing these proceedings.
in the tax court,petitioners disputed the additions to tax for negligence on factual grounds,and sought a refund of the c interest they had paid for on procedural grounds.petitioners did not dispute that they were liable for the addition to tax under irc for,nor did they dispute that the underpayment for was attributable to a transaction.although the facts were largely stipulated,a trial was held with respect to the negligence issue.two witnesses testified at trial,petitioner myron barlow,and fred gordon,the promoter of the dickinson tax shelter.
the tax court issued an opinion sustaining the commissioner position in all respects.the tax court accordingly entered decisions finding that petitioners were liable for all of the asserted additions to tax for the years,and denied their claims for a refund of the interest paid for.this appeal ensued.
in december of,myron barlow hereinafter barlow invested in the dickinson tax shelter which was one of the limited partnership tax shelters that claimed tax benefits attributable to sham transactions involving machines designed to recycle plastic scrap material into pellets.prior to,barlow received a bachelor degree from johns hopkins university,a medical degree from the university of michigan school of medicine,and three years of specialized medical training in dermatology from wayne state university.during the years at issue,barlow practiced medicine as an employee of a professional corporation,earning salaries of in in in and in.prior to investing in the dickinson tax shelter,barlow had invested in a variety of property,including stocks and bonds,real estate,a partnership that invested in real estate,a coal mining company,and a communications system that he rented to a medical clinic.
barlow was introduced to the dickinson tax shelter in november of by herbert krickstein,a friend and medical colleague,and fred gordon,an attorney,while on a golf vacation in florida.gordon was actively engaged in promoting investments in dickinson,and received a commission from dickinson on each sale.after returning home from the golf trip in,barlow received a copy of dickinson private offering memorandum from gordon in the mail,in which units in dickinson was offered at each.the offering warned the potential investor in bold capital letters that this offering involves a high degree of risk,see certain business risks and certain tax risks and consequences.at.in addition,the offering provided that an investment in the partnership involves a high degree of business and tax risks and should,therefore,be considered only by persons who have a substantial net worth and substantial present and anticipated income and who can afford to lose all of their cash investment and all or a portion of their anticipated tax benefits.at.
the offering reported other business and tax risks such as a substantial likelihood of an internal revenue service irs audit of the partnership and each individual partner the partnership had no operating history the limited partners had no control over the business and the business was dependent upon the general partner and there was no established market for the recyclers,as well as other warnings.at.however,the offering also included as an attachment a copy of a favorable tax opinion prepared by the law firm of boylan evans and addressed to sam winer,dickinson general partner.in discussing the recyclers value,upon which the amount of the investment and energy tax credits depended,boyan evans did not proffer its own valuation,but referred to the report of one of the evaluators.boyan evans stated that their opinion as to the offering was for the general partner individual guidance and that no prospective purchaser is entitled to rely upon this letter.at.
the offering also included the opinions of two evaluators,both of whom owned interests in partnerships that leased the recyclers at issue.one of the opinions was that of stanley ulanoff,professor of marketing at the city university of new york and the author of books on technical and marketing subjects.although ulanoff concluded that the price for the recyclers was fair and reasonable,he did not cite that price in his report and appeared to be unaware of it.the other opinion,made by samuel burstein,an associate professor of mathematics at new york university,did not purport to appraise the recyclers,but simply concluded that they would be operationally reliable and capable of continuously recycling polyethylene.
barlow browsed through the offering memorandum,but did not read it cover to cover.rather,he consulted with philip nusholtz,an attorney with whom he had a professional relationship,and whose judgment he respected and advice he valued nusholtz also did not read the offering however,he advised barlow not to invest in any promotion marketed by gordon,and to focus on more conservative investments.
barlow then took the offering to his accountant and tax return preparer,gerald kabeck.kabeck read through the offering and told barlow that he thought that the investment was reasonable.at that time,kabeck had no specialized knowledge or experience in plastics materials or plastics recycling and no specialized knowledge in valuing plastics recycling machines such as those in question.barlow did not pay kabeck for his advice.
in december of,barlow filled out and signed a subscription agreement and purchased one limited partnership unit a interest in dickinson for.a section of the agreement entitled purchaser representative s stated that t he undersigned understands that said representative s may be compensated to the extent of of the price of the units purchased out of the proceeds of the offering,and,accordingly,said representative s may have an interest in seeing the offering consummated.at.in signing the agreement,barlow claims that he assumed that the purchaser representative referred to in this section was gordon.
before signing the subscription agreement and investing in dickinson,barlow did not make any independent investigation of the fair market value of the recycler,nor did he seek the advice of any expert in the plastics industry.instead,barlow was influenced to sign the agreement because he assumed that krickstein and other medical colleagues were investing in dickinson.barlow,however,did not have any specific conversations with his colleagues about either dickinson or plastics recycling before making the investment.barlow did not believe,nor is there any evidence in the record to suggest,that barlow colleagues had any knowledge in plastics recycling barlow himself did not have any such knowledge.however,barlow did know at the time of signing the agreement that he would receive immediate tax benefits in excess of his investment.
based on his initial and only investment of in dickinson,barlow claimed on his tax return investment and energy credits of,which were promised in the offering,and a loss of.these claims reduced petitioners tax liability by,an amount that exceeded his investment by almost two to one.in addition,barlow claimed partnership losses on petitioners returns for through in the respective amounts of,and.barlow never made a profit in any year from his investment in dickinson.
sometime in the,barlow became concerned about his participation in dickinson.in september of,barlow amended his returns for through in order to satisfy anticipated underpayments of tax attributable to the dickinson investment.
dickinson was a tefra partnership subject to the unified partnership audit and litigation procedures set forth in irc.on may,the commissioner mailed a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment fpaa to sam winer,the tax matters partner of the dickinson partnership,for each of the taxable years.a copy of each fpaa was also mailed to barlow.
the fpaas advised barlow of adjustments that the commissioner proposed to make to the partnership returns filed by dickinson.specifically,the fpaas disallowed deductions and credits claimed by dickinson in connection with its plastics recycling activities for through.on june,sam winer petitioned the tax court with respect to the fpaa,commencing the case of dickinson recycling associates commissioner.while that case was pending,the tax court,in,decided that the plastics recycling transaction involved in provizer commissioner,were shams,and this court affirmed in an unpublished decision.see cir.winer,who was also the tax matters partner of the partnership involved in provizer,conceded in dickinson that the commissioner had correctly disallowed all items of income,loss,and credit,and that the recyclers were overvalued.accordingly,on february,the tax court entered its decision in dickinson sustaining the commissioner fpaa determinations for.
on november,after the tax court decision in the dickinson proceeding became final,the commissioner mailed a letter to petitioners in connection with the tax year,advising them that their amended return had been accepted as filed their underpayment was attributable to a transaction and as a result,irc c interest was applicable.section c provides for an increased rate of interest with respect to underpayments attributable to a transaction.see c.the commissioner notified petitioners on december,that the amount of interest assessed against them under c was.petitioners paid the interest later that month.
thereafter,in march of,the commissioner sent petitioners notices of deficiencies for each of the years,determining that petitioners were liable for additions to tax for negligence.the commissioner also determined that petitioners were liable for another addition to tax for for overstating the value of the recycling machines.petitioners took their case to the tax court,challenging only the additions to tax for negligence and the c interest for.trial was held in connection with the negligence issue,wherein two witnesses testified.barlow was one of the witnesses to testify,stating that he received advice about investing in dickinson,and gordon testified as to his role in promoting the dickinson investment.with respect to the c issue,barlow did not dispute that the underpayment for was attributable to a transaction,but,instead,claimed that because no court would have jurisdiction to review his liability for the interest before it was paid,the imposition of the c interest violated due process requirements of the fifth amendment.
the tax court issued an opinion upholding the commissioner.with respect to the negligence additions,the tax court opined that in light of various signs indicating that the leasing transactions were invalid and that the recycling machines were overvalued,a reasonably prudent person with barlow education and investment experience would have made an independent investigation into the validity of the investment,which barlow failed to do.with respect to the c interest issue,the tax court recognized that in cases such as this,where interest is assessed on an underpayment that is attributable to a partnership transaction that is,a prepayment judicial determination as to the amount of the taxpayer liability for such interest is unavailable to the taxpayer.the tax court held that this fact did not violate due process inasmuch as there were judicial forums,including the tax court,in which petitioners could seek judicial review of this assessment after it had been paid,and petitioners have availed themselves of the forums.
discussion 
whether the tax court acted without jurisdiction in finding statutory and constitutional authority for the assessment of interest under irc.
this court reviews de novo the tax court legal conclusions made based upon its findings of fact.see smith commissioner,cir.
petitioners argue that not all tax assessments may be made without notice and opportunity for a hearing,and claim that the denial of a hearing denied them due process.petitioners also make several circular arguments claiming such things as inconsistencies in the tax code regarding tax court jurisdiction,and that the legislative history of a suggests that the interest penalty was intended to be part of tax court proceedings when,in,congress instructed the tax court to issue various penalties,including c to reduce its enormous workload due to tax shelters.petitioners suggest,h ow would the tax court use the tax motivated interest penalty to lighten its docket if it was not intended to have jurisdiction over it in the first place the greatest likelihood is that if congress had intended assessments of tax motivated interest to be done without the benefit of notice of deficiency,it would have done so directly,as it had done on previous occasions.petitioners conclude that i f the tax motivated interest penalty is not interest and subject to tax court jurisdiction under irc c,then the assessment has been made without specific statutory authority.such assessments are void as a denial of due process.see petitioners brief on appeal at.
the commissioner argues that petitioners due process argument based upon the tax court lack review the imposition of interest at the rate set forth in irc c is without merit.the commissioner maintains that pursuant to irc and,the tax court has jurisdiction to redetermine a deficiency,as that term is defined in.the commissioner further maintains that where the tax court has deficiency jurisdiction over a particular tax year,then pursuant to irc b,the tax court has jurisdiction to review a taxpayer claim that there has been an overpayment with respect to that year.and although a taxpayer must first pay the amount in dispute,he may contest his tax liability by way of a refund suit in the appropriate district court or in the court of federal claims under a a.we agree with the commissioner argument in all respects.
in white commissioner,wl,the commissioner issued a notice of deficiency to the petitioners after a proceeding was completed determining that the petitioners were liable for additional interest under irc c,as well as additions to tax under irc a,a,a and.the petitioners filed a petition for redetermination,and the commissioner filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction as to the petitioner claims regarding liability for interest under c.id.the tax court examine
