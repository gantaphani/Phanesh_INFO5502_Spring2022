background 
factual background 
in august,ambase,the successor corporation to the home group,purchased carteret,a federally chartered stock savings bank or thrift.after acquisition,ambase filed consolidated federal income tax returns with carteret.on december,the office of thrift supervision seized carteret and put it into the conservatorship of the rtc due to carteret failure to satisfy capital requirements under the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act.in,the rtc transferred receivership to the federal deposit insurance company fdic.
the dispute in this appeal relates to ambase consolidated federal income tax return,filed on august.on its return,ambase reported carteret tax items from january,through december.it did not,however,include carteret tax items,as ambase did not control carteret,and the rtc had not provided ambase with the relevant records at the time of filing,proposed regulations under.allowed a consolidated group to elect irrevocably to disaffiliate from an institution in its affiliated group that had been placed in receivership.see treatment of acquisition of certain financial institutions certain tax consequences of federal financial assistance to financial institutions,proposed april.however,such an election could not become binding until the regulations had been finalized,see id.at,which did not occur until december.see also reg.the final regulation.on its original return,ambase included a statement electing to disaffiliate from carteret.on april,after having received an extension of time,ambase timely notified the commissioner of internal revenue the commissioner of its decision to reverse its previous decision to disaffiliate from carteret.
on march,ambase filed an amended consolidated federal return for in which it sought to amend its consolidated federal income tax return to increase carteret claimed bad debt deduction,calculated under the reserve method,and generate a net operating loss.on that same date,ambase also filed an amended consolidated federal income tax return for,on which it sought to apply the net operating loss and create a refund.the irs denied the refund claim,and,on april,ambase filed a complaint in the district court against the united states the government.
consideration of ambase refund claim requires an understanding of the reserve method for calculating bad debt deductions.we turn now to a description of the applicable law.
ii.bad debt deductions and the reserve method 
the internal revenue code allows taxpayers to take a deduction relating to worthless or bad debts.two methods exist for calculating this deduction the specific method and the reserve method.the specific method allows taxpayers to deduct the basis of a bad debt in the year in which the debt becomes worthless.the reserve method allows taxpayers to create a reserve of funds in anticipation of bad debts,and deduct,instead of the basis in a particular bad debt,a reasonable addition to the reserve for the year the reasonable addition.a,a.a bad debt must be accounted for in the year in which it becomes worthless.see a specific method calavo,comm r,cir the reserve method.however,it can be difficult for a taxpayer to determine the year in which a particular debt becomes worthless.see,boehm comm r.young comm r,cir.the advantage of the reserve method over the specific method is that,under the former,the taxpayer deduction is not tied to a determination of worthlessness of any particular debt.it allows the taxpayer to make a reasonable prediction of the amount of debt that will become worthless in a given year without having to identify specific worthless loans,and claim a deduction based on that amount.
specific bad debts are still relevant to the reserve method.in the year in which a bad debt becomes worthless,the taxpayer,instead of a taking another deduction,charges off the debt by reducing the amount of the reserve.nash united states,d.this increases the reasonable addition otherwise allowable for the year.see smith united states.similarly,in any year in which a bad debt is recovered,specific method taxpayers include the recovery in gross income,while reserve method taxpayers instead increase the amount of the reserve,decreasing the reasonable addition otherwise allowable for the year.see united states bank of am.trust sav.ass n,cir see also mertens,law of federal income taxation.upon liquidation,the taxpayer unused bad debt reserve is included in gross income.seattle nat.bank of seattle comm r,cir.but see nash,at declining to apply this tax benefit rule when accounts receivable net of reserves were transferred by partnership during liquidation.
use of the reserve method was formerly available to a broader group of taxpayers,but in its use was restricted.see,stat,repealing c see also staff of comm.on taxation,tax reform proposals accounting issues,comm.print.however,certain financial institutions are still allowed to use the reserve method,a,a.ambase affiliate,carteret,is a thrift eligible to use the reserve method under and treasury regulation.thrifts are required to establish two separate reserves,one for nonqualifying loans and one for qualifying real property loans.reg.a see also reg.defining terms.
the reserve method gives the taxpayer a considerable degree of discretion to determine the amount of its bad debt deduction and reduce tax liability.this discretion is restricted by several requirements.first,the taxpayer must earmark the amounts of the reserves,which are not to be used for any purpose other than to apply against bad debts as they occur.levelland sav.loan ass united states,cir citing rio grande loan ass united states,wl.
second,the reasonable addition must be reasonable,as defined by the internal revenue code and treasury regulations,which describe several methods for calculating the reasonable addition relevant to this appeal is the experience method,also called the moving average formula,see b,b,which seeks to ascertain a reasonable addition to a reserve in light of the taxpayer recent chargeoff history.thor power tool comm r,d citing black motor comm r.the experience method starts with the balance of the reserve at the close of the taxable year and then calculates a maximum allowable value for the reserve,based on a ratio which looks to total bad debts and total loans for the current and five preceding taxable years.b.the difference between the maximum allowable value and current balance is the maximum addition to the reserve that is permitted the maximum addition.the taxpayer may claim as a deduction a reasonable addition up to,but not exceeding,the maximum addition.b.because a bad debt reserve is an estimate of future losses,the taxpayer will not invariably increase the reserve based on its past history of bad debts.roth steel tube comm r,cir emphasis added.the taxpayer reasonable addition is calculated and credited at the close of the tax year.reg.b.
as a third qualification,a taxpayer is not to be permitted to enlarge its reserve account retroactively.rio grande,at see also rogan commercial disc,cir wengel,united states,reg.b.this rule follows from the purpose of the bad debt reserve as an estimate of future losses for which the taxpayer freezes funds.a retrospective enlargement would allow the taxpayer to claim a deduction based on funds that it did not have to freeze on its books.this appeal asks us to consider exceptions to the rule of nonretroactivity 
iii.ambase refund claim 
ambase refund claim turns on a proposed amendment to its consolidated federal income tax return for the tax year.on its initial return,ambase calculated a maximum addition of approximately million but only claimed as a deduction a reasonable addition of approximately million on its amended return,ambase seeks to increase its maximum addition to approximately million and to increase its claimed reasonable addition deduction from approximately million to the new maximum value.in other words,ambase is claiming an additional deduction of approximately million.approximately million of that million relates directly to carteret activities.the remaining million is the amount by which ambase could have,but chose not to,increase the reserve on its original return,based on its initial calculation of the maximum addition ambase argues that it is entitled to the entirety of this additional deduction based on its decision to include carteret,on its consolidated federal income tax return.
the irs denied ambase refund claim,and,on april,ambase filed a complaint in the district court against the government.before the district court,the government moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.on march,the district court conditionally dismissed ambase claim,but granted ambase a limited discovery period in which to seek evidence establishing jurisdiction.on february,on ambase motion,the district court set aside its previous dismissal.in response to two partial motions for summary judgment by ambase,the district court issued a november,memorandum of decision,ambase,d,and a may,memorandum of decision,ambase,wl,which granted in part and denied in part ambase refund claim.ambase claim was granted to the extent that it offset the additional income of carteret during the period of tax year,from december to december,which was not included on ambase original return.in all other respects,the district court denied ambase claim.the district court issued a july,final judgment and order consistent with its prior memoranda.
ambase now appeals,arguing that the district court should have allowed its amendment and refund claim in its entirety.on appeal,the government renews its argument that the district court did not have jurisdiction.

here,the parties agree that,under section a,ambase had until march,to file its claim.ambase filed its amended return on march,after that date.before the district court,the government moved to dismiss the refund claim for lack of jurisdiction,but ambase put forth several arguments as to why its claim was timely.first,it argued that the reserve method regulations required an amended return.second,it argued that,under the limitations period,the claim was timely,because it related back to four earlier claims an attachment to ambase original return,a june,note made during a separate government audit,a june protective claim,and a september protective claim filed by the fdic on behalf of carteret.third,ambase argued that the limitations period,under which the claim would be timely,applied to its refund claim.the district court rejected these arguments and conditionally dismissed the refund claim.with respect to ambase argument relying on the fdic claim,the court dismissal rested on the fact that the document was not before the court,and the court granted ambase a limited discovery period in which to acquire the fdic claim.after ambase produced the fdic claim,the district court held that it had jurisdiction and set aside the order of dismissal.
