the superseding indictment charged fraud by wire affecting a financial institution counts to aiding and assisting in the preparation of a false return counts to fraud by wire counts to and aggravated identity theft counts to.the district court dismissed counts,and on the government motion.after the district court granted her motion for acquittal on counts,and,stargell was convicted on the remaining charges.she claims that the district court erred by failing to grant her motion for judgment of acquittal as to counts,and of the superseding indictment despite the government failure to prove that the underlying conduct affected a financial institution permitting convictions on counts and without excluding the possibility that they were based on conduct that preceded the enactment of allowing stargell former attorney to testify at the sentencing hearing and improperly calculating loss and restitution amounts.
we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm the convictions and sentences.
after completing a course on tax preparation and receiving state certification,stargell began preparing taxes for liberty tax service lts in moreno valley,california.lts terminated stargell employment in,and stargell began her own tax preparation business,called liberty bell tax service lbts.
the evidence at trial established that while operating lbts,stargell prepared federal income tax returns containing false statements and engaged in schemes to obtain refund anticipation loans ral from banks based on these fraudulent returns.in some instances,the irs detected the fraud and declined to issue a tax refund,resulting in a loss to the banks that made the rals.the government also proved that stargell engaged in identity theft by using the names and social security numbers of former clients or other individuals,without their knowledge or consent,to file tax returns and to request rals.
before sentencing,the district court held two evidentiary hearings to determine loss and restitution.at the latter hearing,kay otani,former counsel for stargell,testified as a witness.stargell current counsel,the district court,and the government inquired as to otani method of calculating loss and restitution,what documents he sought to obtain from the government,how those documents would have assisted or disadvantaged him,and what was ultimately provided to him.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the district court found an offense level of,a criminal history category of i,and an advisory guideline range of to months.the district court imposed a special assessment,restitution in the amount of,and incarceration for months.this appeal followed.
stargell contends that the district court erred in failing to grant her motion for acquittal as to counts,and because the government failed to prove that such counts affected a financial institution as required by.stargell argument is unpersuasive.
where a defendant moves for acquittal at the close of the government evidence,we review de novo whether sufficient evidence exists to support a guilty verdict.united states stewart,cir citing united states carranza,cir.our review of the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a criminal conviction is to determine whether the record evidence could reasonably support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson.virginia.we do not ask whether we believe that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at quoting woodby ins.instead,the relevant question is whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.
special agent juan marquez of the irs criminal investigations division irs cid testified as a summary witness pursuant to rule of the federal rules of evidence.agent marquez presented a summary chart based upon his review of tax returns all of which either listed stargell as the tax preparer or were connected to her company,lbts.the summary chart demonstrated that each of the tax returns contained either false wage or false withholding figures,and that the vast majority contained both false wage and false withholding figures.every return listed in the summary chart sought a refund,and the total refunds sought amounted to.the irs refunded in connection with these returns before it stopped the remaining claimed refunds.
agent marquez also testified that banks funded a ral for each of the tax returns listed in the summary chart.when a bank issued a ral and the irs later stopped the refund for the related return,the bank was not able to recoup the value of the ral and suffered a financial loss.
to the government,the lost refund money was the main effect that stargell actions had on the banks.yet,the banks only lost money with respect to two of the four counts of fraud charged in the indictment count and count.the summary chart clearly shows that the banks did not lose any refund money on the other two tax returns in question here.nevertheless,the government argues that because rals based on fraudulent returns are riskier than rals based on returns,stargell fraud scheme affected the banks by exposing them to an increased risk of loss.the banks were affected by stargell fraud scheme,the government argues,regardless of whether there was an actual financial loss.
we agree.our sister circuits have defined the term affects within the meaning of a similar statute,to include new or increased risk of loss to financial institutions.see united states mullins,cir holding that a new or increased risk of loss is sufficient to establish that wire fraud affects a financial institution united states serpico,cir holding that fraud affects a bank if the bank is exposed to an increased risk of loss,even if the bank never suffers an actual loss.although and are separate provisions the former extends the statute of limitations to ten years for offenses that affect a financial institution,while the latter defines the offense of wire fraud we see no reason why they should hold different meanings with respect to the term affects.accordingly,we hold that new or increased risk of loss is sufficient to establish that wire fraud affects a financial institution within the meaning of.
here,there was sufficient evidence for a rational jury to conclude that stargell fraudulent returns exposed the banks to an increased risk of loss.the senior risk analyst for one of the banks testified that of the rals issued in connection with stargell fraud scheme resulted in a loss to the bank,compared with a general loss rate of less than for rals.therefore,there was sufficient evidence for a rational jury to conclude that stargell fraud scheme affected the banks within the meaning of,regardless of whether the banks ultimately suffered any actual loss.the district court did not err in denying stargell motion to acquit as to counts,and.
stargell claims for the first time on appeal that because the government case regarding counts and wire fraud,the predicate offenses for counts and aggravated identity theft,focused significantly on conduct that the enactment of on july,the jury may have convicted stargell based solely on conduct.however,because the wire fraud did not occur until january and,the predicate offenses for the aggravated identity theft transpired well after enactment date.
