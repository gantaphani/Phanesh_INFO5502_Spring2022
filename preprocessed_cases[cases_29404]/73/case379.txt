concluding that linda plemons had not received constitutionally adequate notice of her right to redeem certain real property,the district court granted summary judgment to plemons and set aside a deed to that property obtained through the state procedure.advantage td,the tax lien purchaser,and douglas gale,who subsequently acquired the deed from advantage,appeal,asserting that constitutionally sufficient notice was provided to plemons.for the reasons that follow,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
in august,linda plemons and her business partner,jerry lipscomb who is not a party to this appeal purchased the property in question,located on echo road in south charleston,west virginia,for.they duly recorded the deed.
in february,plemons obtained financing from capital state bank in the amount of to pay off the seller of the property.she mistakenly believed that the bank was paying the property taxes on the property through an escrow account.because neither she nor the bank actually paid the taxes,the sheriff of kanawha county sold a tax lien on the property to advantage td on november.plemons was unaware of the sale when,in may,she moved from the property and rented it to tenants.
in december,advantage sought the issuance of a tax deed.as required by west virginia law,advantage p repare d a list of those to be served with notice to redeem and filed that list with the clerk of kanawha county so that the clerk could send them notice of their right to redeem the tax lien.see ann.michie.
the list enumerated several interested parties,including plemons,and provided three addresses for plemons echo road,south charleston,the address of the subject property in the relevant deeds echo road,south charleston,the mailing address of the property and garden street,charleston,the address of another property owned by plemons.the list also directed the clerk to send notices to occupant at and echo road.in late january,the clerk sent the notices by certified mail return receipt requested.the parties agree that the post office promptly returned as undeliverable the notices addressed to plemons,as well as the notices sent to occupant at the echo road addresses plemons had been renting out the subject property and living on quarry pointe since november.
after return of the mailed notices,advantage published,from april,to april,notice as to redemption rights in two charleston newspapers and posted the notice on the front door of the kanawha county courthouse.no one responded to the publications or posting.on may,the clerk issued a deed to advantage,which it recorded.on november,advantage conveyed the property to douglas gale by quitclaim deed,which he properly recorded.according to plemons,she first became aware of the sale of the property in january.
challenging her failure to receive timely notice as a violation of state law and the united states constitution,plemons filed a complaint in west virginia state court seeking to set aside the tax deed issued to advantage as well as the deed issued to gale.advantage,a delaware business trust,and gale,a citizen and resident of florida,removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.
on plemons motion for summary judgment,the district court examined west virginia statutory scheme for tax sales of property.section provides in relevant part 
as soon as the clerk has prepared the notice,he shall cause it to be served upon all persons named on the list generated by the purchaser 
if the address of any person entitled to notice is unknown to the purchaser and can not be discovered by due diligence on the part of the purchaser,the notice shall be served by publication 
ann.michie.a related provision of west virginia law allows a person to set aside a deed if she shows by clear and convincing evidence that the purchaser failed to exercise reasonably diligent efforts to provide notice of his intention to acquire such title to the complaining party.va code ann.b michie.
the district court interpreted these west virginia statutes to require a purchaser to exercise due diligence in identifying and locating parties entitled to notice and to allow publication notice only after the exercise of such diligence.the court,therefore,properly reasoned that west virginia statutory notice requirements parallel the requirements of the united states constitution.see mennonite bd.of missions adams,d mullane central hanover bank trust.
the court concluded that w hen notice sent by certified mail is returned unclaimed,the reasonable diligence standard requires the purchaser to make further inquiry reasonably calculated to locate the interested party correct address.the district court found that in this case,after return of the notices,advantage could have ascertained plemons address through a number of different means telephoning her at the number listed in the local telephone directory,asking plemons tenants for their assistance in reaching her,or inquiring of plemons mortgagee.because advantage took none of these actions to find plemons after the notices were returned as undeliverable,the court held that plemons had proved that she had not received constitutionally adequate notice of the right to redeem her property and granted her summary judgment.
advantage and gale appeal.they do not maintain that they are entitled to summary judgment.but they do assert that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to plemons.
we must determine whether,as a matter of law,plemons failed to receive constitutionally sufficient notice before the issuance of the deed that extinguished her property interest 
in a series of cases,beginning with mullane central hanover bank trust,the supreme court has set forth the requirements for constitutionally adequate notice of an impending deprivation of property.i n any proceeding which is to be accorded finality,due process requires notice reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.mullane,at.
mullane dealt with notice by publication to beneficiaries of a common trust.complying with the new york law governing such trusts,central hanover bank published notice in a local newspaper to inform beneficiaries of a settlement.in addressing the sufficiency of this notice,the supreme court emphasized that when notice is a person due,process which is a mere gesture is not due process.id.at.rather,the means used to provide notice must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.id.only a method that is reasonable,taking into account the practicalities and peculiarities of the case,will be adequate.id.at.the court held that notice by publication sufficed for those beneficiaries whose interests or whereabouts could not with due diligence be ascertained.id.at.but notice by publication did not suffice for those identifiable beneficiaries whose location was ascertainable that class of beneficiaries should have been notified by mail.id.at.where the names and post office addresses are at hand,the reasons disappear for resort to means less likely than the mails.
cases following mullane have sharpened its rule,but reasonable efforts designed to actually inform a party with a property interest of possible deprivation of that interest remain the touchstone of constitutionally adequate notice.id.at.thus,although the constitution does not always require actual receipt of notice,it does always require efforts reasonably calculated under all the circumstances to apprise a party of the pendency of the deprivation of property.dusenbery united states,d.when a party required to give notice knows that a mailed notice has,for some reason,failed to inform a person holding a property interest of the impending deprivation,the notice does not pass constitutional muster.see robinson hanrahan,d holding notice of forfeiture sent to address state knew to be inaccurate or defective insufficient covey town of somers.holding notice mailed to taxpayer known to be incompetent insufficient to afford her notice.
of course,consideration should be given to the practicalities of the situation in each case.tulsa prof l collection,at.however,actual notice is a minimum constitutional to a proceeding which will adversely affect the liberty or property interests of any party,whether unlettered or well versed in commercial practice,if its name and address are reasonably ascertainable.id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.for this reason,the court has held that even a state legitimate interest in expeditious resolution of probate proceedings does not justify the failure to mail notice of a nonclaim probate proceeding to a creditor when the identity of the creditor was reasonably ascertainable through reasonably diligent efforts.id.at.
in the court considered application of these principles in the context of a tax sale,specifically,whether constructive notice by publication to a mortgagee sufficed to inform the mortgagee of a pending tax sale of property in which it had an interest.mennonite,at.the court held that when the identity and location of a mortgagee can be obtained through examination of public records,constructive notice alone does not satisfy the mandate of mullane.id.moreover,a party ability to take steps to safeguard its interests does not relieve the state of its constitutional obligation.id.at.although a party required to provide notice need not undertake extraordinary efforts to discover whereabouts not in the public record,it must use reasonably diligent efforts to discover addresses that are reasonably ascertainable.see id.at.
in sum,mullane and its progeny teach that a party charged with giving notice must be reasonably diligent in doing so.in the case of a tax sale of property,diligence requires that reasonable efforts be made to identify and locate parties with an interest in the property.once those parties are located,they must be provided notice of the impending sale using a method reasonably calculated,under all of the circumstances,to actually inform them of the sale.
here,advantage examined the title to the property to identify and locate those with interests in it and then arranged to send notice by certified mail return receipt requested to the addresses that it found.each of the notices addressed to plemons or to occupant of the subject property was promptly returned as undeliverable.the question before us is what efforts must be made by a party charged with giving notice of irrevocable loss of property via a tax sale,when it is,or should be,apparent from the initial mailings prompt return that they have failed to provide any notice to the intended recipient.
although the supreme court has not directly addressed this question,it has provided some guidance in covey and robinson.in covey,at,when a town had mailed notice of its intent to foreclose on a tax lien to a person whom the town knew to be mentally incompetent,the court held that such notice was constitutionally insufficient.because the town was aware that,as a consequence of the incompetence,the mailing did not actually provide notice,the foreclosure constituted a deprivation of property without due process of law.see also robinson,at.holding that mailing that the government knew would not accomplish notice was insufficient.these cases,as one state supreme court has noted,suggest that when the party seeking to affect a property interest is itself on notice of the failure of mailed notice to inform an interested party,the party must take further action to determine a more accurate address or otherwise ensure receipt of meaningful notice.schwartz dey,en banc.adopting the rule that prompt return of mailed notice triggers a duty to make reasonable efforts would seem to best comport with the instruction in mullane that due process requires efforts reasonably calculated to actually apprise interested parties of the possible deprivation that is,notice consistent with that of one desirous of actually informing the absentee,rather than efforts that are but a mere gesture.mullane,at.
most courts have reached precisely this conclusion in case after case they have held that the reasonable diligence standard requires a party charged with notice to follow up when a mailing has been returned as unclaimed or undeliverable.as the district of columbia court of appeals has remarked,the return of the certified notice marked unclaimed should have been a red flag for some further action.malone robinson,see also bank of america giant inland empire,th,d,o nce county became aware that bank had not received notice regarding the tax sale,county should have made reasonable efforts to renotify bank about the tax sale at an alternate address.
the supreme court of pennsylvania,in tracy county of chester,tax claim bureau,reminds that it is a momentous event when a government subjects a citizen property to forfeiture for the of taxes,see also george antiochian orthodox christian church aggarwal,noting the importance of the property right that is involved in the foreclosure of a right of redemption.because of the importance of the property right,due process requires at a minimum that an owner of land be actually notified by government,if reasonably possible,before his land is forfeited by the state.tracy,at.thus,where the mailed notice has not been delivered because of an inaccurate address,the authority must make a reasonable effort to ascertain the identity and whereabouts of the owner s.id.at.similarly,the new york court of appeals has explained that,when notice is returned as undeliverable,the enforcing officer is in no different position than if an initial examination of the tax roll had yielded no address.generally,when the notice is returned as undeliverable,the tax district should conduct a reasonable search of the public record.kennedy mossafa.
indeed,the courts so holding are legion.see,akey clinton county,cir in light of the notice return,the county was required to use reasonably diligent efforts to ascertain the correct address.rosenberg smidt,alaska requiring,in a case in which notice was returned as unclaimed,the exercise of due diligence to determine a correct address schmidt langel,diligent inquiry requires that if a notice has been returned,the county treasurer must the county records to check the address for accuracy and look for an alternative address.giacobbi hall,idaho,holding that the return of mailed notice as undelivered imposed a duty on the county to make reasonable inquiry to find the owner correct address bryant,so d,requiring,after mailed notice was returned,further effort on the part of the tax collector to inform tax debtors of delinquent taxes george antiochian orthodox christian church,at holding that when the initial investigation of the tax rolls provided the incorrect address,and notice was returned as undeliverable,the parties should have made efforts to discover the correct address city of boston james,requiring further inquiries when notice was returned patrick rice,holding that the return of mailed notice did not mean that the correct address was not reasonably ascertainable and voiding the tax sale in which the property at issue was sold port lawrence title trust,ohio.common pleas ruling that the county failure to follow up once notice was returned as undeliverable fell far short of the reasonable diligence required wells fargo credit ziegler,holding,in a case in which the county treasurer mailed notice,but the proof of receipt was never received by the treasurer,the act of mailing without proof of receipt of notice falls short of the exercise of reasonable diligence in assuring actual notice good kennedy,holding that,when notice was returned undelivered,diligence required further efforts to uncover a correct address.
likewise,many of our sister circuits,in a different but analogous context,have required that the party charged with notice follow up once it is clear that initial mailings have failed to provide notice.see united states ritchie,cir we now join the second,third,fifth,seventh,tenth,and c ircuits in holding that,when initial personal notice letters are returned undelivered,the government must make reasonab
