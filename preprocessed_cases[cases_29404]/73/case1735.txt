in arden carmichael,county of sacramento arden carmichael this court held that a fee imposed on nonprofit organizations by the county of sacramento the county based upon a percentage of their gross receipts earned from bingo games violated article xiii,section,subdivision d of the state constitution hereinafter sometimes referred to as subdivision d.subdivision d provides that a nonprofit organization is exempt from any business license tax or fee measured by income or gross receipts that is levied by a county 
in an effort to conform with the law,the county changed its fee structure.it now imposes a fee based upon a percentage of the prize payouts from the bingo games.
plaintiffs,a group of nonprofit organizations that operate licensed bingo games within the county,brought this action challenging the county new fee structure,arguing that p rize payouts track the gross income closely enough to be considered inextricably linked and that a fee based thereon is therefore violative of the state constitution prohibition against fees measured by income or gross receipts.plaintiffs also argue that the new fee violates penal code section,subdivision l,which authorizes the imposition of a license fee in the amount of,plus an additional fee that may not exceed the actual costs of law enforcement and public safety directly related to the bingo activities.
the county moved for summary adjudication,and the trial court ruled that the county new fee complied with the state constitution and penal code section.
in the published portion of our opinion,we conclude that the county fee does not violate the state constitution because a fee measured by prize is an expense of the bingo be deemed a fee based on income or gross receipts.neither the plain language of the constitutional provision nor its purpose supports an extension of the prohibition to fees based on expenses.however,we reverse and remand because the county has failed to sustain its burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact whether the county is charging plaintiffs a fee that exceeds that permitted by penal code section,subdivision l.
background 
in june,the voters adopted proposition,which amended and limited the reach of article xiii,section of the state authorizes,with some exceptions,the imposition of taxes measured by adding another exception,subdivision d.subdivision d,which exempts nonprofit organizations from any local business license tax or fee measured by income or gross receipts,states in relevant part a nonprofit organization that is exempted from taxation by chapter of part of division of the revenue and taxation code or subchapter f of chapter of subtitle a of the internal revenue code of is exempt from any business license tax or fee measured by income or gross receipts that is levied by a county or city,whether charter or general law,a city and county,a school district,a special district,or any other local agency.
notwithstanding the passage of proposition,between june and december,the county collected from nonprofit organizations in fees based on one percent of each organization gross receipts over earned from bingo games,as authorized by a former version of penal code section and a former county ordinance given the clear and unambiguous language of subdivision d,we concluded in arden carmichael that the county imposition of a fee based on the gross receipts of the bingo games was unconstitutional.
effective january,penal code section was amended hereinafter referred to as section to conform with the requirements of subdivision d.section,subdivision l,now states in relevant part 
l a city,county,or city and county may impose a license fee on each organization that it authorizes to conduct bingo games.the fee,whether for the initial license or renewal,shall not exceed fifty dollars annually 
in lieu of the license fee permitted under paragraph,a city,county,or city and county may impose a license fee of fifty dollars paid upon application an additional fee for law enforcement and public safety costs incurred by the city,county,or city and county that are directly related to bingo activities may be imposed and shall be collected monthly by the city,county,or city and county issuing the license however,the fee shall not exceed the actual costs incurred in providing the service.stats,ch.
also effective january,the county amended county code section to conform with section,modifying the basis for its bingo fee from one percent of gross receipts to a fee plus an additional fee,to be prescribed by the county board of supervisors,to recover law enforcement and public safety costs in accordance with section.that fee,as set by the board of supervisors,has varied from percent of monthly prize payouts less an exemption of monthly for the period of,to a fee of percent for,to a fee of percent effective january.
in deciding to base a fee on prize payouts,the county reasoned that not only was the amount of prize payouts steady,thereby offering a consistent source of monies for the county to fully recover its costs,but that prize payouts generally correlate d to the amount of time involved by the county in regulating licensees usually,with greater sums in prizes and payouts,a charity conducts more games thereby attracting a larger number of gamblers.
in direct response to the county new fee structure,plaintiffs filed this suit seeking a refund of bingo fees collected by the county from january to may.in their first cause of action,plaintiffs charged that because prize payouts are linked to gross receipts,the county new fee structure violated the state constitution.they also contended that the amount of fees did not reflect the actual law enforcement and public safety costs incurred by the county to oversee the operation of the bingo games.a third cause of action was later added making the same claims for an unspecified future time period.second and fourth causes of action sought declaratory relief over the right of members of one charitable organization to work in the bingo hall of another,but this is not at issue on appeal 
the county thereafter filed a motion for summary judgment,or in the alternative,for summary adjudication and judgment on the pleadings.
following hearing and argument,the trial court granted the county motion for summary adjudication.the court concluded that the fee complied with the state constitution and section.the court also granted the county motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to the second and fourth causes of action for declaratory relief.the action was dismissed in its entirety.plaintiffs appeal.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
f rom commencement to conclusion,the party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
g enerally,the party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact if he carries his burden of production,he causes a shift,and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.i f the court concludes that the opposing party evidence or inferences raise a triable issue of material fact,it must conclude its consideration and deny the motion.
b.the constitutionality of the fee 
plaintiffs claim that the county fee violates the state constitution presents only a legal question.it is undisputed that the county fee is calculated on the basis of prize payouts,and the relevant question is whether this violates subdivision d prohibition against fees measured by income or gross receipts.this issue was thus properly subject to a summary judgment determination.
plaintiffs argue that a fee measured by prize payouts is illegal because p rize payouts track the gross income closely enough to be considered inextricably linked.they observe that prize payouts have historically amounted to about percent of gross receipts,and thus claim that the county adjusted its fee from one percent of gross receipts
