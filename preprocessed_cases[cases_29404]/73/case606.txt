factual background 
zack and his business partner,lester sova,began operating a tool and die business called zachova tool die,ztd in.they formed zachova industries,zi in to accommodate the overflow work from ztd.zack and sova each owned percent of the corporate stock of ztd and zi the zachova entities,and they served as president and,respectively,of these corporations.
in the,zack and sova formed four additional businesses sovack partnership sovack,colt tool die,colt,synchronized design development,synchronized,and jaclyn leasing,jaclyn.sovack owned the machinery and equipment that the zachova entities used and the building in which they were located.colt,like ztd and zi,was engaged in the tool and die business.synchronized designed the dies that were used by ztd,zi,and colt.jaclyn owned a building that it rented to the other business entities operated by zack and sova.zack and sova each owned of the stock of colt and synchronized,of jaclyn,and,during the years at issue in the present case,of sovack.
in,zack and sova devised a scheme that enabled them to receive money from the zachova entities that they did not report as income for tax purposes.third parties would issue invoices to the zachova entities for work that had not actually been performed,and would receive payment from the entities.the payees would then cash the checks,keep percent as a fee for their services,and give the remaining percent of the payment back to zack and sova,who would split the proceeds evenly.payments that were made to the third parties were initially designated as expenses and deducted accordingly on the tax returns of the zachova entities.
in addition to the scheme,zack and sova made improvements and repairs to their personal residences that were billed to sovack.sovack recorded these payments either as deductible expenses or as capital expenditures that were depreciated.
the zachova entities started doing business with the ford motor company in.in order to obtain orders from ford,zack and sova began paying bribes to ed cooper,a ford employee.according to zack testimony at trial,the bribes totaled.sova,in contrast,testified that the zachova entities paid only in bribes.during an earlier interview with a ford investigator about the bribes,zack agreed with the figure.
in march of,dennis meagher became the chief financial officer of the zachova entities.he learned of the fraudulent invoices after working there for several months.meagher proceeded to consult with follmer,rudcewicz,follmer,the accounting firm that audited the zachova entities,and with the entities attorney.acting pursuant to follmer advice,meagher revised the records of the zachova entities by treating the false invoices as advances to zack and sova and designating the advances as notes receivable.
follmer prepared audited financial statements for the zachova entities,which were issued on june.these statements listed the accounts as an asset.follmer later instructed meagher to treat the payments as dividends to zack and sova.as a result,meagher revised the books of the zachova entities and charged the amounts of the fraudulent invoices as dividends to zack and sova.the zachova entities subsequently filed amended federal corporate income tax returns for tax years and.these amended returns reclassified expenses that had been deducted on the entities original tax returns.
on may,oxford investment group tooling corporation oig purchased the assets of ztd,zi,sovack,and colt.certain officers notes receivable remained on the books and records of the zachova entities at the time of the purchase.these notes had no relation to the scheme,but rather represented legitimate loans that the entities had made to zack and sova.instead of purchasing these notes,oig reduced its cash down payment for the four purchased companies by the amount of the notes.
procedural background 
on may,zack was convicted on one count of conspiracy to defraud the united states,on two counts of tax evasion,and on seven counts of filing false tax returns.zack conviction and sentence were affirmed by this court on direct appeal.united states zack,wl cir,unpublished table decision.his various motions to vacate his conviction pursuant to were also denied.zack united states,wl cir.may,unpublished table decision.

zack filed a petition in the tax court,requesting a redetermination of his income tax deficiency,on may.in his petition,zack did not dispute that he was involved in the scheme.instead,he argued that he should be permitted to reduce the amount of unreported income by the bribes he paid to cooper.he also claimed that he was entitled to a net operating loss carryback from the tax year that could be applied to reduce his tax liability for the tax years and.zack petition claimed a similar net operating loss carryback for the tax year,but,with the exception of a single sentence complaining about the tax court failure to mention,his briefs focus exclusively on.we shall do the same.
on june,the tax court granted partial summary judgment to the commissioner with respect to the assessments for fraud for the tax years and that were levied pursuant to.the court explained that because zack had been convicted for income tax evasion,the doctrine of collateral estoppel barred him from denying that his underpayments of income tax in and were due to fraud.
after conducting a trial on june and,the tax court found that zack had paid in bribes during the tax years and.on the theory that zack was simply a conduit between the zachova entities and cooper for the amount of bribes paid,the tax court allowed zack to reduce the amount of unreported income by for each of the two years in question.zack unreported income therefore decreased from to for,and from to for.
with respect to zack claim that he was entitled to carry back a net operating loss from the tax year to the tax years and,the tax court concluded that the record did not support zack argument.the tax court also upheld the commissioner determination that zack was liable for additional taxes based upon his substantial understatement of tax for the tax years and,pursuant to.this timely appeal followed.
