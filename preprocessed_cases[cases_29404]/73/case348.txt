in this appeal,we determine priority as between a tax lien filed by the internal revenue service irs and a bank security interest created by a deed of trust that was executed before the irs filed its lien but recorded thereafter.
on january,restivo auto body,of eldersburg,maryland,borrowed million from susquehanna bank and secured repayment of the loan by executing and delivering to the bank a deed of trust with respect to two parcels of real property.six days later,on january,the irs filed notice of a federal tax lien against restivo auto body for unpaid employment taxes.on february,susquehanna bank recorded the deed of trust it had received on january.
susquehanna bank commenced this adversary proceeding in restivo auto body chapter bankruptcy case,seeking a judgment declaring that the security interest it acquired on january,had priority over the irs tax lien filed on january,regardless of the fact that it did not record its security interest until after the irs had filed notice of its tax lien.
the district court granted susquehanna bank priority,ruling that,real prop,related back susquehanna bank subsequent recordation of its deed of trust to the date the deed of trust was executed and delivered,thus giving susquehanna bank a security interest effective before the irs recorded its tax lien and alternatively that maryland common law,under the doctrine of equitable conversion,gave susquehanna bank a protected equitable security interest in restivo auto body property,regardless of recordation,when restivo auto body executed the deed of trust in exchange for the million loan on january,before the irs recorded its tax lien.
we reject the district court holding that,real prop.gives susquehanna bank retroactive priority over the irs,concluding that h a use of the present perfect tense precludes giving effect to real prop.provision.we nonetheless affirm the judgment of the district court on the ground that under maryland common law,susquehanna bank acquired an equitable security interest in the two parcels of real property on january,regardless of recordation,because its interest became protected against a subsequent lien arising out of an unsecured obligation on that date and that therefore its security interest had priority over the irs tax lien under a and h.
restivo auto body failed to pay employment taxes for the fourth quarter of,the first quarter of,and the first and second quarters of.the irs issued notice and demand for payment of these deficiencies on or before september,giving rise to a tax lien on all property owned by restivo auto body.on january,the irs filed notice of its federal tax lien for the relevant quarters in the land records in the circuit court for carroll county,maryland.
on january,six days before the irs filed notice of its federal tax lien,restivo auto body borrowed million from susquehanna bank,giving the bank a note and a deed of trust on two adjacent parcels of real property on enterprise street in eldersburg,maryland lots and to secure repayment of the loan.the deed of trust,however,was not recorded until february,more than a month after the irs filed notice of its tax lien.
when restivo auto body filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in april,the irs filed a proof of claim,stating that restivo auto body owed it in taxes,interest,and penalties for the relevant quarters.susquehanna bank thereupon commenced an adversary proceeding against the irs,seeking a declaratory judgment as to the relative priorities of the parties secured interests,and the parties filed for summary judgment.in claiming priority for the deed of trust that it received before the irs filed its tax lien but recorded thereafter,susquehanna bank relied on,real prop,which relates back a deed of trust effective date upon recordation to the date when the deed of trust was executed.the bank also claimed a prior equitable lien.
the bankruptcy court relied on wc homes,llc united states,civil action no.dkc,wl,to hold that,real prop.relates back the effective date of susquehanna bank deed of trust to january,six days before the irs recorded its tax lien.the court explained 
why susquehanna bank would wait so long to record the lien,who knows but that does really matter for purposes of the analysis.the effective date is the most important thing,and the deed was recorded in such a way as give it priority pursuant to,real prop.over the government claim.
the district court affirmed,again relying on wc homes.the court stated that,under maryland law,which is made applicable by h a,a recorded deed of trust is effective against any creditor of the person who granted the deed of trust as of the date the deed of trust was delivered not the date it was recorded regardless of whether the creditor did or did not have notice of the deed of trust at any time.united states susquehanna bank in re restivo auto body,civil action no.elh,wl,at,quoting chi.title ins.mary,internal quotation marks omitted.it concluded accordingly that as of when the irs lien was recorded,susquehanna deed of trust was already a security interest that was entitled to priority under maryland law and,hence,federal law.id.at.
as an alternative basis for affirming the bankruptcy court,the district court held that susquehanna bank security interest would have taken priority under maryland law even if the deed of trust had never been recorded.the court reasoned that maryland doctrine of equitable conversion entitles the holder of a deed of trust to the same protections as a bona fide purchaser for value,who takes title free and clear of all subsequent liens regardless of recordation.since h a gives an irs tax lien only those protections that local law would afford to a subsequent judgment lien arising out of an unsecured obligation,the court concluded that susquehanna bank deed of trust took priority over the irs lien.
the irs filed this appeal.
the priority of a federal tax lien is governed by federal law.see aquilino united states.under federal law,a lien in favor of the irs attaches to all property owned by a person who neglects or refuses to pay taxes for which he is liable after the irs demands payment.the lien arises at the time the tax assessment is made,id,and generally takes priority over a lien created after that date under the principle that the first in time is the first in right,united states city of new britain,even if the tax lien is unrecorded,see united states snyder.but a tax lien is not valid as against any holder of a security interest until notice thereof has been filed by the secretary of the treasury.a.as used in a,a security interest is defined to mean any interest in property acquired by contract for the purpose of securing payment or performance of an obligation or indemnifying against loss or liability,id.h,and its existence at any given time depends on whether,inter alia,the interest has become protected under local law against a subsequent judgment lien arising out of an unsecured obligation,id.h a.
the issue,in this context,is whether maryland law gave susquehanna bank a security interest,as defined by h,when the bank received a deed of trust to secure the repayment of its loan on january,even though it did not record the deed of trust until february.as the issue is a question of law,we review the judgment of the district court de novo.
the irs contends that the district court misread h in applying,real prop.to give susquehanna bank the retroactive benefit of its late recordation.in particular,it argues that h requires the court to determine whether a security interest existed as of january when the irs filed its tax lien.and it notes that under h,a security interest only exists at such time as the interest has become protected under local law.emphasizing the text use of the present perfect tense,it argues that susquehanna bank did not obtain an effective security interest as of january,but only as of february,when it recorded the deed of trust.because susquehanna bank was not a holder of a security interest on january,according to the irs,the federal tax lien became valid against the bank by september,the last date on which the irs assessed the tax deficiencies,and therefore the federal tax lien takes priority under the rule of first in time,first in right.
susquehanna bank argues that maryland statute is part of the local law and must,under h a,be given effect.
our analysis begins with the determination of when,under maryland law,a deed of trust becomes effective against subsequent judgment liens.see h a.as a general proposition,maryland specifies that a deed of trust is not effective unless it is executed and recorded,real prop.a.when the date of execution is earlier than the date of recordation,recordation relates back the deed effective date to the date the deed was is,e very deed,when recorded,takes effect from its effective date,presumptively defined as the later of the date of the last acknowledgment or the date stated on the deed.id.this means,according to maryland case law,that a recorded deed of trust is effective against any creditor of the person who granted the deed of trust including a holder of a judgment lien as of the date the deed of trust was delivered.chi.title,at.thus,where a deed of trust was executed on july,but remained unrecorded for over two years,the effective date of the deed of trust was nonetheless july,giving the deed of trust priority over a lien arising from a judgment rendered after the execution date but before the recordation date.id.at see also,angelos.cas,holding that a mortgage took priority over a judgment lien under real prop,where the mortgage had been executed before,but recorded after,the institution of a lawsuit to obtain the judgment lien.
thus,under maryland law,when susquehanna bank recorded its deed of trust on february,the effective date of the deed of trust related back to january,when it was executed and delivered.
that conclusion,however,does not dispose of the question presented in this case,because the question here is not what interest susquehanna bank had on february,but rather,under u.a,whether susquehanna bank had a security interest at the time the irs recorded its tax lien on january.section h definition of that term focuses the priority determination on the date when the irs filed notice of its tax lien,providing that a security interest must exist at the time of the irs recordation.in statutory language,susquehanna bank would have priority only if,at such time as the filing of the irs lien,january,the property is in existence and the interest has become protected under local law against a subsequent judgment lien arising out of an unsecured obligation.h a.on january,however,susquehanna bank had not yet triggered the statute because recordation was an essential element that had not then been satisfied.see,real prop.every deed,when recorded,takes effect from its effective date emphasis added chi.title,at real prop.plainly means that a recorded deed of trust is effective against any creditor of the person who granted the deed of trust as of the date the deed of trust was delivered emphasis added.while susquehanna bank subsequent recordation on february gave its deed of trust an earlier effective date by operation of real prop,that statute had not yet been triggered as of the date on which the irs filed notice of its tax lien.thus,that statute had no bearing in determining whether susquehanna bank security interest had become protected as of january.
the district court analysis removed h a temporal distinction from the statute and rendered the words at such time as the interest has become protected superfluous,notwithstanding the supreme court guidance to take account of congress use of verb tenses.see,united states wilson,congress use of a verb tense is significant in construing statutes.tenses are particularly telling where congress uses multiple tenses within the same section.see dickerson new banner,deriving meaning from congress use of the present and present perfect tenses within barrett united states,congress used the present perfect tense elsewhere in the same section,in contrast to its use of the present tense here.the statute pattern is consistent and no intended misuse of language or of tense is apparent.
thus,we give effect to congress use of the present perfect tense in h a,especially since congress used the present tense within the same sentence.see h a security interest exists at any time a if,at such time,the property is in existence and the interest has become protected under local law emphasis added.as a consequence,h must be read to mean that at the time that the irs filed its lien,a security interest must have been in existence and must have become protected under local law in order to obtain priority.here,that means that as of january,susquehanna bank security interest must have become protected by local law against subsequent judgment liens to deny the irs priority.yet,under maryland law,as of january,real prop.did not give susquehanna bank such protection.that statute did not operate to give susquehanna bank a security interest until february,when it recorded its deed of trust.
the sixth circuit opinion in citizens state bank united states,cir per curiam,provides substantial support for this conclusion.there,citizens state bank recorded a mortgage involving two tracts of land.id.at.thereafter,intending to release the mortgage on one of the tracts,the bank inadvertently recorded a total release as to both tracts.id.the irs subsequently recorded a federal tax lien pursuant to.id.the bank sought priority for its mortgage,arguing that since it,at some point,had a security interest that had become protected under local law,its mortgage had priority under a.id.at.relying on the phrase has become in h a,the court rejected the bank interpretation of the statute 
congress intended the protection to cover present security interests which have been perfected at some point prior to the imposition of the federal tax lien.thus,the language would exclude security interests which have not yet become perfected under local law,as well as those interests which have been released t he language has become suggests that congress intended to cover only those security interests which exist presently,and have become valid prior to the federal tax lien.
id.emphasis added.
in short,although maryland law retroactively validated susquehanna bank security interest,it had not so operated as of january,when the irs recorded its tax lien.
this interpretation is precisely the one adopted in reg.h a.that regulation provides 
for purposes of this paragraph,a security interest is deemed to be protected against a subsequent judgment lien on 
a the date on which all actions required under local law to establish the priority of a security interest against a judgment lien have been taken,or 
b if later,the date on which all required actions are deemed effective,under local law,to establish the priority of the security interest against a judgment lien.
for purposes of this subdivision,the dates described in a and b of this subdivision shall be determined without regard to any rule or principle of local law which permits the relation back of any requisite action to a date earlier than the date on which the action is actually performed.
reg.h a emphasis added.
susquehanna bank argues that we should not rely on the regulation because the statute that the regulation interprets unambiguously gives effect to local law here,real prop.which,it maintains,protects recorded security interests from the date of delivery,irrespective of the date of recordation.this interpretation,however,overlooks the language of h,which,as we have already pointed out,requires that the evaluation of susquehanna bank security interest be made as of the date that notice of the federal tax lien was filed.because susquehanna bank had not,as of that date,recorded its deed of trust,the relationback provision in real prop,which applies only to a deed when recorded,did not yet apply.
even if susquehanna bank argument were recognized to demonstrate a statutory ambiguity,the treasury regulation would nonetheless be enforceable if it were a permissible construction of the statute.a court need not conclude that the agency construction was the only one it permissibly could have adopted to uphold the construction,or even the reading the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in the judicial proceeding.chevron,natural res.def.council.instead,any ensuing regulation is binding in the courts unless procedurally defective,arbitrary or capricious in substance,or manifestly contrary to the statute.united states mead.
we conclude that the regulation is indeed a permissible construction of h a.for the reasons we have already given above,the present perfect tense used in h a precludes the subsequent retroactive creation of a security interest.in addition,the legislative history of the federal tax lien act of,stat.codified in scattered sections of,demonstrates that congress wanted to bypass state laws that relate back a deed date of priority to an earlier date.the senate report states specifically that f or federal tax purposes,a security interest is not considered as existing until the condition set forth here namely,the requirements listed in h are met even though local law may relate a security interest back to an earlier date,at.and the house report expresses the same view 
for purposes of h a,a security interest becomes protected against a subsequent judgment lien on the date on which all actions required under local law to establish the priority of the security interest against such a judgment lien have been taken,or,if later,the date on which all such actions are deemed effective,under local law,to establish such priority.therefore,a security interest comes into existence only at the time prescribed in the preceding sentence notwithstanding any rule or principle of local law which permits the relation back of any requisite action to a date earlier than the date on which it is actually performed.
at emphasis added.
our conclusion that the treasury regulation is a reasonable construction of h a is bolstered by the fact that federal courts have,with one exception,uniformly applied it to bar state laws that would otherwise permit later actions to relate back in time,without any suggestion that it might be an impermissible construction of the statute.see haas irs in re haas,cir holding that,although alabama state law would give a mortgagee who erroneously recorded a release of a mortgage an equitable right to have the mortgage retroactively reinstated,reinstatement would have resulted in relating back the perfection of the mortgage to the original recording date,in violation of reg.h a flagstar bank,fsb eerkes,no,wl,at,granting reformation of a deed of trust describing the wrong parcel of land,but holding that the reformed deed was inferior to a federal tax lien under reg.h a prohibition against rules regions bank united states,cv,wl,at,reaching same result as haas under similar facts bank of mellon trust,ass phipps,civil no.l,wl,at,assuming that a deed of trust could be amended to include a mistakenly omitted purchaser or that an equitable lien could be imposed under state law,but holding that those remedies could only have effects pursuant to reg.h a.but see wc homes,llc united states,civil action no.dkc,wl,at,concluding that reg.h a was not entitled to deference because the statute was unambiguous.
in short,while we read h a unambiguously to preclude the application of,real prop,we also conclude that the treasury department construction of h a in explicitly precluding the application of a rule is a permissible one.thus,we find that the district court misinterpreted h a in ruling that real prop.gave susquehanna bank a prior security interest.
apart from its application of,real prop,the district court also concluded that susquehanna bank had a prior security interest under h a,based on the maryland doctrine of equitable conversion.the court explained that under maryland law,the holder of an equitable title or interest in property,by virtue of an unrecorded contract of sale,has a claim superior to that of a creditor obtaining a judgment subsequent to the execution of the contract.susquehanna bank,wl,at quoting stebbins anderson bolton,internal quotation marks omitted.and it pointed out that the doctrine applies to lenders whose interests are secured by mortgages or deeds of trust.construing h a,the court concluded that an irs tax lien is entitled only to the protection due under state law to a subsequent judgment lien arising out of an unsecured obligation id.quoting h a,and that,under maryland law,as made applicable by h a,judgment liens are subject to prior,undisclosed equities,id.quoting.mut.bank homan,internal quotation marks omitted.
we agree with the district court that h a incorporates maryland law insofar as it protects equitable security interests against subsequent liens.
the maryland doctrine of equitable conversion emanates from the maxim that equity treats that as being done which should be done.noor centreville bank,quoting himmighoefer medallion.pursuant to that doctrine,upon contracting to buy land,in equity the vendee becomes the owner of the land,the vendor of the purchase money.id.quoting himmighoefer,at.although the seller retains legal title during the executory period,he has no beneficial interest in the property apart from his right to the balance of the purchase money.watson watson.rather,he holds his legal title in trust for the purchaser.wolf,oles.by contrast,a holder of equitable title retains a significant interest in the enforcement of a land sales contract.mut.bank,at.consistent with these principles,maryland courts have repeatedly held that a land purchaser equitable title is superior to any judgment lien subsequently obtained against the seller.see,watson,at wolf,at.as maryland court of appeals explained in himmighoefer 
it is a general rule that the holder of an equitable title or interest in property,by virtue of an unrecorded contract of sale,has a claim superior to that of a creditor obtaining judgment subsequent to the execution of the contract the right of the vendee to have the title conveyed upon full compliance with the contract of purchase is not impaired by the fact that the vendor,subsequently to the execution of the contract,incurred a debt upon which judgment was recovered.a judgment creditor stands in the place of his debtor,and he can only take the property of his debtor subject to the equitable charges to which it is liable in the hands of the debtor at the time of the rendition of the judgment.
at quoting stebbins anderson,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.a judgment creditor lien can not attach to a seller bare legal title in the property after the seller has conveyed equitable title,because the seller legal title is a mere technicality.wolf,at.nor can the judgment creditor lien attach to the seller equitable interest in the property,because that interest has already become vested in another.id.
moreover,the maryland doctrine of equitable conversion protects the security interest of a purchaser regardless of the purchaser compliance with the recordation statutes.the recordation statutes protect only bona fide purchasers.see lewis rippons,holding that because a party was not a bona fide purchaser,the recording statute avail ed him not see also greenpoint mortg.funding,schlossberg,in re careful laundry.and maryland law is clear that a judgment creditor is not in the position of a bona fide purchaser.kolker gorn,see also,himmighoefer,at stebbins anderson,at chi.title,at.mut.bank,at chambers cardinal.thus,a judgment creditor claim is subject to prior,undisclosed equities and must stand or fall by the real,and not the apparent rights of the defendant in the judgment.kolker,at quoting ahern white,internal quotation marks omitted.
this traditional scheme of real property law and equity does not render,real prop.recordation requirement a nullity,as the district court recognized.bona fide purchasers remain incentivized to record their interests to achieve priority against other bona fide purchasers.see,real prop.
while susquehanna bank did not sign a contract to purchase restivo auto body real property,it did receive a conditional deed to secure repayment of its loan.and maryland principles in equity treat lenders who secure their interests with a mortgage or deed of trust as entitled to the protections available to bona fide purchasers for value,so long as those lenders act in good faith.mut.bank,at see also silver benson,it is well settled that in circumstances where a deed is set aside for fraud,a mortgagee not a party to the fraud is entitled to the protection afforded a bona fide purchaser by a court of equity,to the extent of his interest.consequently,a lender equitable interest in secured property is superior to the interest of subsequent judgment lienholders.taylor,first mariner bank,the overwhelming weight of authority is that once a bona fide purchaser or lender for value acquires title by way of execution of a contract for sale or valid mortgage,the purchaser or mortgagee takes title free and clear of any subsequent lien emphasis added and omitted.
these principles are not unique to maryland,which applies traditional equitable principles to traditional real property law.see hellmann circle c props.i,cv,wl,at,holding that a lender who held a deed of trust had priority over a debtor subsequent judgment creditor suffolk cnty.fed.sav.loan ass geiger,misc d,holding that a mortgagee had priority over a subsequent judgment lienholder.
applying these principles in this case,susquehanna bank took equitable title to lots and when restivo auto body executed a deed of trust and delivered it to the bank on january.that equitable title gave susquehanna bank priority over all of restivo auto body subsequent lienholders.and because federal tax law subordinates a federal tax lien to a deed of trust that has become protected against a subsequent judgment lien arising out of an unsecured obligation,h a,susquehanna bank equitable security interest,which had become protected on january,had priority over the irs lien under a.
the irs arguments to the contrary are unavailing.first,noting that maryland equitable conversion cases all involve belatedly recorded deeds,rather than deeds that were never recorded at all,the irs argues that those cases involved the application of the principle of,real prop.and are therefore subject to that statute recordation requirement.this argument,however,overlooks the fact that maryland courts have applied the doctrine of equitable conversion to grant priority to equitable titleholders since well before the enactment of real prop.in.see,stebbins anderson,at.and cases decided after have likewise applied equitable conversion to subordinate judgment liens to subsequently recorded deeds without invoking real prop,demonstrating that real prop.and equitable conversion are logically independent.see himmighoefer,at grant kahn.indeed,several cases applying equitable conversion make no mention of the deed recordation,indicating that recordation is irrelevant to the doctrine application.see noor,at wolf,at.in short,we must accept the maryland court of appeals at its word when it said that equitable conversion does not depend upon actual notice to the creditor.stebbins anderson,at.
second,the irs contends somewhat obliquely that the district court analysis improperly combined an equitable doctrine with the technical elements of a detailed federal statutory scheme.a straightforward consideration of the text,however,puts this argument to rest.section h a defines a security interest as an interest that is enforceable against subsequent judgment creditors under local law.maryland doctrine of equitable conversion is local law,and it makes susquehanna bank deed of trust enforceable against subsequent judgment creditors.nowhere does h a limit local law to exclude established principles of state common law.moreover,federal courts have often invoked equitable principles of state law when applying h a.see haas,at holding that state equitable principles would retroactively reinstate an erroneously released mortgage but that those principles were nonetheless barred by reg.h a prohibition against relation back regions bank,wl,at same bank of mellon trust,wl,at assuming arguendo that state equitable principles would retroactively impose an equitable mortgage where a deed of trust accidentally omitted the name of a purchaser,but holding that those principles were barred by reg.h a.
pointing to angelos maryland casualty,the irs responds that maryland own courts do not combine the doctrine of equitable conversion with the technical elements of h a when determining priority of a lien relative to a competing federal tax lien.in angelos,the irs intervened in a dispute over lien priority between a judgment creditor and angelos,the holder of a third mortgage,asserting that its tax liens deserved priority over the judgment creditor lien.at.while the factual record was insufficient to decide conclusively the irs priority,the court endeavored to guide the lower court on remand.id.at.it noted that the irs had conceded that its tax lien was subordinate to angelos lien because the tax lien came not only after angelos mortgage was executed,but after it was recorded as well.id.at.far from rejecting application of the doctrine of equitable conversion in determining tax lien priority,the court in angelos had no need to consider the doctrine in light of the irs admission that angelos lien was entitled to priority.even if the irs had not conceded its inferior lien position,real prop.would have afforded angelos priority because angelos mortgage was recorded before the irs filed notice of its tax lien,making reliance on equitable conversion unnecessary and,in the circumstances,irrelevant.
third,the irs maintains that susquehanna bank does not qualify as a statutory purchaser entitled to priority under a.section h defines purchaser as a person who,for adequate and full consideration in money or money worth,acquires an interest other than a lien or security interest in property which is valid under local law against subsequent purchasers without actual notice.under maryland law,until recordation,a purchaser property interest is subject to destruction by a conveyance of the legal title to a bona fide purchaser without notice.bourke krick,cir.since susquehanna bank had not yet recorded its property interest when the irs filed notice of its federal tax lien,the irs contends that susquehanna bank property interest was not valid under local law against subsequent purchasers without actual notice.although the irs may be correct that susquehanna bank was not a statutory purchaser,that point is wholly beside the point.maryland doctrine of equitable conversion does not transform lenders into purchasers.rather,it entitle s lenders to the protection afforded by maryland law to bona fide purchasers.silver,at.as a lender secured by a deed of trust,susquehanna bank acquired equitable title on january,when restivo auto body executed the deed of trust,giving the bank priority over any subsequent judgment liens obtained against restivo auto body.as such,on january,susquehanna bank had a security interest,as defined in h,giving it priority over the irs tax lien,pursuant to a.
fourth,the irs contends that a party can not convey an interest in property that it does not have.it notes that its tax lien attached to restivo auto body property on or before september,when the tax deficiencies were assessed.see.therefore,it maintains that restivo auto body property was already encumbered when it executed a deed of trust to susquehanna bank on january,precluding restivo auto body from conveying an unencumbered interest in lots and.this argument is a red herring.it is all too common that a property holder fraudulently conveys the same interest in his property to various parties.even though the property holder does not hold an unencumbered interest when conveying that interest to a second purchaser or mortgagee,property law often places title in fee simple in the second purchaser or mortgagee as long as it obtained its interest in good faith.for example,under maryland statute,a second bona fide purchaser who beats the first bona fide purchaser in the race to record takes good title to the property,real prop.section a is no different.where a delinquent taxpayer executes a deed of trust to a lender after a federal tax lien has attached to the same propert
