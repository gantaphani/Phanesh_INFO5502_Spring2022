we have before us appeals from two final judgments validating bonds proposed for issuance by the town of cedar grove cedar grove pursuant to part iii of chapter,florida statutes,referred to as the community redevelopment act one judgment validates bonds proposed for the core redevelopment area,while the other validates bonds proposed for the brannonville redevelopment area.we affirm both judgments.
factual and procedural background 
on february,cedar grove adopted resolution establishing the cedar grove community redevelopment agency.the resolution also identifies the brannonville redevelopment area,states that the area contains blighted conditions,and includes a finding of a need for a community redevelopment agency.
over six years later,on march,cedar grove adopted resolution,which identifies the core redevelopment area,states that the area contains blighted conditions,and includes a finding of necessity.also,on march,cedar grove adopted resolution ratifying its previous determination that the brannonville redevelopment area met the blighted criteria described in section,florida statutes.then,on may,cedar grove adopted resolutions approving redevelopment plans for the core and brannonville redevelopment areas.
thereafter,on may,cedar grove adopted ordinance,which establishes a community redevelopment trust fund for the core area and authorizes the use of tax increment financing in order to fund the trust.also,on may,cedar grove adopted ordinance establishing a community redevelopment trust fund for the brannonville area and authorizing the use of tax increment financing to fund that trust.both ordinances provide that t here shall be paid into the fund each year by each of the taxing authorities levying ad valorem taxes within the area a sum equal to percent of the incremental increase in ad valorem taxes levied each year by that taxing authority.ordinance,ordinance.
finally,that same day,cedar grove enacted two bond resolutions.resolution authorizes cedar grove to issue bonds not exceeding for the purpose of financing capital projects in the core redevelopment area,while resolution authorizes cedar grove to issue bonds not exceeding for the purpose of financing capital projects in the brannonville redevelopment area.
absent cedar grove approval of supplemental ordinances,the tax increment revenues deposited into the trust funds are the only source of revenues pledged to repay the bonds.see resolution,art.i,resolution,art.i,however,the bond resolutions emphasize that government taxing power is not pledged.specifically,section of both resolutions provides that the bonds are not general obligations or indebtedness of cedar grove as bonds within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision.rather,the bonds are special obligations payable solely from and secured by a lien upon and pledge of the pledged funds.resolution,art.iv,resolution,art.iv.the bond resolutions then explain that no bondholder shall ever have the right to compel the exercise of the ad valorem taxing power of the state,bay county,or any other governmental entity.id.
on may,cedar grove filed complaints seeking validation of the core and brannonville bond proposals.bay county intervened in the proceedings,and the state required strict proof of the matters alleged but did not otherwise object to validation.after conducting a consolidated hearing,the circuit court entered final judgments validating the bond proposals.bay county appeals those final judgments.
ii.discussion 
before this court,bay county appeals the circuit court conclusion that section,florida statutes,does not require two public readings for resolutions adopted pursuant to the community redevelopment act.in addition,bay county contests the circuit court conclusion regarding the constitutionality of the proposed bonds as explained below,we affirm the trial court conclusions.we address each issue in turn.
at the outset,we note that a trial court must make three determinations during a bond validation proceeding whether the public body has the authority to issue the subject bonds whether the purpose of the obligation is legal and whether the authorization of the obligation complies with the requirements of law.city of gainesville state,so d.on appeal,this court reviews the trial court findings of fact for substantial competent evidence and its conclusions of law de novo.id.citing city of boca raton state,so d,panama city beach cmty.redev.agency state,so d.
two readings 
bay county argues that section of the community redevelopment act requires that resolutions adopted pursuant to the act be read twice.statutory interpretation is a question of law subject to de novo review.bellsouth,meeks,so d.because section incorporates only the public notice requirements of sections a and,florida statutes,we conclude that two readings are not required for municipal resolutions adopted pursuant to the community redevelopment act.
section of the community redevelopment act reads 
before the governing body adopts any resolution or enacts any ordinance required under,or creates a community redevelopment agency approves,adopts,or amends a community redevelopment plan or issues redevelopment revenue bonds under,the governing body must provide public notice of such proposed action pursuant to or a

emphasis added.finally,section,which applies to counties,provides in relevant part 
a the board of county commissioners at any regular or special meeting may enact or amend any ordinance,except as provided in subsection,if notice of intent to consider such ordinance is given at least days prior to said meeting by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.a copy of such notice shall be kept available for public inspection during the regular business hours of the office of the clerk of the board of county commissioners.the notice of proposed enactment shall state the date,time,and place of the meeting the title or titles of proposed ordinances and the place or places within the county where such proposed ordinances may be inspected by the public.the notice shall also advise that interested parties may appear at the meeting and be heard with respect to the proposed ordinance.
read in light of the referenced statutory provisions,section is clear and unambiguous.section specifies that the governing body of a municipality or county must give public notice and mail a timely notice to each relevant taxing authority before adopting resolutions pursuant to the community redevelopment act.this public notice is subject to the standards set forth in section a or.although sections a and include additional procedures for enacting municipal and county ordinances respectively,they contain the identical public notice requirements.both require that at least ten days notice be given that notice be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the pertinent county or municipality that a copy of the published notice be available for inspection by the public that the notice state the date,time,and place of the meeting the title or titles of the proposed ordinance and the place or places where the proposed ordinance may be inspected by the public and that the notice advise that interested parties may appear and be heard at the meeting.a a.stat.
because section incorporates only the public notice requirements of sections a and,we find that section does not impose a requirement for resolutions adopted pursuant to the community redevelopment act.as a result,cedar g
