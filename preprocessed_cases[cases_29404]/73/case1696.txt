in this appeal,defendant and city of san diego the city challenges a judgment that upheld proposition e,a ballot initiative that the voters in the city approved in the march general municipal election the election by a majority vote and invalidated as unconstitutional a key provision discussed,post of a second ballot measure,proposition f,that the voters also approved by a slimmer majority vote margin in the same election.
proposition e titled the san diego taxpayer protection act of which plaintiffs and howard jarvis taxpayers association hjta and edward teyssier supported and the city opposed,amended the charter of the city of san diego the charter to require voter approval by a supermajority margin of any new general tax or any increase in an existing general tax,to be levied by the san diego city council the city council.
proposition f,which the city placed on the same ballot in response to proposition e,would amend the charter by adding section,which would have to the date of the any amendment of the charter requiring a super majority vote of the electorate such as proposition e would itself have to be adopted by the same proportionate super majority vote.
the city council declared that the voters approved proposition f.the city council also declared that proposition e failed because it did not receive a vote as required by proposition 
hjta and teyssier challenged the city certification of proposition f in consolidated declaratory relief actions seeking a determination that proposition e was duly adopted and proposition f was unconstitutional.in response,the city brought consolidated declaratory relief seeking a determination that if proposition f was invalid,proposition e was also invalid.
hjta brought a motion for summary adjudication on its complaint,and hjta and the city brought for summary judgment on the city.the court ruled in favor of hjta on both of its motions and entered judgment in favor of hjta and teyssier,upholding proposition e and invalidating key provisions of proposition 
on appeal,the city contends the judgment should be reversed because the california constitution and applicable state statutes permit the charter to be amended to require that certain charter amendments be approved by a supermajority vote of the electorate propositions e and f did not conflict proposition f may be retroactively applied to proposition e so as to invalidate proposition e on the ground it did not receive a supermajority vote in the election proposition e violates article xi,section,subdivision a hereafter article xi,section a of the california constitution because it would require a vote to impose or increase a general tax by means of an amendment to the charter and proposition e also violates article xiiic,section,subdivision b hereafter article xiiic,section b because it would require a vote to impose or increase a general tax.
we hold that the provisions of proposition f requiring a supermajority vote of the electorate for approval of certain amendments to the charter are invalid,and thus the court properly ordered them severed because those provisions conflict with article xi,section a,which provides that only a majority vote is required to amend a city charter in california and are preempted by state law.we also hold that proposition e is invalid and not reformable because its provisions requiring a supermajority vote for approval of any new general tax or any increase in an existing general tax conflict with articles xiiic,section b and xi,section a.accordingly,we affirm the portion of the judgment in favor of hjta and teyssier on their complaints challenging proposition f and reverse the portion of the judgment in their favor on the city challenging proposition 
factual and procedural background 
propositions e and f 
at the general municipal election held on march,two ballot measures proposing to amend the e and presented to the city electorate.proposition e,which had been placed on the ballot pursuant to certified petitions presented to the city council,purported to require a vote for the imposition of any new general tax or for any increase in any existing general tax,to be levied by the city council proposition f,which the city council placed on the ballot,purported to retroactively require from the date of the election that any measure requiring a supermajority vote such as proposition e must itself be adopted by an identical super majority vote to be effective 
both propositions received a majority vote of the electorate proposition e received percent of the vote and proposition f received percent.proposition e received more votes than did proposition f.the results of the election were certified to the city council by the city clerk,and the city council declared that proposition f had been adopted,but that proposition e had been rejected by the voters because it did not receive a vote as required by proposition proposition f was filed by california secretary of state and became effective as section of the charter.
in april,hjta brought an action for declaratory relief against the city,seeking a declaration that proposition f was invalid on a variety of grounds.teyssier thereafter brought a similar action the city answered hjta complaint,raising the affirmative defenses of failure to state a cause of action and lack of standing,and filed a for declaratory relief alleging that,if proposition f was invalid,proposition e was also invalid because it violated articles xi and xiiic.the city also answered teyssier complaint,raising the same affirmative defenses asserted by hjta,and filed a similar declaratory relief.the court ordered the consolidation of the city for all purposes.hjta and teyssier answered the city.
hjta motion for summary adjudication on its complaint 
hjta filed a motion for summary adjudication on its complaint,contending that proposition f was preempted by the state constitution propositions e and f were irreconcilably in conflict,and proposition e was thus effective because it received more votes and proposition f could not retroactively nullify the vote on a proposition proposition e that appeared on the same ballot.the city opposed hjta motion on the grounds that hjta had no standing to contest the validity of proposition f the state constitution did not prohibit a charter city from imposing supermajority vote requirements as set forth in proposition f,and the imposition of such a requirement is a municipal affair reserved to charter cities under the constitution and is not preempted by statutory law propositions e and f did not conflict the electorate intended that proposition f be applied retroactively to the date of the election so as to require a supermajority vote for the approval of proposition e and if the court determined that proposition f could not require a supermajority vote requirement to amend the charter,any offending clauses could be severed so as to save the balance of that proposition.teyssier did not participate in the summary adjudication proceedings.
order granting hjta motion for summary adjudication 
in august,the court issued a telephonic ruling granting hjta summary adjudication motion.following oral argument,the court issued a minute order confirming the telephonic ruling,and thereafter entered a formal order,but did not enter a judgment pending resolution of the.
in the order granting hjta motion,the court found that hjta had standing to bring the action proposition f was preempted by the state constitution and proposition f could not be applied retroactively.the court also found,however,that the offending parts of proposition f could be severed from its other provisions,which could remain in effect with respect to the preemption issue,the order stated 
a city charter may not conflict with the california constitution a rticle xi,section states that a county or city may adopt a charter by majority vote of its electors.a charter may be amended,revised or repealed in the same manner.adoption of proposition f would no longer permit the city charter to be amended by majority vote.rather,a super majority of the city voters would be required to amend the charter on certain tax matters.adoption of proposition e means that a super majority vote of is required for the imposition of new general taxes.however,it does not alter the fact that the charter may be amended by majority vote.even if proposition f were not in conflict with the california constitution,it conflicts with the state statutory scheme for charter amendments because the legislature impliedly manifested its intent to fully occupy the area furthermore,proposition f can not enter the field of charter amendments,even if it addresses a point on which the state statutes appear silent.citation.
for summary judgment on the city 
the city and hjta thereafter filed for summary judgment on the city.teyssier joined hjta motion.the city claimed that proposition e was invalid because it conflicted with both article xi,section,and article xiiic.hjta disputed this contention.
order on the for summary judgment 
the court issued a telephonic ruling denying the city motion and granting hjta motion on the ground that proposition e did not conflict with the state constitution,and thus was valid as a matter of law.following oral argument,the court took the matter under submission and thereafter requested further briefing on two issues raised by hjta during the oral argument whether reformation of proposition e was appropriate,and whether a facial challenge to proposition e was timely.in its supplemental brief,the city brought to the court attention a recent california appellate decision,howard jarvis taxpayers city of roseville th,d roseville,contending that it was relevant to the motion.hjta,teyssier and the city filed supplemental briefs.
in april,the court issued a minute order confirming its previous telephonic ruling,finding that the city was making an untimely facial challenge to proposition e thereby declining to rule on the merits of the article xi,claim proposition e could be reformed in any event and roseville,supra,th,d,was not relevant.
judgment,writ and appeal 
in july,the court filed a formal order on the for summary judgment and entered judgment against the city and in favor of hjta and teyssier,disposing of the entire matter.in the judgment,the court ordered the severance and deletion of t he retroactivity clause in proposition f and any suggestion that its super majority vote requirement applies to charter amendments or initiatives proposing charter amendments.the court also issued a writ of mandate commanding the city to take all necessary steps to cause certification of proposition e as a valid charter amendment.the city appeal from the judgment followed.
standard of review 
the court entered the judgment in favor of hjta and teyssier after granting both hjta motion for summary adjudication on hjta and teyssier complaints challenging proposition f and hjta motion for summary judgment on the city challenging proposition a party may move for summary adjudication on grounds that one or more causes of action has no merit or there is no affirmative defense thereto.travelers casualty surety superior court th,d travelers code civ,subd.f.the motion may be granted only if it disposes entirely of a cause of action.code civ,subd.f.a motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.

discussion 
proposition f 
the city first contends the judgment in favor of hjta and teyssier on their declaratory relief complaints challenging proposition f should be reversed because neither the california constitution nor any state statute regulating the charter adoption and amendment process in california prohibits the amendment of the charter to require that certain charter amendments be approved by a supermajority vote of the electorate propositions e and f did not irreconcilably conflict and proposition f may be retroactively applied to proposition e so as to invalidate proposition e on the ground it did not receive a supermajority vote in the election.
proposition f conflicts with article xi,section 
in granting hjta motion for summary adjudication,the court noted that a city charter may not conflict with the california constitution and found that the super majority vote requirement proposed by proposition f for certain charter amendments was in conflict with article xi,section discussed,post.the court did not err.
article xi,section,subdivision a confers on charter cities home rule powers and autonomy in municipal affairs.fisher county of alameda th,d.witkin explains that u nder this theory of municipal home rule,such municipalities have supreme authority in the field of municipal affairs,matters of internal or local concern,free from interference by the legislature.citations.the municipal affairs doctrine merely allows an area in which the local government may freely operate,subject to basic constitutional limitations.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.constitutional law.
it is that a charter represents the supreme law of a charter city,subject only to conflicting provisions in the federal and state constitutions and to preemptive state law.citation.domar electric,city of los angeles cal th,d,domar see also roseville,supra,th at,d.
applying the foregoing legal principles,we conclude the provisions of proposition f requiring that certain amendments to the charter be approved by a supermajority vote of the city electorate conflict with the california constitution.article xi,section a,which governs the voting margin required to amend a city charter,provides in part for its own government,a city may adopt a charter by majority vote of its electors voting on the question a charter may be amended in the same manner.italics added.
the city claims there is no conflict between article xi,section a and the supermajority voting requirement for charter amendments proposed by proposition f.in support of this claim,the city maintains that the word may in the phrases may adopt a charter by majority vote italics added and a charter may be amended in the same manner italics added set forth in article xi,section a,permits a charter city to amend its charter by majority vote of the electorate,but does not create a restraint that prohibits such a city from requiring that charter amendments be approved by a supermajority vote.we reject these assertions.
as hjta points out,the word may is also used in the state constitution to indicate the existence of a right,but not an obligation.for example,article i,section,subdivision a provides in part that e very person may freely speak,write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects.italics added.this provision plainly means that people have a right to share their thoughts,but have no obligation to do so.article ii,section,provides that a united states citizen years of age and resident in this state may vote.italics added.this provision plainly means that people who are qualified to vote in california have a right,but not an obligation,to do so.
similarly,the provisions in article xi,section a that a city may adopt a charter by majority vote italics added and a charter may be amended in the same manner italics added must be construed to mean that the electorate of a city has the right,but not the obligation,to adopt or amend a charter,but if the electorate exercises that right,only a majority vote,not a supermajority vote,is required for approval of such charter adoption or amendment.if we were to agree with the city position that article xi,section a reserves to charter cities the permissive right to amend their charters to require a supermajority vote for certain charter amendments,and thus if we were to allow proposition f to take effect,san diego voters would no longer be permitted to approve all proposed amendments of the charter by majority vote even though article xi,section a expressly provides that they may do so.the foregoing provisions of proposition f requiring a supermajority vote for approval of certain charter amendments can not be harmonized with the provisions of article xi,section a granting voters the right to amend a city charter by majority vote.because those provisions of proposition f are in conflict with those of article xi,section a,they can not be enforced.
california decisional authority supports the foregoing interpretation of article xi,section a.in roseville,a decision on which the city relies,the court of appeal held that under article xi,section a,a city charter may be amended,revised or repealed only by majority vote of the electorate.roseville,supra,th at,d,italics added.
preemption 
as a separate ground for granting hjta motion for summary adjudication,the court found that after the state constitution was amended in the legislature manifested an intent to fully occupy the field of charter amendments by enacting a comprehensive statutory scheme governing the charter amendment process,and thus state law preempted the provisions of proposition f that would require a supermajority vote for approval of certain charter amendments.the city contends the court erred by ruling that those provisions of proposition f were preempted by state law.we reject this contention.
hjta request for judicial notice 
hjta motion for judicial notice of the official ballot pamphlet for statewide proposition,which the voters approved at the june primary election,is granted.the ballot pamphlet is relevant to the revisions of the state constitution discussed,post.
although a charter represents the supreme law of a charter city,it is subject to preemptive state law.domar,supra,cal th at,d,roseville,supra,th at,d.
here,state law preempts the provisions of proposition f requiring a supermajority vote for approval of certain charter amendments.in district election.committee d,the court of appeal addressed the issue of whether the regulation of the charter amendment process was a matter of statewide concern governed exclusively by state laws that supersede conflicting provisions in a municipal charter.id.at.the court noted that prior to the revision of the state constitution in,the constitutionally prescribed procedure for amending a city charter was exclusive and controlling over any conflicting provisions in a subordinate city charter,supra,d at.the court explained that in the relevant constitutional provisions were extensively modified as part of an overall revision and streamlining effort.citation.id.at.according to the official report of the revision commission the adopted revisions art.xi,subds.a discussed,ante and b were designed to achieve,inter alia,the removal of cumbersome detailed provisions including certain arbitrary limitations in the charter enactment and revision process that could be better treated by statute,and to establish uniformity in such process between chartered cities and chartered counties citation but such revisions neither contemplated nor effected any substantive change in the balance of powers between the local and state branches of government indeed,the electorate clearly expressed its will that the relevant provisions are to be construed as restatements of such former constitutional principles without any substantive change.citation,supra,d at,italics added,fn.omitted.
on the issue of preemption,the court first noted that i n initiating the constitutional revisions with the avowed objectives of deleting extraneous detail and simultaneously authorizing statutory enactments to implement the charter amendment process authorized under revised article xi,section,subdivisions a and b citation,the legislature manifested its intent to retain exclusive regulation of the charter amendment process,theretofore constitutionally mandated as a matter of statewide concern,through the statutes enacted for that sole purpose while chartered cities with home rule provisions continue to maintain exclusive control over municipal affairs citation,as to matters which are of statewide concern,however,home rule charter cities remain subject to and controlled by applicable general state laws regardless of the provisions of their charters,if it is the intent and purpose of such general laws to occupy the field to the exclusion of municipal regulation the preemption doctrine.citation,supra,d at.
the court further noted that in enacting a comprehensive legislative scheme dealing with procedures applicable to amendments of charters adopted under article xi,section and enumerated provisions codified in the government code,the legislature unequivocally expressed its intention that the relevant government code sections were to apply uniformly to all chartered cities on a footing consistent with the authority provided under article xi,section,supra,d at,italics added.
the court held that in enacting general laws dealing with charter amendment procedures,et,the legislature was properly acting upon a matter of statewide concern with the intention of preempting that field of regulation to the exclusion of any attempted municipal regulation in the same field,supra,d at,italics added.citing with approval,the california supreme court stated in people ex rel.seal beach police officers city of seal beach cal d,that squarely held that the regulation of the charter amendment process is a matter of statewide concern governed exclusively by general laws which supersede conflicting provisions in a city and county charter.
here,citing,supra,d at page,and city and county of san francisco patterson d.patterson,the city asserts that t he courts have held that the current charter amendment process is of statewide concern regulated by state statutes not the constitution,and conflicting charter provisions must give way to procedures governed by state statute.first italics added.the city also asserts that the measure of the law is not the state constitution but rather state statutes italics added,and there is no conflict between proposition f and state statutes because none of the statutes in the government code and the election code sets forth a voting percentage requirement for charter amendments.thus,the city maintains,proposition f is not preempted by state law.
we reject these assertions.as already discussed,the body of state law that governs the charter amendment process in california includes both statutory law and constitutional law,including article xi,section discussed,ante,supra,d at.the city reliance on patterson,supra,d,is unavailing.in that case,the court of appeal stated that t he power of the electorate to amend a city charter is authorized by the california constitution art.xi,as implemented by statewide legislation exclusively regulating the processes and standards for qualifying a charter amendment for the ballot.these general laws supersede conflicting provisions in a city charter.patterson,supra,d at,fn,italics added.the patterson court reference to t hese general laws is a reference to both article xi,section,and implementing statutes.the lack of a statute setting forth a voting requirement for charter amendments is explained by the fact that the voting requirement is already set forth in article xi,section a.we thus conclude that the provisions of proposition f requiring a supermajority vote for certain charter amendments are preempted by state law.
e.other issues 
we further conclude that the issue of whether the foregoing provisions of proposition f retroactively apply to proposition e is moot.for reasons already discussed,we have concluded those provisions are unenforceable because they conflict with the provisions of article xi,section a,and they are preempted by state law.because proposition f can not be enforced to the extent it purports to require a vote for certain charter amendments,the issue of whether it can be retroactively applied to proposition e as of the date of the election is moot.because we shall conclude that proposition e is unenforceable,we need not and do not address the issue of whether propositions e and f were in conflict.
ii.proposition e 
the city also argues that the judgment in favor of hjta and teyssier on the city challenging proposition e should be reversed because proposition e violates article xiiic,section b by requiring a vote to approve a new general tax or an increase in an existing general tax and violates article xi,section a by requiring a vote to approve an amendment to the charter that would provide for the imposition of a general tax or an increase in an existing general tax.for reasons we shall explain,we conclude that proposition e conflicts with both article xiiic,section b,and article xi,section a.accordingly,we reverse the portion of the judgment entered in favor of hjta and teyssier on the city.
proposition e conflicts with article xiiic,section b 
in november,the voters approved proposition a statutory initiative that added sections through to the government code.guardino,supra,cal th at,d,roseville,supra,th at,d.the manifest purpose of proposition as a whole was to increase the control of the citizenry over local taxation by requiring voter approval of all new local taxes imposed by all local governmental entities the measure defines broadly and inclusively both the taxes,and the entities,to which it applies.guardino,supra,cal th at,d.
government code section,the provisions of which were set forth in the text of proposition see guardino,supra,cal th at,d,states that a ll taxes are either special taxes or general taxes.general taxes are taxes imposed for general governmental purposes.special taxes are taxes imposed for specific purposes.another provision of proposition,codified in government code section states in part that a local government may not impose a special tax unless and until the tax is submitted to the electorate and is approved by a vote of the voters voting on the issue.a third provision of proposition,codified in government code section provides in part that a local government may not impose a general tax unless and until the tax is submitted to the electorate and is approved by a majority vote of the voters voting on the issue.
although proposition defined the term local government to include a chartered city,doubt existed as to whether the provisions of proposition applied to charter cities.one appellate court has stated that prior to the addition of article xiiic discussed,post to the california constitution in,charter cities were not required to obtain voter approval for new general taxes.airport authority city of burbank th,d burbank.in,the california supreme court rejected various arguments that proposition was unconstitutional,but found it unnecessary to determine whether its voter approval provisions discussed,ante applied to charter cities.guardino,supra,cal th at,d,see also roseville,supra,th at,d.
in november,california voters added article xiiic to the state constitution by approving proposition,the right to vote on taxes act.burbank,supra,th at,d see historical notes,west ann.const.supp.foll.art.xiiic.as a constitutional initiative,proposition is binding upon charter cities.roseville,supra,th at,d.as already discussed,existing statutory law enacted as a result of voter approval of proposition prior to the adoption of proposition required counties and most cities to obtain a majority vote of the electorate to impose new general taxes or to increase or extend existing general taxes.in practical effect,as we shall now explain,the addition of article xiiic by voter approval of proposition constitutionally requires charter cities to obtain voter approval of general taxes.burbank,supra,th at,d.
article xiiic,section,subdivision a defines a general tax as any tax imposed for general governmental purposes.a tax is general only when its revenues are placed into the general fund and are available for expenditure for any and all governmental purposes.citation.roseville,supra,th at,d.in contrast,section,subdivision d of article xiiic defines a special tax as any tax imposed for specific purposes,including a tax imposed for specific purposes,which is placed into a general fund.
under proposition,the imposition of increase of a general tax must be submitted to the electorate and approved by a majority vote.specifically,article xiiic,section b provides in part 
no local government may impose,extend,or increase any general tax unless and until that tax is submitted to the electorate and approved by a majority vote.italics added.
in contrast,under proposition the imposition or increase of a special tax must be approved by a vote of the electorate.roseville,supra,th at,d.specifically,article xiiic,section,subdivision d hereafter article xiii,section d provides in part 
no local government may impose,extend,or increase any special tax unless and until that tax is submitted to the electorate and approved by a vote.italics added.
the issue presented here is whether proposition e,by requiring a vote of the city electorate to approve a new general tax or an increase in an existing general tax,conflicts with the provisions of article xiiic,section b requiring a majority vote for approval of the imposition or increase of such a tax.resolution of this question turns on the meaning of the term majority vote in article xiiic,section b.
we begin with the fundamental rule that our primary task is to determine the lawmakers intent.citation.in the case of a constitutional provision adopted by the voters,their intent governs.citations.to determine intent,t he court turns first to the words themselves for the answer.citation.people jones cal th,d.when statutory language is clear and unambiguous,there is no need for construction and courts should not indulge in it.citations.people benson cal th,d.if the terms of a statute provide no definitive answer,then courts may resort to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.citation.people hazelton cal th,d.
here,hjta contends that proposition e does not violate article xiiic,section b because its plain language means a general tax would be unconstitutional if imposed without receiving at least majority approval.italics added.hjta also contends that the language of article xiiic,section b can not mean that a general tax would be unconstitutional if approved by more than a majority because there is no such thing as more than a majority.hjta further contends that a majority is anything more than percent and thus a tax receiving of the vote necessarily also receives majority approval.in other words,hjta maintains that article xiiic,section b permits the electorate of a local government like the city to require a super majority vote for the imposition or increase of a general tax,notwithstanding the majority vote language set forth in article xiiic,section b,because a vote is a majority vote.
we reject these contentions.article xiiic,section b states that n o local government may impose or increase any general tax unless and until that tax is submitted to the electorate and approved by a majority vote.italics added.this constitutional language clearly and unambiguously means that approval of a local government imposition or increase of any general tax requires only a majority vote,and a vote can not be required for such approval.had the drafters of article xiiic intended the term majority vote to mean at least a majority vote or a majority vote,including a vote at the election of the electorate,they easily could have done so.that the drafters did not intend the term majority vote to expansively include a supermajority vote such as the vote required by proposition e is plainly shown by the fact that the express voting requirement they set forth in section b of article xiiic for the imposition or increase of any general tax is a majority vote and,in contrast,the express voting requirement they set forth in section d of that article for the imposition or increase of any special tax is a vote.the plain language of section b and d of article xiiic thus indica
