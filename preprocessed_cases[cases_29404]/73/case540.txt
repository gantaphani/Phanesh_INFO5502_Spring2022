on march,carl wagenknecht,wagenknecht filed a complaint alleging a wrongful determination and levy on the part of the internal revenue service irs and seeking a redetermination of the decision.on may,the district court sua sponte dismissed the portion of the complaint challenging the income tax levies for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.pursuant to d b,the dismissal included a thirty day period in which wagenknecht could refile with the tax court the dismissed portion of the complaint.in addition,the district court,reaching the merits,sua sponte dismissed the remainder of the complaint.
wagenknecht now appeals the district court order.he essentially argues that the district court lacked the authority to sua sponte dismiss his complaint.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the portion of the dismissal that found there was no subject matter jurisdiction over the income tax challenge and reverse the portion of the dismissal which decided wagenknecht claims on the merits.
background 
on march,wagenknecht received a final of intent to levy and notice of your right to a hearing,notice of levy.the notice of levy was sent to wagenknecht pursuant to,which allows the irs to levy property in satisfaction of unpaid federal tax.the notice of levy listed two categories of amounts owed.the first category included form tax liabilities from and.the second category included civil penalty tax liabilities from,and assessed pursuant to.
after receiving the notice of levy,and pursuant to,wagenknecht requested and was granted a collections due process hearing cdp hearing with an irs appeals officer.the cdp hearing was held telephonically on november.no relief was granted and the levy action was sustained.
the irs informed wagenknecht of the outcome of the hearing through two separate notices of determination.one notice addressed the tax liabilities for and tax notice,while the other notice indicated the outcome regarding the civil penalties for,and penalties notice.the penalties notice instructed that if he want ed to dispute this determination in court,he had days from the date of th e letter to file a complaint in the appropriate united states district court for a redetermination.the tax notice provided that a dispute should be made by fil ing a petition with the united states tax court for a redetermination within days of th e letter.if wagenknecht failed to seek a redetermination within the thirty day time period,the irs would continue with the levy.
despite the instructions in the two notices of determination,on march,wagenknecht filed suit in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio,challenging both the civil penalties and form liabilities the complaint named three defendants the irs the commissioner of internal revenue and lawrence phillips,the appeals team manager.it sought abatement of all tax assessments,civil penalties,interest,and other penalties for,and.on may,service was effected on all three defendants.
fifteen days later,without any answer filed in the record or notice or opportunity to respond,the district court sua sponte dismissed the action,deciding the income tax liability issue separately from the civil penalties issue.as to the former,the district court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to determine wagenknecht challenge to his and form tax claim.pursuant to,these tax liability challenges were dismissed without prejudice,and wagenknecht was given thirty days from the date of entry of the judgment to refile the form claims in the tax court 
unlike the form challenge,the district court decided the civil penalties challenges on the merits,dismissing these claims after determining that wagenknecht did not set forth a single allegation to support his claim that the irs was not justified in imposing separate penalties for tax years,and,or that it was required to give notice before doing so.under a,the district court certified that an appeal of the action would not be taken in good faith.
wagenknecht appeal raises three general categories of issues.the first is whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the form claims and the civil penalty claims.the second is whether the district court properly dismissed sua sponte the civil penalties claims.the third pertains to matters raised for the first time on appeal.
