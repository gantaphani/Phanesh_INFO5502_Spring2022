charles and elizabeth fargo taxpayers appeal the decision of the tax court holding that the commissioner of internal revenue did not abuse his discretion by rejecting their offer to pay in compromise of the approximately interest owed on their and federal income tax liabilities.we affirm.
more than twenty years ago,taxpayers bought interests in two partnerships the jackson associates partnership jackson,and the smith asher associates partnership smith asher.in,taxpayers claimed a loss of attributable to their interest in jackson in,they claimed a loss from jackson and a loss from smith asher.these partnerships were themselves partners in yet other partnerships wilshire west associates and redwood associates,respectively,which in turn were associated with a series of tax shelters called the swanton coal programs all of the partnerships were subject to the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act tefra provisions of.
the swanton coal programs were exposed as purely transactions in kelley commissioner of internal revenue,cch,with the tax court opining that the programs were nothing more than an elaborate scam to provide highly leveraged deductions for nonexistent expenses.the tax court ruling in kelley had an effect on taxpayers liabilities for and,but the final liability amount would not be determined until six years later,in.this delay stemmed from the tiered partnership system before the effect of the decision in kelley could be determined,the commissioner had to negotiate with the tax matter partners tmps for jackson and smith asher.the delay led to an accumulation of penalties and interest that increased taxpayers total liability to over.after the assessment was finalized in,taxpayers were informed of their while they quickly paid their back taxes in the amount of,they refused to pay the remaining interest.the commissioner sent notice of intent to levy,and taxpayers requested a collection due process hearing before the office of appeals.
taxpayers timely submitted to the appeals officer an for about seven percent of their outstanding liability.at the time of the offer,temporary treasury regulations issued pursuant to governed the acceptance of temporary treasury regulation b indicated that 
a compromise may be entered into to promote effective tax administration when 
i collection of the full liability will create economic hardship within the meaning of or 
ii regardless of the taxpayer financial circumstances,exceptional circumstances exist such that collection of the full liability will be detrimental to voluntary compliance by taxpayers and 
iii compromise of the liability will not undermine compliance by taxpayers with the tax laws.
taxpayers was based on sections i and ii of this regulation they claimed both economic hardship and exceptional circumstances.they argued that economic hardship would ensue because fargo medical expenses would soon balloon to per year,and the large interest payout of would both cut into their overall resources and eventually serve to bankrupt them.taxpayers additionally claimed exceptional circumstances,arguing that the irs dragged its feet in determining their liability,and thus the delay was not taxpayers fault and should not be held against them.also under the exceptional circumstances rubric,taxpayers contended that congress specifically contemplated longstanding cases such as theirs when it enacted,and all but required that such cases be compromised.
the commissioner rejected their offer.the tax court,reviewing for abuse of discretion,affirmed.fargo comm r,cch.taxpayers appeal,again arguing economic hardship and exceptional circumstances.
ii.standard of review 
we review the tax court decision under the same standard as civil bench trials in district court,see milenbach comm r,cir,and thus review de novo.boyd gaming comm r,cir.in this instance,de novo review amounts to a fresh analysis of whether the commissioner abused his discretion.abuse of discretion occurs when a decision is based on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the facts.united states morales,cir en banc citing cooter gell hartmarx,d.
iii.discussion 
economic hardship 
the tax court held that the commissioner did not abuse his discretion in determining that the taxpayers would not experience economic hardship if their was rejected.we agree.
the operative statutory and regulatory framework in this case focuses on basic expenses.the regulation in effect at the time of the,temporary treasury regulation b,provides that a compromise may be entered into to promote effective tax administration when c ollection of the full liability will create economic hardship within the meaning of.economic hardship is defined as the inability of the taxpayer to pay his or her reasonable basic living expenses.b i.the regulation goes on to specify that 
the determination of a reasonable amount for basic living expenses will be made by the director and will vary according to the unique circumstances of the individual taxpayer.unique circumstances,however,do not include the maintenance of an affluent or luxurious standard of living.
id.these regulations are consistent with provisions of their authorizing statute,which provides explicitly for a analysis designed to provide that taxpayers entering into a compromise have an adequate means to provide for basic living expenses.c.
taxpayers claim that they will suffer economic hardship if they are required to pay their full liability.they argue that fargo medical expenses,owing to his progressive dementia,will soon reach per year and bankrupt them in about a decade.the evidence to support their claim is thin.first,the only medical evidence taxpayers present is a diagnosis performed by a clinical neuropsychologist that indicates that fargo suffers from frontal lobe dementia,contributing to a number of impairments of his mental abilities.this diagnosis,however,mentions nothing of the necessity for nursing care,nor of medical expenses.
second,the taxpayers current monthly medical expenses,as reported in the monthly income and expense analysis section of their,total.their claimed future expenses of per year seem predominantly hypothesized from information that is not particularized to fargo.thus,their future medical expenses are almost wholly speculative.
third and perhaps most importantly,taxpayers have considerable assets,and it is highly unlikely that their ability to pay basic living expenses would be impaired even were fargo to require nursing care.taxpayers have an annual adjusted gross income of bank accounts and individual retirement accounts worth securities worth and equity in real property amounting to.their assets are worth more than a million dollars combined.furthermore,their current reported expenses are per month,against a monthly gross income of.in other words,taxpayers can afford significantly greater health care expenses than they currently pay,even without liquidating any assets.accordingly,their contention that their medical expenses will outrun their net worth in ten years seems to assume a number of premises unsupported by the record,and indeed feels like nothing more than multiplication.
taxpayers hardship claim is particularly weak given that the relevant inquiry is only whether the commissioner abused his discretion.although one might find some ground upon which to quibble with the commissioner decision,it is impossible to hold that the commissioner employed an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the facts.given the speculative nature of taxpayers expenses,their considerable accumulation of wealth,and the statutory focus on basic expenses,it stretches reason to contend that the commissioner abused his discretion in rejecting the taxpayers claim of hardship.
exceptional circumstances 
taxpayers claim of exceptional circumstances is also unavailing.taxpayers argue that the commissioner either waited too long after the tax court decision in kelley to contact them with the amount of their liability,or simply took too long to determine their liability in the first place.the commissioner responds that any delay is due to the length of time it t
