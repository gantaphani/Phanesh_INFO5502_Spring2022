this appeal arises out of a quiet title action by plaintiffs and respondents frank and josie mayer to restore their joint ownership of a commercial property that was sold by defendant los angeles county treasurer and tax collector tax collector to defendant and appellant l b real estate l b for unpaid property taxes.the trial court ruled that the tax collector gave constitutionally defective notice of the tax delinquency and the tax sale,and that it and l b were estopped from relying on the statute of limitations that would have otherwise barred the mayer action.accordingly,it quieted title in favor of the mayers,and enjoined and restrained l b from asserting any interest in,or collecting any rent for,the subject property.the trial court credited l b for its tax auction payment,plus its property tax payment,but offset that amount against the that l b had received in rental payments,leaving due to the mayers finally,the trial court found that the mayers made a timely claim for the in excess proceeds from the tax sale and ordered that the tax collector pay that money to the mayers 
we reverse the judgment.as the undisputed facts show,the mayers had constructive and actual notice of the tax sale,providing them with ample time to comply with the limitations period.as such,we do not reach the question of whether the tax collector satisfied its due process obligations regarding presale notice.
statement of facts 
on december,the mayers bought the subject property parcel,which was part and parcel of a larger commercial property located on south la brea avenue the la brea property,receiving title to the entire property as joint tenants.the la brea property was originally comprised of three lots.lot numbers and together comprised assessor parcel number apn parcel.parcel apn,the subject of the quiet title action,comprised the balance of the la brea property.in,parcels and were owned by henry and chong moon,who conveyed them together as a single property to bastian development.the la brea property was then conveyed to norman and armand gabay,and from the gabays to the mayers in.
at the time of the mayer acquisition,the la brea property was leased to an auto parts store that used the entire property to conduct its business.the store itself was located on parcel,with the adjacent parcel as a driveway and for signage.the auto parts store became the mayers tenant and paid them monthly rent.
the mayers received annual property tax bills,which they timely paid.however,unbeknownst to the mayers,those bills were exclusively for parcel.the los angeles county assessor had failed to recognize that the moons had consolidated parcels and,and that the la brea property had eventually been conveyed to the mayers in its entirety,even though all those transactions had been duly recorded.more specifically,as of and until october,when the error was finally corrected,the assessor records mistakenly reflected that the moons owned parcel,and that only parcel was owned by the mayers.as a result,because the tax collector used the assessor records for purposes of property tax assessment,the tax bills for parcel went to the mayers,while the bills for parcel went to the moons.
not surprisingly,the tax collector received no payment on the parcel tax bill for fiscal year,and the mayers received no notices of delinquency or default.on july,in preparation for a potential tax sale,however,a delinquency notice recorded as to that property in,in the course of preparing to send out the annual tax sale auction notices,the tax collector discovered that parcel owner of record,according to official property records,differed from that of the named assessees.that discrepancy,referred to as an assessor title difference or atd,caused the tax collector to investigate.in the course of that investigation,the tax collector discovered its error.a title report on april informed the tax collector that the moons had been erroneously designated as the assessees.
nevertheless,the tax collector made no effort to inform the mayers of the error.from the tax collector perspective,the outstanding tax delinquency for parcel warranted a tax sale,regardless of whether tax bills or delinquency notices had been received by the property owner.further,the tax sale could proceed as long as all persons having an interest in the property were given statutory notice of the sale and an opportunity to redeem.
accordingly,rather than pull parcel from the list of properties to be sold at auction,the tax collector sent the mayers an official notice of auction on approximately june,referencing the subject property as apn,with the description,por of vac st adj lot tr no on the notice informed the mayers that they may have an interest in the property,which was to be auctioned on august or of that year.the assessee was identified as henry and chong moon.the notice gave the mayers two options if they had no interest in the property,they were to write wrong party,return to sender on the envelope and send it back.if they did have an interest,they could prevent the proposed sale by redeeming the property according to the schedule on the notice.however,the right of redemption would terminate at on the last business day before the auction.
the notice reverse side contained a statement of rights of parties of interest after sale.for one year after the sale,a party could make a claim for the sale proceeds exceeding the assessment liens and costs.the reverse side also instructed that if the recipients had any questions concerning redemption,the proposed sale or the property,or your right to claim excess proceeds,they could visit or write to the secured property tax division of the county treasurer and tax collector.
the mayers compared the apn in the notice with that on their tax bills for the la brea property and found they were for the property in the notice and for the property on the tax bills.they had not heard of the identified assessees,the moons.mayer compared the notice property description with that on the deed to the la brea property and found they did not match.the deed description was more than a page long and neither referenced la brea boulevard nor included parcel apn 
seeking assistance,mayer called the assessor office to find out the address of the property referenced in the notice,but was told they did not know concluding the notice concerned a different property and had been sent to him in error,mayer followed the instructions in the notice and mailed it back.
on approximately november,the mayers received a notice of excess proceeds from the tax collector,notifying them that the property designated apn had been sold at auction on august,and that the deed to the purchaser had been recorded on october.for the first time,the mayers were designated as the assessees.they were given one year to apply for the auction excess proceeds.finally,the notice identified deputy tax collector zella scott as the person to contact with any questions.
fearing that a portion of the la brea property had been sold,mayer went to the assessor van nuys office where he was shown microfiche of the official maps,indicating that his fears their property had been sold were justified.the mayers were next referred to the assessor inglewood office,before being told to go to the tax collector office in downtown los angeles.
on january,the mayers met with scott from the tax collectors office and complained that their property had apparently been sold for delinquent taxes,although they had never received any notice or tax bills.as scott noted in writing,the mayers said they never received notice of delinquency on this parcel.this parcel is adjacent to property which they felt taxes were included.scott told them to contact martha duran,the treasurer assistant operations chief,tax defaulted land unit,to contest the sale.
they arranged to meet with duran in february of.after giving her the same explanation he had previously given to scott,mayer asked duran what he could do about it she told him to send her a letter stating his case,to which she would respond in writing.the mayers did so in a letter dated february.in her reply,dated four days later,duran informed the mayers that the tax collector would not reinstate them as owners of parcel.there was no legal basis to cancel the sale because the mayers had been given proper notice of the impending tax sale by the june,notice of auction,which mayer had signed and returned.duran closed by urging the mayers to submit a claim for the excess proceeds.
in response,the mayers met again with duran.as reflected in her letter of april,duran took the same position as before.the sale was valid and would not be cancelled because the mayers had been given adequate notice by the notice of auction and the subsequent excess proceeds notice again,duran urged the mayers to apply for the excess proceeds.she did not inform them of the option of filing a lawsuit to contest the sale,or of the limitations period for doing so.nor did she advise them to retain counsel.she would have done so if the mayers said they wanted to appeal the tax collector determination,or if the issue had come up in their conversation.
the mayers contacted their title insurer concerning the propriety of the tax sale.the insurer informed the mayers that it could not help them the property had been sold legally.
l not contact the mayers during the year following the sale.nor did any county official.the first time they realized that an adverse interest was being actively asserted against their property was when their tenant,auto zone,informed them l b claimed to be the owner of a portion of the la brea property and was therefore entitled to a portion of the rental proceeds.specifically,on september,l b had notified auto zone that it was the owner of parcel and wanted to negotiate a lease agreement.as a result,auto zone deducted from the monthly lease payment to the mayers,which it paid to l 
the mayers filed the underlying quiet title action on october.when asked why he did not take legal action after being informed that the property had been sold and the tax collector deemed the sale valid,mayer explained that he did not realize he had a remedy he trusted in the government.
discussion 
the trial court erroneous legal decision on the statute of limitations issue was obviously driven by the tax collector cavalier attitude regarding the mayers predicament.it seems probable that if the tax collector had admitted its error to the mayers,they would not have lost their property.nevertheless,l b neither colluded with the tax collector nor misled the mayers in any respect.rather,l b relied on its statutory rights under the revenue and taxation code to take the property as a bona fide purchaser,while the mayers neglected their reciprocal statutory rights.while it may be tempting to apply principles of equity to restore the mayers property,a court inherent equitable power may not be exercised in a manner inconsistent with the legislative intent underlying a statute.kraus trinity management services,cal th,fn,d.as the trial court findings of equitable tolling and estoppel contravened the clear application of the applicable limitations period and were directly contrary to the legislature unambiguous intent that a tax sale deed convey title free and clear of all encumbrances,we reverse.

section presumption of regularity is rebuttable as to the jurisdictional issue of compliance with due process.philbrick huff d.miller starr,cal.real estate ed.however,such actions are subject to a limitations period a proceeding based on alleged invalidity or irregularity of any proceedings instituted under this chapter can only be commenced within one year after the date of execution of the tax collector deed.it is undisputed that the tax deed from the tax collector to l b for parcel was executed on august,and that the mayer quiet title action was filed over a month after the limitations period expired.
the trial court initially and erroneously found that the statute did not run against the mayers because they were owners in undisturbed possession of a tax sold property.that finding was contrary to our supreme court holding and rationale in kaufman gross cal d,kaufman.in kaufman,the court acknowledged the general rule that a reasonable statutory limitations period is enforceable as to jurisdictional defects in tax sale proceedings that arise from a failure of notice even if such defect be constitutional in stature.id.at.at the same time,the kaufman court recognized a narrow exception to that general proposition where the party against whom the statute is raised is an owner in undisturbed possession at the time of such proceedings.ibid.
the kaufman court proceeded to delineate a clear,pragmatic rationale for determining whether an owner was in undisturbed possession for purposes of avoiding the statute of limitations.merely being an owner in actual possession of the subject property would not suffice.rather,the statute of limitations should be inapplicable as to owners who because of their possession could not be assumed to have actual knowledge of claims of adverse interest by persons not in possession.citation.kaufman,supra,cal d at.that is,the undisturbed possession exception applies to situations involving an owner in possession lacking any reasonable means of alerting himself to the tax proceedings affecting his property.id.at.
kaufman concerned the application of section,the analogous limitations period governing challenges to a street lighting assessment.there,at the time plaintiff kaufman obtained the subject property,he had constructive notice of the tax delinquency,which had been recorded months prior to kaufman acquisition of the property.in addition,as a purchaser of real property,he was charged with the duty of examining the public records to ascertain that no one has acquired title adverse to him.atkins kessler d,citing kaufman,supra,cal d at.
regardless of whether the mayers had constitutionally adequate presale notice or whether they should be charged with constructive notice of the recorded tax lien on october,they had actual notice of the tax sale when they received the tax collector notice of excess proceeds on approximately november,within three months of the limitation period triggering of the tax collector deed at the time of the sale to l b on august,the mayers admitted that they knew parcel had been sold when they viewed the assessor maps shortly after receiving the notice.that understanding was confirmed through their subsequent meetings with the tax collector in february and april,and by their own title insurance company shortly thereafter.in the almost six months following that,the mayers did nothing to regain title.if constructive notice of clouded title and a duty to inquire was sufficient to disqualify the petitioner in kaufman from relying on the undisturbed possession exception,then actual notice that their property had been sold to,and a tax deed recorded in favor of,a third party must have sufficed as to the mayers.
the trial court erroneously reasoned that kaufman precedential value was undercut by the fact that it was issued under the prior statutory regime,whereby property was initially sold to the state by operation of law,triggering a redemption period before the property would be deeded to the state,conveying absolute title.following the statutory revisions in,the prior procedure was replaced with the current one,permitting sales to private persons by auction.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.taxation.while the trial court correctly noted that kaufman applied to a deed to the state,not a tax deed to a
