section of the internal revenue code allows certain qualified employees to bring an action in the tax court for a declaratory judgment to challenge a determination that their employers retirement plan qualifies for favorable tax treatment.pursuant to the statute express delegation of authority,the secretary of the treasury promulgated regulations determining which employees would be permitted to utilize the declaratory judgment remedy.see reg.b as amended in.appellants sought to use to challenge the internal revenue service irs determination that the amended retirement plan of their former employer continued to qualify for favorable tax treatment.the regulations,however,grant standing to use the declaratory judgment remedy only to current employees,not former employees like appellants.see id.the united states tax court therefore dismissed appellants action for a declaratory judgment and upheld the regulations denying standing to former employees.see flynn comm r,cch,wl.
on appeal,appellants make three arguments.first,they argue that impermissibly delegates authority to the secretary to determine which employees may use the declaratory judgment remedy,without giving the secretary guidelines for making that determination,in violation of the constitutional nondelegation doctrine.because appellants did not raise this argument at the tax court,we decline to address it now.second,appellants renew their challenge to the validity of reg.b.we find that the tax court correctly upheld the regulation as a reasonable construction of the statutory language.finally,appellants argue that their employer somehow conferred standing on them by mailing them a notice to interested parties informing them that it was seeking a determination that the amended plan would continue to receive favorable tax treatment.it is clear,however,that the rules governing the content of notices to interested parties do not operate to confer standing on appellants.we accordingly affirm the judgment of the tax court.

appellants responded to the notice by submitting critical comments to the irs.they argued that while the amended plan complied with erisa backloading requirements,the old version of the plan which governed appellants benefits did not.the plan was supposed to satisfy one of the statutorily available mathematical formulae,known as the method.see b a.that method requires that the accrued benefit to which each worker is entitled on leaving the employer is not less than of the normal retirement benefit to which that worker would be entitled if he or she began participation in the plan at the earliest possible entry age and served continuously until the earlier of age or normal retirement age,multiplied by the number of years of that worker participation in the plan.id.according to appellants,the amended plan satisfied the rule,because it allowed vested employees with less than years of service to accrue benefits at the rate of of final pay for each year of service.preliminary written comments of john flynn and james thomas,reprinted in app.appellants alleged that the version governing their benefits,however,had only allowed them to accrue benefits at a rate of of final pay,in violation of t
