this case,which comes before us now for a second time,involves an assessment by the commissioner of internal revenue of an estate tax deficiency against the estate of albert strangi.initially,the tax court held for the estate.however,we remanded to the tax court,which reversed its prior holding and decided the case under a.section a provides that transferred assets of which the decedent retained de facto possession or control prior to death are included in the taxable estate.the tax court held that strangi retained enjoyment of the assets in question,and thus,that the transferred assets were properly included in the estate.the estate now appeals that decision.we find no reversible error,and accordingly affirm.
as failing health began to telegraph that the inevitable would occur,albert strangi transferred approximately ten million dollars worth of personal assets into a family limited partnership.upon his death,strangi estate filed an estate tax return based on the value of his interest in that partnership,as opposed to the actual value of the transferred assets.the internal revenue service issued a notice of a deficiency of in estate taxes.strangi estate petitioned the tax court for a redetermination of the deficiency.
after protracted litigation,the tax court found that strangi had retained an interest in the transferred assets such that they were properly included in the taxable estate under a,and entered an order sustaining the deficiency.our review of the tax court decision requires an inquiry into the structure of the limited partnership established by strangi and the extent to which he retained enjoyment of partnership assets.first,however,some account of antecedents is in order.
albert strangi died on october,in waco,texas.he was survived by four children from his first marriage jeanne,rosalie,albert,and john collectively,the strangi children.rosalie was married to michael gulig,a local attorney.
in,after divorcing his first wife,strangi married delores seymour.seymour had two daughters,angela and lynda,from a prior marriage collectively,the seymour children.in,strangi and seymour both executed wills,naming one another as primary beneficiaries and the strangi and seymour children as residual beneficiaries.that same year,seymour began to suffer from a series of medical problems.as a result,strangi and seymour decided to move their residence from florida to waco,texas.to facilitate the relocation,strangi executed a general power of attorney naming gulig as his.
in july,strangi executed a new will,naming the strangi children as sole beneficiaries if seymour predeceased,cutting out the seymour children.the new will designated strangi daughter rosalie and a bank,ameritrust,as of the estate.seymour died in december.
in,strangi began to experience health problems.he had surgery to remove a cancerous mass from his back,was diagnosed with a neurological disorder called supranuclear palsy,and had prostate surgery.at this point,gulig took over management of strangi daily affairs.
gulig testified that,on several occasions between and,he discussed his concerns regarding strangi estate with retired texas probate judge david jackson,who was a personal friend.gulig said that he felt confident that the seymour children would either sue strangi estate or contest the will.he also claimed to have been concerned about horrendous executor fees that he believed ameritrust would charge.further,gulig said he worried about the possibility of a tort claim by strangi housekeeper for injuries she sustained in an accident while caring for strangi.he testified that judge jackson advised him that his fears were very valid and that he had to do something to protect the strangi estate.
on august,gulig attended a seminar provided by fortress financial group,explaining the fortress plan.the fortress plan was billed as a means of using limited partnerships as a tool for asset preservation,estate planning,income tax planning,and charitable giving.fortress marketed the plan as a means of,among other things,lower ing the taxable value of your estate by means of well established court doctrines which recognize that the value of a limited partnership interest is worth less than the value of the assets owned by the limited partnership.in brief,the plan instructed parties to sell their assets in exchange for an interest in a limited partnership.because a partnership interest is worth less for tax purposes than a proportional share of the partnership to lack of direct control and exchange would reduce the taxable value of the estate.
the next day,gulig,acting under power of attorney on behalf of strangi prepared the agreement of limited partnership of the strangi family limited partnership sflp prepared and filed the articles of incorporation of stranco,stranco transferred of strangi valued at sflp in exchange for a limited partner interest transferred of strangi assets to stranco in exchange for of stranco common stock facilitated the purchase of the remaining of stranco common stock by the four strangi children for issued a check from stranco for a general partner interest in sflp.
the result of gulig efforts was a entity,with the roughly million in assets strangi had transferred into the top.the sflp partnership agreement provided that stranco,which owned a general partnership interest in sflp,had sole authority to conduct sflp business affairs.strangi owned a interest in sflp,but was a limited partner,and thus had no formal control.
stranco itself was a texas corporation.strangi owned of stranco common stock each of his four children owned a share.stranco articles of incorporation named strangi and the four strangi children as the initial board of directors.on august,the five met to execute the corporate bylaws,a shareholder agreement,and an authorization to employ gulig as manager of stranco.
on august,stranco made a corporate gift of of one percent the mclennan community college foundation.gulig later testified that he understood that the gift would improve the asset protection features of the structure.the implementation of the fortress plan was thus completed.
following strangi death in october,gulig asked texas commerce bank tcb,a successor in interest to ameritrust to decline to serve as executor of the estate.to that end,gulig claims to have issued a threat that no distributions would be made from sflp to pay executor fees.after receiving indemnification from the strangi children,tcb agreed.strangi will was admitted to probate in april with rosalie gulig as the sole executor.
both prior to and after strangi death,sflp made various outlays,both monetary and,to meet his needs and expenses.in september and october of,sflp distributed and,respectively,to strangi.on both occasions,sflp made proportional distributions and,to be its general partner,stranco.the commissioner suggests that these payments to strangi were necessary because,after the transfer to sflp,strangi retained possession of only minimal liquid,two bank accounts with funds totaling.the estate responds by noting that strangi received a monthly pension of and social security payments of,and that he retained over in liquefiable assets,which consisted largely of various brokerage accounts.
sflp also distributed approximately in to pay for funeral expenses,estate administration expenses,and various personal debts that strangi had incurred.in and,sflp distributed approximately to pay for estate expenses and a specific bequest made by strangi.moreover,in,sflp distributed to the estate to pay federal and state inheritance taxes.the estate notes that all of these disbursements were recorded on sflp books and accompanied by pro rata distributions to stranco.the estate further notes that it repaid sflp for the advance in january.
in addition,prior to his death,strangi continued to dwell in one of the two houses he had transferred to sflp.the estate notes that sflp charged rent for the two months that strangi remained in the house.although the accrued rent was recorded in sflp books,it was not actually paid until january,more than two years after strangi death.
in december,the internal revenue service issued a notice of deficiency to the estate,asserting that it owed in federal estate tax or,in the alternative,in federal gift tax.the deficiency was attributable to the irs determination that strangi interest in sflp was,the actual value of the assets than the that the estate reported 
the estate petitioned the tax court for a redetermination of the deficiencies.in the tax court,the commissioner of internal revenue contended,inter alia,that sflp should be disregarded because it lacked economic substance and business purpose the partnership agreement was a restriction on the sale or use of the underlying property that should be disregarded for valuation purposes the fair market value of strangi partnership interest was understated and if a discount was appropriate,strangi had made a taxable gift on formation of sflp to the extent the value of the property transferred exceeded the value of his partnership interest.
prior to trial,the commissioner filed a motion for leave to amend his answer to include the alternative theory that,under a,strangi taxable estate should include the full value of the assets he transferred to sflp and stranco.the tax court denied the motion.after a trial,the court held for the estate,rejecting all of the commissioner proffered reasons for inclusion of the assets.see estate of strangi commissioner,wl strangi i.
the commissioner appealed,inter alia,the denial of the motion to amend his answer.this court affirmed in part and reversed in part,and remanded the case to the tax court with instructions that it either set forth its reasons for denial of the commissioner motion for leave to amend or reverse its denial of the commissioner motion,permit the amendment,and consider the commissioner claim under.estate of strangi commissioner,cir.
on remand,the tax court opted to permit the amendment.the parties submitted additional briefs on the a issue and the tax court entered its opinion in may,finding in favor of the commissioner,and upholding the estate tax deficiency.see estate of strangi commissioner,wl,memo strangi ii.the estate now appeals the decision of the tax court.
the strangi estate advances two primary arguments.both hinge on the application of a to the facts at hand.section a provides 
the value of the gross estate shall include the value of all property to the extent of any interest therein which the decedent has at any time made a transfer except in the case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money worth,by trust or otherwise,under which he has retained for his life or for any period not ascertainable without reference to his death or for any period which does not in fact end before his death 
the possession or enjoyment of,or the right to the income from,the property,or 
the right,either alone or in conjunction with any person,to designate the persons who shall possess or enjoy the property or the income therefrom.
first,the estate contends that the tax court erred in holding that strangi retained possession or enjoyment of the property he transferred to sflp or the right to designate who would possess or enjoy it.if strangi did not retain such an interest,a does not apply.second,the estate contends that,even if strangi retained possession or enjoyment of the assets,the tax court erred in holding that the transfer did not fall within the bona fide sale exception to a.
the core of the estate argument on appeal is that the tax court erred in concluding that strangi retained possession or enjoyment of the assets he transferred to sflp.it follows,the estate contends,that the tax court erred in holding that the assets were includible in the taxable estate under a.
section a is one of several provisions of the internal revenue code intended to prevent parties from avoiding the estate tax by means of testamentary substitutes that permit a transferor to retain lifetime enjoyment of purportedly transferred property.see in re estate of lumpkin,cir.specifically,a provides that property transferred by a decedent will be included in the taxable estate if,after the transfer,the decedent retains either possession or enjoyment of the transferred property or the right to designate the persons who shall possess or enjoy the property or the income therefrom.
a transferor retains possession or enjoyment of property,within the meaning of a,if he retains a substantial present economic benefit from the property,as opposed to a speculative contingent benefit which may or may not be realized.united states byrum,d.irs regulations further require that there be an express or implied agreement at the time of the transfer that the transferor will retain possession or enjoyment of the property.a.
in the case at bar,the benefits retained by,for example,periodic payments made prior to strangi death,the continued use of the transferred house,and the payment of various debts and clearly substantial and present,as opposed to speculative or contingent as such,our inquiry under a turns solely on whether there was an express or implied agreement that strangi would retain de facto control enjoyment of the transferred assets.
the commissioner does not suggest that any express agreement existed.thus,the precise question before us is whether the record supports the tax court conclusion that strangi and the other shareholders of is,the strangi an implicit agreement by which strangi would retain the enjoyment of his property after the transfer to sflp 
the tax court determination that an implied agreement existed is a finding of fact and is reviewed only for clear error.see maxwell commissioner,cir.a factual finding is not clearly erroneous if it is plausible in light of the record read as a whole.see,united states villanueva,cir.as such,we will disturb the tax court findings of fact only if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.otto candies,nippon kaiji kyokai,cir quoting allison roberts in re allison,cir.
the tax court,in its memorandum opinion,presented a litany of circumstantial evidence to support its conclusion.the estate responds that each of the factors cited by the court is either factually erroneous or irrelevant.we consider each of the evidentiary factors in turn.
first,the commissioner cites sflp various disbursements of funds to strangi or his estate.the estate responds that only two of the made in september and october,totaling be considered,because the remaining payments were made after strangi death,and thus were not as a consequence of anything strangi did.
the estate response misses the point.certainly,part of the possession or enjoyment of one assets is the assurance that they will be available to pay various debts and expenses upon one death and that assurance is precisely what strangi retained in this case.sflp distributed over from to to pay for funeral expenses,estate administration expenses,specific bequests and various personal debts that strangi had incurred.these repeated distributions provide strong circumstantial evidence of an understanding between strangi and his children that partnership assets would be used to meet strangi expenses 
second,the tax court found highly probative strangi continued physical possession of his residence after its transfer to sflp.the estate responds by noting that sflp charged strangi rent on the home.as the tax court observed,although the rent charge was recorded in sflp books in,the estate made no actual payment until.even assuming that the belated rent payment was not a post hoc attempt to recast strangi use of the house,such a deferral,in itself,provides a substantial economic benefit.as such,the tax court did not err in considering strangi continued occupancy of his home as evidence of an implied agreement.
third,both the commissioner and the tax court point to strangi lack of liquid assets after the transfer to sflp as evidence that some arrangement to meet his expenses must have been made.as noted supra,strangi transferred over of his wealth to sflp and afterward retained only in truly liquid assets.the estate counters that strangi had over in liquefiable securities,which could have been sold to meet expenses for the remainder of strangi is,for the twelve to months he was expected to live after august.even this limited assertion seems dubious,however,when,as the tax court noted,strangi averaged nearly in monthly expenses over the two months between the creation of sflp and his death.see strangi ii,memo.
in sum,upon creation of sflp,strangi retained assets barely sufficient to meet his own living expenses for the low end of his life is,for about one he was never required to pay rent,estate administration costs,outstanding personal debts,funeral expenses,or taxes.at the same time,strangi began receiving substantial monthly payments out of sflp coffers.given these circumstances,we can not say that the tax court clearly erred in holding that strangi and his children had some implicit understanding by which strangi would continue to use his assets as needed,and therefore retain possession or enjoyment within the meaning of a 
the estate next contends that,even if the assets transferred to sflp do fall within the ambit of a,they should nonetheless be excluded from the taxable estate,based on the bona fide sale exception contained in a.for the reasons set forth below,we disagree.
section a provides an exception for any transfer of property that is a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money worth.the exception contains two discrete requirements a bona fide sale,and adequate and full consideration.see estate of harper commissioner,wl,memo.both must be satisfied for the exception to apply.
we turn briefly to the adequate and full consideration requirement.this requirement is met only where any reduction in the estate value is joined with a transfer that augments the estate by a commensurate amount.kimbell,at.where assets are transferred into a partnership in exchange for a proportional interest therein,the adequate and full consideration requirement will generally be satisfied,so long as the formalities of the partnership entity are respected the commissioner concedes that such has been the case here.as such,the adequate and full consideration prong of the exception is satisfied and the sole question before us is whether the transfer was a bona fide sale.
thus,we turn our attention to the bona fide sale requirement.the term bona fide,taken literally,means in good faith or without fraud or deceit.see black law dictionary,ed.as we have previously observed,use of a bona fide standard often requires the courts to assess both the subjective intent of a party and the objective results of his actions.see,united states adams,cir.
as we noted in wheeler united states,however,congress in removed a provision from the internal revenue code that included within the taxable estate transfers intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment after the decedent death,cir.we observed that congress apparent purpose was to eliminate factbound determinations hinging on subjective motive.id.quoting estate of ekins commissioner,cir.as such,since wheeler,we have held that whether a transfer of assets is a bona fide sale under a is a purely objective inquiry.see kimbell,at.
we have yet to definitively state,however,precisely what this objective inquiry entails.relying on language from wheeler,the estate contends that the objective bona fide sale inquiry requires only that the transfer be for adequate and full consideration the exception to a,however,already expressly requires that transfers be for adequate and full consideration.as such,the estate interpretation of the exception would render the term bona fide superfluous,and must therefore be rejected 
we think that the proper approach was set forth in kimbell,in which we held that a sale is bona fide if,as an objective matter,it serves a substantial business or other purpose.id.at.as noted supra,congress has foreclosed the possibility of determining the purpose of a given transaction based on findings as to the subjective motive of the transferor.instead,the proper inquiry is whether the transfer in question was objectively likely to serve a substantial purpose thus,the finder of fact is charged with making an objective determination as to what,if any,business purposes the transfer was reasonably likely to serve at its inception.we review such a determination only for clear error.see walker intern.holdings republic of congo,cir.
the estate proffered five discrete rationales for strangi transfer of assets to sflp.they are deterring potential tort litigation by strangi former housekeeper deterring a potential will contest by the seymour children persuading a corporate executor to decline to serve creating a joint investment vehicle for the partners and permitting centralized,active management of working interests owned by strangi.the tax court rejected each of the rationales as factually implausible.in reviewing for clear error,we ask only whether the tax court findings are supported by evidence in the record as a whole,not whether we would necessarily reach the same conclusions.
first,the estate contends that strangi transferred his assets to sflp partly out of concern that his former housekeeper,stone,might bring a tort claim against the estate for injuries sustained on the job.the tax court,however,heard admissions by gulig that strangi had paid all of the medical expenses stemming from stone injury and had continued to pay her salary during her absence from work.
still,the estate contends,had stone sued,she might have recovered a substantial amount for her pain and suffering.although this possibility can not be ruled out entirely,the evidence before the tax court suggests otherwise.gulig testified,for example,that stone and strangi were very close and admitted that he had never inquired as to whether there was any evidence that strangi actually caused stone injury.further,there is no evidence that stone ever threatened to take any action.as such,the tax court did not clearly err in finding that the transfer of assets into sflp did not operate to deter stone from bringing a tort claim against the estate.
second,the estate contends that sflp served to deter a will contest by the seymour children.the tax court concluded that t he seymour claims were stale when the partnership was formed,and they never materialized.strangi i,at.further,although the seymour children did retain counsel,gulig admitted that prior to the creation of sflp neither they nor their attorney ever contacted him in regard to strangi will,and that no claim was ever made against the estate.although reasonable minds might differ on this point,the tax court factual,that the seymour children either would not or could not have mounted a successful challenge to the not clearly erroneous.
third,the estate argues that sflp deterred tcb,the corporate of strangi will,from serving,thus saving the estate a substantial amount in executor fees.the estate presented gulig testimony regarding a meeting with tcb and tcb subsequent declining to serve.nonetheless,the tax court was unpersuaded,noting that it was skeptical of the estate claims of business purposes related to executor and attorney fees.see id.
the estate concedes that the reason for which the corporate declined to serve is not reflected in the record.thus,although a finder of fact might infer a causal relationship between the existence of sflp and tcb withdrawal,there is nothing clearly erroneous in the tax court refusal to do so.
fourth,the estate contends that sflp functioned as a joint investment vehicle for its partners.the tax court rejected this contention,noting that the contribution of the strangi children,which totaled,was de minimis and thus properly ignored for purposes of the bona fide sale requirement.the tax court further concluded that,even if the contributions of the children were properly considered,sflp never made any investments or conducted any active business following its formation.see strangi i,at.
the estate responds that ignoring a shareholder contribution as de minimis runs contrary to kimbell,in which we noted that there exists no principle of partnership law that would require the minority partner to own a minimum percentage interest in the partnership for transfe
