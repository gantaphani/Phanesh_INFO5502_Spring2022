plaintiff,george nichols,iii,the liquidator for kentucky central life insurance company kcl,filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of kentucky alleging that the internal revenue service irs owed kcl income tax refunds totaling plus interest for the taxable years,and.plaintiff claimed that losses incurred during the taxable years and by kcl life insurance company,losses which kcl sought to carry back to the income of its nonlife insurance company affiliate groups,reduced its taxable income on its consolidated tax returns for through.under reg.a ii the regulation,which prohibits kcl from carrying back losses from its life subgroup to its subgroup,kcl would not be entitled to an income tax refund.plaintiff argued,however,that the regulation is an invalid exercise of the secretary of the treasury power to promulgate consolidated tax return regulations and is thus void.rejecting plaintiff argument,the district court granted summary judgment to the government and denied plaintiff motion to alter or amend the grant of summary judgment.plaintiff now appeals.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court orders granting summary judgment to the government and denying plaintiff motion to alter or amend.
background 
kcl is a life insurance company organized under the laws of kentucky with its principal place of business in lexington,kentucky.kcl is the common parent of an affiliated group of corporations that includes insurance companies that are not life insurance companies nonlife companies or nonlife insurance companies.after a series of financial setbacks,on august,kcl was placed into liquidation by the franklin circuit court in frankfort,kentucky.the court appointed the kentucky commissioner of insurance as the liquidator.plaintiff is kentucky current commissioner of insurance.
kcl filed consolidated tax returns in the years preceding its liquidation.kcl,along with its affiliated group of corporations,reported its income and losses as follows on its consolidated income tax returns for the years through.
kcl filed the above income tax returns in accordance with the regulation which prohibits the carryback of losses in consolidated tax returns from one subgroup to another subgroup.the regulation adopts a subgroup method,providing one subgroup for life insurance companies and another subgroup for nonlife insurance companies.in calculating the loss of a subgroup,the regulation provides as follows 
one subgroup loss must first be carried back against income of the same subgroup before it may be used as a setoff against the second subgroup income in the taxable year the loss arose.see section c.the carryback of the losses from one subgroup may not be used to offset income of the other subgroup in the year to which the loss is to be carried.this carryback of the first subgroup loss may bump the second subgroup loss that in effect previously reduced the income of the first subgroup.the second subgroup loss that is bumped in appropriate cases may in effect reduce a succeeding year income of the second or first subgroup.this approach gives the group the tax savings of the use of losses but the bumping rules assures that insofar as possible life deductions will be matched against life income and nonlife deductions against nonlife income.
reg.a ii.in other words,under this regulation,kcl could not use the losses of its life subgroup in and to offset the income of its nonlife subgroup in,and.
however,on september,plaintiff sought to do exactly what is prohibited under the regulation.on kcl behalf,plaintiff filed timely claims with the internal revenue service irs seeking refunds for the tax years,and.while plaintiff acknowledged the ban on the carryback of losses across subgroups,plaintiff nevertheless argued that the regulation contravened the intentions of congress in enacting the tax reform act of hereinafter the act or the tax reform act and was therefore invalid.in kcl claims for refunds,plaintiff attempted to carryback life losses from and against nonlife income for,and.plaintiff claimed that kcl was due refunds for taxable years,of,and,respectively.
within six months of filing its claims for refunds and without response from the government,plaintiff filed the instant action seeking a total refund of plus interest.the parties filed joint stipulations of facts and for summary judgment.on july,the district court granted the government motion for summary judgment but denied plaintiff motion for summary judgment.
on july,plaintiff filed a motion to alter or amend the district court order and judgment granting summary judgment to the government.the district court denied plaintiff motion to alter or amend on march.
plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal on april,appealing both the march,order and the july,order of the district court.

discussion 
on appeal,plaintiff argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the government on plaintiff claim seeking income tax refunds on behalf of kcl.whether kcl is entitled to the income tax refunds claimed in the complaint turns on its ability to carryback losses from its life subgroup for the years and to the income of its nonlife subgroup for the years.the regulation,however,prohibits carrybacks between life and nonlife subgroups.pursuant to the regulation,kcl would not be entitled to the refunds plaintiff now seeks.plaintiff nevertheless argues that kcl is entitled to income tax refunds because the regulation is an invalid exercise of the secretary power to make regulations because it contravenes the tax reform act,c a.
we disagree.a review of the law,the tax reform act,the legislative history of the act,and the facts make clear that,when issuing the regulation,the secretary acted within his authority under sections and c to create consolidated tax return regulations.the district court therefore properly concluded that the regulation is not arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the tax reform act.
prior to and the tax reform act,nonlife insurance companies were prohibited from filing consolidated tax returns with affiliated life insurance companies.part i,at,reprinted in.this prohibition was aimed at ensuring that life companies were taxed on an amount approximately equal to their taxable investment income.id.congress,however,noted that a recession and inflation in prices had caused casualty insurance companies to incur large losses.id.whereas casualty insurance companies that were affiliated with nonlife insurance companies were permitted to file consolidated tax returns to offset their losses,casualty insurance companies that were affiliated with life insurance companies were not allowed to file consolidated income tax returns.id.recognizing that the ban on consolidated tax returns ha d been a hardship for casualty companies which are affiliated with life companies,congress enacted the tax reform act of.id.
the tax reform act eliminated the ban on consolidated tax returns.the act allowed life and nonlife companies that were affiliated to file consolidated tax returns in order to provide substantial relief in the future for casualty insurance companies with losses,while at the same time,preserv ing the concept sought by congress in the past to the effect that some tax will be paid with respect to the life insurance company investment income.part i,at,reprinted in at.
the act,however,placed two restrictions on the application of losses from nonlife companies to the income of life companies.first,the act prohibits the carryback of nonlife losses against life income.see c.second,the act provides that in order to take advantage of the losses of a as a carryback,carryover,or for the current taxable subgroup must be a member of the affiliated group five or more years.see c.except for these express restrictions,the details of the computation of the tax liability of an affiliated group which includes life or other mutual insurance companies is sic to be determined under regulations issued by the treasury department.part i,at,reprinted in at.
sections and of the tax code provide the secretary with the authority to establish regulations in the area of consolidated returns.section provides 
the secretary shall prescribe such regulations as he may deem necessary in order that the tax liability of any affiliated group of corporations making a consolidated return and of each corporation in the group,both during and after the period of affiliation,may be returned,determined,computed,assessed,collected,adjusted,in such manner as clearly to reflect the liability and the various factors necessary for the determination of such liability,and in order to prevent avoidance of such tax liability.
section further provides 
in any case in which a consolidated return is made or is required to be made,the tax shall be determined,computed,assessed,collected,and adjusted in accordance with the regulations under section prescribed before the last day prescribed by law for the filing of such return.
pursuant to his authority under the code,the secretary issued the regulation.the regulation provided that,inter alia,a loss whether capital or operating generated by one subgroup can never be carried back against the income of the second subgroup carryback.the rule applies to both life and nonlife losses.filing of consolidated returns.in the preamble to the regulations,the secretary explained,
t he proposed regulations prohibit the carryback of one subgroup losses,whether capital or operating,for use against the income of the other subgroup.this is referred to as a prohibition on carrybacks.
all taxpayers agree that section c prohibits the carryback of nonlife consolidated net operating losses for use against life income.however,they argue for life loss from operations and net capital loss whether life or nonlife carrybacks.the discussion is better broken into two losses from operations and net capital losses.
the tax court held that a single life company may not carry its loss from operations back for use against its own taxable income in years in which it did not qualify as a life company life ins,wl,aff,cir.the court based its conclusion on the internal revenue code.see sections and d.furthermore,section only deals with carryovers.
in view of these carryback prohibitions that to a single life company that files a separate return,the final regulations continue to prohibit the carryback of a life loss from operations for use against another company nonlife taxable income,especially since section c prohibits the carryback of a nonlife consolidated net operating loss for use against another company life taxable income.
the final regulation also prohibit the carryback of capital losses.the prohibition is consistent with the overall pattern of consolidation suggested by section c,and by other provisions internal revenue code of,such as sections b and f.
prior to the date the regulations were enacted,congress considered the regulations and spoke to them in the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of tefra.in tefra,while congress did not speak directly to the regulation at issue here,it indicated that it had reviewed the regulations as they were proposed in june of.see,at.through tefra,congress left the regulations intact save one provision for which congress thought further review was necessary tefra therefore delayed implementation of that provision,the modified method of calculation provision,and implemented a method of calculation provision for two years in order to conduct a review of the regulations proposed by the secretary.id.however,congress took no action on the other provisions of the regulations and they were subsequently implemented.
this case is governed by chevron natural resources defense council,d,and its progeny,which set forth the standard by which the courts are to examine administrative regulations.when a court reviews an agency construction of the statute it is charged with implementing,the court must first determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.if congress has not directly spoken on the precise issue,however,the court must then determine whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.where congress has left gaps in legislation to be filled by an administrative agency,the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto are accorded deference.id.at.the court need not conclude that the agency construction was the only one it permissibly could have adopted to uphold the construction,or even the reading the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding.id.at.
congress may either explicitly or implicitly delegate authority to an administrative agency.chevron,at.if congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill,there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation.id.at.such regulations are considered legislative regulations and are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.if,however,the delegation of authority is implicit,a court must uphold the administrative interpretation of a statutory provision if it is reasonable.id.
our resolution of this case is also guided by wolter construction commissioner,cir,one of the premiere cases in this circuit discussing the validity of consolidated tax return regulations.while wolter was decided prior to chevron,it is consistent with the principles announced therein and is instructive in this case.the taxpayer in wolter filed a consolidated return under sections and a as an affiliated group.the taxpayer sought to take a deduction for net operating losses reported by a member of its affiliated group.the commissioner,however,denied the carryover deductions because the net operating losses that the taxpayer desired to deduct were incurred prior to its affiliation with the member that sustained the losses.id.at.on appeal from the tax court decision affirming the commissioner ruling,the taxpayer argued that the regulation which prohibited the deduction,reg.c,was unreasonable and thwarted congress intent.id.at.
in resolving the case,the wolter court noted that 
s ection of the code expressly authorizes the issuance of regulations to deal with the complex problems created by the filing of consolidated returns.this grant of legislative authority insures that the rules will be written by masters of the subject,united states moore,who will be responsible for putting the rule into effect.national muffler dealers ass united states,d.since congress has delegated to the secretary of the treasury the responsibility for formulation of the statutory schema in the area of consolidated returns,any challenge to those regulations bears a greater burden than were the challenge directed at interpretive regulations which could be measured against specific code provisions.
id.at.after consideration of the regulations and related statutes,the court noted that c onspicuously absent in the consolidated return area is some constructive guidance from congress as to the nuts and bolts for computing income of consolidated corporations.id.at.furthermore,the taxpayer in wolter cited no tax code provision with which the regulation conflicted.id.at.instead,the taxpayer relied on a policy argument it extrapolated from the regulations.id.the court rejected the taxpayer argument and held that the regulation was valid and enforceable.to do otherwise,the court reasoned,
would require us to overrule a legislative regulation so as to permit a deduction based only upon a generalized policy distilled from regulations and symbiotic code provisions.even if we were to assume that the instant transaction was distinguishable,as a matter of economic reality,from the common parent exception,we would not be required to recognize a claimed deduction for the carryover of the member net operating losses.the propriety of a deduction does not turn upon general equitable considerations,such as a demonstration of effective economic and practical equivalence.rather,it depends upon legislative grace and only as there is clear provision therefore can any particular deduction be allowed.reg.c is a clear expression that a particular deduction is limited,conspicuously absent from the code is any clear provision which allows the deduction in full.
wolter,at.the court continued,t he consolidated return regulations,unlike ordinary treasury regulations,are legislative in character and have the force and effect of the law.absent a conflict with the code,we must sustain the validity of reg.c.id.at.
like the regulation in wolter,we conclude that the regulation is a proper exercise of the secretary power to promulgate regulations governing consolidated tax returns.the regulation does not conflict with an express provision of the code or congress intent and purpose in enacting the tax reform act.the regulation represents a reasonable interpretation and implementation of the code and is therefore neither arbitrary,capricious,nor manifestly contrary to the tax reform act.
in the first instance,we must examine whether congress has spoken directly on the precise issue at carryback of life losses to nonlife income.ohio periodical,commissioner,cir.in ohio periodical distributors,this court,in upholding reg.g as a reasonable interpretation of section of the code,concluded that congress had not spoken to the precise issue presented by reg.g whether a cost of goods adjustment should be properly made under subsection a.id.in that case,the taxpayer argued that a provision of the code other than section expressed congress intent.the taxpayer therefore claimed that congress had directly spoken on the precise issue before the court and that the secretary interpretation of section was not entitled to deference.this court rejected that argument.the court stated that while the provision noted by the taxpayer was related to the subject matter of the regulation,there is nothing in that provision that speaks to the precise question.id.the court concluded that because the taxpayer had failed to point to any language in the statute that precludes the enactment of reg.g,taxpayer has failed to demonstrate under chevron that we may not consider the reasonableness of the commissioner interpretation of the statute.id.
like the ohio periodical court,we similarly conclude that congress has not spoken to the precise issue at hand life losses may be carried back to nonlife income.a review of section and section reveal that congress has not spoken to this precise issue.in fact congress did not reference how life losses were to be treated at all.
like the taxpayer in ohio periodical,plaintiff argues that congress has directly spoken on the precise issue of whether life losses can be carried back to nonlife income by failing to expressly prohibit the carryback of life losses to nonlife income while expressly prohibiting the carryback of nonlife losses to life income.plaintiff argues that congress had the opportunity to limit the carryback of life losses but chose not to do so and thus expressed its intent to allow such losses.plaintiff further argues that congress intent to allow the carryback of life losses against nonlife income is apparent because congress placed no express limits on the filing of consolidated returns by life companies except to the extent that congress established a transitional rule.the transitional rule provided that losses from a year ending prior to january,could not be used in consolidated returns to offset income as carryovers or carrybacks.tax reform act,c.plaintiff essentially argues that congress would have no need to create a transitional rule regarding the carryback of losses if congress did not intend to allow the carryback of life losses against nonlife income because it had already banned the carryback of nonlife losses against life income.therefore,plaintiff contends,congress intent to allow the carryback of life losses to nonlife income is clear and the secretary regulations in this area are not entitled to deference.
we,however,reject plaintiff arguments.first,the contention that congress express ban on the carryback of nonlife losses against life income clearly indicates that congress intended to allow the carryback of life losses against nonlife income is flawed.it is more likely that congress failed to expressly mention the treatment of life losses because the statute was not concerned with life losses.as the legislative history demonstrates,at the time the statute was written,life insurance companies were almost always profitable congress was not concerned about life insurance companies being able to offset their losses.the act instead was concerned with the hardship that casualty insurance companies had faced because they could not offset their losses against the income of their affiliated life insurance companies.the act was not directed at or necessarily intended for the benefit of life insurance companies,but rather was intended for the benefit of casualty insurance companies.it could very well be that congress had no occasion or need to address the treatment of the losses of life insurance companies.therefore,a conclusion that congress intended to allow the carryback of life losses to nonlife income does not necessarily flow from its failure to expressly prohibit such a carryback.united state mitchell,cir health ins.ass of am.shalala.
plaintiff argument that the transitional rule necessarily implies that congress intended to allow the carryback of life losses against nonlife income is equally unavailing.much like congress failure to prohibit the carryback of life losses to nonlife income,the transitional rule does not evince any intent by congress to allow the carryback of life losses to nonlife income.as the government demonstrated before the district court,there are a number of situations at which the transitional rule could have been directed other than the carryback of life losses against nonlife income.for instance,the transitional rule could affect a chain of corporations where a life company owned a nonlife company which in turn owned another life company,or vice versa.in such a case,the transitional rule would prevent the carryback or carryforward of losses between the first and second life companies or between two nonlife companies during the transitional period if there was no chain of includible corporations prior to.consequently,the existence of the transitional rule does not demonstrate a clear intent by congress to allow the carryback of life losses to nonlife income.
there is,at best,an ambiguity as to whether congress intended to allow the carryback of life losses against nonlife income.it is clear,however,that congress has not directly spoken as to the precise issue regulated by the regulation.because plaintiff has failed to point to any language in the statute that expressly allows the carryback of life losses against nonlife income,we apply the chevron rule of deference to the instant case.see ohio periodical,at.
in the area of consolidated tax returns,congress has expressly delegated to the secretary the authority to promulgate regulations governing the assessment and computation of the tax liability of corporations filing consolidated tax returns,accord wolter,at recognizing that congress authorized issuance of regulations to deal with complex problems created by the filing of consolidated returns.accordingly,the regulations promulgated pursuant to this authority,in this case the regulation,are legislative in nature and have the force and effect of law.life ins.commissioner,cir see also chevron,at.we must therefore uphold the regulation unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the tax reform act.see chevron,at,at.
first,the regulation is not manifestly contrary to the tax reform act.the purpose of the tax reform act was to ease the hardship imposed on casualty companies by the ban on consolidated income tax returns,while at the same time ensuring that life insurance companies paid taxes approximately equal to their investment income.because casualty companies were suffering financially,the act was primarily concerned with allowing those companies the opportunity to offset their losses.the legislative history of the act indicates that congress was not at all concerned with the losses of life companies.in fact,as far as we can tell,there is no mention of life losses in the act or its legislative history.moreover,the prohibition on the carryback of life losses against nonlife income clearly does not thwart the purpose of the act inasmuch as it does not place a heavier burden on casualty companies suffering losses than the statutory ban imposed on the carryback of nonlife losses against life income.
second,the regulation is not arbitrary or capricious.in adopting the regulation,the secretary relied in part on life insurance commissioner,wl,aff,cir,where the court held that a life insurance company could not carryback losses to a year when it was not a life insurance company within the meaning of section.relying upon section d,which governed the carryback of life losses,the court reasoned that life losses could only be carried back against life insurance company taxable income id.at.since the taxpayer was not a life insurance company within the meaning of section during the relevant carryback years and therefore had no life insurance company taxable income during those years,there could be no offset of the life losses against life income.id.the court stated that if the taxpayer were entitled to apply its loss from operations to its income,the loss could,under the statute,be carried undiminished to other taxable years,a result clearly not intended by congress.id.at.
in addition,the secretary considered the enactment of section,which allows an insurance company to carry forward a loss to a year in which its status changed from a life insurance company to a nonlife insurance company or vice versa.prior to the enactment of section,an insurance company was not permitted to carry forward or carry back losses to a year in which the insurance company status changed,either from life to nonlife or vice versa.the secretary thought it significant that congress,through section,allowed the carryforward of losses but did not alter the statute to allow insurance companies to carry back losses to a year when its life status changed.filing of consolidated returns.at.see also appellee br.at.
after considering the rationale of,section and other statutes,the secretary concluded,
i n view of these carryback prohibitions that apply to a single life company that files a separate return,the final regulations continue to prohibit the carryback of a life loss from operations for use against another company nonlife taxable income,especially since section c prohibits the carryback of a nonlife consolidated net operating loss for use against another company life taxable income.
filing of consolidated returns.at.the government now argues that,
it would have been highly anomalous for congress,or the secretary in his consolidated tax returns regulations,to permit the carryback and application of life company losses against a prior year income of nonlife members because,under the law in existence at the time the act was enacted,life members themselves could not carry back and apply such losses against their own prior years income on separate returns if they had not qualified as life companies in the prior year.life see also.
appellee br.at.
our rule in cases of this sort begins and ends with assuring that the commissioner regulations fall within his authority to implement the congressional mandate in some reasonable manner.wolter,at citation omitted.here,the secretary interpretation and implementation of the tax reform act are and reasonable.contrary to what plaintiff would have this court believe,there appears to be a history of disallowing a single life insurance company to carry its life losses back to a year when the company was not a life insurance company,when it did not have taxable life income.it is therefore reasonable for the secretary to continue such prohibitions in the area of consolidated returns,especially in light of congress express prohibition against nonlife carrybacks across subgroups 
the secretary interpretation of the statute is also supported by subsequent action by congress.after reviewing the regulations in their proposed form,congress thought further research was necessary on one particular provision and therefore delayed implementation of that regulation however,congress allowed the other regulations,including the regulation,to be enacted as proposed by the secretary.see tefra,a,stat.
congress,of course,is not required to act each time a statute is interpreted erroneously and legislative silence in the face of such interpretation is not necessarily equivalent to legislative approval.however,a consistent administrative interpretation of a statute,shown clearly to have been brought to the attention of congress and not changed by it,is almost conclusive evidence that the interpretation has congressional approval.
kay fcc.here,congress implicitly approved the regulations enacted by the secretary by only acting to delay implementation of one provision while allowing the other provisions including the regulation to go forward.long united states,cir regulations of longstanding under code section which congress has thereafter frequently amended may be viewed as reflecting the approval of congress.citing lykes united states.
plaintiff makes several arguments,which he claims demonstrate that the regulation is invalid.plaintiff primary argument is that the rationales offered by the secretary in the preamble to the regulation do not support the regulation and the secretary interpretation of the tax reform act.inasmuch as we have previously concluded that the regulation is a reasonable interpretation and implementation of the tax reform act and is supported by the case law and provisions of the code cited by the government,plaintiff argument must fail.
plaintiff also argues that the regulation does not fall within the confines of section because the regulation serves no tax avoidance purpose generally and specifically in this case.in the first instance,plaintiff tax avoidance argument is meritless insofar as he contends that the regulation is invalid because there is no evidence of tax avoidance in this case.the validity of the regulation does not turn on whether it operates fairly and perfectly in every single instance.see united states brockamp,d tax law,after all,is not normally characterized by exceptions reflecting individualized equities.
secondly,the government has supported its argument that the regulation operates to prevent tax avoidance and properly reflect income.the government argues that the regulation prevents shareholders surplus accounts from being artificially high to illustrate its point,the government presented the following 
for example,assume the following income and loss figures for life and nonlife companies 
assume that,at the beginning of,the life company had a policyholder surplus account psa of and a shareholder surplus account ssa of zero.if the life company loss is carried back and allowed to offset nonlife income of in,the life company income will be,rather than zero,as it would be if the loss realized in were applied against the life company income.the life company could then make a distribution to its shareholders without being taxed because its ssa would have been increased by the of income and would not be reduced by the carry back of the loss from even though the life company had no net income over the period from to.
appellee br.at emphasis in original.the government also argues that allowing the carryback of lo
