introduction 
coso energy developers,coso finance partners,and coso power developers the coso entities appeal from a judgment denying their claims for refunds of property taxes paid to the county of inyo inyo.the coso entities contend that statutes,chapter,section,page statute precludes inyo from taxing a portion of their geothermal energy operations located on land within the china lake naval weapons center nwc.we disagree and affirm.
statement of facts and procedural history 
the essential facts were stipulated to by the parties or are undisputed.the coso entities operate geothermal energy projects located within the nwc in inyo county.the coso entities operate their projects pursuant to certain contracts and leases with the united states navy.under these agreements,the coso entities own the right to explore,develop,and take geothermal steam and related minerals from a portion of the land.they also own power plants,facilities,equipment,and personalty related to the projects.
the land on which the coso entities operate their projects was ceded to the united states by mexico pursuant to the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo in,stat.some portions of this land have been continuously owned by the united states since that time,while other portions were conveyed by the united states to private parties or to the state of california in or after.the coso entities do not dispute that inyo may tax its operations situated on land that has not been continuously owned by the united states.their claims are limited to the taxation of their operations on land that has been continuously owned by the united states since.
inyo levied taxes against the coso entities based upon the value of their possessory interests in the projects as determined by the inyo county assessor.in and,the coso entities filed refund claims with inyo for taxes paid for the years through which inyo denied.the coso entities then commenced this action to recover the disputed amounts.they asserted that the land on which their improvements are located has been continuously owned by the united states,and that,by way of the statute,california ceded exclusive jurisdiction to the united states.the coso entities argue that because exclusive jurisdiction was ceded to the federal government,inyo could not tax their possessory interests.
inyo denied the coso entities claims and argued that the statute is meant to include land which has been or may be ceded by the state of california to the united states and does not include the cession from mexico to the united states in.inyo further asserted affirmative defenses,including waiver,equitable estoppel,laches,and the failure to exhaust administrative remedies.the state of california,acting by and through the state lands commission,appeared at trial as amicus curiae in support of inyo 
the matter was tried and the court found in favor of inyo.the court explained to hold that the statute was intended to cede exclusive jurisdiction to the federal government over all public domain lands then within california because said lands had been ceded to the united states by the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo results in an absurdity of monumental magnitude.the court also concluded that the presumption of acceptance of jurisdiction by the united states has been rebutted and that jurisdiction has not been accepted.the court did not rule on the merits of inyo defenses.judgment was entered for inyo and the coso entities appealed.
the parties agree that if the state of california ceded exclusive jurisdiction over the subject land,and the united states accepted such jurisdiction,inyo can not tax the coso entities interests on such land.the primary issues before us are whether the statute was intended to constitute a cession of exclusive jurisdiction over the subject land and,if so,whether the united states accepted such jurisdiction.because the meaning and construction of a statute is a pure question of law,we review the statutory interpretation issue de novo and make our determination independently of the trial court construction.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d,ventura county of child support services brown th,d.to the extent the trial court conclusion that the united states did not accept jurisdiction was based upon factual findings,we will accept such findings if they are supported by substantial evidence.foreman clark fallon cal d.
background 
the state of california or its instrumentalities may not tax property interests held by the united states.see minnesota.west oklahoma tax commission.people shearer cal,act for admission of state of cal.into union,stat.whether the state or a county can impose a tax upon private parties based upon property interests situated on land owned by the united states depends upon the nature of the federal government jurisdiction over such property.
where the united states has exclusive jurisdiction over an area within a state,no other legislative power than that of congress can be exercised over such area.fort leavenworth lowe.fort leavenworth.the state is barred from exercising any legislative authority including its taxing and police power in relation to the property and activities of individuals and corporations within the territory.silas mason tax comm.of washington.silas mason accord,collins yosemite park.collins standard oil california.the extent of the united states jurisdiction over its property is a question of federal law.silas mason,supra,at.paul united states,d paul.
in contrast to having exclusive jurisdiction,the united states may have only a proprietary interest in land.fort leavenworth,supra,at.as the supreme court has stated it is not unusual for the united states to own within a state lands which are set apart and used for public purposes.such ownership and use without more do not withdraw the lands from the jurisdiction of the state.surplus trading cook.the property in that case,unless used as a means to carry out the purposes of the government,is subject to the legislative authority and control of the states equally with the property of private individuals.fort leavenworth,supra,at.thus,where the united states is the owner of land within a state and does not have exclusive jurisdiction over the land,the state may generally tax private possessory interests in,or private property situated on,such land.surplus trading cook,supra,at.people shearer,supra,cal.at,united states of america county of fresno d,affd,d.
exclusive jurisdiction can be acquired by the united states over land within a state in three ways by purchase or donation of property with the consent of the state as provided in the united states constitution,art.i,cl.humble pipe line waggonner,d by a reservation of jurisdiction by the united states upon the admission of the state into the union fort leavenworth,supra,at.and the state cession,together with the united states acceptance,of such jurisdiction id.at.silas mason,supra,at.it is only this third method which concerns us in this case.
the ability of a state to cede jurisdiction to the united states over land was established in fort leavenworth.in that case,the supreme court considered whether a private railroad owner,whose railroad was situated on land owned by the united states and within the state of kansas,could be taxed by the state of kansas.the subject land,fort leavenworth military reservation,was a portion of the land that france ceded to the united states in.upon the cession by france and prior to the admission of kansas into the union in,the federal government possessed the rights of a proprietor,and had political dominion and sovereignty over the land.fort leavenworth,supra,at.when the united states admitted kansas into the union,it did not reserve to itself jurisdiction over the land.as a result,although the united states continued to own the land,the possession of the united states was only that of an individual proprietor.the state of kansas could have exercised,with reference to it,the same authority and jurisdiction which she could have exercised over similar property held by private parties.id.at.
in,the kansas legislature passed an act entitled an act to cede jurisdiction to the united states over the territory of the fort leavenworth military reservation.fort leavenworth,supra,at.this act purported to cede to the united states exclusive jurisdiction over the fort leavenworth military reservation.ibid.whether the united states could constitutionally accept and exercise such jurisdiction was nevertheless unclear because the united states constitution provided for the federal government exclusive jurisdiction only over what would become the district of columbia and other land purchased by the united states with a state legislature consent,art.i,cl,italics added see warne,affd.in part,vacated on other grounds sub nom.paul,supra,d.the united states constitution did not provide a method for the federal government to obtain exclusive jurisdiction over land,such as fort leavenworth,that it already owned and therefore did not purchase.benson united states.the court concluded that even though the fort leavenworth military reservation was not purchased by the consent of the legislature as expressed in the united states constitution,kansas act to cede jurisdiction was,with the acceptance by the united states,effective to transfer jurisdiction to the federal government.fort leavenworth,supra,at.
after the decision in fort leavenworth,it was clear that a state could transfer jurisdiction over land within its borders by either consenting to the purchase by the united states of such land as provided in the united states constitution or enacting a statute ceding jurisdiction over federal land and having the united states accept such cession.fort leavenworth and subsequent cases also made clear that a state may limit or qualify its cession of jurisdiction.see fort leavenworth,supra,at.james dravo contracting.the terms of the cession,the supreme court has stated,to the extent that they may lawfully be prescribed,determine the extent of the federal jurisdiction.united states unzeuta.thus,in ceding jurisdiction to the united states,a state may reserve to itself the power to regulate or tax private interests within an area over which it otherwise cedes jurisdiction.fort leavenworth,supra,at.collins,supra,at.accord,standard oil johnson cal d,standard oil.
in,mexico and the united states entered into the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo,stat.see standard oil,supra,cal d at.pursuant to this treaty,mexico relinquished to the united states sovereignty over california.botiller dominguez.while the property rights of mexicans were to be respected under the treaty,title to land not privately held passed to the united states thompson doaksum cal,botiller dominguez,supra,at.such land is sometimes referred to as the public domain of the united states.see,people shearer,supra,cal.at.the parties agree that ownership of the land that is the subject of this action passed from mexico to the united states pursuant to this treaty and that the united states has held title to such land continuously since that time.
following the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo and prior to california admission into the union,the ownership and jurisdictional status of the subject land was analogous to the land at issue in fort leavenworth prior to the admission of kansas.see bateman.the united states was not only the proprietor of the public domain property in california,but held political dominion and sovereignty over the land.fort leavenworth,supra,at.see botiller dominguez,supra,at.
in,the united states admitted the state of california into the union.act for admission of state of cal.into union,stat.as with the admission of kansas years later,the united states did not reserve to itself exclusive jurisdiction over its lands within the new state.see bateman,supra,at.thus,as to such lands,the united states retained the rights of an ordinary proprietor except as to lands used for the execution of the powers of the general government and the state of california could generally exercise the same authority and jurisdiction it had over similar property owned by private parties.fort leavenworth,supra,at.bateman,supra,at.
in light of this background,the parties agree that from the time california was admitted to the union until the enactment of the statute,the united states had only proprietary interests not exclusive jurisdiction subject property.the fundamental question this case presents is whether the statute changed this status.
b.the statute is ambiguous 
the statute provides section.the state of california hereby cedes to the united states of america exclusive jurisdiction over such piece or parcel of land as may have been or may be hereafter ceded or conveyed to the united states,during the time the united states shall be or remain the owner thereof,for all purposes except the administration of the criminal laws of this state and the service of civil process therein.this act shall take effect immediately.stats,ch.the trial court concluded that the statute applied,as inyo contended,only to lands ceded by california.italics added.because the land which is now the nwc was ceded to the united states by mexico,and not by california,the statute did not effect a transfer of california jurisdiction over nwc,and the coso entities property was therefore subject to taxation by inyo.
the coso entities principal argument is that the trial court failed to interpret the statute according to what they believe is its plain meaning,and improperly inserted the words by california into the statute.the words of the statute,the coso entities argue,mean just what they say.what the words say,according to the coso entities,is that california cedes exclusive jurisdiction over all land ceded to the united states without limitation as to time or identity of the ceding party.italics added.the statute,of course,does not expressly state this.indeed,as we explain,it is the statute failure to specify the identity of the ceding party that renders the statute ambiguous.we resolve this ambiguity in favor of the trial court construction of the statute.
our primary task in construing a statute is to ascertain the legislature intent to effect the purpose of the statute.allen contracting cal th,d.we begin by examining the statutory language because it generally is the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citation.we give the language its usual and ordinary meaning,and i f there is no ambiguity,then we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citation.if,however,the statutory language is ambiguous,we may resort to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.citation.ultimately we choose the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the lawmakers,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute.citation.any interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences is to be avoided.id.at,d.
the statute begins plainly enough the state of california hereby cedes to the united states of america exclusive jurisdiction over such piece or parcel of land according to this clause,the state of california purports to cede exclusive jurisdiction to the united states over the land described in the statute.it is the description of the land in the next clause that concerns us in this case.the land over which exclusive jurisdiction is ceded is land as may have been or may be hereafter ceded or conveyed to the united states the land description clause.the coso entities contend that this language is plain and unambiguous and therefore requires no construction or interpretation.we disagree.
the land description clause is written in the passive voice without identifying the actor that has ceded or conveyed,or will cede or convey,land to the united states.when a legislature writes a statute in such a manner,the failure to indicate the actor can render the statute ambiguous and make its meaning somewhat difficult to ascertain.united states wilson,d see also american family mut.ins.cir.by using the passive voice and failing to disclose the ceding or conveying party in the land description clause,we are required to infer or imply the intended actor.see brumbaugh cir.had the clause been written in the active voice,the identity of the ceding or conveying party would have been necessarily disclosed.the statute could have been drafted in the active voice to read,for example,land that the state of california ceded or conveyed or hereafter cedes or conveys to the united states alternatively,if the legislature intent was as the coso entities contend,the statute could have been drafted to read,land that anyone ceded or conveyed or hereafter cedes or conveys to the united states from the plain text alone,we can not be certain whether the statute applies to land ceded or conveyed by anyone,by the state of california,or some other actor or actors.harbor bancorp subsidiaries cir.
a sentence or clause written in the passive voice is not necessarily ambiguous.the identity of the actor may be clear in light of the statutory scheme see,du pont de nemours train,d ajala parole com cir,people cook th,fn,d,when the apparent intent of the legislative body is to allow anyone to be the actor see,special devices,oea,or when the actor is indefinite or unknown see clemons cir,fn.the coso entities,while conceding that the use of the passive voice in statutes can result in uncertainty,argue that this is a case in which the actor identity is obvious from the circumstances.the obvious actors,according to the coso entities,are all who cede or convey land to the united states.we disagree.
initially,we note that the subject of the sentence and lone actor in the initial clause the state of california hereby cedes to the united states of america exclusive jurisdiction over such piece or parcel of land is the state of california.it is the next clause as may have been or may be hereafter ceded or conveyed to the united states that fails to disclose the actor ceding or conveying land.it is reasonable to infer that the undisclosed actor in the second clause is the same actor specified in the first the lack of disclosure in the second instance can be attributed to the desire to avoid redundancy.see,lehrfeld richardson.having just specified the state of california as the actor ceding jurisdiction at the beginning of the sentence,the drafters would likely have viewed restating the name of the actor as to the transfer of land in the next clause of that sentence as unnecessarily repetitive.daimlerchrysler state tax assessor me.indeed,if someone other than the only specified actor in the sentence,the state of california,was intended to be the actor as to the ceding or conveying of land,we would reasonably expect the legislature to have made that clear by identifying the different actor.the statute,however,includes no language suggesting an actor other than the state of california.in light of the entire statute,the land description clause is thus more reasonably read as referring to land ceded or conveyed by the state of california rather than by all who cede or convey land to the united states.at a minimum,we can not say that the coso entities proposed actor is so obvious or clear from the statute as to preclude judicial efforts to construe it.see torres parkhouse tire service,cal th,d.
legislative history provides no meaningful indication of the legislature intent 
when a statute is ambiguous,courts can look to legislative history in aid of ascertaining legislative intent.people robles cal th,d.however,we consider legislative history as dispositive only when that history is itself unambiguous.medical bd.of california superior court th,d.here,there is scant evidence of legislative history concerning the statute,and what there is provides little help in ascertaining the legislature intent.indeed,both parties point to the absence of meaningful legislative history to support their positions.the coso entities argue,in essence,that the lack of legislative history precludes us from looking beyond what they contend is the plain meaning of the statute.inyo,on the other hand,points out that the available legislative history does not explain why the state would have wanted to cede its jurisdiction over all of the public domain to the united states in.the problem,however,is that the legislative history,to the extent any exists,does not provide any reliable explanation for the enactment of the statute.we must therefore look to other interpretative aids to shed light on what inyo fairly describes as the rather enigmatic statute of.
d.the coso entities interpretation is unreasonable 
in response to the brief of amici curiae,the coso entities assert that the unstated actors in the statute are all who cede or convey land to the united states.this view of the statute is irrational and would produce absurd results because it would render the state legislative and taxing authority over public domain lands dependent upon the actions of others.
by the terms of the statute,california cedes jurisdiction over both land that has been previously ceded or conveyed and land that is hereafter ceded or conveyed to the united states.there is no distinction made between the actor that ceded or conveyed land prior to the enactment of the statute and the actor that cedes or conveys land after its enactment.to the extent the transfer of land occurs after the enactment of the statute,the statute appears to cause a cession of the state jurisdiction whenever the land is ceded or conveyed to the united states.stats,ch.the statute thus gives to the unnamed actor or actors the power to abrogate california jurisdiction over land by simply ceding or conveying it to the united states.this loss of authority to legislate,regulate,or levy taxes concerning such land would occur as and whenever that land is conveyed.the issue thus becomes,in enacting the statute,who did the legislature intend to have the power to cause the cession of the state jurisdiction to the united states 
if the statute is read as the coso entities urge,then the class of actors includes virtually anyone who owns or acquires california land and conveys the land to the united states.the resulting loss of jurisdiction and tax revenue would occur by the mere operation of the statute without any further action,approval,or even knowledge of the transfer,by the state of california.a business or other entity seeking to avoid compliance with california regulations or paying state or county taxes,for example,could convey its land to the united states in exchange for the right to operate on the land,and inform the state and county it is now operating within a federal enclave beyond california jurisdiction.such an extraordinary delegation of the state power to assert or transfer its jurisdiction has no reasonable or rational basis and would produce patently absurd consequences 
by contrast,if the actor associated with such subsequent ceding or conveying of land is the state of california,the cession of jurisdiction over such land is unremarkable and eminently rational.in that case,the state retains complete control over the timing and circumstances by which jurisdiction is ceded as well as the decision as to what land california jurisdiction will be relinquished.land owned by the state of california would,of course,be ceded or conveyed only by the state authority and with its knowledge.as the ceding party or conveyor of the property,it would be aware that such action would carry with it,by operation of the statute,a cession of exclusive jurisdiction over the same property.the state would at all times be in control of its power to retain,qualify,or withdraw its jurisdiction as appropriate under the circumstances.
where the language of a statute is susceptible of two constructions,one of which will be reasonable in its application and the other produce absurd consequences,we will adopt the former.harris capital growth investors xiv cal d.here,the issue is the identity of the ceding or conveying party in the land description clause.the legislature failure to expressly identify that party has resulted in two susceptible interpretations the coso entities actor anyone who cedes or conveys land to the united states and inyo actor the state of california.because application of the coso entities interpretation of the statute would be irrational and lead to absurd results,while inyo interpretation is rational and would avoid absurd results,we reject the former and adopt the latter.
the interpretation urged by inyo is also reasonable in light of the california land grants to the united states.in,the california legislature enacted a consent statute,in which the state expressed its consent to the purchase by the united states of land within california for the purpose of erecting thereon armories,arsenals,forts,fortifications,navy yards,or dock yards,magazines,custom houses,light houses,and other needful public buildings or establishments whatsoever stats,ch,codified in as pol.code,statute.such consent was expressly made to be in accordance with the united states constitution,which provides for the acquisition by the united states of exclusive jurisdiction over land purchased by the united states for purposes similar to those described in the statute thus,after,a purchase of land for one or more of the specified purposes by the united states would,by operation of the statute and the united states constitution,effect a cession of exclusive jurisdiction over such land.between and,california occasionally granted,or authorized the grant of,land to the federal government.some of these grants of land were expressly for one or more of the purposes set forth in the statute.see,stats,ch,custom house stats,ch,military purposes stats,ch,lighthouses stats,ch,military purposes stats,ch,custom house.as to such grants,exclusive jurisdiction would appear to have been transferred to the united states along with title to the property by operation of the statute and the united states constitution.other grants of land by california to the united states,however,were for either unspecified reasons or for purposes not clearly within those specified in the statute.see,stats,ch,property released to the united states for unspecified purposes stats,ch,grant authorized to change the course of river stats,ch,for a breakwater to improve entrance to humboldt bay stats,ch,same.because such lands are not clearly for any of the purposes described in the statute,their jurisdictional status was at best ambiguous prior to.in enacting the statute,the legislature did not limit the cession of jurisdiction to property used only for certain purposes and,by applying to land previously ceded or conveyed,it encompassed prior grants of california property that were not covered by the statute.the statute can thus be reasonably viewed as an attempt to clarify and remove any doubt as to the jurisdictional status of property previously granted by the state of california to the united states for purposes other than those set forth in the statute.
subsequent legislation can not be harmonized with the coso entities interpretation 
when a legislature enacts a law,it presumably has in mind prior statutes relating to the same subject matter.mccurter older d,disapproved of on another point in in re marriage of arceneaux cal d.thus,if possible,we will construe statutes on the same subject to be in harmony with each other.brusso running springs country club,d.woodard southern cal.permanente medical group d.
following the enactment of the statute,the california legislature enacted several statutes ceding jurisdiction to the united states over land that,if the coso entities view was correct,was already under exclusive federal jurisdiction by way of the statute.see,stats,ch,statute ceding jurisdiction over land held by united states for military purposes stats,ch,statute ceding jurisdiction over land for yosemite national park stats,ch,ceding jurisdiction over land for lassen volcanic national park stats,ch,ceding jurisdiction over land for kings canyon national park.if the statute is given the interpretation urged by inyo,these statutes together with the united states acceptance would effectively cede jurisdiction over the land described in the subsequent statutes.if,on the other hand,the statute effected a cession of jurisdiction over all public domain land held by the united states at that time,as well as over all land subsequently ceded or conveyed by anyone,as the coso entities contend,these later statutes would be unnecessary and superfluous.two of the statute and the been the subject of judicial decisions and bear further discussion.
the statute provides the state of california hereby cedes to the united states of america exclusive jurisdiction over all lands within this state now held,occupied,or reserved by the government of the united states for military purposes or defense,or which may hereafter be ceded or conveyed to said united states for such purposes stats,ch.if the coso entities interpretation of the statute was correct,there would have been no need for the statute because jurisdiction over the land described in the later statute land now held,occupied,or reserved by the government of the united states for military purposes or defense would have been,according to the coso entities,ceded to the united states under the statute.if,on the other hand,the statute is construed such that the cession of jurisdiction did not cover land that anyone including mexico ceded or conveyed to the united states,but covered only land that had been ceded or conveyed by the state of california,then the statute would be effective in ceding jurisdiction over public domain lands regardless of how the united states came to own it,provided it was used for military purposes or defense.this latter construction of the statute thus gives effect to the statute,whereas the coso entities construction would render it virtually meaningless.we do not presume that the legislature performs idle acts,nor do we construe statutory provisions so as to render them superfluous.shoemaker myers cal d.
this view of the relationship between the statute and the statute finds further support in a publication by the california attorney general.the statute,the attorney general stated,ceded jurisdiction over lands held by the united states for military purposes,which had been so held at the time california entered the union.such lands,prior to this statute,had been held to be within the jurisdiction of the state because they were not purchased by,conveyed,or ceded to the united states and therefore not within the terms of the cession statute of.brown et,cal.of justice,jurisdiction over federal enclaves,supra,at.the attorney general thus viewed land held by the united states at the time california entered the union,such as land ceded by mexico,as land that had not been ceded or conveyed to the united states within the meaning of the statute.jurisdiction over such land would,however,have been ceded to the united states by the statute so long as it was used for military purposes or defense 
the coso entities rely upon watkins watkins,which discussed both the statute and the statute.in watkins,the court was faced with the issue of whether the united states had jurisdiction over the presidio of san francisco.the court noted that the presidio had been ceded by mexico to the united states pursuant to the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo,and used as a military reservation since that time.id.at.upon california admission into the union,the land passed,without reservation of jurisdiction,to the state of california the proprietary ownership remaining in the united states.ibid.the court reviewed the history of california jurisdiction cession laws and stated under the authority of the leavenworth case it may well be said that the language of the statute ceded exclusive jurisdiction of the presidio reservation to the united states.ibid.nevertheless,the court continued,evidently the act of was thought insufficient to confer exclusive jurisdiction in the united states,for in we find the state legislature again passing upon the subject by enacting the statute.id.at see also standard oil california,supra,at.exclusive jurisdiction over the presidio of san francisco ceded by statute without reference to statute.
the court then applied the statute to the facts and concluded that the conditions applicable to the statute had been fulfilled and there was sufficient evidence of acceptance of the cession of jurisdiction.watkins,supra,at.the court therefore held that the united states had jurisdiction.id.at.at most,the watkins court comment as to what may well be said of the statute is dictum,as the decision in the case turned on the application of the terms of the statute.moreover,any value the comment might have had was undercut by the court statement that the statute was thought insufficient to confer exclusive jurisdiction in the united states.for our purposes,watkins provides no guidance or persuasive weight.
in the statute,the california legislature ceded exclusive jurisdiction over yosemite national park and certain other lands the united states congress expressly accepted the cession of jurisdiction in.collins,supra,at.some of the land that is the subject of this statute had been owned by the united states continuously since it was acquired under the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo.ibid.other portions of the land were ceded by california to the united states in.stats,ch,collins,supra,at.if the coso entities construction of the statute is correct,california ceded to the united states in california jurisdiction over land that had been continuously held by the united states.under either the coso entities construction or inyo construction of the statute,the statute operated to effect a cession of jurisdiction over the portion of the land that california ceded to the united states in.as with the statute,if the coso entities view was adopted,the statute would have accomplished nothing.according to both the united states supreme court and our state supreme court,however,this statute,along with the express acceptance by the united states,was effective to transfer jurisdiction to the united states.see collins,supra,at.standard oil,supra,cal d at.
in addition to the inconsistencies between the coso entities interpretation of the statute and the cession statutes,the coso entities interpretation is also inconsistent with statutes enacted after which assume california continuing jurisdiction over federal lands.see,stats,ch,law for the making and perfection of mining claims upon the public domain of the united states stats,ch,protection of wildflower reserves on federal land fish,regulating fishing and hunting on federal land.the enactment of the political code in stats,ch,for example,provided for the collection of taxes on certain interests in property growing or being on the lands of the united states,and all rights and privileges appertaining thereto.id.at.by the time this code was enacted,california jurisdiction over the lands of the united states had,according to the coso entities view,been ceded to the united states four years earlier.if true,this aspect of the political code would therefore have been ineffective.see paul,supra,at.a state may not legislate with respect to federal enclaves unless it reserved the right to do so.
while acknowledging the practice of taxing possessory interests on federal land,the coso entities contend that such taxes were unlawful by virtue of the statute.courts have,however,repeatedly upheld california practice of taxing possessory interests on united states land.see,atlantic oil county of los angeles cal d,bakersfield kern county cal,united states of america county of fresno,supra,d at.international paper siskiyou county cir.in any event,our task is to harmonize,if possible,the statute and the statute enacted a few years later permitting taxation of possessory interests on federal land.we can not do that if we adopt the coso entities interpretation the laws permitting such taxation would have to be declared unlawful.the two laws can,however,be harmonized to avoid harm to either,by interpreting the statute as the trial court did.
statutes derogating state sovereignty must be construed narrowly 
our construction of the statute is further supported by the rule that statutes restricting or derogating the state sovereignty should be strictly construed in favor of the state.see people cal d.in standard oil,our state supreme court considered the scope of a reservation of the taxing power in the statute ceding jurisdiction to the united states over land for yosemite national park the court there stated the following pertinent considerations i t will not be presumed,in the absence of clearly expressed intent,that the state has relinquished its sovereignty the taxing power of the state is never presumed to have been relinquished unless the language in which the surrender is made is clear and unmistakable.standard oil,supra,cal d at,quoting ryan state.
there is no question that the statute,expressly ceding jurisdiction to the united states,is a law relinquishing the state sovereignty.it is the extent of the relinquishment of its sovereignty that is at issue in this case.far from establishing a clear and unmistakable intent to cede jurisdiction over california land previously,or ever,ceded or conveyed by anyone to the united states,the language of the statute is,as we explained above,ambiguous at best.in light of the rule strictly construing statutes such as this in favor of state sovereignty,such ambiguity weighs heavily against the coso entities interpretation.
g.the coso entities further arguments are unpersuasive 
the coso entities contend that the legislature use of the word cede in the land description clause,refers to the transfer of land effected by the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo because none of the statutes by which california transferred land to the united states up to that time used that term.see,stats,ch,stats,ch,stats,ch,stats,ch,stats,ch,stats,ch.land that may have been ceded to the united states,the coso entities therefore argue,must refer to the cession of land by mexico.the argument is unpersuasive for two reasons.first,while california apparently did not use the term cede in statutes transferring title to land to the united states prior to,neither did the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo.rather,the transfer of land from mexico to the united states occurred by operation of the setting of a new boundary line following a war between the two nations,stat,art.v.both parties agree that the words cede and cession generally refer to transfers of land or jurisdiction between two sovereigns or governments.the parties further agree that the words cede and cessions do not refer solely to transfers of territory by sovereign nations,such as mexico and the united states,to the exclusion of transfers by states,such as the state of california.thus,just as the transfer of land accomplished by the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo could be,and has been,described as a cession of land see,botiller dominguez,supra,at.standard oil,supra,cal d at,the transfers of land by the state of california to the united states can just as easily be described as cessions of land.
second,the word ceded in the land description clause applies not only to land previously ceded to the united states,but to land that is ceded to the united states after.there is no basis in the text or otherwise to conclude that the legislature intended the party ceding land before to be different from the party ceding land thereafter.yet,mexico certainly would not be ceding land within california to the united states after.thus,if ceding refers to transfers by a sovereign,the only actor that reasonably could have ceded land to the united states before as well as thereafter ceded land to the united states was the state of california.
the coso entities argue that the reference to a party after could refer to other states in the united states.other states,they contend,may occasionally own land within california borders.the statute could then apply to a cession by such other state to the united states.the coso entities do not explain why another state would acquire land within california.in any event,an interpretation of the statute that would permit other states to unilaterally trigger the abrogation of california jurisdiction is neither plausible nor reasonable.
the coso entities,relying upon civil code sections,and,next contend that its interpretation of the statute is consistent with the rule that grants of real property shall be interpreted in favor of the grantee,here the united state
