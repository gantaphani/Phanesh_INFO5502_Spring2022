memorandum and opinion 
in this tax refund suit,the plaintiffs,john duffie and melissa duffie,allege that the internal revenue service improperly assessed enhanced or penalty interest against them under c.that statute,which was effective for only a few years,provides for interest at of the statutory interest rate when there is a substantial underpayment of taxes attributable to a transaction.
john duffie became a limited partner in american,amcor in.his proportionate share of the partnership income loss was reported on the duffies joint income tax return.the irs subsequently disallowed amcor expense deductions for tax year,reducing the partnership loss.as a result,partners,including the duffies,had underpaid their income tax liability for.the irs assessed enhanced interest against the duffies under section c for the underpayment.the duffies seek a refund.
the parties have filed for summary judgment.the duffies seek summary judgment that as a matter of law,imposing the section c enhanced or penalty rate of interest was erroneous because it is based on a tax court judgment entered after a settlement of items that did not decide issues critical to assessing the interest.the government asserts that the duffies claims are barred by res judicata and that this court lacks jurisdiction over the refund claim because it would require the court to reexamine the partnership items resolved in the tax court.
based on a careful review of the motions,the pleadings,the record,and the applicable law,this court denies the duffies motion for summary judgment and grants the government.final judgment dismissing this case is entered by separate order.the reasons for this ruling are set forth in detail below.
background 
a.the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 
partnerships file informational tax returns,but partnerships are not subject to federal income taxes.instead,a partnership is treated as a conduit through which income passes to its partners,who are responsible for reporting their pro rata share of tax on their individual income tax returns.id.
before,examining a partnership for federal tax purposes was a tedious process.a partnership filed an informational tax return on a form,which reflected the distributive shares of partnership income,gains,deductions,and credits attributable to the partners.if the irs sought to adjust an item on a partnership return,the irs had to examine each partner individual return.as a result,the irs could not ensure consistent adjustments of partnership items among partners.in response,congress enacted the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of,stat,tefra.
tefra consolidated the audit and adjustment procedures by requiring that the tax treatment of any partnership item shall be determined at the partnership level.tefra created a single unified procedure for determining the tax treatment of all partnership items at the partnership level,rather than separately at the partner level.in re crowell,cir.after tefra,the irs could adjust partnership items at a singular proceeding,and then subsequently assess all of the partners based upon the adjustment to that particular item.the irs would not have to conduct individual partner level proceedings for each member of a partnership.prati united states.
tefra defines a partnership item as any item required to be taken into account for the partnership taxable year under any provision of subtitle a to the extent regulations prescribed by the secretary provide that,for purposes of subtitle f,such item is more appropriately determined at the partnership level than at the partner level.a.the regulations provide that items more appropriately determined at the partnership level include the gains,losses,deductions,and credits of a partnership.a.the term partnership item also includes the accounting practices and the legal and factual determinations that underlie the determination of the amount,timing,and characterization of items of income,credit,gain,loss,deduction,a b.
a nonpartnership item is an item which is or is treated as not a partnership item.a.the tax treatment of nonpartnership items requires determinations that must be made at the individual partner level.see crnkovich united states.
tefra also includes a hybrid category of affected items.an affected item is any item to the extent such item is affected by a partnership item.a.for example,a medical expense deduction under a is an affected item.because a taxpayer can only deduct medical expenses to the extent those expenses exceed of adjusted gross income,a change in the partnership income affects the amount of the partner deduction.affected items can have both and components.for example,determining a limited partner amount at risk for purposes of may require a determination of the amount of partnership debt and a determination of the amount of that debt assumed by the limited partner.
there are two different types of affected items.the first type of affected items requires only a computational adjustment at the partner level,which can only be made at the conclusion of the partnership level proceeding.woody comm r of internal revenue,wl citing energy partners comm r of internal revenue,wl.the term computational adjustment means the change in the tax liability of a partner which properly reflects the treatment under this subchapter of a partnership item.a.a computational adjustment may include a change in tax liability that reflects a change in an affected item where that change is necessary to properly reflect the treatment of a partnership item.a t a.such a computational affected item may be applied to the individual partner without any factual determination at the partner level.the other type of affected item is one that is dependent upon factual determinations other than a computation relating to an adjustment made at the partner level.woody,at energy partners,at.these affected items require particular to the individual partner.
if the irs decides to adjust any partnership items on a partnership informational income tax return,it must notify the individual partners of the adjustment by issuing a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment fpaa.see also kaplan united states,cir.a notice of fpaa sets out the proposed adjustments,disallowing all or part of partnership deductions,and lists the grounds for the adjustments.id.for ninety days after a notice of fpaa issues,the tax matters has the exclusive right to challenge the proposed adjustments in tax court,the court of federal claims,or a united states district court.a.if the tmp does not file suit challenging the proposed adjustments within this period,other partners have sixty days to file a petition for readjustment.id.b.if a partnership level challenge is filed,each partner in the partnership is deemed a party to the case.c.
if a partner settles his tax liability with the irs,the partner will not be able to participate in the suit and will be bound by the settlement agreement terms.id.a,c.if the irs enters into a settlement agreement with any partner with respect to partnership items,other partners are entitled to a consistent settlement as to those partnership items.c.the tmp may bind partners to a settlement agreement resolving partnership items if the tmp expressly states in the agreement that it shall bind the other partners.c a.a partner is a partner with less than a interest in a partnership that has more than partners.see a,b.
in a proceeding,the tax court has jurisdiction to determine all partnership items for the tax year to which the fpaa relates.the tax court also has jurisdiction to determinate the proper allocation of the partnership items among the partners.f.for tax years,the tax court does not have jurisdiction over nonpartnership items or over affected items id.the tmp and the irs may reach an agreed decision in the tax court as to partnership items.tax court b.in a refund action,courts do not have jurisdiction over partnership items.h.but a court does have jurisdiction in a refund action over partnership items that were converted to nonpartnership items through a settlement with the irs.id.b c.
factual background 
in the early,amcor organized a number of limited partnerships for which it acted as general partner.these partnerships had as stated goals acquiring agricultural land,investing in agricultural ventures,and growing crops amcor solicited investments from professionals across the country.each partner in an amcor partnership would receive a projected tax loss from crops planted in the first year of roughly twice that partner investment.investors paid the farming expenses up front and deducted the amount invested on their tax returns.the next year,when the crops were harvested,the amount of loss in excess of the amount invested would be subject to taxes.however,the farming expenses typically exceeded any income realized from the farming activities.in,the irs began an investigation and audit into the amcor partnerships to determine whether they were impermissible tax shelters.
in,john duffie invested as a limited partner in one of the amcor partnerships,texas farm venturers,a texas limited partnership the general partners in texas farm venturers in included amcor and robert wright.john duffie held a interest in texas farm venturers.on march,texas farm venturers timely filed its partnership return for tax year.docket entry,appendix at.the return states that texas farm venturers had one hundred partners the partnership reported an ordinary income loss of for.id.the duffies timely filed their income tax return on june.docket entry,ex.the duffies joint return reported john duffie share of the texas farm venturers loss as.docket entry,ex.
after investigating the amcor partnerships,the irs issued a notice of fpaa to the tmps of a number of the amcor partnerships in and.the notices proposed to adjust the partnership items of these amcor partnerships for tax years,and,as applicable.wright,the tmp of texas farm venturers,received a notice of fpaa on april.docket entry,ex.the fpaa listed several reasons for disallowing part of the texas farm venturer farming expenses.the reasons included that the irs had determined that the partnership activities were a series of sham transactions and that the activities lacked economic substance.id.
on july,limited partners in texas farm venturers other than the tmp filed a petition in united states tax court contesting the fpaa for the partnership.docket entry,appendix at.the case was assigned case number.id.at.the duffies became parties to the tax court case under c,which treats nonparticipating partners as parties to a case in which a partner challenges the fpaa.the tax court consolidated case number with six other cases involving amcor partnerships.wright subsequently intervened as the texas farm venturers tmp.
in,while the tax court cases were pending,several limited partners in amcor partnerships settled their income tax liability with the irs by executing forms ad.the irs imposed enhanced interest under c against these partners for underpayment of taxes.morris weiner,a limited partner in several amcor partnerships,challenged the imposition of enhanced interest.in weiner united states,cir,cert.denied,d,the appellate court concluded that the irs improperly assessed enhanced interest against weiner under section c.because the fpaa listed multiple independent reasons for disallowing the partnership deductions,there was no way to determine,without additional superfluous litigation,whether the taxpayer underpayment is attributable to a reason that also qualifies as a transaction such as a sham.id.at.
the duffies did not settle with the irs.the duffies remained parties to the texas farm venturers tax court case.on april,the irs moved under tax court rule b for entry of decisions in the amcor cases.docket entry,appendix at.the motion for entry of decisions stated that the irs and the tmps for the amcor partnerships had reached contingent agreements with respect to all of the disputed partnership items at issue in the fpaa cases.id.at.the agreements were contingent on the tax court entry of the decision submitted with the irs motion.the irs motion for entry of decisions stated that all partners in each partnership whose partnership items are to be determined in the fpaa cases and who meet the interest requirements of d are deemed parties to the partnership proceedings,would be bound by the determination of the partnership items in the applicable decision,and would be assessed any additional tax resulting from the adjustments contained in the decision documents pursuant to,a and a.the motion also stated that the irs had made preliminary determinations as to certain affected items,including the liability of the liability of the limited partners for additions to tax pursuant to and,and for the assessment of interest on the deficiencies in the partners income tax at the increased rate prescribed by former c which determinations the tax matters partner and other partners are expected to dispute.the motion stated that o nce the decisions are entered by the court and become final,respondent will assess any deficiency in income tax due from each partner by way of computational adjustment,under a based upon the adjustment contained in the decisions,and based upon the determination made in the decisions,respondent will assess interest which has accrued thereon under former c.
on june,the duffies moved in the tax court for leave to file a notice of election to participate out of time.docket entry,appendix at.the motion for leave stated that the duffies did not object to entry of the proposed decision.because entry of the agreed decisions in the tax court could be halted by one objecting partner from any of the partnerships,the duffies sought to preserve their right to a consistent settlement with the irs under section c.the right to a consistent settlement was only preserved for sixty days after issuance of the notice of fpaa.the tax court denied the duffies motion on july.
the tax court entered its decision in the texas farm venturers case on july.docket entry,ex.the decision stated that the partnerships claimed farming expenses would be reduced by.id.the tax court decision also stated 
t hat the adjustments to partnership income and expense for the taxable year are attributable to transactions which lacked economic substance,as described in former c a v,so as to result in a substantial distortion of income and expense,as described in c a iv,when computed under the partnership cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting.

if the burden of proof at trial lies with the nonmoving party,the movant may satisfy its initial burden by showing that is,pointing out to the district there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party case.see celotex,at.while the party moving for summary judgment must demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact,it does not need to negate the elements of the nonmovant case.boudreaux swift transp,cir citation omitted.an issue is material if its resolution could affect the outcome of the action.directv,robson,cir quoting weeks marine,fireman fund ins,cir.if the moving party fails to meet its initial burden,the motion for summary judgment must be denied,regardless of the nonmovant response.quorum health,maverick county hosp,cir citing little liquid air,cir en banc.

iii.analysis 
voluntary dismissal of the duffies claims based on the statute of limitations and interest abatement 
the duffies complaint alleged that the irs assessed tax and interest after the statute of limitations expired,entitling them to a refund of amounts paid under.docket entry.the complaint also alleged that the irs erroneously failed to abate interest under e.id.in its for summary judgment,the government correctly noted that district courts lack jurisdiction over both of these claims.in weiner,at,the fifth circuit held that district courts do not have jurisdiction in a refund suit over a claim that tax and interest were assessed after the statute of limitations expired.id.in hinck united states,d,the supreme court held that district courts lack jurisdiction to hear claims regarding the irs refusal to abate interest under section e.in their response to the for summary judgment and reply to the response in opposition to their motion for summary judgment,the duffies moved for voluntary dismissal of both the claims based on the statute of limitations and the claims based on interest abatement.docket entry at.under fed civ.a,this court grants the duffies motion for voluntary dismissal of both claims.
claim preclusion 
the government argues that the duffies claim that the irs improperly assessed enhanced interest under section c is barred by claim preclusion,or res judicata.the duffies do not dispute the preclusive effect of the tax court agreed decision on partnership items.interest,including interest under section c,is an affected item that has both partnership and nonpartnership components.the duffies dispute the res judicata effect of the tax court decision on the assessment of enhanced interest under c.
claim preclusion bars the litigation of claims that either have been litigated or should have been raised in an earlier suit.test masters educ,singh,cir,cert.denied,d,citing,united states,cir.the test for claim preclusion has four elements the parties in the subsequent action are identical to,or in privity with,the parties in the prior action the judgment in the prior case was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction there has been a final judgment on the merits and the same claim or cause of action is involved in both suits.see also ellis amex life ins,cir.if a party can only win the suit by convincing the court that the prior judgment was in error,the second suit is barred.test masters,at internal citations omitted.when all four elements are present,claim preclusion prohibits a litigant from asserting any claim or defense in the later action that was or could have been raised in support of or in opposition to the cause of action asserted in the prior action.united states shanbaum,cir.
identical parties in both actions 
the first element of claim preclusion is met here because the parties in this action are identical to the parties in the tax court case.under c,john duffie was treated as a party to the texas farm venturers tax court case,in which the irs was the opposing party.
judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction 
the duffies argue that the tax court was not a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to imposing enhanced interest under section c on partners of the partnership.in a proceeding,the tax court jurisdiction is limited to determining partnership items and the proper allocation of those partnership items among the partners.f.section c,an affected item,imposes interest at of the statutory rate for substantial underpayment of tax.a tax underpayment is substantial when it exceeds for the tax year in question.c.the irs may not assess interest under section c unless the substantial underpayment is attributable to one of the transactions defined by statute.transactions include any sham or fraudulent transaction,c a v,and any use of an accounting method that may result in a substantial distortion of income,c a iv.in the texas farm venturers case,the tax court stated that the adjustments to partnership income and expense for the taxable year are attributable to transactions which lacked economic substance,as described in former c a v sham transaction,so as to result in a substantial distortion of income and expense,as described in c a iv accounting method when computed under the partnership cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting docket entry,ex.
the duffies argue that the tax court determination that the partnership transactions that resulted in the adjustments lacked economic substance,as described in former c a v is not a finding of transactions.docket entry,at.in other amcor partnership cases,courts have examined the language from the tax court agreed decision in the consolidated cases and found that it clearly stated that the partnership transactions were,allowing the irs to impose interest under section c.see nault united states,cir kimball comm r of internal revenue,wl tax court because the partnership transactions lacked economic substance,they constituted taxmotivated transactions.in nault,the court stated 
the reference to section c a v,which helps to define transactions,confirms that the transactions were sham s or fraudulent transaction s and therefore lacked economic substance.the phrase so as to result in a substantial distortion of income and expense simply tracks the language of the former c a iv,which likewise helps to define transactions.thus,each phrase independently establishes that the adjustments were attributable to the partnerships activities.
at internal citations omitted.
the government asserts that the tax court has already determined that the transactions that resulted in the adjustments to the partnership items were transactions this determination is binding on the duffies and this determination meets the requirements for imposing enhanced tax under section c,leaving open only issues that were not and could not have been addressed in the tax court.the open issues do not include any examination into the character of the underlying transactions.the duffies assert that even if the tax court finding at the partnership level that the adjustments resulted from transactions that lacked economic substance means that they were sham transactions,this determination leaves unresolved issues requiring determinations,including the individual partner personal profit motive.these issues were not and could not be made at the partnership level because the tax court does not have jurisdiction to determine them.as a result,according to the duffies,the tax court decision did not resolve their liability for the enhanced interest and they are free to challenge the assessment.
a.the tests for determining sham transaction 
the tax court jurisdiction depends on whether the test for determining a sham transaction under section c requires substantive factual determinations.the genesis of the doctrine is the supreme court decision in frank lyon united states,d.the court stated that a transaction will be accorded tax recognition only if it has economic substance which is compelled or encouraged by business or regulatory realities,is imbued with considerations,and is not shaped solely by features that have meaningless labels attached.id.at.
subsequent case law developed two predominant tests for identifying a sham transaction.in rice toyota world,commissioner,cir,the fourth circuit adopted a standard,stating that t o treat a transaction as a sham,the court must find that the taxpayer was motivated by no business purposes other than obtaining tax benefits in entering the transaction,and that the transaction has no economic substance because no reasonable possibility of a profit exists.id.at.the businesspurpose prong inquires into the taxpayer subjective motive for entering the transaction.id.at.the prong requires an objective determination of whether a reasonable possibility of profit from the transaction existed apart from the tax benefits.id.at.
the other test,adopted by a majority of the circuits,states that the distinct aspects of the economic sham theory inquiry do not constitute discrete prongs of a rigid analysis,but rather represent related factors both of which inform the analysis of whether the transaction had sufficient substance,apart fromits tax consequences,to be respected for tax purposes.acm comm r of internal revenue,cir,cert.denied,d see alsosochin comm r of internal revenue,cir,cert.denied,d rose comm r of internal revenue,cir james comm r of internal revenue,cir stores,comm r of internal revenue,cir.the sham transaction doctrine has few bright lines,but i t is clear that transactions whose sole function is to produce tax deductions are substantive shams.stores,at quoting kirchman comm r of internal revenue,cir.
courts of appeals following the approach followed in most of the jurisdictions to consider the issue have held that while a taxpayer subjective business purpose or profit motive may be relevant to the sham transaction inquiry,the lack of a subjective profit motive is not required to assess interest at the enhanced rate under section c.see thomas united states of america,cir by its plain language c imposes no inquiry into the taxpayer investment motive when the transaction is found to be a sham chakales comm r of internal revenue,cir no basis for reading a separate state of mind requirement into the sham transaction test for purposes of section c a v estate of carberry comm r of internal revenue,cir upholding enhanced interest under section c without considering the taxpayer motive karr comm r of internal revenue,cir upholding enhanced interest assessment without inquiring into taxpayer motive because tax court found partnership activity lacked economic substance jackson comm r of internal revenue,cir the mere presence of a profit motive does not prevent a transaction from being a sham.
the fifth circuit has recognized,but not resolved,the disagreement between those circuits that apply the test for finding a sham transaction and those that collapse the prongs into a factors test.the fifth circuit has declined opportunities to determine what test should apply.in compaq computer subsidiaries comm r of internal revenue,cir,the court found it unnecessary to determine the appropriate standard for determining a sham transaction because in that case,the taxpayer met its burden on both prongs.see id.at because compaq did not involve a partnership,the question of how a partner individual profit motive fits into the sham inquiry was not at issue in that case.weinerv.united states,d.in copeland commissioner,cir,a partnership case involving a sham transaction,the fifth circuit did not reach the question whether profit motive is to be tested at the individual or partnership level.id.at.answering this question was unnecessary in copeland because the irs relied on for disallowing the partnership deductions,a section not applicable to partnerships.id.at.
jurisdiction to determine a sham transaction 
the tax court has held that it does not have jurisdiction in a proceeding to determine whether the adjustments made on a fpaa are attributable to a tax motivated transaction pursuant to section c.affiliated equip.leasing ii comm r of internal revenue,wl citing white comm r of internal revenue,wl see also energy partners,at,wl.this is because section c interest is not a partnership item and is not within the court scope of review in a partnership level proceeding,but is rather an affected item which requires a determination.white,at citing energy partners,at.the second and fourth circuits agree that interest assessed against a partner under section c is not a partnership item.field united states,cir zfass comm r of internal revenue,cir.in field,the second circuit stated that enhanced interest under section c is an affected item that turns on factual determinations made at the partner level.at see also mcgann united states,assessment of enhanced interest for tax motivated transactions is not a partnership item,but an affected item.
in recent cases,courts have held that the tax court does have jurisdiction to make factual findings concerning whether the partnership transactions were designed merely to secure tax benefits.river city ranches comm r of internal revenue,cir see also keener united states,prati.at.the ninth circuit in river city ranches did not characterize section c interest as a partnership item or an affected item.the court held that the nature of the partnership transactions,whether the transactions were is a partnership item.at.the tax code defines partnership item as any item required to be taken into account for the partnership taxable year under any provision of subtitle a to the extent regulations prescribed by the secretary provide that,for purposes of subtitle f,such item is more appropriately determined at the partnership level than at the partner level.a.the court in river city ranches reasoned 
the character of the partnership transactions does relate back to subtitle a,because it determines the individual partners personal income subtitle a matter.a partnership tax items affect not the income tax of the partnerships,but the income tax of the partners.a partnership tax items,which determine the partner taxes,are litigated in partnership in the individual partner cases.
id.at internal citations omitted.these cases recognize that a determination of sham transaction,properly made at the partnership level,affects the individual partner income tax liability at the partner level.
in keener,the court concluded that section c interest is an affected item with a component and a component.at.the nature of a partnership they are a the partnership item component of assessing section c interest.id.whether a transaction was a sham must be resolved first in a proceeding,before any consideration can be given in a refund action to whether the interest should have been imposed on the individual partner.id.
section c applies to transactions other than sham transactions,including any loss disallowed by reason of section a.c ii.section was added to the tax code to combat tax shelters caused by nonrecourse financing and other situations in which taxpayers were effectively immunized from loss.see comm r of internal revenue tufts,d.under section a,any loss from an activity covered by the section shall be allowed only to the extent the taxpayer is at risk.a.a taxpayer is considered to be at risk for the amount of cash contributed and for certain amounts borrowed for the activity.id.b.a taxpayer is generally not at risk for amounts protected against loss through nonrecourse financing,guarantees,stop loss agreements,or other similar arrangements.id.b.
the keener court drew a parallel between a sham transaction and section a.application of the provisions of section a is an affected item.see ginsburg comm r of internal revenue,wl greenberg bros comm r of internal revenue.issues concerning items such as the nonrecourse character of partnership notes are to be resolved in a proceeding,with those determinations then being binding on the partners in any refund litigation that would ensue.keener.at citing greenberg,at.the determination is appropriately made at the partnership level,in a unified proceeding,and not at the level.
in keener and river city ranches,the courts distinguished between the actual assessment of interest under section c by the irs,which requires that the partner tax underpayment was greater than,and the factual determination of whether a partnership was engaged in sham transactions.the decisions characterizing section c interest as an affected item that must be resolved at the partner level did not consider whether section c has a component that requires findings at the partnership level.the court in keener stated that these cases go astray in assuming that because interest is not itself a partnership item,a court is not required to resolve issues concerning the nature of the partnership transactions in a unified partnership proceeding.id.
in ertz comm r of internal revenue,wl tax court,the tax court applied river city ranches to hold that it lacked jurisdiction in a proceeding to determine whether a transaction was under section c.the in ertz resided in idaho and the appeal from the tax court decision was to the ninth circuit.the tax court followed the rule that it is bound to follow a court of appeals decision which is squarely on point where appeal from the decision lies to that court of appeals and that court alone.golsen comm r of internal revenue,wl,aff cir,cert.denied,d.under the ninth circuit precedent,the tax court held that jurisdiction to determine whether a transaction was under section c was only present in a proceeding.
the river city ranches rule regarding tax court jurisdiction is consistent with the ninth circuit approach to sham transaction in the partnership context.the determination of an existing profit motive is made at the partnership level and does not address the subjective intent of the particular partner in question.hill commissioner,cir.upon finding that a partnership transaction was a sham,as long as the partner underpayment was or greater,the irs may impose interest under section c irrespective of the subjective intent.see id.at.
the duffies argue that in the fifth circuit,a determination requires a finding that the individual partner lacked a profit motive.in partnership cases decided before compaq and copeland,the fifth circuit affirmed tax court decisions that the irs properly imposed interest at the section c enhanced rate.see chamberlain comm r of internal revenue,cir lukens comm r of internal revenue,cir durrett comm r of internal revenue,cir.in these cases,the tax court had found that the individual partner lacked a profit motive,despite testimony to the contrary.chamberlain,at lukens,at durrett,at.the fifth circuit affirmed the imposition of interest at the section c rate in these cases because the tax court factual finding that the individual partners lacked a profit motive was not clearly erroneous.
the fifth circuit has not decided which of the two tests followed in the circuit courts is the appropriate test for sham transaction.copeland,at.in transcapital leasing associates lp united states.cir,the court stated it was unnecessary to adopt either variant of the sham transaction doctrine because the transaction lacked a genuine business purpose and was economically insubstantial.the court also expressed no opinion on whether the profit motive analysis of an alleged sham transaction focuses on the subjective motivation of the taxpayer partner or the partnership entity.id.in chamberlain,lukens,and durrett,the fifth circuit merely affirmed the result reached in the tax court,based in part on the fact that the tax court finding that the individuals lacked a profit motive was not clearly erroneous.
contrary to the duffies assertion,the fifth circuit does not require a finding that an individual partner lacked a profit motive to impose interest at the enhanced rate under section c.while the individual taxpayer subjective business purpose or profit motive may be relevant to the inquiry,lack of profit motive is not required to impose interest at the enhanced rate.see thomas,at karr,at see also cherin commissioner,wl the tax court has never held that the mere presence of an individual profit objective will require it to recognize for tax purposes a transaction which lacks economic substance bohrer commissioner,cir noting that either lack of profit motive or lack of economic substance can render a transaction a sham.in weighing the relevant factors to determine whether a partnership transaction is a substance and business court is not required to determine whether the individual partner lacked a profit motive in deciding that enhanced interest applies.
the duffies concede that under tax court rule b and the language of the irs motion for entry of decisions,they are bound by the tax court determination of partnership items.in its motion for entry of decisions,the irs took the position that enhanced interest under section c was an affected item,not a partnership item,which is a judicial admission binding on the irs.see martinez bally,cir holding a judicial admission is a formal concession in the pleadings or stipulations by a party or counsel that is binding on the party making them.
although enhanced interest under section c is an affected item,it has a partnershipitem component and a component.keener,fed.cl at.the component of section c interest is whether the taxpayer underpayment was substantial or whether it was attributable to a transaction previously determined at the partnership level to be.the tax court does not have jurisdiction to make this nonpartnership determination in a proceeding.the tax court did not determine whether any underpayment by the duffies was substantial or whether such underpayment was attributable to texas farm venturers disallowed farming expenses.the tax court did had jurisdiction to do the partnership transactions resulting in the adjustments were a sham.this determination of the component of section c interest is properly made at the partnership level.
making the determination at the partner level could lead to inconsistent results.tefra was intended to channel partnership items into a unified procedure for resolution determining whether the partnership activities were sham transactions in a proceeding is consistent with that purpose.the tax court had jurisdiction to determine whether the texas farm venturers transactions were sham transactions.
final judgment on the merits 
section g states that a determination by a court on the fpaa shall have the force and effect of a decision of the tax court.g.the duffies assert that because the tax court decision was an agreed decision,drafted by the irs,it should not be given preclusive effect.the fifth circuit has held that an agreed decision in the tax court may be given res judicata effect.shanbaum,at.the court in shanbaum stated that s imply because the tax court decisions were reached by agreement does not mean that the taxpayer income tax and transferee liabilities were not resolved by a sic final judgments on the merits for the purposes of res judicata.id.
because an agreed decision is contractual in nature,the preclusive effects should be measured by the intent of the parties.wright,miller cooper,federal practice and procedure jurisdiction.preclusion should be denied as to claims the parties intended to leave open for further litigation.see id.the duffies argue that the parties did not intend the tax court proceedings and decision to determine whether the assessment of section c interest at the partner level was appropriate.the duffies argue that they are not bound by the agreement in attachment c to the irs motion for entry of decisions,which stated that the limited partners would be estopped from challenging the assessment of interest under section c.docket entry,appendix at.
once a suit is filed in the tax court,the tmp may enter into a settlement agreement with the irs that is binding on all the other partners,notice and non notice,with respect to the determination of the partnership items in dispute.tax court.b b.the agreement between the irs and the tmp concerning section c interest,attachment c,stated in relevant part 
effective upon entry of the decision and in consideration of the reduced adjustments set forth therein,the partners expressly consent to the assessment of interest on the deficiencies in income tax,if any,which are attributable to the adjustments to the partnership items of the partnership at the increased rate specified in former c.
absent a timely objection to the entry of decisions the parties to the proceedings shall be presumed to have consented to all of the terms of the agreement described above and shall be estopped from challenging the adjustments to the partnership items determined in the decision and from challenging the assessment of interest accruing on any deficiencies in income tax attributable thereto at the increased rate prescribed by former c.
id.at the irs motion for entry of decisions stated 
the irs has made preliminary determinations as to certain affected items,including the assessment of interest on the deficiencies in the partners income tax at the increased rate prescribed by the former c which determinations the tax matters partner and other partners are expected to dispute.
docket entry,appendix at.
the agreement and decision are binding and preclude relitigation of partnership items.this includes the component of section c,whether the partnership transaction resulting in the adjustments was a sham transaction.although the irs motion for entry of decisions states that the assessment of section c interest would not be subject to challenge by partners,the motion also states that the irs expected the partners to dispute the irs preliminary determinations as to the liability of the limited partners for additions to tax under sections and and for the assessment of interest on the deficiencies in the partners income tax at the rate set under section c.docket entry,appendix at.taken together,these two sections of the motion,the agreement,and the decision allow a challenge of the component of section c interest whether the partner underpayment was greater than and whether it was attributable to the transaction previously determined at the partnership level to be.
section c,section,and section a,under which the irs made determinations it expected the partners to dispute,all impose additional tax or interest for tax underpayment.section imposes an addition to tax of percent of the interest payable under section for an underpayment which is attributable to negligence or intentional disregard of rules or regulations.a.section a,in effect during tax years and,provided that if there were a substantial understatement of income tax for a taxable year,a penalty of percent of the amount of the underpayment attributable to the understatement would be imposed.an understatement was deemed substantial if it exceeded the greater of ten percent of the tax required to be shown on the return or.b.
it is instructive to look at the difference between section c,on the one hand,and sections and,on the other,regarding the necessary factual findings at the partner level.section requires a finding of the individual partner negligence.energy partners,at.if the transaction is a tax shelter,section requires a factual finding concerning the taxpayer reasonable beliefs about litigation risks.id.in contrast,if the proceeding results in adjustments attributable to a transaction,the factual finding at the partner level for section c is computational.the tax court has held that section c applicability turns on the amount of the taxpayer underpayment attributable to a taxmotivated transaction.energy partners,at.determining the amount of a partner underpayment resulting from the adjustment resulting from a transaction is a computational task of deciding whether the underpayment amount was greater than.although some federal district courts in the fifth circuit have concluded that sham transaction requires an inquiry into the individual partner profit,the fifth circuit has not adopted this requirement.when a sham transaction is found at the partnership level,the factual finding required at the individual partner level is computational whether the resulting underpayment was greater than.
the agreement in attachment c states that in consideration of the parties consent to the assessment of interest at the rate prescribed by former c,the irs expressly waives all claims against the limited partners for any additions to tax that might be due under and.docket entry,appendix at.however,the general partners consent ed to the assessment of an addition to tax pursuant to,at the rate of of any additional tax deficiency which results from the adjustments to partnership items contained in the decisions.id.the irs waived its claims against the general partners for the assessment of additional tax under section.id.at.when the irs stated that it expected the partners to dispute its determinations under sections,and c,it expected that the general partners would dispute their reasonable belief about litigation risks under section and that the limited partners would dispute the determination that their underpayments were greater than under section c and whether that
