the city of concord filed timely proofs of claim for property taxes owed by a chapter debtor with respect to quarters of the tax year that had been billed,but did not file proofs of claim with respect to property tax bills for later quarters that were billed during the bankruptcy proceedings.a single lien secured payment of the entire tax burden both taxes that were the subject of claims and those that were not.upon the city motion for allowance and payment of tax claims that were not filed,the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york morris,ruled that the plan extinguished the lien,reasoning that the plan declared all property of northern new england telephone operations llc nneto to be free and clear of liens,including the city lien,because the city had asserted the tax liabilities for the earlier quarters but not for the later quarters.
before the enactment of the bankruptcy code,et,the rule governing extinguishment of liens was simple liens pass through bankruptcy unaffected.dewsnup timm,see long bullard.the code preserves that background rule,see d,with a caveat liens are extinguished if the underlying property was dealt with by a confirmed plan,unless the plan or the order of confirmation provides otherwise.id.c.
applying c,the bankruptcy court held that the reorganization plan of debtor nneto extinguished a tax lien held by the city of concord.the bankruptcy court therefore denied the city motion for allowance and payment of tax claims,filed more than two years after confirmation.the united states district court for the southern district of new york sweet,affirmed.on appeal,the city argues in the alternative as to why its lien survived the bankruptcy proceedings,including that a plan extinguishes a lien under c only if the plan text dealt with the property subject to the lien,and that the text of nneto plan did not deal with the relevant property that a plan extinguishes a lien under c only if the lienholder participated in the bankruptcy proceedings,and that the city participation was insufficient to support extinguishment that d preserves the lien because the plan was confirmed without any proof of claim having been filed for those tax bills the city now asserts that,even if c applies and the city lien was extinguished by the plan,equitable principles should prompt this court to recognize the city lien and that the doctrine of excusable neglect required the bankruptcy court to accept the city untimely assertion of the lien.each of these arguments fails.
we have not previously considered the circumstances under which a reorganization plan extinguishes a lien.we now hold that a lien is extinguished by a chapter plan if the text of the plan does not preserve the lien the plan is confirmed the property subject to the lien is dealt with by the terms of the plan and the lienholder participated in the bankruptcy proceedings.as they apply to the facts of this case,all four requirements are satisfied.we conclude that the plan extinguished the city lien,and we therefore affirm.
background 
on october,nneto,along with its parent corporation fairpoint communications,filed petitions for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the southern district of new york.on january,the bankruptcy court confirmed the operative reorganization plan,the third amended joint plan of reorganization under chapter.
as of the petition date,nneto owned several parcels of real property in concord,new hampshire.the city of concord would bill nneto for property taxes on a quarterly basis.the tax year begins each april,with quarterly tax bills issuing in july for,october for,january for,and march for.when nneto filed its bankruptcy petition in october,the city had already issued property tax bills for the first and second quarters of the tax year.the city filed several proofs of claim in nneto bankruptcy proceedings,including the and property tax bills for.however,the city never filed proofs of claim for and.payment on those bills was due january,and march,and the city mailed both bills to nneto on november.all dates pertinent to the tax bills preceded the april,bar date the deadline for governmental units to file proofs of claim against nneto.
ultimately,the bankruptcy court allowed the city claims for the and tax bills after reducing some of the amounts.as to the and tax bills,the city moved the bankruptcy court on october,after the january,confirmation to formally allow those tax bills and order payment.the motion contended,inter alia,that the tax claim is secured by a lien and that such lien was not discharged by the plan.nneto opposed the motion on the ground that the lien was extinguished on confirmation of the plan.
the bankruptcy court denied the city motion,citing the plan provision that all property of nneto be free and clear of creditors interests,which the court interpreted to mean that the tax lien on nneto real property in concord was extinguished.the district court affirmed.the city challenges that affirmance on further appeal to this court.

when a bankruptcy appeal reaches us after district court review of the bankruptcy court order,our review of the bankruptcy court order is plenary.momentum emp.creditors comm.in re momentum,cir.in undertaking this plenary review,we independently review the factual determinations and legal conclusions of the bankruptcy court,evaluating the bankruptcy court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
the longstanding background rule has been that liens pass through bankruptcy unaffected.dewsnup timm,in re penrod,cir.for the most part,the federal bankruptcy code,et seq,originally enacted as the bankruptcy reform act of,stat,leaves that general principle intact.dewsnup,at see d.however,chapter of the code contains a caveat 
except as provided in subsections d and d of this section and except as otherwise provided in the plan or in the order confirming the plan,after confirmation of a plan,the property dealt with by the plan is free and clear of all claims and interests of creditors,equity security holders,and of general partners in the debtor.
c.the parties agree that the statutory exceptions,d and d,have no application to this case.
the phrase,interests of creditors,in c includes liens.id.defining lien as interest in property to secure payment of a debt or performance of an obligation.although c does not explicitly reference the extinguishment of liens,courts have uniformly held that confirmation of a reorganization can act to extinguish liens.in re chrysler llc,cir.citing cases,vacated as moot sub nom.state police pension tr.chrysler llc.
accordingly,whether a plan extinguishes a lien depends on the requirements embedded in c.the express wording of c provides that a lien is extinguished if the plan is confirmed,the property subject to the lien is dealt with by the plan and neither the plan nor the order of confirmation preserves it.
our sister circuits and the lower courts of this circuit have inferred a fourth consideration that a reorganization plan extinguishes a lien only if the lienholder participated in the bankruptcy proceedings.the participation requirement was recognized as such in penrod.see at.the plan in that case provided for payment of a claim secured by a lien on several hogs,but was silent as to whether the lien was extinguished.id.at.after the plan effective date but before the debtors were required to make payment,the debtors sold the hogs for slaughter and kept the proceeds.id.the creditor believed it had maintained a lien on the hogs and therefore was owed the sale proceeds but the court held that the lien was extinguished by the plan.as the court explained,since lienholders know that their liens are likely to be affected,and indeed altered,their participation in a reorganization qualifies the background rule that liens pass through bankruptcy unaffected.see id.at.accordingly,the court held that a lien can be extinguished pursuant to c if the lienholder participated and that if the lienholder did not participate,then his lien would not be property dealt with by the plan,and so the section woul
