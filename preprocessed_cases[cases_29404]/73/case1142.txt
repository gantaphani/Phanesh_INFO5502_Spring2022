background 
joseph and beth shwarz are the sole shareholders of abw,which repairs steam boilers for dry cleaners.steve hadley and al bryant are employees of the irs.bryant was at all relevant times hadley supervisor.
at some time before september,the irs assessed a trust fund recovery penalty of against joseph shwarz shwarz for the period ending december,pursuant to a.it also assessed federal employment,unemployment,and withholding taxes of approximately against abw,for the years,and.
in september,abw submitted an offer in compromise of for the taxes owed by it and the trust fund penalty owed by shwarz.the offer called for a payment of,followed by monthly payments of,until the balance and interest were paid in full.the irs accepted the offer.
between november,and april,shwarz caused abw to pay a total of to the irs towards satisfaction of the offer in compromise.shwarz also believed,based on a letter from his accountant,that the cash value of a life insurance policy that shwarz owned that the irs had levied on would be applied to the offer in compromise.at the time,the policy cash value was approximately.
in april,shwarz stopped making payments to the irs,believing that the in payments,plus the cash value of the insurance policy,a total of,had fully paid the offer in compromise of,plus accrued interest of approximately,a total of due.
in april,hadley informed shwarz that abw offer in compromise was in default.shwarz told hadley that he and abw could not pay the amounts demanded,that abw was current in its tax compliance,and requested an installment payment arrangement.hadley threatened shwarz with enforced collection in the form of closing down abw and selling its assets.appellants then submitted a new offer in compromise and also filed a collection appeal request,but the irs did not process the new offer.
the irs then made an application in federal district court to enter the private business premises of abw to effect a levy.attached to the application was a supporting declaration from hadley,dated june.in paragraph of his declaration,hadley asserted that on june,he requested shwarz consent to enter abw premises to effect the levy,but shwarz refused.because hadley did not speak to shwarz on june,this statement was false 
the district court issued the order for entry.in describing the basis for the order,judge dean pregerson stated that t he internal revenue service has sent notices and demands to the taxpayer,but the taxpayer has neglected or refused to pay the taxes owed,citing paragraph and two other paragraphs of the declaration in support of this statement.judge pregerson did not refer to hadley having requested or shwarz having refused consent to enter abw premises.
shortly thereafter,the irs made a second application in district court,this time to enter the private personal and business premises of shwarz to effect a levy.attached to the application was a supporting declaration from hadley,dated july.in paragraph of the declaration,hadley claimed that on june,he had visited shwarz business premises and observed several vehicles shwarz stated that he owned the vehicles the date on which shwarz allegedly made this statement is not explicitly given and on april,hadley confirmed with the california department of motor vehicles that shwarz owned the vehicles.appellants again claim that some of this is false they claim that hadley did not observe the vehicles on june,and that shwarz did not on that date tell hadley that he owned them.in paragraph of the declaration,hadley again claimed that on june,he requested shwarz consent to enter to effect the levy,but shwarz refused.this statement is assert,and appellees apparently concede,that hadley did not speak to shwarz on june.
the district court issued the order for entry.in describing the basis for the order,judge tevrizian referred to hadley claims in paragraph of the july,declaration.he also cited paragraph in precisely the same manner as judge pregerson had,and he did not refer to hadley having requested or shwarz having refused consent to enter abw premises.
pursuant to the orders for entry,the irs entered both shwarz and abw premises to effect the levies.the irs seized abw business assets,as well as real and personal property of appellants,padlocked all entrances and exits,and posted seizure notices on the premises and assets.
appellants then brought this action against the irs and the united states for unauthorized disclosure of tax return information under and and,against the united states for unauthorized tax collection actions under,and against hadley and bryant for violations of their fourth and fifth amendment rights under bivens.
appellees moved to dismiss the action pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b on various grounds.the district court granted the motion in part and denied it in part.it ruled that the claim under and was precluded by appellants had failed to state a claim under because they had not alleged in support of it any violation of the revenue code or regulations and a bivens claim was unavailable in light of the exclusive statutory remedy of,and,in any event,appellants had not been deprived of their constitutional rights,because the search and seizure were made pursuant to valid entry orders.
only the claim survived the motion to dismiss.appellees then moved for summary judgment on that claim.appellants opposed the motion on the grounds that it was premature and that triable issues of material fact existed,but presented no affidavits or other evidence in opposition to the motion.the district court granted summary judgment to appellees on the claim.this appeal followed.
ii.standard of review 
a dismissal for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted,pursuant to rule b,is reviewed de novo.see tworivers lewis,cir.a grant of summary judgment is also reviewed de novo.see robi reed,cir.
iii.discussion 
section claim 
section requires that tax returns and return information be kept confidential,subject to specifically described exceptions.see.section creates a private right of action against the united states if any officer or employee of the united states knowingly,or by reason of negligence,discloses any return or return information in violation of any provision of section.a.
section,however,creates a private right of action against the united states if in connection with any collection of federal tax any officer or employee of the internal revenue service recklessly or intentionally,or by reason of negligence disregards any provision of this title,or any regulation promulgated under this title.a.thus,a violation of in connection with any collection of federal tax is actionable under.section further provides that,e xcept as provided by section dealing with damages for failure to release a lien,such civil action shall be the exclusive remedy for recovering damages resulting from such actions.id.emphasis added.
it is unclear both in appellants complaint and in their briefs precisely what they allege constituted unauthorized disclosures in violation of.it might be the perjured declarations of hadley,it might be the seizure notices posted at the shwarzes and abw place of business,or it might be both.in any case,because all of those disclosures occurred in the course of tax collection activity,the district court correctly ruled that the action is precluded by the exclusivity provision of.
no circuit has decided the question whether the exclusivity provision of bars a suit for unauthorized disclosure of
