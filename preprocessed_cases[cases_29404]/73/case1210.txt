this case involves financial accounting issues in the context of income taxation.consolidated manufacturing purchases used car parts,called cores,rebuilds the cores with new components,and then sells them.consolidated uses a pricing system that encourages its customers for the rebuilt products to send a replacement core back to it.in this way,consolidated ensures a continuous supply of its primary raw cores.the price that the company agrees to pay its customers for such replacement cores is called the core amount referred to herein as core amount or customer core amount.for tax purposes,consolidated uses the,fifo accounting method for its inventory of these cores,but it uses the,lifo method for its other inventory,overhead,and new parts.cores in inventory that have already been integrated into a finished rebuilt part are valued by the company at the price the company would pay to purchase such a core from a professional core supplier.all other cores in inventory,either in raw inventory or integrated into partly finished products,are valued at scrap metal prices.
after auditing the company tax returns,the commissioner of internal revenue determined that several of these accounting procedures were improper.the commissioner ruled that the company must use the fifo method for all of its expenses,and that the inventory of cores should be valued at the customer core amounts rather than as scrap metal or at supplier core prices.consolidated challenged these determinations,and the tax court affirmed the commissioner decisions.we hold that the commissioner correctly determined that consolidated mixed use of lifo and fifo was improper it was not an abuse of discretion for the commissioner to order consolidated to use fifo for all inventory,rather than lifo and the customer core amounts reflect the cost,but not the market price,of the inventory of cores.because consolidated chose to use the lower of cost or market price to value its inventory of cores,we remand for further findings on the market prices of the cores.we therefore affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
background 
customer cores 
consolidated remanufactures used car parts.the company acquires worn parts,strips them down to a reusable core,and then rebuilds them with new components.these rebuilt parts are sold to its customers,ford dealers.
the used core is the key ingredient in the remanufacturing process.although consolidated buys some of its cores from professional core suppliers,it acquires most from its customers.the company uses its pricing method to ensure that it has a constant supply of cores from its customers.when it sells a remanufactured part,consolidated charges both an exchange amount and a core amount.these exchange and core amounts are used in consolidated price lists,invoices,and financial accounting books.the customer core amount is credited back if the customer sends a core of similar type to consolidated for the rebuilt core that it has purchased from consolidated.this method of obtaining used cores primarily from customers for the rebuilt parts is a standard practice in the industry.
consolidated accepts these returned cores on the basis of a visual inspection by the driver.even if the core later turns out to be unusable,the customer is credited for the full customer core amount.the company also sometimes accepts cores with missing parts or other defects,but at less than full credit.consolidated invoices provide that to receive credit a core has to be returned within a given time period,such as sixty days,but in practice the company accepts cores even after these deadlines,and even if the core has become obsolete.gregory gordon,the president of consolidated,testified that the company sometimes accepts a core that does not match the type delivered to the customer,although in that case the company does not refund the full customer core amount,but rather pays the customer the price that a professional core supplier would charge for such a core.this price is usually much less than the customer core amount,which is purposely set high by consolidated to induce customers to return their used parts.
during and,approximately to of sales depending on the type of part resulted in the customer providing a core back to consolidated.of the consumer cores that consolidated accepted,about to had defects and were not rebuildable.unusable cores are sold as scrap metal.
gordon testified that consolidated uses this method of obtaining cores because it enables the company to acquire customer cores at virtually no cost.the delivery trucks are returning to consolidated anyway,so the return loads with customer cores are.
consolidated sets the price for the customer core amount on the basis of several factors,including the supply of cores in the market and the demand for the rebuilt part.gordon testified that the company considers the current inventory levels of the type of core involved in the transaction and the cost of purchasing that type of core from a core supplier.to induce the customer to return a core,the core amount reflects an amount above the price that a professional core supplier would charge.
ii.supplier cores 
consolidated buys some of its used cores from core suppliers,businesses that specialize in supplying cores to meet specific needs.jimmy bishop,president of consolidated largest supplier,testified that suppliers buy used parts from salvage yards,car manufacturers,or consumers on the basis of a price schedule that they set.the suppliers inspect these cores and then sell them to remanufacturers like consolidated at somewhat higher prices than they pay to buy them,but for less than the customer core amount that consolidated is willing to credit its customers when they return cores in conjunction with the purchase of rebuilt parts.
unlike customer cores,supplier cores are guaranteed to be usable.if consolidated discovers a defect in a supplier core during the rebuilding process,that core can be returned to the supplier for credit.because supplier cores are ordered to meet specific needs,they generally remain in consolidated inventory for a brief period of time.consolidated inventory,therefore,consists almost entirely of customer cores.
iii.consolidated accounting practices 
manufacturing businesses must take inventory each year for tax purposes.see.through its choice of an accounting method for inventory,a taxpayer can manipulate its reported income and therefore its tax burden.consequently,the tax code requires that the method both conform as nearly as may be to the best accounting practices and clearly reflect the income.id.here,consolidated could change accounting methods only with the consent of the commissioner.see e.
one of two assumptions about the flow of goods is commonly made in calculating inventory,fifo or,lifo.these assumptions do not track the physical movement of actual goods,but rather are used to simplify the calculations.under the fifo method,the taxpayer assumes that any goods sold were the oldest in stock,so the goods remaining in inventory are the most recently procured or produced.under the lifo method,the reverse is assumed the most recently procured or produced goods were sold first,and the inventory consists of the oldest remaining goods.fifo is the default rule for tax purposes,but under some circumstances a company may opt to use the lifo method instead.see reg.d.
since,consolidated has used the lifo method for its labor,overhead costs,and new parts inventories.however,the company continues to use the fifo method for its inventory of cores.it also uses the component of cost method rather than assigning a value to each item in its inventory,consolidated totals the units of each raw material,labor,overhead,and other costs represented by its inventory.thus,the cost of a finished product is calculated as the sum of its materials and other costs of production.
items inventoried under lifo must be valued at cost,see b,but consolidated has elected to value its used cores inventoried under fifo at the lower of cost or market price as permitted by reg.c.for tax and insurance purposes,it values the cores in its remanufactured finished products at the price that a core supplier would charge for that core,rather than at the customer core amount.the company values its inventory of cores that either have not yet been integrated into a remanufactured part or have been only partly integrated into a work in process at scrap metal prices.however,the tax court found that for its financial reports,consolidated values its entire inventory of customer cores at supplier core prices.
iv.administrative and judicial proceedings 
the commissioner audited consolidated returns for and and determined that the returns understated consolidated income for those two years by nearly million.there were two bases for this adjustment first,the company had used an unallowable method to value its inventory by valuing cores at less than the customer core amount.second,the company election of the lifo method was invalid because it applies only to the inventory of overhead,labor,and new parts,but not to the inventory of cores.because the commissioner concluded that consolidated had improperly elected the lifo method for inventory,the commissioner terminated its use of that method,forcing consolidated to use fifo instead for all inventory.consolidated sought review in the tax court,which ruled for the commissioner on all issues.
discussion 
consolidated raises three issues.first,it argues that it should be allowed to use the lifo method to calculate its costs for labor,overhead,and some raw materials,without using it for the used cores.second,it argues that even if it may not use lifo in this manner,it was an abuse of the commissioner discretion to order consolidated to use fifo for everything.third,it argues that the commissioner overvalued its inventory of customer cores by using customer core amounts rather than supplier core amounts or scrap metal prices.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction to review decisions of the tax court under i.a,which provides that the review shall be in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions tried without a jury.thus,we review factual questions for clear error,legal questions de novo,and mixed questions of law and fact either for clear error or de novo,depending on whether the question is primarily factual or legal.anderson comm r,cir.we review de novo findings of ultimate fact derived from applying legal principles to subsidiary facts.first bank comm r,cir.finally,we review the commissioner determination that an accounting method does not clearly reflect income for abuse of discretion.thor power tool comm r,d.
ii.use of the lifo method for overhead,labor,and new parts 
a taxpayer may elect to use the lifo method to inventory specified goods properly subject to inventory.reg.a see also a.regulations further provide that the taxpayer may limit its use of lifo to one or more of the raw materials in a class of goods.reg.c,j.in that case,the taxpayer uses fifo for all remaining costs.thus,consolidated presumably could have invoked this provision to use lifo for its inventory of new parts a raw material,for example,and fifo for labor,overhead,and used engine cores.
consolidated,however,elected to use lifo for its labor,overhead,and new parts.consolidated does not contend that labor and overhead are raw materials,so the regulatory exception in c,j does not apply to this case.the question,therefore,is whether labor,overhead,and the new parts alone constitute goods properly subject to inventory.we hold they are not.
in the manufacturing context,goods subject to inventory are tangible,movable objects.jim turin sons,comm r,cir holding that term merchandise in,defining when inventories must be taken for tax purposes,does not include items that can not be warehoused in inventory.this accords with the plain meaning of the term goods.see black law dictionary ed webster third new international dictionary.thus,under a a manufacturer may elect lifo only with respect to tangible objects.
in this case,consolidated produces goods,rebuilt engines.rebuilt engines are made of cores,new parts,labor,and overhead.labor and overhead are not themselves goods,because they are not tangible objects.even when the new parts are factored in,there is no tangible product the labor and overhead is applied to the cores together with the new parts.it was therefore improper for consolidated to use lifo to inventory these components without also including the cores.
consolidated had three options under the regulations it could use fifo for everything it could use lifo for everything or it could use lifo for some or all of its raw materials new parts or cores and fifo for the other raw materials,labor,and overhead.consolidated chose a fourth,impermissible option using fifo for some raw materials cores and lifo for the other raw material new parts,as well as for labor and overhead.although option is permitted by the regulations,consolidated fourth option is not.
consolidated argues that our understanding of the term goods is contradicted by the regulations under that govern the fifo method.we disagree.it is true that the regulations pertaining to also refer to inventorying goods.see reg.d.consolidated is required to include all direct and indirect costs in its inventory,reg.a,and if consolidated were to inventory its raw materials using lifo,then it would inventory only its labor and overhead using fifo.however,the provision that refers to goods also explicitly references the regulations under that govern the lifo method.see reg.d.these regulations,not those under,cover consolidated hypothetical situation.it is clear from the examples in c that when a company uses lifo for its raw materials,it uses fifo for its labor and overhead.thus,even though labor and overhead are not goods,c requires a taxpayer to use fifo for them in some not circumstances applicable to consolidated.
consolidated also contends that we should allow flexibility in the lifo regulations because congress intended that all taxpayers have the option to use lifo.our decision does not foreclose the use of lifo by anyone if it is properly elected.consolidated could have elected to use lifo to value its inventories of used engine cores and new parts and its labor and overhead costs.rather,our decision prevents a taxpayer from mixing methods in a way that is not authorized by the tax code or treasury regulations.
we find consolidated reliance on hutzler brothers commissioner,wl,to be misplaced.in that case,the tax court allowed a department store to use the dollar value of its merchandise in taking inventory under lifo,rather than making the company track the physical movement of each item.id.at,wl.the court found that congress intended that lifo be available to all,and that accounting methods made it impractical to compute inventory by tracking specific articles.id.at,wl.it therefore held that the store must be allowed to use the method.the tax regulations have since been amended specifically to permit the method.see reg.
in this case,by contrast,consolidated has not shown that it would have been impossible for the company to use lifo for its entire inventory.thus,even if we were inclined to adopt the dicta in hutzler brothers that lifo must be made available to all taxpayers,it would not avail consolidated.
in sum,we hold that consolidated election to use lifo just for its labor,overhead,and new parts inventory was improper.
iii.termination of lifo 
the commissioner has substantial discretion to terminate consolidated lifo election and order the company to use fifo instead.the tax code specifically provides that if the accounting method used does not clearly reflect income,the computation of taxable income shall be made under such method as,in the opinion of the secretary,does clearly reflect income.b.the regulations state more specifically that whether or not the lifo method,once adopted,may be continued,and the propriety of all computations incidental to the use of such method,will be determined by the commissioner in connection with the examination of the taxpayer income tax returns.reg.d.
to the extent that the regulations constrain this discretion,they do so in a way that supports the
