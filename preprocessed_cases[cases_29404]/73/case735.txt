edward kunze died on december.the net worth of his estate at the time of his death was approximately million.this amount is uncontested.nine months after edward estate filed its tax return,an audit,which eventually lasted months,was started.during the long audit,interest of accrued.
on july,the estate filed a petition with the irs requesting an abatement of this interest charge by invoking exercising its discretion,the irs denied the request and the estate filed this suit in the tax court for review of the denial.the irs filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,arguing that the net worth of the estate as of the date of kunze death exceeded the limit of million.the tax court agreed and dismissed the case.
on appeal to us,the estate argues that due to a convoluted series of in the internal revenue code,the tax court applied the wrong statute in determining subject matter jurisdiction.it also alleges that the jurisdictional requirement,limiting judicial review of abatements to estates valued at less than million,is unconstitutional both on its face and as applied.
we have jurisdiction over this appeal under a.we apply the same standard of review to a tax court decision that we apply to district court determinations in a civil bench trial we review questions of law de novo we review factual determinations,as well as applications of legal principles to those factual determinations,only for clear error.eyler commissioner of internal revenue,cir.
internal revenue code grants the tax court jurisdiction to review abatement of interest denials if the appealing party meets the requirements of c a ii section c a ii references the requirements of d b,which,for purposes of an award of attorneys fees and litigation costs,defines party as an individual whose net worth did not exceed million at the time the civil action was filed.however,d b refers to the maximum net worth of an individual or corporation seeking to bring suit and not the maximum net worth of an estate.here,the estate,not an individual,brought suit.thus,the tax court applied another subsection of c d which provides special rules for applying the net worth requirement of d b for purposes of section c a ii.the special rules outlined in c d state that the million net worth limitation set forth in d b shall apply to an estate and shall be calculated at the time of the decedent death.emphasis added.
the estate contends that instead of calculating the net worth of the estate when kunze died in,as required by c d,the tax court should have followed the requirements of d b and calculated the estate value when it filed suit against the irs years later,in.the estate argues that c d was inapplicable because i refers only to subsection c a ii and not to subsection c d.moreover,it contends that the irs was estopped from contesting jurisdiction because the estate relied on misinformation provided by an irs employee.finally,the estate argues that c d did not apply to c a ii because the unamended version of d referenced a nonexistent subsection of c a ii.
we find that all three of these arguments are unpersuasive and conclude that the tax court correctly applied the jurisdictional limitations set forth in c d.moreover,even were we to disregard c d and calculate the estate net worth at the time the action was filed,as required by d b,the result would remain unchanged.the estate contention that its net worth at the time it filed suit was less than million is based on the mistaken assumption that,in calculating its net worth,the irs should exclude the value of assets distributed upon the death of the decedent.however,we have rejected this calculus and held that for the purpose of the valuation of an estate must encompass all assets,including those distributed prior to litigation.estate of woll united states,cir.thus,regardless of which statute applied,the net worth of the estate exceeded million therefore,the tax court lacked jurisdiction.
the estate is correct in noting that i does not directly reference c d and instead refers to c a ii.this section,a ii,in turn,incorporates the requirements of d b.unfortunately,does not direct the reader back to.however,because d b refers to individuals,corporations,partnerships,associations and their like,but not estates,the reader is on notice that this statute alone does not establish the jurisdictional requirements for estates.
in fact,provides special rules for estates.section c d specifically references c a ii and states that d provides special rules for applying the net worth requirement of d b for purposes of the subparagraph a ii of this paragraph.thus,establishes that subparagraph d applies to c a ii for determining jurisdictional limits.
granted,the series of back and presented in this case is not a model of clarity.however,such meanderings are not uncommon in the tax code and have been known to provide lifetime employment,if not enjoyment,to tax attorneys.here,the tax court adeptly followed the trail of,applied the appropriate statute,and correctly determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.
the estate also argued that the irs should be estopped from raising the issue of subject matter jurisdiction.in a final determination letter sent in april,the irs denied the estate petition for interest abatement and erroneously stated that the estate could file for court review,provided your net worth not exceed million as of the filing date of your petition for review.the estate argues that the court should have deferred to the irs erroneous letter and determined the net worth of the estate at the time it filed suit in.
however,the estate can not manufacture subject matter jurisdiction based solely on a government agent misinterpretation of tax statutes.see commissioner schleier,d interpretative ruling by the irs can not be used to overturn the plain language of a statute.moreover,we have held that estoppel will not operate against the government where a plaintiff has relied on the erroneous advice of a government agent.cheers secretary of health,education,and welfare,cir parties dealing with the government are charged with knowledge of and are bound by statutes and lawfully promulgated regulations despite reliance to their pecuniary detriment upon incorrect information received from government agents or employees.
here,the estate argument that greater deference should have been given to the final determination letter is unavailing.the estate was represented by counsel,and its failure to decipher the tax code can not be excused by its reliance on a government employee error.the tax court correctly held that a mistake on the part of an irs agent did not confer subject matter jurisdiction where there existed no statutory basis for judicial review.
the estate also argues that c d should not have applied because in april,when it received the irs letter denying abatement,the unamended version of c d referenced a nonexistent subsection of,namely,c a iii because subsection c a iii did not exist,the estate argues that the limits set forth in c d should be ignored and we should look to d b to determine subject matter jurisdiction.
this argument fails on two counts.first,congress amended c d on july,months before the estate filed suit in october.thus,even if the typographical error had caused confusion,the estate had access to the corrected version of d before it filed suit.
moreover,the error is so transparent that the estate can hardly claim to have been bamboozled.the unamended version of c d incorrectly referred to subparagraph iii instead of subparagraph ii.however,subparagraph c a ii still set forth the relevant jurisdictional limitations.in turning to subsection a,a reader would realize that the subparagraph had been misnumbered,but would not be surprised by the intent of subsection a.
nevertheless,the estate suggests that we should read the subsection literally and simply conclude that it no longer applies.there are limits to literalism.generally,each word of a statute is given effect unless the provision is the result of an obvious mistake or error.see norman singer,sutherland statutory construction ed.such is the case here.the erroneous in d to a mis
