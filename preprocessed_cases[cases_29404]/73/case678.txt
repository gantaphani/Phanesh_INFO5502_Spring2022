this case is an example of how the best laid plans of mice and men can often go awry.prior to his passing,the decedent,robert lurie,planned for the bulk of his wealth to be excluded from federal estate taxes and passed through various trust instruments set up for the benefit of his wife and children.the commissioner of internal revenue,however,determined that the trusts formed for the benefit of the children,valued at approximately,should be included in lurie gross estate for tax purposes.this determination left the funds remaining in the probate estate insufficient to pay the estate tax deficiency,calculated by the tax court to be.the estate does not appeal the calculations of the tax court,but only appeals the tax court ruling that the deficiency,as well as the legal costs arising from this dispute,must be paid by the executor,ann lurie,out of the trust set up for lurie benefit,instead of out of the trusts set up for the decedent children that generated the tax deficiency.we agree with the ruling of the tax court and,therefore,affirm.
background 
the underlying facts in this case are undisputed.robert lurie decedent died on june,leaving assets worth approximately million.he was survived by his wife,ann lurie,and six children,who were minors when he died.
in may,at the start of robert lurie career,his mother created ten trusts which came to be known as the robert lurie family trusts the lf trusts.lurie had a limited power of appointment over the lf trusts,and exercised that power in february to create six new trusts,one for the sole benefit of each of his six minor children.the six new trusts received all of the assets of the lf trusts.lurie also held a power of appointment with respect to ten trusts,known as the rd trusts.lurie exercised his power of appointment over the rd trusts and created ten new trusts to succeed and receive the assets of the rd trusts.both parties and the tax court referred to the lf trusts,the rd trusts,and their successor trusts collectively as the notice trusts.
lurie created the revocable trust,of which he was both grantor and trustee,on december,three days before he executed his will.the revocable trust agreement provides that upon lurie death the assets of the revocable trust would be allocated between a marital trust and a nonmarital residuary trust.article iii of the trust instrument deals with the creation of the marital trust.specifically,the allocation provision states in relevant part 
amount of allocation to marital trust.the allocation herein to the marital trust shall have a value equal to the smallest pecuniary amount which,if allowed as a federal estate tax marital deduction,would result in the least federal estate tax being payable by reason of the grantor death,taking into account the maximum available unified credit and the credit for state death taxes,but only to the extent that those state death taxes are not thereby increased.
the residuary trust is established pursuant to section.section provides that,upon lurie death,the remainder of the trust estate not allocated to the marital trust or used for the payment of the debts and expenses of lurie estate was to be allocated into a residuary trust for the benefit of lurie and his children.
section of the revocable trust instrument provides that if the residue of the probate estate was insufficient,then any remaining expenses from the administration of his estate were to be paid from the revocable trust.in relevant part 
debts and taxes.upon the death of the grantor,the trustee shall,to the extent that the assets of the grantor estate are insufficient,pay reasonable expenses of administration of his estate all income,estate,inheritance,transfer and succession taxes,including any interest and penalties thereon,which may be assessed by reason of the grantor death,without reimbursement from the grantor executor or administrator,from any beneficiary of insurance upon the grantor life,or from any other person all such payments shall be charged first against the principal of the trust estate 
lurie executed his will on december.lurie will directs that his personal effects be distributed to his wife and that any residuary,after payment of debts,funeral expenses,costs of administration,taxes and legal expenses,be distributed to the revocable trust.the will references the revocable trust agreement and states that the trust agreement governs the administration and distribution of the residue estate which includes the payment of estate taxes and legal fees ordinarily payable from the residue estate.see section of the will of robert lurie dated december.
at lurie death,the value of his probate estate was.the value of the revocable trust at his death was.in accordance with the decedent will,his personal effects valued at were bequeathed to his wife,leaving a residuary probate estate of.after payment of funeral expenses and administrative expenses,the residue of the probate estate was distributed to the revocable trust.lurie had made gifts during his lifetime which fully absorbed the unified credit,so the nonmarital residuary trust was never formed,and the revocable trust distributed all of its assets to the marital trust for the benefit of lurie.on its federal estate tax return,the estate reported a gross estate of,which did not include the value of any of the notice trusts.the estate claimed a marital deduction in the amount of,and other deductions in the amount of,resulting in a taxable estate of zero.
upon an audit by the internal revenue service,the commissioner of internal revenue determined that the notice trusts should have been included in the decedent gross estate and,as a result,calculated a deficiency in the decedent taxable estate.the increase in the taxable estate unsurprisingly led to an estate tax deficiency,which in turn left the residual probate estate insufficient to the outstanding expenses of the estate.the estate then petitioned the tax court for a redetermination.
before the tax court,the parties eventually stipulated that the notice trusts would be included in the decedent gross estate at a total value of,but left it to the tax court to decide whether the resulting estate taxes,payable as a result of including the value of the notice trusts in the decedent gross estate,were payable from the revocable trust assets that otherwise would have gone to the marital trust,or from the notice trusts that generated the tax.in addition,the parties left it to the tax court to decide whether the legal costs associated with the audit and the ensuing litigation should be paid by the revocable trust or the notice trusts.
the tax court found that section of the revocable trust instrument provided for payment of estate taxes and legal costs if the residuary probate estate was insufficient,and that,in accordance with that provision,the estate taxes and legal costs should be paid out of revocable trust assets that otherwise would go to the marital trust.the tax court calculated the estate tax deficiency to be.

section of the internal revenue code imposes a tax on the transfer of the taxable estate of every decedent who is a citizen or resident of the united states.in computing the taxable estate,the provides for a marital deduction that permits an estate an unlimited deduction from the gross estate for the value of any property that passes from a decedent to the decedent spouse.the estate then is only required to pay estate tax on transfers not qualifying for the marital deduction,such as transfers to beneficiaries other than the surviving spouse.b.typically,the resulting estate tax is paid from property that otherwise would pass to the surviving spouse,thereby reducing the marital deduction by that amount of federal estate tax.state law contro
