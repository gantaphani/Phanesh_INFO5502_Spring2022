facts and procedural history 
a.the fee in lieu of property taxes 
fresno is a charter city.in,the voters approved a charter provision governing municipally owned utilities.section of the city charter,as adopted in and currently,requires that the city endeavor to make each municipally owned utility financially selfsustaining.it also provides that,after payment of enumerated expenses and funding of enumerated reserves,each utility shall apply all annual profits thereafter remaining to rate reductions no municipally owned utility shall be operated for the benefit of other municipal functions nor be used directly or indirectly as a general agency for the city but may pay to the city such amounts of money,in lieu of property and other taxes normally placed upon private business enterprises,as the city council may provide by ordinance most property is exempt from property taxation see cal,art.xiii.all further citations to article are to the california constitution.
beginning with a ordinance,fresno required each municipal utility to pay to the city,in lieu of property and other taxes normally placed upon private business,an amount designated by the council in a master fee resolution.fresno.the fee currently is percent of the assessed value of fixed assets of the utility department or division.we will refer to this charge by the city as the in lieu fee.
municipal utility is defined in fresno municipal code section to include not only the department of public utilities water,sewer,and solid waste divisions,but also airports,golf courses,and certain other city departments.for,the last year reflected in our record,fresno expected to generate about million for its general fund from in lieu fees paid by the municipal utilities.the record does not disclose the portion of this revenue generated by the three utility divisions directly involved in the present case,water,sewer,and solid waste disposal.
the amount paid by each utility is passed through to its customers.the overall amount of the in lieu fee is blended into the user fees in a manner not disclosed by the record,so that,for example,a water bill contains only a single amount due for service the of the in lieu fee is not separately reflected on the bill.according to the budget of fresno for the fiscal year,of which we take judicial notice,in lieu fees vary as a percentage of the utility divisions operating budgets,ranging up to percent of the water division budget and percent of the wastewater division budget.see fresno,budget,hereafter fresno budget available at as of.
proposition 
approved by the voters on november,proposition added articles xiii c and xiii d to the california constitution.article xiii d,entitled assessment and property related fee reform,addresses all assessments,fees and charges,whether imposed pursuant to state statute or local government charter authority,with certain enumerated exceptions.art.xiii d.
in relevant part,proposition uses the words fees and charges interchangeably and,usually,in combination,as fee or charge.see,art.xiii d.for convenience,we shall refer to these simply as fees.
a fee,for purposes of article xiii d,is any levy other than an ad valorem tax,a special tax,or an assessment,imposed by an agency upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership,including a user fee or charge for a property related service.art.xiii d,subd.e.property ownership is defined broadly to include tenancies of real property where tenants are directly liable to pay the fee in question.art.xiii d,subd.g.a public service is property related if it has a direct relationship to property ownership.art.xiii d,subd.h.
c.the complaint 
plaintiffs filed a complaint for declaratory relief and writ of mandate on january.the complaint focuses on fresno water,sewer,and solid waste collection services.it alleges that,in addition to the revenue collected through service rates for the recovery of costs incurred by the city in providing such services,the city also collects an additional amount it calls a fee in lieu of property tax.the complaint avers the in lieu fee is preempted by state constitutional provisions and statutes which exempt public property from property taxation,and violates state constitutional provisions and statutes which prohibit fees from exceeding the cost of providing service and prohibit the expenditure of fee revenue for purposes other than providing service.in its answer to the complaint,as relevant here,fresno contends the revenue measure at issue is valid in all respects.
d.the summary judgment motions 
plaintiffs moved for summary judgment based,primarily,on howard jarvis taxpayers city of roseville th,d hereafter jarvis roseville,which involved similar in lieu fees assessed against a city utility departments.plaintiffs motion did not distinguish between the in lieu fee itself,imposed by fresno on its utility departments,and the effect of the fee on ratepayers as the fee is recovered along with all the rest of a department budgeted costs as part of monthly utility bills.plaintiffs asserted three reasons why the fee violated article xiii d,section 
first,the fee was not required to provide the property related service and therefore exceeded the cost to provide such services.see art.xiii d,subd.b.while payment of the in lieu fee to the general fund was,in a sense,required by city ordinance,payment of the fee was not a required cost of providing utility services.
second,revenues derived from the fee were used for a purpose other than that for which the fee or charge was imposed.art.xiii d,subd.b.plaintiffs rationale was stated in the following terms utility rates are imposed for the use of utility services.the city is taking an amount of that revenue and using it for purposes other than that for which the fee or charge was imposed.
third,the fee is deposited in the general fund and,therefore,violates the requirement that no fee may be imposed for general governmental services including,but not limited to,police,fire,ambulance or library services,where the service is available to the public at large in substantially the same manner as it is to property owners.art.xiii d,subd.b.
fresno also moved for summary judgment.it contended proposition was inapplicable to fees that were not newly imposed,increased,or formally extended after the effective date of proposition.fresno asserted the in lieu fee is not imposed as an incident of property ownership.see art.xiii d,subd.e.finally,fresno argued the in lieu fee,as it impacted ratepayers,is not a fee at all but,instead,is a general tax on the consumption of utility services.as a general tax adopted by the electorate,it meets the requirements of proposition,according to fresno.see art.xiii c.
in an extensive and order,the trial court granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and denied that of fresno.quoting at length from jarvis roseville,supra,th,d,which it found controlling,the trial court concluded the in lieu fee was imposed as an incident of property ownership,that proposition covered existing fees as well as new or increased fees,and that the in lieu fee was not a general tax.
after concluding the in lieu fee was subject to the requirements of proposition,the court emphasized that article xiii d,section,subdivision b places the burden on the governmental entity to demonstrate compliance with this article in any legal action contesting the validity of a fee.the court noted that fresno had not offered any evidence or argument to show that it had complied with article xiii d instead,fresno exclusively argued that proposition or at least the portion contained in article xiii d,section was inapplicable.the court concluded the in lieu fee,exacted from ratepayers but used as general revenue,violated article xiii d in all three of the ways suggested by plaintiffs.
the court entered judgment declaring invalid fresno municipal code section insofar as it authorized the in lieu fee for water,sewer,and solid waste utilities.it enjoined fresno from collecting such a fee.
fresno filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
historical background and initial conclusions 
governmental entities are permitted to charge user fees to recover the cost of utility services.see pub.when a city decides to establish its utility departments as enterprise funds,as an accounting matter certain costs of the enterprise are attributed to it user fees seek to recover these costs.see fresno budget,supra,defining enterprise funds.
typically,however,some infrastructure costs have not been attributed to the enterprise for example,there is an added cost of repair required by the transit of garbage trucks over streets and highways.see jarvis roseville,supra,th at,d.such costs are real,even if minimal and difficult to calculate precisely.further,they are the type of expense normally paid out of a city general revenue and funded through ad valorem property taxes and sales taxes.see oneto city of fresno d.conc.opn.of gomes.
fresno charter,unlike that of los angeles,for example,prohibited it from making a profit on utility services.compare howard jarvis taxpayers city of los angeles th,d hereafter jarvis los angeles with fresno charter.nevertheless,fresno undoubtedly generated by the utility departments,but not attributed to them directly in their budgets.those costs must be covered in some manner,if not from profits from the enterprise then from some other source of revenue.see generally oneto city of fresno,supra,d at.conc.opn.of gomes.
the present in lieu fee was,apparently,a simple way for fresno to account for those city costs that were not expressly identified in the budget of the utility enterprise funds.see oneto city of fresno,supra,d at.conc.opn.of gomes.as a very rough approximation,fresno could have determined its unallocated cost for providing utility services was equivalent to the taxes paid by private business the in lieu fee could be established at the tax rate assessed such private enterprises.see ibid.and id.at.dis.opn.of brown.
before proposition,a city did not need to be too precise in accounting for all of the costs of a utility enterprise,since the city was permitted unless otherwise restricted by its charter to make a profit on its utility operations in any event and rates were permitted to reflect the value of the service,not just the cost of providing the service.see jarvis los angeles,supra,th at,d oneto city of fresno,supra,d at.
proposition changed all that with its constitutional requirement that r evenues derived from the fee or charge shall not exceed the funds required to provide the property related service.see art.xiii d,subd.b see also jarvis roseville,supra,th at,d.
cities are still entitled to recover all of their costs for utility services through user fees.jarvis roseville,supra,th at,d.the manner in which they may do so,however,is restricted by another portion of proposition the amount of a fee or charge imposed shall not exceed the proportional cost of the service attributable to the parcel.art.xiii d,subd.b.
together,subdivision b and of article xiii,section,makes it fresno wishes to recover all of its utilities costs from user it reasonably determine jarvis roseville,supra,th at,d the unbudgeted costs of utilities enterprises and that those costs be recovered through rates proportional to the cost of providing service to each parcel.undoubtedly this is a more complex process than the assessment of the in lieu fee and the blending of that fee into the rate structure.nevertheless,such a process is now required by the california constitution.the trial court correctly prohibited fresno from collecting the outdated in lieu fee.
fresno does not accept that proposition requires it to change the way it accounts for the cost of city services provided to its departments.instead,it contends utility user fees incorporating an in lieu fee component are not the type of fee addressed by proposition and that,in any event,proposition does not purport to restrict existing fees.in addition,fresno contends the in lieu fee component of utility user fees is really a general tax on consumption of utilities,not a proposition fee at all.none of these contentions has merit.
existing fees 
the limitation that revenue derived from a fee shall be used only for the purpose for which the fee was charged is contained in article xiii d,section,subdivision b.that section is entitled requirements for existing,new or increased fees and charges.italics added.the substantive portion of subdivision b does not use parallel language,however.it states that its limitations are upon a fee extended,imposed,or increased by any agency.italics added.section,subdivision d provides all fees shall comply with this section beginning july.
proposition does not define extended.government code section,subdivision e,adopted by the legislature in the wake of voter approval of proposition,provides in part that,for the purposes of article xiii d,extended,when applied to an existing tax or fee or charge,means a decision by an agency to extend the stated effective period for the tax or fee or charge,including,but not limited to,amendment or removal of a sunset provision or expiration date.thus,fresno contends,for proposition to apply to an existing fee,a governmental agency must take formal action to extend the fee.fresno contends its in lieu fee has not been extended and therefore it is not a fee for purposes of article xiii d,section.as a result,it is not one of the fees comprising all fees that are required to comply with this section.
plaintiffs contend that section,subdivision d means what it says beginning july,all fees or charges shall comply with this section.secondarily,they note that section,subdivision b expressly applies to existing fees,and fresno proposed interpretation of section would simply read that applicability out of proposition.
we agree with plaintiffs first contention.section,subdivision b requires that a city or agency that acts to extend,impose,or increase a fee after the effective date of proposition must comply with the requirements of subdivision b through.however,section,subdivision d clearly requires,in addition,that cities and other agencies conform existing fees to the requirements of subdivision b through b by the stated date of july.
this view of the unambiguous language of section,subdivision d is supported by the legislative analyst summary of proposition printed in the ballot pamphlet for the november general election.see legislature eu cal d.specifically,the measure states that all local fees must comply by july,with the following restrictions the pamphlet then summarizes the provisions of section,subdivision b through.ballot,analysis of by legislative analyst.by july,local governments would be required to reduce or repeal existing fees and assessments that do not meet the measure restrictions on fee and assessment amounts or the use of these revenues.
similarly,when the legislature considered senate bill,proposing the definitions now codified in government code section,the various committee reports on the bill all recognized that proposition applied to existing fees and assessments.for example,the assembly committee on local government report on the bill stated proposition requires that all existing,new,or increased assessments shall be in compliance with the provisions of the proposition by july.assem.com.on local government,analysis of bill reg.sess.june,see also rules,off.of floor analyses,bill reg.sess.
where the language of the proposition is clear and there is no suggestion of any conflicting voter intention,we have no authority to engraft an exception for existing fees onto the constitutional provisions adopted in proposition.
