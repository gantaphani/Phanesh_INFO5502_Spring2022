the estate of helen jameson appeals following a tax court decision assessing a deficiency against it.the estate argues that the tax court clearly erred in valuing assets of johnco,johnco,a holding company that is part of the estate.it also raises a plausible but unsustainable constitutional challenge to the estate tax as applied in this case.as we agree that the court valuations were in error,we vacate and remand for further proceedings.
this dispute arises from a series of bequests from john jameson to his wife helen jameson,and from helen to their children andrew and dinah jameson.
a.jameson bequest of johnco shares to andrew and helen.
jameson incorporated the privately held holding company johnco in.at his death in may,he owned of johnco shares as separate property.in his will,jameson bequeathed in johnco shares to andrew to fund a unified estate tax credit,directing that the shares be valued by independent appraisal as of my date of death.the remainder of jameson shares passed to his wife.
helen,the initial executrix of jameson estate,filed an estate tax return in which she reported the value of the johnco stock passing through the estate at per share.the source of this share value is unclear.this tax return was never amended.
helen died in september.northern trust bank of texas northern trust became the executor of both spouses estates.northern trust asked rauscher pierce refsnes,rauscher to appraise both estates in december.although the appraisal of jameson estate is not in the record,its conclusion that johnco shares were worth only per share at the time of his death appears in his wife estate appraisal.
northern trust used the figure to calculate that andrew was entitled to johnco shares to satisfy the he was entitled to receive under jameson will.northern trust concluded that helen received john remaining shares of johnco.had northern trust used the share value,andrew would have received shares and jameson would have received shares.
b.the family settlement agreement.
jameson left andrew and dinah equal shares of her estate.the siblings entered into a december settlement agreement family settlement agreement dividing her estate.separate counsel represented andrew and dinah during the negotiations.
the family settlement agreement assigned a value of million to jameson estate shares of johnco and gave the shares to andrew.this established an implicit per share value of.dinah received million in cash,marketable securities,and other assets.
johnco timber property.
johnco principal asset is acres of timberland in louisiana the timber property that it acquired in.the company does not harvest or transport its own timber.rather,johnco earns over of its revenue by receiving fees from companies that harvest timber on the property.the timber property gross revenues averaged roughly annually from johnco average net income over this period was.the parties stipulated that the timber property was.
northern trust commissioned an appraisal of the timber property by consultant forester george screpetis in.screpetis noted that the timber property was outstanding for timber production and opined that a buyer of the property would most likely be a company in the forest products business.
forester robert baker prepared a report on the timber property on behalf of the irs.the report stated that the timber property was extremely productive and that its best use was for timber production.commending johnco management of the property,the report predicted that private investors,pension funds,or local timber companies would be most likely to purchase it.
harold elliott,a consulting forester who had worked for the jamesons for many years,testified at trial that johnco management was interested primarily in covering expenses and not in making a big profit.elliott testified that johnco cut timber conservatively.he also testified that timber grew on the property at the rate of to a year.
the parties stipulated that,at jameson death,johnco had a basis of in the timber property and that the property was worth million.at trial,the parties disputed how the value of johnco interest in the timber property was affected by the capital gains taxes the company would incur through timber or land sales.
both parties presented expert reports and testimony on johnco fair market value given its low basis in the timber property.clyde buck,a managing director of rauscher,prepared a new appraisal on behalf of the estate new rauscher appraisal.this appraisal considered three possible scenarios for a buyer of johnco under discount rates ranging from to an immediate fire sale of the timber property a rapid but controlled sale of timber property parcels within months and ongoing operation of the timber property.
buck testified that he had no information that johnco was operating in a wasteful manner.based on the stipulation that the timber property was worth million,however,buck concluded that a buyer of johnco would realize the most income through an immediate liquidation.on the other hand,a buyer would realize the least income by far if it operated the timber property as a going concern.after subtracting the taxes that a buyer would incur by immediately selling the timber property,buck concluded that johnco interest in the property was worth only million.
john lax of arthur andersen llp also presented an appraisal on behalf of jameson estate andersen appraisal.lax estimated the debt payments a potential buyer would incur if it financed million of johnco purchase price.he concluded that johnco projected future cash flow would not cover the debt payments.he also asserted that a buyer would demand a return on equity of for a risky investment like the timber property.lax concluded that a buyer of johnco would liquidate the timber property within a year.after calculating capital gains taxes based on this conclusion,lax determined that johnco interest in the timber property was worth only million.
francis burns then testified and presented a report on behalf of the irs.burns was a principal in the financial consulting firm ipc group llc.burns argued against any capital gains discount based on an immediate liquidation of the timber property by a buyer of johnco.he stated that this discount was counterintuitive,since it assumed that an entity would purchase johnco and then immediately turn around and sell what it just purchased.
johnco tanglewood property.
johnco also owned a parcel of unimproved land in harris county,texas the tanglewood property.the parties stipulated that this property was worth at helen death,and that johnco held a basis of in it.
jameson estate did not specifically indicate that a buyer of johnco would immediately liquidate the tanglewood property,but the new rauscher appraisal incorporated the value of this property when it calculated a capital gains discount for johnco assets.thus,this appraisal assumed that a buyer of johnco would realize capital gains through an immediate sale of the tanglewood property.
e.the tax court decision.
the tax court first considered the number of johnco shares that passed to jameson estate after john bequest of in johnco shares to andrew.the court observed that the appraised share value used by helen estate managers conflicted with the share value reported on jameson estate tax return.the court also noted that the share value reduced jameson property available for a marital deduction,and it opined that jameson will intended to maximize this deduction.while noting that the appraisal of jameson estate was not in the record,the court expressed doubt about rauscher valuation methodologies.the court applied the share value and concluded that jameson estate owned johnco shares.
the tax court then turned to valuing johnco.although the court acknowledged that andrew and dinah negotiated the family settlement agreement at arm length,it refused to adopt the share value adopted in that agreement since the agreement relied on the rauscher appraisal,and the appraisal was flawed because it assumed a liquidation of the timber property.
the court then considered capital gains tax discounts for johnco assets based on the company low basis in them.it refused to apply a discount for the tanglewood property,stating that the parties had failed to address this issue.the court did decide to apply a discount for the capital gains tax liability that johnco would incur from ongoing sales of timber.it rejected a discount reflecting an immediate sale of the timber property,however,concluding that a buyer would operate the property on an ongoing basis.
the court designed a model to estimate the capital gains taxes that johnco would incur if it operated the timber property as a going concern.the parties had not presented evidence on this specific issue.the court model assumed that johnco would sell of its timber annually to follow a sustainable yield pattern and that a rate of inflation would apply.along with these assumptions,the model estimated that the timber property would realize in revenues in year one and similar revenues in later years.it applied a discount rate,within the range of the taxpayer expert estimates,and determined that the present value of capital gains taxes johnco would eventually pay is approximately.consequently,johnco interest in the timber property was worth roughly million 
based on its conclusions,the tax court found that johnco shares were worth each and assessed a deficiency against jameson estate,which has appealed.

iii.discussion 
valuation of the timber property 
the value of the johnco stock for estate tax purposes depended principally on the fair market value of the timber property at the date of helen death.the concept of fair market value represents the price that a willing buyer would pay a willing seller,if both have reasonable knowledge of the facts and neither is under compulsion.estate of bright united states,cir.the buyer and seller are hypothetical,not actual persons,and each is a rational economic actor,that is,each seeks to maximize his advantage in the context of the market that exists at the date of valuation.estate of newhouse comm r,wl.valuation is a question of fact that may be reversed only for clear error by this court.
although the parties stipulated to a fair market value of million for the timber property,they disagreed whether in valuing johnco stock,the estate was entitled to a discount because of the substantial capital gains that would be recognized as timber is harvested and sold.in johnco hands,the timber property had appreciated enormously since its original purchase,and its basis for tax purposes was.any sale of johnco stock would transfer the timber property with the capital gains liability.the estate valuation experts opined that the only sound economic strategy for a hypothetical purchaser of johnco would be to liquidate the timber property immediately and pay off the capital gains tax.the commissioner expert opined,however,that,in part due to creative alternative tax strategies to offset the tax liability,no discount should be recognized.
the tax court found neither side argument fully persuasive.contrary to the commissioner view,the court concluded that some discount for capital gains should be acknowledged based on its recent decision in estate of davis comm r,wl.estate of davis held that in determining the fair market value of closely held stock after repeal of the general utilities doctrine capital gains discounts are not precluded and are appropriate in some circumstances.id.at.the tax court also rejected the estate valuation of johnco stock,which it viewed as having been incorrectly derived from johnco income rather than its assets.the tax court found that the johnco stock is properly valued under revenue ruling,according to the fair market value of its assets.the irs has typically applied an asset approach when a closely held corporation functions as a holding company,and earnings are relatively low in comparison to the fair market value of the underlying assets.see estate of davis,at.finally,the tax court rejected the estate methodology that contemplated immediate liquidation of the timber property rather than,as the government forestry expert testified,its sound cultivation and continued management.
the court then crafted its own valuation.it accepted the parties million figure as the net asset value for the timber property,while estimating a net present value of the capital gains tax liability that will be incurred as the timber is cut.the court used assumptions furnished by the estate,a annual rate of the timber a annual inflation rate in the value of the harvest a capital gains tax rate and a discount rate.according to the court method,it would take nine years to pay off the capital gains liability.consequently,the present value of the liability,and the reduction of the fair market value,is approximately.this deduction is less than half that sought by the estate,which sought full deduction of the million capital gain liability if the timber property were to be liquidated immediately.
although the tax court was not required to credit the valuation testimony of either party,its calculations must be tied to the record and to sound and consistent economic principle.unfortunately,the court deviated from several criteria of fair market value analysis and thus clearly erred in assessing johnco stock value.first,the court should not have assumed the existence of a strategic buyer of the timber property,a buyer that most probably would continue to operate it for timber production.fair market value analysis depends instead on a hypothetical rather than an actual buyer.see reg.b estate of bright,at lefrak comm r,tcm cch.while it may well be true that the timber property best use is for sustainable yield timber production,this does not mean that the first,or economically rational,purchaser of johnco stock would so operate or lease the property.that purchaser would have to take into account the consequences of the unavoidable,substantial tax liability on the property.
relatedly,the court misplaced emphasis on a purchaser engaged in timber production led to its peremptory denial of a full discount for the accrued capital gains liability.the hypothetical willing seller test substitutes evidence of the actual owner or purchaser intent with the most economically rational analysis of a sale.see eisenberg comm r,cir vacating and remanding tax court decision because a tax liability upon liquidation or sale for capital gains was not too speculative,and such potential liability should be taken into account in valuing the stock even though no liquidation or sale of the corporation or its assets was planned at the time of valuation.if the evidence did not support an economic case for the buyer of johnco stock to engage in timber production,then the tax court discount of the capital gains liability over nine years of further production was erroneous.
such was the case here.recognizing the uncertainties inherent in the acquisition,the estate experts arrived at substantial discount rates for any hypothetical investment in the property.the tax court recognized that the discount rate represents the rate of return necessary to attract capital based on an asset overall investment characteristics.moreover,the court did not quarrel with the finding of a annual discount rate,and it applied that rate to the stream of future capital gain taxes.nevertheless,the court simultaneously recognized that no more than a gross annual rate of return would be received from the ongoing production of timber.a reasonable hypothetical investor who required a rate of return on johnco stock would not accept the timber property modest return.instead,the investor would liquidate johnco quickly and reinvest the proceeds.courts may not permit the positing of transactions which are unlikely and plainly contrary to the economic interest of a hypothetical buyer.estate of smith comm r,cir,citing eisenberg,at.the tax court internally in
