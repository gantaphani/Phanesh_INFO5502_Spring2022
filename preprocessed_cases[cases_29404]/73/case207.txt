plaintiff pro se sean mcnamee,the owner of a limited liability company or llc formed under connecticut law,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut,christopher droney,judge,rejecting his challenge to a determination by the internal revenue service irs under treasury regulations and,and,that,because of his failure to exercise his option to have his llc treated as a corporation,mcnamee was personally liable for the llc employment tax liabilities.mcnamee alleged principally that the treasury regulations,and hence the irs determination,were contrary a to state law treating an llc and its members as separate entities,and b to provisions of the internal revenue code or code.the district court,concluding that the treasury regulations were both consistent with the code and reasonable,ruled in favor of the government.on appeal,mcnamee pursues his contentions that the regulations are invalid because they contravene state law and the federal statutory scheme.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
background 
the material facts appear to be undisputed.mcnamee was the sole proprietor of an unincorporated accounting firm,mcnamee company llc,a connecticut limited liability company that ceased operation in march.employed an average of six persons.
the internal revenue code imposes two forms of employment tax obligations on an employer hereinafter payroll taxes.first,the employer is required to pay unemployment taxes,see,and to make contributions to its employees and medicare benefits pursuant to the federal insurance contributions act fica,see id.second,the employer is required to withhold from employee compensation and remit to the government a employee income taxes,see id,and b the employees own mandated fica contributions,see id,b.with respect to the third and fourth quarters of and all four quarters of,made no payment of any of the required payroll taxes.
the code recognizes a variety of business corporations,companies,associations,partnerships,sole proprietorships,and,based on the classifications,treats the entities in various ways for income tax purposes.for example,the income of a corporate entity is generally subject to a double wave of taxation,in that the corporation is taxed directly,see a,and its individual shareholders are further taxed on dividends paid to them out of the corporation income,see id.a.in contrast,an unincorporated sole proprietorship that is treated as such is taxed only once the owner simply lists his business income on schedule c of his individual tax return the proprietorship entity is not directly taxed,see generally id.a b.
as discussed in greater detail in part ii below,the code definitions of various types of business entities are broad,and to some extent they overlap one another.see a.in an attempt to eliminate ambiguity,the treasury regulations instruct that certain entities must be classified as corporations,see b,while other entities are permitted to decide for themselves whether or not to be treated as corporations,see id.thus,an entity whose classification as a corporation is not required referred to in the regulations as an eligible entity,and which has only one owner,has the option of being classified either as an association which is defined in b as a as a sole proprietorship that is to be disregarded as an entity separate from its owner,id.a.
an eligible entity exercises that option simply by filing irs form,entitled entity classification election,having checked the appropriate box on the form.see id.c the regulation.in the absence of such an election,an eligible entity that has only one owner is disregarded as a separate entity.see id.b.
mcnamee llc,was not required to be classified as a corporation,and mcnamee elected not to have it treated as one.thus,under the treasury regulations,was disregarded as a separate entity and was treated as a sole proprietorship.unpaid payroll taxes for and totaled.the irs,having disregarded as a separate entity,assessed those taxes against mcnamee personally and placed a lien on his property.
mcnamee filed a timely administrative appeal.he did not dispute liability for the unpaid.however,pointing to sections of connecticut law providing that members of an llc are not personally liable for the debts of the llc,see.ann.west,he argued that the irs did not have the authority to unilaterally pierce the corporate veil of an llc simple sic by looking at how it reports it sic income,and that the irs application of the regulation was therefore in direct conflict with the right of an llc member.mcnamee request for a collection due process hearing.
in a notice of determination concerning collection action s under section,dated october,irs determination,the irs appeals office rejected mcnamee appeal.the unpaginated explanatory attachment irs determination attachment stated that the irs review confirmed that was set up as a single member llc,and that you,as the single member,did not elect association status irs determination attachment,first page.after discussing the pertinent treasury regulations,the irs concluded that,t herefore,the llc has been disregarded as an entity separate from you.you,as the single member owner,are personally liable for the employment tax debt of the llc id.third page.the irs also noted that,while the administrative appeal was pending,mcnamee had terminated the existence of see id.first page,and that he offered no alternative means of collecting the amount due see id.third page.
mcnamee brought the present action in the district court pursuant to,inter alia,and,seeking review of the irs administrative determination.he principally reiterated his contentions that the irs had no authority to disregard the protection from liability afforded to members of an llc by connecticut law and thereby hold him responsible for tax liabilities.he also contended that the regulations relied on by the irs conflicted with provisions of the internal revenue code.
mcnamee moved for summary judgment in his favor.the government moved for affirmance of its determination that mcnamee is liable for unpaid payroll taxes.the district court summarily denied mcnamee motion and granted the irs motion,find ing that the regulations at issue here were both reasonable and consistent with the purposes of the revenue statutes.ruling on pending motions,dated september,at.
judgment was entered in favor of the government,and this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,mcnamee argues principally that the regulations directly contradict the relevant statutory provisions of the internal revenue code mcnamee brief on appeal at,violate federal policy,and ignore the limited liability laws created by local legislation,id.at.he also argues that an irs proposal in october to amend the relieve the owner of a llc from any possibility of personal liability for the llc payroll tax that the current regulation is wrong id.at.finding no merit in any of mcnamee contentions,we affirm.
a.the validity of the treasury regulations 
the standard of review 
in reviewing a challenge to an agency regulation interpreting a federal statute that the agency is charged with administering,the first duty of the courts is to determine whether the statute plain terms directly addres s the precise question at issue.national cable telecommunications ass brand x internet services,d national cable quoting chevron natural resources defense council,d.if the statute is ambiguous on the point,we defer to the agency interpretation so long as the construction is a reasonable policy choice for the agency to make.national cable,at.quoting chevron,at.as stated in chevron itself,
f irst,always,is the question whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.if,however,the court determines congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute,as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation.rather,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.

if congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill,there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation,and s uch legislative regulations are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at.see also united states mead,d administrative implementation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for chevron deference when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.
in the internal revenue code,congress expressly delegated authority to the secretary of the treasury to adopt regulations to fill in gaps in the code 
rules and regulations 
a authorization 
except where such authority is expressly given by this title to any person other than an officer or employee of the treasury department,the secretary shall prescribe all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement of this title,including all rules and regulations as may be necessary by reason of any alteration of law in relation to internal revenue.
d manner of making elections prescribed by secretary 
except to the extent otherwise provided by this title,any election under this title shall be made at such time and in such manner as the secretary shall prescribe.
a and d emphasis added see also a b the term secretary means the secretary of the treasury or his delegate.with respect to the promulgation of regulations interpreting the code,the secretary of the treasury has delegated authority to the commissioner of internal revenue commissioner.see.because congress has delegated to the commissioner the power to promulgate all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement of the internal revenue code,a,we must defer to his regulatory interpretations of the code so long as they are reasonable,see national muffler dealers,united states.cottage savings ass commissioner of internal revenue,d.
the relevant provisions of the code 
the internal revenue code sets out d efinitions of various types of business entities in the first three subsections of a,under the headings person s,partnership s,and corporation s.as an examination of these provisions reveals,the categories are overlapping and somewhat ambiguous 
a when used in this title,where not otherwise distinctly expressed or manifestly incompatible with the intent thereof 
the term person shall be construed to mean and include an individual,a trust,estate,partnership,association,company or corporation.
partnership 
the term partnership includes a syndicate,group,pool,joint venture,or other unincorporated organization,through or by means of which any business,financial operation,or venture is carried on,and which is not,within the meaning of this title,a trust or estate or a corporation 
corporation 
the term corporation includes associations 
a,and emphases added.thus,each subsection tends to be illustrative,rather than definitive,and none of them specifies the characteristics of the entity that it defin es.
potential overlap among definitions is evident from the lack of even illustrative definitional entries of such terms as company and association.for example,a company could be deemed a partnership within the meaning of subsection a if it is an unincorporated organization but it is a corporation within the meaning of subsection a if it is an association.however,the code contains no definition of the term association.it does,however,define the term shareholder to include a member in an association.id.a.sole proprietorships are nowhere defined in the code,although the existence of such a business form is recognized,see,b f iii relating to net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks.
limited liability companies are not expressly mentioned,much less defined,in the code.although an llc might be considered a company or an association,its proper characterization is not clear from the terms of the code itself.limited liability companies are a relatively new business structure allowed by state statute,having some features of corporations and some features of partnerships.irs publication,tax issues for limited liability companies,available at.gov businesses small article,id.html irs pub.for example,similar to a corporation,owners have limited personal liability for the debts and actions of the llc.see.ann.other features of llcs are more like a partnership,providing management flexibility,irs pub.see.ann.execution of documents,agency,management,and in some cases affording the benefit of taxation,irs pub.but see.ann.a limited liability company formed under sections to shall be treated,for purposes of taxes imposed by the laws of the state or any political subdivision thereof,in accordance with the classification for federal tax purposes.emphases added.
under connecticut law,a limited liability company may have a single member.see,id,c.the internal revenue code is unclear as to whether such a company falls within subsection a or a of.it hardly seems to be a subsection a association,as one person does not associate with himself.nor is a operation in the same genre as the specific subsection a entities that are included within the term partnership,syndicate,group,pool,joint venture all of which,like the term partnership itself,denote combinations of persons rather than a single person,see.ann.partnership means an association of two or more persons.the closest fit for a llc would seem to be other unincorporated organization an organization that might or might not be an entity separate from its owner.
the treasury regulations 
against this ambiguous statutory background,the treasury regulations were intended to provide straightforward guidance as to how various types of entities,including businesses,are to be classified for tax purposes.treasury regulation states i n general that 
t he internal revenue code prescribes the classification of various organizations for federal tax purposes.whether an organization is an entity separate from its owners for federal tax purposes is a matter of federal tax law and does not depend on whether the organization is recognized as an entity under local law.
single owner organizations.under and,certain organizations that have a single owner can choose to be recognized or disregarded as entities separate from their owners.
a and emphases added.the regulations proceed to describe the classification of business entities 
a business entities.for purposes of this section and,a business entity is any entity recognized for federal tax purposes including an entity with a single owner that may be disregarded as an entity separate from its owner under that is not properly classified as a trust under or otherwise subject to special treatment under the internal revenue code.a business entity with two or more members is classified for federal tax purposes as either a corporation or a partnership.a business entity with only one owner is classified as a corporation or is disregarded if the entity is disregarded,its activities are treated in the same manner as a sole proprietorship,branch,or division of the owner.
a emphases added.subsection b of this regulation defines the term corporation to include a business entity that is incorporated under federal or state law,see id.b,an association as determined under,id.b emphasis added,and various other business entities,see id.b,and.
subsection c of treasury regulation states in pertinent part,with regard to o ther business entities,that f or federal tax purposes,
the term partnership means a business entity that is not a corporation under paragraph b of this section and that has at least two members.
wholly owned entities i in general.a business entity that has a single owner and is not a corporation under paragraph b of this section is disregarded as an entity separate from its own
