several consumers brought actions contesting imposition of sales and use taxes on optional service contracts sold with computers.in this action,plaintiffs sued dell for unfair and deceptive business practices for collecting tax on the service contracts,and dell against the california state board of equalization sbe for a refund of the disputed taxes dell remitted to the tax agency bus.the parties agreed to a bench trial on the discrete issue of whether the sales of service contracts to plaintiffs were subject to california sales or use tax.the trial court concluded that the sales were not subject to tax.dell and the other defendants petitioned this court for a writ of mandate.defendants asked us to review and to reverse the trial court decision.
we have reviewed the decision and,following briefing and oral argument,conclude that the trial court correctly found that the sales were not taxable.california taxes the retail sale and use of tangible personal property but not the sale or use of intangible personal property or the performance of services.dell and sbe concede that optional service contracts are not tangible personal property and are generally exempt from taxation.dell and sbe claim that taxation of dell service contracts is nevertheless proper because dell sells its computers and service contracts for a single price,without a separate statement on the invoice of the charge for the service contract we reject the claim.
while dell computers and service contracts are sold concurrently for an aggregate price,they are distinct consumer items and each is a significant object of the transaction.dell service contracts have readily ascertainable values,even without itemized invoices.accordingly,sbe can not decree that the exclusive means to establish a tax exemption for an optional service contract sold together with a taxable product is that its value be separately stated on the retailer invoice,absent a statute,regulation,or consistent administrative interpretation of the laws mandating a separate statement of value.
dell sells computer systems and services to individuals,businesses,and governmental agencies.dell operates on a business model,rather than through traditional retail outlets.customers primarily order products directly from dell by telephone,over an internet website,or by other direct means.dell products are marketed in various packages,which consist of hardware,software,a warranty,and a service contract.each configuration bears a single,price the components are itemized but not separately priced.the customer has the option of changing the configuration of a package by switching hardware,software,or service contract components in exchange for an increase or decrease in the price.the price effect of such changes is identified in dell advertising or interactive computer screens in the format of add an x for y or delete the x and reduce the package price by y or substitute an x for the z for a price change of for example,add an extended service contract for,or substitute a gigabyte hard drive with a gigabyte hard drive for an additional.after the changes to the package configuration are selected,the revised package price is stated to the customer without a breakdown of individual prices for the various components.
the statement of the purchase price to the customer is either an acknowledgement of the purchase if the customer pays in full at the time of the order,or an invoice if money is due.an invoice or acknowledgement identifies the computer components and states the total sales price for the aggregate of the components selected by the customer.the invoices and acknowledgements generally do not list separate unit prices for the computer various components,memory,hard drive,monitor,service contract.internally,dell does assign unit prices to many of the computer systems components.those unit prices appear,among other places,in price lists and dell computerized record database.
computer systems sold by dell are warranted at no additional cost to the customer.the warranties cover defects in materials and workmanship in products.the warranties are return to facility warranties requiring the consumer to return the defective product or part to dell for repair or replacement.computer systems sold by dell also typically include computer service contracts.many such service contracts provide for the dispatch of an repair technician,while others provide for repair or replacement within certain time frames.
a standard service contract is included in every initial package the package before the customer customizes its configuration.a customer can eliminate this standard service contract from the package and receive a reduction of the purchase price.extended service contracts are available that vary in duration,coverage and benefits.the selection of an extended service contract will have a varying effect on the price based upon the contract duration and other terms.it is not necessary that any of these extended service contracts be included in order for a customer to purchase a package of hardware,software,and basic warranty.dell internal price list specifies a particular dollar figure for each type of standard and extended service contract.on every invoiced sale,dell keeps records showing a separate and exact amount for the service contract.
on may,plaintiff diane mohan purchased a computer package from dell.dell option selection catalog,which was available to customers,stated that the service contract could be upgraded from one to three years for an additional over the basic package price.mohan upgraded the basic service contract to three years.the service contract would be performed by a third party corporation,defendant banctec.dell sells these third party service contracts as an agent of banctec.dell internal product price allocation for the aggregate service contract basic plus a extension was.the invoice for the mohan package stated a price of plus a shipping charge.the customer invoice did not specify an itemized price for the service contract.at the time of the mohan transaction,dell was not registered with the state to collect sales and use tax on its own sales to california purchasers.however,banctec was a registered seller in california and dell collected sales and use tax on banctec behalf.the dell invoice stated a taxable amount of dell internal valuation of the service contract and a tax of.the amount stated for the tax was paid and remitted to sbe,as the state tax collection agency.
on october,plaintiff demarco enterprises,demarco purchased a computer package from dell that included a service contract and gold technical support,which is a technical support contract.dell,not a third party,was the service provider on the demarco service contract.the invoice to demarco stated a price of,without a separate price for the contracts for service and technical support.demarco was taxed on the entire invoice price,which amount was remitted to sbe.
ii.procedural history 
this action is one of three consumer actions coordinated in the trial court for resolution cal.rules of court,rule.one of the other actions was voluntarily dismissed,and the other was dismissed following demurrer.we recently affirmed the latter dismissal.computer service tax cases,nonpub.opn,wl.
this action was initiated in april.the operative third amended complaint by plaintiffs mohan and demarco states four causes of action unlawful competition and deceptive practices in the sale of consumer goods,unfair business practices bus,fraud and intentional misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation.plaintiffs want the action certified as a class action and seek equitable relief,including an order adjudging dell service contracts intangible property exempt from any california sales or use tax.plaintiffs also ask that defendants be enjoined from further charging and collecting from california residents a purported tax on the purchase of optional service contracts.additionally,plaintiffs seek restitution,damages,and attorney fees.
defendants filed a against sbe.defendants assert their belief that plaintiffs claims are meritless but,to account for the possibility that the court could agree with plaintiffs and grant plaintiffs relief,defendants against sbe to recover taxes collected from plaintiffs and others similarly situated and remitted to sbe.defendants operative first amended alleges eight causes of action for refund of use taxes paid refund of sales taxes paid indemnity equitable indemnity or partial equitable indemnity involuntary trust unjust enrichment money paid and money had and received.
in an effort to streamline resolution of the action,the parties stipulated to a bifurcated trial on the taxability of dell service contracts.the parties agreed to a bench trial on the discrete issue of whether the sale by one or more of the retailer defendants of a service contract to mohan in may,or to demarco in october,was subject to california sales or use tax.
in june,the trial court issued its ruling and statement of decision on the taxability issue.the court found that all of the service contracts standard and extended are optional.the court further found that the service contracts are intangible property,rights to future labor for repair or maintenance.as intangible property,the purchase of a service contract is neither a sale nor a use of property subject to taxation.the trial court considered sbe and dell reliance on the separate statement rule,under which sales and use tax will be charged on all items in a bundled transaction unless the price for any component is separately stated.the court found the rule consistent with common sense and common practice within and beyond california,but inconsistent with the relevant tax statutes which do not contain a separate statement rule covering computer service contracts.the court concluded that service contracts of the two plaintiffs herein were not subject to california sales use taxes.after ruling on the taxability issue,the trial court entered an order stating that appellate review of its statement of decision through a writ proceeding will materially advance the conclusion of this complex litigation.code civ.
dell filed a petition for a writ of mandate in this court asking us to review and to reverse the trial court decision.on august,we issued an alternative writ directing the trial court to show cause why the petition should not be granted.real parties in interest,sbe and plaintiffs,filed briefs responsive to the petition,and dell filed a reply brief.oral argument was heard and the matter submitted for decision.
iii.discussion 
california applies sales and use tax to tangible personal property but not to intangible property and services,all further section references are to this code,except as noted.dell computers are taxable tangible personal property.service contracts are nontaxable intangible property or services.the question presented here is whether a mixed sale in which a dell computer and service contract sold at the same time,for a single undifferentiated price on the invoice,is wholly taxable as dell and sbe claim or only partially taxable as plaintiffs claim.we conclude that the transaction is only partially computer is taxed and the service contract is not taxed.a service contract for a dell computer is a distinct and separately identifiable component of the transaction entitled to individual tax treatment.guiding principles of tax law lay the path to that conclusion.

taxable transactions under california law 
california law imposes a tax on the retail sale of tangible personal property,but not on the sale of intangible personal property or on the performance of services see.of these three concepts,only tangible personal property is defined by statute.it means personal property which may be seen,weighed,measured,felt,or touched,or which is in any other manner perceptible to the senses.although there appears to be no comprehensive definition of intangible property citation,such property is generally defined as property that is a right rather than a physical object the third concept,service,has been defined by the california supreme court as the performance of labor for the benefit of another.navistar internat.transportation state bd.of equalization cal th,d,navistar.
the taxation of bundled and mixed transactions 
drawing the line between taxable sales of tangible property and nontaxable sales of services or intangibles is sometimes difficult,especially where property that was largely created by personal services is transferred.hellerstein,state taxation ed.where services and tangible property are inseparably bundled together,determination of the taxability of the transaction turns upon whether the purchaser true object was to obtain the finished product or the service,tit,navistar,supra,cal th at,d,california state bd.of equalization advance schools,advance schools applying california law.
as an example,the true object in purchasing a sculpture is acquisition of the finished product,and thus the transaction is taxable without reduction for the service embodied in the product,tit.in contrast,the true object in purchasing tax advice is the performance of a service,so the entire transaction is not taxable despite the incidental furnishing of forms,binders or other tangible property.ibid.in culligan water conditioning.state bd.of equalization cal d,the court held that the true object of a water conditioning which water softening equipment is attached to a customer home plumbing and periodically the furnishing of the tangible equipment which,by itself and without requiring any performance of human labor,softens the water.
the above examples involve bundled transactions in which goods and services are inextricably intertwined in a single sale.hellerstein,state taxation,supra,c.for bundled transactions of goods and services,the true object test applies and the entire transaction is generally taxed or not taxed as a whole,tit,advance schools,supra,at.in bundled transactions where the purchaser true object is to obtain a finished product and services are incidental,services may be considered part of the sale of tangible property and thus subject to sales or use tax,subd.b,subd.b see rylander san antonio smsa,rylander court considers essence of transaction to determine whether service is part of sale of bundled goods.

california views sales of tangible property bundled with intangibles,rather than services,differently.the regulatory true object test,by its terms,applies only to transactions involving the performance of a service.preston state bd.of equalization,supra,cal th,d.the california supreme court has thus rejected the position that a transfer of tangible property is not taxable if the transfer is incidental to the transfer of intangible property.navistar,supra,cal th at,d,in navistar,the court held that the transfer of drawings and designs embodying technology for the manufacture of industrial turbine engines was taxable even if the principal object of the sale was to transfer the intangible or intellectual content embodied in the documents.navistar,supra,at,d.navistar did not articulate the precise manner for determining the taxation of concurrent transfers of tangible and intangible property.hellerstein,state taxation,supra.however,the court holding that documents containing intangible trade secrets were fully taxable as a sale of tangible property was based in part on the absence of a separate and distinct transfer of an intangible property right.preston state bd.of equalization,supra,at,d,discussing navistar,supra,at,d.in short,the court was concerned with a truly bundled transaction in which taxable and nontaxable items were inextricably intertwined.
bundled transactions are distinguishable from transactions in which goods and services are sold together yet are readily mixed transactions.advance schools,supra,at rylander,supra,at hellerstein,state taxation,supra,a iv.one respected commentator has stated that a mixed transaction involving separately identifiable transfers of goods and services can and should be distinguished from a bundled transaction involving goods and services that are inextricably intertwined in a single sale.hellerstein,state taxation,supra,c a iv.
unlike bundled transactions,the goods and services in a mixed transaction are distinct not intertwined and each is a significant object of the transaction not one incidental to the other.rylander,supra,at.in mixed transactions,the separate elements of the transaction are analyzed as separate transactions for tax purposes.id.at.the tangible property aspect of the transaction is taxed and the service aspect of the transaction is not taxed.ibid.
several examples of mixed transactions are illustrative.in overly state bd.of equalization d,the court found that a contract for steel door frames and doors was divisible into taxable tangible property the manufactured frames and nontaxable services installation of the doors.the court noted the dual nature of the contract,which supplied products and provided separate services,and contrasted the transaction from those where an entire bundled transaction is taxable because service is incidental to the sale of goods.id.at.
in advance schools,an correspondence school provided california students with both educational services and lesson materials in the form of books,printed lessons,training kits,and tools.advance schools,supra,at.the school charged a single tuition fee,with no separate charge for the lesson materials.ibid.the court held the school liable for use taxes on that portion of the tuition attributable to the sale of the lesson materials.id.at.the court rejected the school argument that the entire transaction was not taxable because a student true object in paying tuition was to obtain educational services.id.at.
the federal bankruptcy court in advance schools noted that california recognizes three possible situations with regard to mixed sales of services and property.advance schools,supra,at see in re los angeles internat.airport hotel associates,approving advance schools analysis.first,tangible property is the primary item or true object of the transaction,in which case tax applies to the entire sales price.advance schools,supra.second,service is the primary item or true object of the transaction,in which case no tax applies to the transaction.ibid.third is the truly mixed transaction,where property and services are distinct and consequential elements of the transaction,in which case the transaction is severable into its taxable and nontaxable components.ibid.the school reliance on the true object test was misplaced because that test applies only to the first two described situations where services rendered are inseparable from the property transferred.id.at.the court found the lesson materials provided by the school to be separate from the educational services,and both the materials and services significant aspects of the transaction.id.at.the court severed the transaction for tax purposes,and allocated tax upon the market price of the materials.id.at.
a texas appellate court likewise allocated taxes to telecommunications equipment separate from engineering services sold on a single invoice in rylander,supra,at.the tax agency assessed sales tax on the entire transaction upon the contention that the engineering services were a part of the sale of the telecommunications equipment.id.at.texas,like california,considers the ultimate object of the sale in determining whether a nontaxable service bundled with a taxable sale of goods is a part of the sale and thus taxable.id.at.in accord with the advance schools court that applied california law,the texas court of appeal discerned three categories of transactions the real object of the transaction is the purchase of tangible property and services are incidental all taxable the real object is the purchase of services and the property is incidental all nontaxable and the real object is both services and property and the two elements are distinct and identifiable property alone taxable.id.at.the court held that the engineering services were readily separable from the purchase of equipment and thus not a part of the sale of tangible personal property and consequently not subject to sales tax.id.at see new england.clark,clark readily separable services not taxed as part of sale of telecommunications equipment 
the taxation of warranties and service contracts 
a warranty may be defined as a written statement arising out of a sale to the consumer of a consumer good pursuant to which the manufacturer,distributor,or retailer undertakes to preserve or maintain the utility or performance of the consumer good or provide compensation if there is a failure in utility or performance,subd.a.a service contract generally means a contract in writing to perform,for an additional cost,over a fixed period of time or for a specified duration,services relating to the maintenance,replacement,or repair of a consumer product,subd.o.
an express warranty is both a representation of fitness and an agreement to repair.gavaldon daimlerchrysler cal th,d.a service contract is an agreement to repair.ibid.both warranties and service contracts generally obligate the seller to furnish parts,materials,and labor necessary to maintain a consumer product for a specified period of time,subd.o,subd.a,subd.b,tit,subd.b b,subd.c.warranties and service contracts may be mandatory or optional.they are mandatory when the buyer,as a condition of the sale,is required to purchase the warranty or service contract from the seller,tit,subd.a a,subd.c.a warranty or service contract is optional when the buyer is not required to purchase the warranty or service contract from the seller,the buyer is free to contract with anyone he or she chooses.ibid.

optional warranties receive different tax treatment.most of the states with sales tax,including california,do not tax optional warranties,tit,subd.c state bd.of equalization,bus.taxes law guide,sales use tax annots.annot.all further annotation citations are to this guide hellerstein,state taxation,supra,b i,blatt,when are warranties and service contracts subject to sales tax,supra,cch state tax review,at.a manufacturer who provides replacement parts to fulfill its optional warranty obligations pays tax on the parts as a consumer of the parts furnished,tit,subd.b c,subd.c.
a number of states tax repair services but do not tax optional warranties on the theory that an optional warranty constitutes the purchase of an intangible right,not the purchase of services p erforming repair services does not include the act of entering into a contractual commitment to provide in the future and on a contingent basis repair services.covington pike toyota,cardwell,see generally hellerstein,state taxation,supra,b i.other states that tax repair services have construed optional warranties as a purchase of taxable services,south central utah,auditing div.of the utah state tax comm.utah.california has had no need to conclusively classify optional warranties as either intangibles or services because neither is taxable here.thus,it has been sufficient for california taxing authorities to state that a contract for optional computer hardware maintenance is not a contract for the sale of tangible personal property and no sales or use tax applies to the charge.annot.
the taxation of dell service contracts 
dell computers are warranted against defects in materials and workmanship for a specified period of time,at no additional cost to the consumer.the warranties are return to facility warranties requiring the consumer to mail the defective product or part to dell for repair or replacement.at issue here are optional warranties that extend the basic warranty for a longer period of time,and optional service contracts that provide computer repair by a service technician 
sbe concedes that dell service contracts are optional and,if sold alone,are not taxable.sbe also concedes that dell service contracts,if sold with computers,are not taxable provided that the charge for the service contract is separately stated on the sales invoice or other contract of sale.it is sbe position that the absence of a separate statement of the charge for optional service contracts render them taxable.while sbe interpretation of the laws it enforces is entitled to consideration,the ultimate resolution of legal questions rests with the courts.yamaha corporation of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,yamaha culligan water conditioning state bd.of equalization,supra,cal d at.we respect sbe interpretation of the tax laws as applied to the dell transactions but we can not endorse it.
the fundamental starting point is the recognition that california imposes a tax on the retail sale or use of tangible personal property,but not on the sale or use of intangible personal property or services.navistar,supra,cal th at,d.dell service contracts are not tangible personal property,as all the parties agree.the parties debate only whether dell service contracts are properly classified as services as dell and sbe argue or intangible property as plaintiffs argue.as dell observes,classification is difficult because the service contracts share characteristics of each the contracts provide an apparent service of telephone technical support,and an arguably intangible right to future repair.resolution of the classification debate is unnecessary here because neither services nor intangibles are taxable.
sbe concedes that service contracts generally are not taxable and justifies its taxation of dell service contracts on the fact that the service contracts are sold without a separate statement of the value of the contracts on the sales invoice.it is the bundled sale of computers tangible personal property with service contracts intangibles or services that render the latter taxable,according to sbe.dell and plaintiffs likewise construe the subject transactions as bundled sales of taxable and nontaxable items.in this respect,all parties err,and that error has misdirected the analysis of the taxation issue.
the subject transactions are not bundled sales,but rather mixed transactions.as noted above,a mixed transaction involving separately identifiable transfers of goods and services can and should be distinguished from a bundled transaction involving goods and services that are inextricably intertwined in a single sale.hellerstein,state taxation,supra,c a iv.so,too,is a mixed transaction involving separately identifiable transfers of tangible and intangible property distinguishable from a bundled sale of intertwined property.dell sale of computers with service contracts is not,properly speaking,a bundled sale.
the service contracts are readily separable from the computers dell sells.dell,for marketing purposes,presents particular product configurations to its customers but these configurations are not fixed.dell proudly advertises at dell,you can your dream system from the ground up.as a dell tax manager explained in her declaration submitted at trial dell typically offer s to their customers various models of computer systems.each different model is often available in a basic configuration of computer components which may include,for example,a microprocessor,memory,hard drive,monitor,warranty,service contract,sold for a single,total price for the basic configuration.dell customers typically have the option to customize a computer model by upgrading or downgrading various computer components in exchange for an increase or decrease in the single,total price for the customer order.
customization includes a customer option to purchase a computer without a service contract in exchange for a reduction in the overall price for the customer order.the variability of the sales price based on the customer selection of items to include or exclude from the basic product configuration shows that the sale is not an intertwined,bundled transaction.as the drafters of a proposed uniform state tax law recognize,a bundled transaction does not include the sale of any products in which the sales price varies,or is negotiable,based on the selection by the purchasers of the products included in the transaction.hellerstein,state taxation,supra,a iv,quoting the streamlined sales and use tax agreement,app.c,pt.i.
it is also clear that the computer and service contract are each significant aspects of the transaction,and not one incidental to the other.dell touts its service,as well as its computer equipment,and the cost of service contracts is far from de minimus.in plaintiff mohan purchase of a computer and service contract,for example,the service contract was valued at over percent of the total price of the transaction.in advance schools,supra,at,where the court severed tuition paid for nontaxable education services from taxable lesson materials,the court found that materials valued at close to percent of the total tuition charged could not be deemed an insignificant aspect of the transaction.
we conclude that the proper approach under california law is to tax the computer tangible personal property and not the service contract service or intangible property.as other courts have recognized,when there is a fixed and an ascertainable relationship between the value of the article and the value of the services rendered,and each is a consequential element capable of a separate and distinct transaction,then the elements must be analyzed as separate transactions for tax purposes.clark,supra,at.
dell service contracts are not a part of the sale of computers 
sbe correctly observes that the total taxable amount for which property is sold includes a ny services that are a part of the sale,subd.b,subd.b.we will assume,for purposes of argument,that sbe is also correct in classifying dell service contracts as services rather than intangible personal property.but we can not accept sbe assertion that dell service contracts are a part of the sale of computers.as we noted above,it is with intertwined bundled transactions,where the purchaser true object is to obtain a finished product and services are incidental,where services may be considered part of the sale of tangible property and thus subject to sales or use tax,subd.b,subd.b,tit,culligan water conditioning state bd.of equalization,supra,cal d at,rylander,supra,at.dell sale of service contracts with computers is not an intertwined bundled transaction.computers may be purchased without service contracts,and the transaction price is reduced by a specified sum if the service contract is declined.dell service contracts are not part of the sale of computers,but a separate object of the transaction at a readily ascertainable value.
dell service contracts are not taxable even without separate invoicing 
sbe and dell maintain that it is proper to treat dell service contracts as taxable because the value of the contracts is not separately stated on an invoice.sbe contends that,in a concurrent sale of tangible personal property and services,the generally nontaxable service element is taxable unless its purchase is optional and its value is separately stated on an invoice.sbe and dell present the separate statement rule as a general principle or general rule in sales and use tax administration,and argue that it should be upheld because it promotes the efficient administration of the tax code.
while tax administrators may properly apply the separate statement rule in a number of contexts,this is not one of them.the primary sources of the separate statement rule are tax statutes that expressly require separately stated charges.in california,the sales price of tangible personal property,upon which tax is imposed,is defined to exclude s eparately stated charges for transportation,subd.c.other states statutorily exclude various charges from taxation if separately stated or identified.tax code ann.see generally hellerstein,state taxation,supra,quoting the streamlined sales and use tax agreement definition of sales price.as sbe conceded at trial,there is no california statute or regulation that requires service contract charges to be separately stated to avoid taxation.
another alleged source of the separate statement rule is the administrative enforcement of statutes carrying a presumption of taxability.t he burden of proof concerning the right to a tax exemption is on the taxpayer because the taxpayer is in the best position to create and maintain records of his transactions and to destroy or conceal such records.pope state bd.of equalization d.when property and services are purchased together,separate invoices or separate itemization on the same invoice are useful in meeting the taxpayer evidentiary burden of proving tax exemption for the service item in the transaction.in many transactions,separate itemization may be the only practical means of proof.but no statute or regulation demands a separate statement of a service contract value on an invoice as the exclusive means of meeting the taxpayer evidentiary burden.in the unusual situation presented here,the value of dell service contracts is readily ascertainable without an itemized invoice,as discussed above.
sbe maintains,however,that it has reasonably and consistently interpreted the tax laws to require that the value of services be separately stated on an invoice to avoid taxation where,as here,services are sold concurrently with tangible personal property.sbe says it may insist upon an itemized invoice as the only acceptable proof of a service value and tax exemption,and that its interpretation of tax laws to require an invoice with a separately stated value for services is entitled to judicial deference.the presumption of taxability was the express basis for sbe reliance on the separate statement rule in the trial court.on appeal,sbe says the separate statement rule is implicit in provisions assessing tax on services that are part of the sale of tangible personal property,subd.b,subd.b.we do not understand sbe to argue that the form of invoicing dictates the taxability of services a service is or is not a part of taxable property depending on whether the service is separately priced but to argue for a presumption of taxability a separate statement of value is necessary for sbe to determine whether a service contract is optional,and thus not taxable,as sbe phrases the point on appeal.as sbe expressed the point at trial,t he separately stated requirement is an evidentiary rule that allows the parties to the transaction,and sbe,to determine easily whether the service is or is not part of the sale of the tangible property.
dell supports sbe reliance on the separate statement rule,and maintains that sbe routinely uses such a rule to determine the taxability of services sold with tangible property.both sbe and dell rely on a series of tax annotations to support their claim of a consistent administrative construction of the tax laws to require that the value of services sold with property be separately stated on an invoice.
tax annotations are summaries of opinions by sbe attorneys of the business tax effects of a wide range of transactions.yamaha,supra,cal th at,d.t he summaries are prompted by actual requests for legal opinions by the board,its field auditors,and businesses subject to statutes within its jurisdiction.the annotations are brief a sentence or to state definitively the tax consequences of specific hypothetical business transactions.id.at,d.annotations do not have the force and effect of law,tit,subd.a.
the california supreme court has considered what legal effect courts must give to the board annotations when they are relied on as supporting its position in taxpayer litigation.yamaha,supra,cal th at,d.the court concluded that a n agency interpretation of the meaning and legal effect of a statute is entitled to consideration and respect by the courts however,unlike regulations adopted by an agency to which the legislature had confided the power to make law,and which,if authorized by the enabling legislation,bind this and other courts as firmly as statutes themselves,the binding power of an agency interpretation of a statute or regulation is contextual its power to persuade is both circumstantial and dependent on the presence or absence of factors that support the merit of the interpretation.id.at,d,italics in original.a court is more likely to defer to an agency interpretation that is a and consistent interpretation of the law.id.at,d.in contrast,a vacillating position is entitled to no deference.id.at,d.
sbe has not consistently applied a separate statement rule to concurrent sales of services and tangible personal property.while dell says that sbe routinely uses a separate statement rule to determine the taxability of services sold with tangible property,dell also admits that sbe has used several different approaches from time to time.the multiplicity of sbe approaches to the taxation of concurrent sales of goods and services is apparent in the regulatio
