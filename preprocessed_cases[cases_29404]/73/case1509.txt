facts and procedural 
ventura port district district was organized by the county of ventura in as a local governmental entity to operate and develop the ventura harbor.the district was created pursuant to harbors and navigation code section.the district is governed by a board of port commissioners pursuant to harbors and navigation code section.
in,the district leased real property along the harbor to ocean services corporation ocean,a corporation that had agreed to develop a commercial marina on the harborfront property.the district,however,failed to disclose a restrictive covenant on the property that prohibited the commercial development of part of the property for years.once ocean learned of the covenant,the district provided repeated assurances that the covenant would be removed quickly and at the district expense.ocean continued to plan the project,obtained the necessary licensing,preleased the property,guaranteed the loan payments for the necessary financing,and expended a large amount of money and effort to complete the development project.
meanwhile,the landowners benefitting from the restrictive covenant filed a lawsuit against the district and ocean to enjoin the project.in,the owners successfully obtained a preliminary injunction.in,ocean informed the district that its losses on the project had reached million due to the injunction.in,the parties settled the restrictive covenant lawsuit,but the district refused to renegotiate ocean lease or cover any of ocean losses.
in january,ocean filed a lawsuit in the superior court of ventura county against the district for breach of contract,deceit,and promissory estoppel.the parties continued to have difficulties with the terms of the lease and with the development of the property.in,ocean filed for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code.the district secured an order from the federal bankruptcy court declaring that the lease between the district and ocean had been rejected,and then evicted ocean from the property and took control of the marina facilities.in,ocean converted the chapter bankruptcy proceeding to a chapter bankruptcy proceeding,but the court permitted ocean and its creditors to continue to pursue the lawsuit against the district.
at trial,ocean argued that the district had breached the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.on september,a jury awarded ocean,which the trial judge later reduced to.
in,ocean recorded an abstract of judgment against the district.ocean believed that its abstract of judgment created a judgment lien against the district and secured creditor status for itself.at the same time,the district recorded an extinguishment of lien.the district then encumbered a portion of its real property in a series of transactions,one of which resulted in the district giving a deed of trust against some of its property to merchants bank of kansas city.
in april and pursuant to ocean chapter proceeding,ocean sold and assigned its cause of action against the district to a new corporation formed by ocean former shareholders,ventura group ventures vgv,appellant herein.in may,the second district court of appeal affirmed vgv verdict ocean services ventura port dist.th,d,but in an unpublished portion of the decision reduced the award to,plus costs and interest.
on august,vgv filed the instant action in the superior court of ventura county to enforce the judgment.vgv sued the district,the county of ventura county,merchants bank of kansas city,and other parties that vgv believed would contest the priority of vgv judgment against the district.first,vgv sought a declaratory judgment that the district and the county were required under state law to pay the judgment either by selling property or levying additional taxes or assessments,or that in the alternative,vgv could execute against the district property.second,vgv asked for a writ of mandate against the district and the county in the amount of the judgment.vgv included a claim for slander of title against the individual attorneys for filing the extinguishment of lien.vgv also sought a determination that its abstract of judgment gave it priority over the district other creditors.
immediately thereafter,the district filed a chapter bankruptcy petition,and vgv claims against the district were automatically stayed.the federal bankruptcy court granted vgv relief from the automatic stay,permitting vgv to go forward solely with its claim for a declaratory judgment to determine if vgv could force the district or the county to levy a property tax in order to pay the judgment.
after vgv complaint was filed,the federal deposit insurance corporation became the receiver for merchants bank of kansas city and,as a party defendant,removed the case to the united states district court for the central district of california.the federal district court then remanded the slander of title claims to the ventura county superior court.all that remained in the federal case was the claim for a declaratory judgment determining the rights and obligations of vgv,the district,and the county regarding the payment of vgv state court judgment,and a determination of whether an abstract of judgment against a public entity could create a judgment lien giving vgv priority over the district other creditors.
in january,pursuant to its grant of summary judgment to the county and its final judgment after a bench trial,the federal district court held that article xiii a of the california constitution proposition prohibited the county from levying an additional property tax to satisfy vgv judgment proposition and revenue and taxation code section prohibited the county from reallocating revenue generated from permissible property taxes to satisfy the judgment the district could not levy a special assessment to satisfy vgv judgment vgv could not proceed with a writ of execution against the district property vgv abstract of judgment did not create a judgment lien for the purpose of establishing vgv priority and the other creditors had liens superior to vgv.
the federal district court did hold that vgv could obtain a writ of mandate against the district for the purpose of satisfying the judgment,and that a court considering the issuance of the writ could order the district to sell some of its property to satisfy the judgment.the district did not appeal this determination.vgv limited its ninth circuit appeal to the consideration of the first three issues listed in the preceding paragraph,along with federal constitutional claims,and agreed to dismiss its appeal as to all defendants except the district and the county.
in april,the federal bankruptcy court approved the district modified chapter plan of debt adjustment.as part of the plan,vgv received as an unsecured creditor.although the bankruptcy court noted the federal district court determination against vgv,the modified plan provided that vgv retained the right to pursue its appeal of the district court judgment in the ninth circuit.if the appeal is successful,the bankruptcy court stated t he district will levy the tax as directed by the ninth circuit,or,if the subject proceedings are remanded,by the district court so that the tax will be included in the real property tax bills issued by the ventura county tax collector.if and when such taxes are collected by the county of ventura and remitted to the district,the district shall distribute the funds as required by applicable law or order of court.
on december,the chapter bankruptcy proceeding was closed.
ii.discussion 
again,the first question is does a rticle xiii a of the california constitution adopted in by statewide initiative as proposition prohibit a county from levying property taxes,in excess of the one percent limit,pursuant to california harbors and navigation code section to pay a money judgment as required by california government code sections ventura group ventures,supra,at.
california constitution,article xiii a,section provides a the maximum amount of any ad valorem tax on real property shall not exceed one percent of the full cash value of such property.the one percent tax to be collected by the counties and apportioned according to law to the districts within the counties.b the limitation provided for in subdivision a shall not apply to ad valorem taxes or special assessments to pay the interest and redemption charges on i ndebtedness approved by the voters prior to july,or b onded indebtedness for the acquisition of real property approved on or after july,by of the votes cast by the voters voting on the proposition.
government code section,subdivision a provides that a district shall include in its budget each fiscal year sufficient funds to pay all judgments rendered against it.harbors and navigation code section provides that a port district shall annually furnish the county board of supervisors with a written estimate of the amount of money the district will need for all purposes in the ensuing fiscal year,and t hereupon,it is the duty of the board of supervisors to levy a special tax,on all taxable property of the county lying within the district,sufficient in amount to raise that sum.
exception for prior indebtedness 
in its opening brief,vgv argued that this judgment constitutes an indebtedness approved by the voters prior to july,and is thus not subject to the percent limit set out in article xiii a because it comes within the exception stated in section,subdivision b of that article.here,the local voters themselves approved the creation of the district in knowing that state law,harb,mandated that the county of ventura would levy a special property tax each year up to the maximum tax rate specified in harbors and navigation code section to cover the district outstanding liabilities.an amicus curiae brief filed by twenty eight california cities in support of the district correctly observed that this argument was a stretch of logic that would gut proposition,and vgv has abandoned it.in any event,vgv argument was meritless because the district debt occurred no earlier than when the lease with ocean was executed,and so it did not arise prior to when proposition was adopted.
harbors and navigation code section 
vgv next contends proposition was not intended to repeal harbors and navigation code section.the state legislature is understandably concerned as much now as it was in that any port district formed in this state be financially sound.this concern is clearly one reason why the legislature has left these statutes intact.if that key piece of this legislation,the pledge of taxing support,were impliedly deleted by proposition,it would destroy the statutory framework the legislature adopted in governing the formation and operation of local port districts that is essentially unchanged to the present.for this reason alone,it is not reasonable to conclude that proposition was intended to repeal harbors and navigation code section.
the district aptly characterizes practice under harbors and navigation code section as budgeting first,taxing later.that is,as we have explained above,a port district was required to furnish the county board of supervisors with a written estimate of the amount of money the district would need in the coming fiscal year,and it was then the duty of the board to levy a special tax,on all taxable property of the county lying within the district,sufficient in amount to raise that sum.harb.if vgv is contending that in adopting proposition,the voters intended to permit counties,on behalf of port districts,to continue to levy property taxes without regard to the percent limit,vgv is plainly wrong.moreover,vgv argument appears to reveal a fundamental misunderstanding as to whose intent controls here.we may assume for the sake of argument that,as vgv contends,t he state legislature is understandably concerned as much now as it was in that any port district formed in this state be financially sound.however,the question is what the voters intended when they adopted proposition,and it is clear that,as far as they were concerned,the practice of budgeting first,taxing later was no longer acceptable.harbors and navigation code section has been superseded by the statutes implementing article xiii a insofar as,where applicable,they are inconsistent.article xiii a,section,subdivision a provides that the percent tax collected by the counties is to be apportioned according to law to the districts within the counties.the legislature read this language as conferring authority to legislate on the subject and to apportion the tax funds to local agencies and districts.amador valley joint union high sch.dist.state bd.of equalization cal d,amador.formulae for the distribution of tax funds to local agencies and districts have been enacted by the legislature.see,et therefore,a district can no longer expect a county to levy taxes to raise whatever sum the district budget calls for.that those days are long gone should come as no surprise to vgv or anyone else.
judgments resulting from acts 
vgv fallback position is that,even if article xiii a otherwise limits a county taxing authority under harbors and navigation code section,it was not intended to apply to a judgment like this one,which vgv characterizes as a judgment resulting from a nondiscretionary act.proposition,vgv asserts,was not intended to repeal the carefully crafted statutes the legislature had adopted just five years earlier to govern the payment of judgments of this nature.the statutes upon which vgv relies are sections and of the revenue and taxation code and sections and of the government code.we will first set out the statutes and then consider whether they support vgv position.
section of the revenue and taxation code provides in pertinent part a local agency may levy,or have levied on its behalf,a rate in addition to the maximum property rate established pursuant to this chapter commencing with section to pay costs mandated by the federal government or costs mandated by the courts or costs mandated by initiative enactment,which are not funded by federal or state government.italics added.
section of the revenue and taxation code provides in pertinent part costs mandated by the courts do not include i costs incurred as a result of a judgment in an eminent domain or condemnation proceeding,ii costs incurred in order to comply with a final court order mandating the specific performance,or awarding damages as a result of nonperformance,of any contract or agreement entered into after january,and iii costs incurred as a result of a final court order which requires a local agency or school district to comply with a program or service enacted after january,which the court has determined that the local agency or school district has failed to comply with prior to such order.
section,subdivision a of the government code provides each local public entity shall in each fiscal year include in its budget a provision to provide funds in an amount sufficient to pay all judgments in accordance with this article.
section,subdivision c of the government code provides for the purposes of section of the revenue and taxation code,taxes levied to pay pursuant to this article a judgment resulting from a nondiscretionary act are levied to pay costs mandated by the courts.section,subdivision a of the government code provides judgment resulting from a discretionary act means a judgment arising from a liability which the local public entity has discretion to incur or not to incur and includes a judgment rendered in an eminent domain proceeding and a judgment requiring specific performance of a contractual obligation or awarding damages for failure to perform a contractual obligation.
as the statutes make clear,even before proposition,the nondiscretionary obligations for which an agency was permitted to tax over the limit did not include all court judgments,on the theory that the duty to pay a judgment is mandatory rather than discretionary.instead,the distinction focused on the voluntary or involuntary nature of the original liability that resulted in the court judgment.judgments founded in contract and eminent domain were discretionary,while judgments founded in tort and inverse condemnation were nondiscretionary.
this judgment was founded in contract.it resulted from two discretionary acts the district decision to enter into a ground lease with ocean,and the district subsequent decision to violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.ocean services ventura port,supra,th at,d.therefore,the judgment is not covered by the statutory exemption for c osts mandated by the courts.because vgv argument does not withstand statutory analysis,we need not reach the question whether an exception for judgments resulting from nondiscretionary acts should be read into article xiii see amador,supra,cal d at,as a general rule,courts will not reach constitutional questions unless absolutely necessary to a disposition of the case before them.
constitutional questions 
vgv contends article xiii a is inconsistent with the united states constitution guarantee clause,which directs the united states to guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government,art.iv.in most of the cases in which the united states supreme court has been asked to apply the guarantee clause,the high court has found the claims presented to be nonjusticiable under the political question doctrine.new york united states,d.however,in amador,supra,cal d at page,we squarely rejected the claim that article xiii a would result in a change from a republican form of government,lawmaking by elected representatives to a democratic governmental plan,lawmaking directly by the people.contrary to petitioners assertion we are convinced that article xiii a does not change our basic governmental plan.following the adoption of article xiii a both local and state government will continue to function through the traditional system of elected representation.other than in the limited area of taxation,the authority of local government to enact appropriate laws and regulations remains wholly unimpaired.amador,at.vgv efforts to distinguish amador are unavailing.at bottom,what vgv is complaining of is not that article xiii a undermines this state republican form of government,but that it permits local voters to deny vgv recovery on its judgment in violation of due process of law and the takings clause.
vgv due process argument is itself a makeweight,consisting solely of an analogy to criminal law,in which vgv compares its situation to that of a criminal defendant who has been acquitted by a jury only to find that the voters can override the jury verdict.the analogy is not helpful.article xiii a does not nullify the judgment against the district.it simply restricts the ability of the district to raise taxes in order to pay the judgment.vgv is not thereby denied all means of satisfying its judgment.indeed,the bankruptcy court awarded vgv almost million for assigned rights it purchased from ocean in,long after proposition was adopted.ironically,in the name of due process,vgv would deny districts the protections afforded them under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code.
finally,vgv contends that an exception for judgments must be read into article xiii a in order to avoid a construction that would permit takings in violation of the fifth amendment to the united states constitution.
vgv argument rests entirely upon a recent decision of the court of l farm city council th,d f l farm.f l farm arose from an inverse condemnation action brought by several farmers against the city of lindsay.the city had for years accepted saline industrial wastewater from an olive processing facility,holding the wastewater first in percolation ponds and later in lined evaporation ponds.eventually much of the salt from the wastewater percolated into the groundwater through the percolation ponds and through holes in the liners of the evaporation ponds,causing injury lost profits from crops and permanent reduction in land value to farms in the vicinity of the ponds.the farmers obtained judgments totaling million,and the city appealed,claiming that articles xiii a,xiii b,xiii c,and xvi so limited its ability to tax and spend as to override its statutory duty to pay the judgments.the court of appeal framed the issue before it as follows when a city in california has deprived california residents of constitutionally protected property interests and a judgment has been entered against it to compensate the residents for the wrongs committed,may the city simply refuse to pay the judgment on the basis that it has no spare money we think not.f l farm,at,d.
f l farm is distinguishable on two grounds.first,f l farm involved a judgment founded in inverse condemnation,and as we have explained above,judgments founded in tort and inverse condemnation,unlike judgments founded in contract and eminent domain,are covered by the statutory exemption for c osts mandated by the courts.second,unlike the city of lindsay,the district here has not been permitted to avoid satisfaction of vgv judgment on the ground it has no spare money.f l farm,supra,th at,d.to the contrary,as a result of the bankruptcy proceeding,vgv has received nearly million,half of the sum awarded it.the discharge of the district debts in a bankruptcy proceeding can not reasonably be construed as a taking in violation of the fifth amendment to the united states constitution.
the analysis of article xiii a in f l farm got off on the wrong track because the case focused on whether,rather than how,the city was required to satisfy the judgment.f l farm got the whether right,but it got the how wrong.that is,article xiii a is most assuredly not a license to stiff judgment creditors with impunity.the bankruptcy award of almost million against the district here is proof of that.however,the fact that article xiii a does not absolutely shield a local public entity from a judgment creditor does not mean that a court can compel a county to levy property taxes in excess of article xiii a percent limit in order to satisfy the judgment.
in concluding that the judicially created nondiscretionary debt exception should be imported from article xvi,section to article xiii a,the court of appeal in f l farm relied principally upon the canon that a statute or constitutional provision susceptible of several interpretations should be construed so as to avoid serious constitutional problems.f l farm,supra,th at,d.this canon is beside the point here,though,for as we have just concluded,the constitutional challenges raised by vg
