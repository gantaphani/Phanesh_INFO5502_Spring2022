the commissioner of internal revenue assessed a tax deficiency and associated penalties against kathryn cheshire.in the united states tax court,cheshire asserted claims for innocent spouse relief from the tax deficiency and penalties under b,c,and f of the internal revenue code.supp.the tax court denied cheshire request for innocent spouse relief,and cheshire appeals that denial.for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the tax court.
factual history 
the facts in this case are undisputed.kathryn cheshire appellant married david cheshire in.more than twenty years later,cheshire retired from southwestern bell telephone company effective january,and received the following retirement distributions in 
of the total distribution,was rolled over into a qualified account and is not subject to federal income tax.cheshire deposited of the retirement distributions into the cheshires joint checking account,which earned in interest for appellant knew of cheshire receipt of in retirement distributions and of the in interest earned on the distributions.
the cheshires made several large disbursements from the retirement distributions in their joint checking account.they withdrew from this account to pay off the mortgage on their marital residence,and they withdrew an additional to purchase a new family car,a ford explorer.cheshire also used the retirement proceeds to provide capital for his new business,to satisfy loans taken out to acquire a family truck and an automobile for the cheshires daughter,to pay family expenses,and to establish a college fund for the cheshires daughter.appellant knew of all these expenditures.
appellant and cheshire filed a joint federal income tax return,prepared by cheshire,for.on line of this return,they reported the in retirement distributions but claimed only of this amount as taxable.before signing the return,appellant questioned cheshire about the tax consequences of the retirement distributions.cheshire replied that john daniel mican,a certified public accountant,advised cheshire that retirement proceeds used to pay off a mortgage are nontaxable.appellant accepted this answer and made no further inquiries prior to signing the return on march.in fact,cheshire had not consulted mican,and all retirement proceeds that are not rolled over into a qualified account are taxable.because of cheshire persistent problems with alcohol,the cheshires permanently separated on july,and they divorced seventeen months later.the divorce decree awarded appellant unencumbered title to the marital residence and to the ford explorer.
the commissioner of internal revenue the commissioner audited the cheshires return and determined that cheshire had received taxable retirement distributions of difference between the total distributions and the rollover.thus,the cheshires had understated the amount of their taxable distributions by.the commissioner also determined that the cheshires had underreported the interest income earned on the retirement distributions by.because of these inaccuracies,the commissioner imposed a penalty under a of the internal revenue code 
ii.procedural history 
appellant commenced this action in the tax court.she conceded that of the retirement distributions and the corresponding earned interest were improperly excluded from taxable income.she claimed,however,that she was entitled to relief as an innocent spouse under b c or f of the internal revenue code.prior to trial,the commissioner conceded that appellant qualified for innocent spouse relief with respect to the lesop distribution,the savings plan distribution,and the esop distribution.consequently,the taxable income from the retirement distributions and the corresponding earned interest remaining in dispute totaled and,respectively.these amounts roughly correspond to the improperly deducted amounts that the cheshires used to pay off their mortgage.
the tax court majority,consisting of twelve judges,denied appellant relief under b,c,and f.cheshire comm r,wl.the tax court found that appellant failed to establish that she did not know,and had no reason to know of the tax understatement as required for relief under b c.id.at.the tax court also found that appellant was not entitled to relief under c because she had actual knowledge of any item giving rise to a deficiency within the meaning of c c id.at.finally,the tax court held that the commissioner did not abuse his discretion in denying appellant equitable relief under f with respect to the retirement distributions and the interest income,as well as the a penalty associated with the interest income id.at.
iii.the statutory scheme 
generally,spouses who choose to file a joint return are subject to joint and several liability for tax deficiencies under the internal revenue code.d supp.recognizing that joint and several liability may be unjust in certain circumstances,congress authorized relief from such liability under the innocent spouse provision.section provides three distinct types of relief for taxpayers who file joint returns first,b provides relief for all joint filers who satisfy the five requirements listed in that section second,c allows a spouse who filed a joint tax return to elect to limit her income tax liability for that year to her separate liability amount section c applies only to taxpayers who are no longer married,are legally separated,or do not reside together over a period.c a i.furthermore,a spouse who had actual knowledge of an item giving rise to a deficiency at the time that spouse signed the return may not seek relief under c.c c 
finally,a taxpayer may seek relief as an innocent spouse under f,which authorizes the secretary of the treasury the secretary or his delegate to grant equitable relief from joint and several liability when relief is unavailable under b and c except for the knowledge requirement of c c the provision disallowing election of separate liability to a spouse with actual knowledge of the item giving rise to the deficiency,the taxpayer bears the burden of proving that she has met all the prerequisites for innocent spouse relief.see reser comm r,cir.section c c explicitly places the burden of proof on the secretary.
iv.standard of review 
this court reviews decisions of the tax court in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions tried without a jury.a supp.thus,we review issues of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error.park comm r,cir.the tax court determination that a spouse is not entitled to innocent spouse relief is a finding of fact that this court reviews for clear error.reser,at.
section b relief 
section b provides innocent spouse relief if the taxpayer satisfies all of the five requirements listed in that section in this case,the parties concede that appellant satisfied the requirements of subsections a,b,and e of b.thus,the b issue presented by this case is whether appellant satisfied the requirements of subsections c and d.we conclude that appellant has not satisfied the requirement of subsection c and thus is not entitled to relief under b.
subsection c allows for innocent spouse relief only if the spouse establishes that in signing the return he or she did not know,and had no reason to know,that there was such understatement.b c.originally,the innocent spouse provision formerly codified at e granted relief only in cases involving omitted income,cases in which the tax return failed to report taxable income.since the enactment of the original provision,courts have agreed that in omitted income cases,the spouse actual knowledge of the underlying transaction that produced the income is sufficient to preclude innocent spouse relief the test.reser,at in,the innocent spouse provision was expanded to include relief in erroneous deduction cases,cases in which an incorrect deduction results in an understatement of taxable income.park,at.the tax court applies the test to both types of cases,see bokum comm r,wl,though some circuits have adopted an alternate test for erroneous deduction cases see,price comm r,cir reser,at fifth circuit case.
the ninth circuit was the first circuit to adopt an alternative knowledge test for erroneous deduction cases.in price,the ninth circuit established that a spouse fails to satisfy the b c knowledge requirement in erroneous deduction cases if a reasonably prudent taxpayer in her position at the time she signed the return could be expected to know that the return contained the substantial understatement.at.the ninth circuit reasoned that since erroneous deductions are necessarily reported on a tax return,any spouse who signs the joint return is thereby put on notice that an transaction occurred.id.at.thus,in erroneous deduction cases,it would be illogical to bar recovery for spouses with mere knowledge of the transaction as this would preclude any spouse from obtaining relief under b.id.the ninth circuit noted that adoption of such an interpretation would do violence to the intent congress clearly expressed when it expanded coverage of the provision to include relief for spouses from deficiencies caused by deductions for which there is no basis in fact or law.id.
thus,under the price approach,actual knowledge of the underlying transaction,standing alone,is not enough to preclude innocent spouse relief under b c in erroneous deduction cases.however,price notes that if the spouse knows virtually all of the facts pertaining to the transaction which underlies the substantial understatement,then her defense is premised solely on ignorance of law,and she is considered as a matter of law to have reason to know of the substantial understatement.id.at emphasis added.
this court adopted the price approach and reasoning in reser see at.accordingly,in erroneous deduction cases,this court questions whether the spouse knew or had reason to know that the deduction in question would give rise to a substantial understatement of tax on the joint return.id.emphasis in original.however,if the spouse knows enough about the underlying transaction that her innocent spouse defense rests entirely upon a mistake of law,she has reason to know of the tax understatement as a matter of law.see park,at noting that ignorance of the law can not establish an innocent spouse defense to tax liability sanders united states,cir.if reason to know can not be determined as a matter of law,the proper factual inquiry is whether a reasonably prudent taxpayer in the spouse position at the time she signed the return could be expected to know that the stated liability was erroneous or that further investigation was warranted.reser,at.
in this case,the cheshires reported the receipt of in retirement distributions on line of their joint tax return.on line,they reported as the taxable amount of those retirement distributions.cheshire led appellant to believe that he calculated this amount of taxable income by properly deducting the money placed in a qualified account and the money used to pay off the mortgage on their home.in fact,only the money placed in a qualified account was properly excludable from the cheshires taxable income.appellant argues that these facts present a case of erroneous deduction and that the standard is therefore applicable.the commissioner argues that this is a case of omitted income and that the test is therefore applicable.
this court has not previously determined if such facts present a case of omitted income or of erroneous deduction,and we need not do so here because the outcome under either standard is the same appellant knew or had reason to know of the tax understatement under the test applied in omitted income cases,appellant fails to satisfy b c because she had actual knowledge of the retirement distributions and of the corresponding earned interest at the time she signed the return in erroneous deduction cases,this court asks whether appellant knew or had reason to know that the deduction in question would give rise to a tax understatement at the time she signed the return.the parties agree that appellant did not have actual knowledge that the deduction was improper.however,because appellant knew all the facts surrounding the transaction that gave rise to the understatement,including the amount of the retirement proceeds,the account where the proceeds were deposited and drawn upon,the amount of interest earned on the proceeds,and the manner in which the proceeds were spent,appellant had reason to know of the improper deduction as a matter of law.appellant defense consists only of her mistaken belief that money spent to pay off a mortgage is properly deductible from retirement distributions.ignorance of the law can not establish an innocent spouse defense to tax liability.park,at sanders,at.
because appellant knew or had reason to know of the understatement under both the omitted income standard and the erroneous deduction standard,she fails to establish the requirement of b c.this conclusion bars relief under b,obviating the need for this court to decide whether appellant satisfied the requirement of b d.the tax court determination that appellant is not entitled to innocent spouse relief under b is not clearly erroneous.
vi.section c relief 
section c allows any divorced or separated individual to elect to assume responsibility for only that portion of a joint tax deficiency that is properly allocable to that individual the parties agree that appellant falls within the class of taxpayers permitted to make a c election since she and cheshire were divorced when she filed her petition with the tax court.moreover,neither party in this case disputes that the deficiency attributable to the retirement distributions is properly allocable to cheshire.thus,if this election is available to appellant,she can avoid liability for the tax deficiency caused by the retirement distributions.however,the benefit of the c election is not available to an individual with actual knowledge of any item giving rise to a deficiency.c c in order to preclude relief under c,the commissioner must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that appellant had actual knowledge of any item giving rise to a deficiency.culver comm r,wl.whether the commissioner satisfied this burden is the c issue in this appeal.
the debate between the parties focuses on the meaning of the term item in c c.appellant argues that item means incorrect tax reporting of an item of income,deduction,or credit so that c c only bars relief for spouses with actual knowledge that an entry on the joint tax return is incorrect.the commissioner argues that item means an item of income,deduction,or credit so that c c bars relief for all spouses with actual knowledge of the transaction,even if they lacked knowledge of the incorrect tax reporting of that transaction.
the term item appears fifteen times in.most of these appearances are uninformative,but the uses of the term item in b b and d support the commissioner definition.section b b refers to an understatement of tax attributable to erroneous items of one individual filing the joint return.if item refers to the incorrect tax reporting of an item,as appellant asserts,then the reference to an erroneous item is redundant.thus,b b suggests that item means an item of income,deduction,or credit,as the commissioner asserts.furthermore,d refers to an item of deduction or credit.this use of the term item suggests that the term refers to an actual item of income,deduction,or credit,rather than the incorrect reporting of such an item.
other sections of the internal revenue code define the term item without reference to tax consequences.for example,a defines gross income to include such items as compensation for services,interest,rents,and royalties.a supp.thus,in this context,item means an item of income.section a defines the term partnership item as any item required to be taken into account for the partnership taxable year under any provision of subtitle a a supp.these uses of the term item,as well as those uses appearing in,suggest that item means an item of income,deduction,or credit.see comm r lundy,d stating that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning internal citations and quotations omitted.this interpretation supports the commissioner position that c c bars relief for all spouses wit
