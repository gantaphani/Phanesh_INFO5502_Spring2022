application of tax guidelines 
the sentencing guidelines manual directs the sentencing court to d etermine the offense guideline section in chapter two offense conduct most applicable to the offense of conviction,the offense conduct charged in the count of the indictment or information of which the defendant was convicted.ussg a the statutory index,found in appendix a of the guidelines,provides a listing to assist in this determination.ussg,cmt.the guidelines in the statutory index are not mandatory,however.united states fulbright,cir.the index merely points the court in the right direction.its suggestions are advisory what ultimately controls is the most applicable guideline.united states cambra,cir.
the statutory index recommends the use of ussg,the fraud guideline,for a violation of.see ussg app.for a violation of,the index refers to various guidelines,depending on the type of example,for conspiracy to commit murder,for conspiracy to defraud by interference with governmental functions,and,relevant here,for conspiracy to impede,impair,obstruct,or defeat tax.see id.the introduction to the index notes,however,that,in an atypical case,the guideline section indicated for the statute of conviction may be inappropriate because of the particular conduct,in which case the court is to use the guideline section most applicable to the nature of the offense conduct,referring to ussg.id.
the district court rejected appellant objections to the presentence report psr and concluded that the general fraud guideline in was not applicable because it was not the most applicable guideline to the offense of conviction.the court reasoned that appellant conduct constituted tax fraud,a more specific genre of false claims against the united states,because it is based upon the manipulation of the tax laws provisions within the overall taxing scheme of the united states.the court thus relied on for aiding,assisting,procuring,counseling,or advising tax fraud and conspiracy to impede,impair,obstruct,or defeat tax in determining appellant sentence.the court further relied on application note to,which states that w hen a particular statute proscribes a variety of conduct that might constitute the subject of different offense guidelines,the court will determine which guideline section applies based upon the nature of the offense conduct charged in the count of which the defendant was convicted.ussg,cmt.reasoning that and proscribe a variety of conduct,the court decided that the tax guidelines were the most applicable to the specific conduct.
whether a particular guideline applies to a specific set of facts is subject to de novo review.see fulbright,at united states koff,cir.d ue deference is given to the district judge application of the guidelines to the facts.united states van krieken,cir.
although appellant was charged under for presenting false claims against the united states,the entire scheme was based on filing fraudulent tax returns.appellant situation is thus similar to that in united states hopper,cir,cert.denied,d,and cert.dismissed sub nom.united states reed,d,where the defendants were not convicted under tax statutes,but their offense conduct related to a tax scheme.the defendants in hopper were convicted of conspiracy under and obstruction of proceedings under.although the guideline specified by the index for a violation of is,obstruction of justice,we upheld the district court application of the tax conspiracy guideline because did not adequately address the seriousness of the defendants conduct and the amount of tax liability they attempted to obstruct.id.at.
moreover,the statute under which appellant was charged is a general statute.section criminalizes the presentation of any false,fictitious,or fraudulent claim against the united states.the commentary to ussg states 
sometimes,offenses involving fraudulent statements are prosecuted under,or a similarly general statute,although the offense is also covered by a more specific statute where the indictment or information setting forth the count of conviction establishes an offense more aptly covered by another guideline,apply that guideline rather than.
ussg,cmt.the commentary thus specifically considers a situation such as that found here,where the defendant is charged under a general statute,but the offense conduct is more aptly covered by another guideline.
appellant argues that and apply only to offenses involving interference with the collection of taxes,not an offense whose objective was simply to obtain money.in support of this contention,appellant quotes application note to,which states that t his section applies to conspiracies to defraud the united states by impeding,impairing,obstructing and defeating the collection of revenue.ussg,cmt.quoting united states carruth,cir.the note goes on to state that does not apply to taxpayers,such as a husband and wife,who merely evade taxes jointly or file a fraudulent return.id.
while it is true that the sentencing guidelines commentary must be given controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation,it is not binding in all instances.stinson united states,d quoting bowles seminole rock sand.even if the commentary
