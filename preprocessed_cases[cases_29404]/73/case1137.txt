the united states appeals the district court summary judgment determining that the boeing company and its consolidated subsidiaries boeing are entitled to an income tax refund of approximately million for the years through.the issue is how research and development costs r d should be accounted for in computing boeing net income from export sales of commercial airplanes under the internal revenue code export incentive provisions for a domestic international sales corporation disc and a foreign sales corporation fsc.
we have jurisdiction under.we conclude that,in computing boeing net income,the commissioner of internal revenue properly applied reg.e to allocate boeing r d costs to its export sales.accordingly,we reverse the district court summary judgment granting boeing tax refund claim 
from to,boeing exported commercial airplanes through its subsidiary,boeing international sales corporation,which qualified as a disc under internal revenue code.after,boeing exported commercial airplanes through its subsidiary,boeing sales corporation,which qualified as a fsc under.
during the relevant period,boeing maintained separate programs for each of its major commercial airplane product lines each of boeing programs constitutes a separate product or product line under industry practice and trade usage in the commercial airplane business.
in developing these programs,boeing segregated its r d costs into two broad categories.the first category,r d,was for r d costs incurred prior to boeing board of directors giving approval for a new airplane model,which approval was referred to as program go ahead.blue sky r d included basic research relating to commercial airplanes that might be the precursor to a specific program.the second category,company sponsored product development,was for costs incurred for a specific program after program go ahead had been given for a particular airplane model and included the r d cost of designing,developing,testing and qualifying that airplane.approximately percent of the r d costs in the tax years at issue in this case fall within the company sponsored product development category.
for accounting purposes,boeing apportioned blue sky r d to all of its airplane programs,but allocated company sponsored product development r d directly to the particular program for which those costs were incurred.boeing deducted all r d costs in the period in which they were incurred,regardless of whether there were any corresponding sales during that period.this meant that significant r d costs for any new program could be allocated to that program in years prior to any sales of airplanes within that program.
boeing used the combined taxable income method cti to calculate the intercompany price and profits from its export sales.see a a.pursuant to reg.c,boeing grouped its export sales by program and apportioned costs,including r d costs,to the particular airplane program for which those costs were incurred.if those r d costs exceeded the amount of sales for the airplane program to which those costs were allocated,the excess of costs over sales,according to the irs,simply disappeared,in that those costs were not accounted for by boeing in computing its cti.
during an audit,the irs determined that boeing method of allocating its r d costs to its disc and fsc sales violated reg.e,which requires all r d costs to be allocated to and apportioned among all sales within the broad product categories set forth in the office of management and budget standard industrial classification sic.because all of boeing commercial airplane sales fell within sic code transportation equipment,the irs allocated all of boeing r d costs in a given period to all of boeing commercial airplane sales in that period.by this method of allocation,none of the r d expenses disappeared the government characterization instead,all of such expenses were charged to sales in the relevant period.this method of allocation by the irs caused a substantial decrease in boeing net income from its disc and fsc sales.because net income from such sales is accorded favorable tax treatment,boeing overall income tax liability,according to the irs,was substantially understated.
boeing paid the amount of additional tax required by the irs,and timely filed claims for refund.when those claims were denied or not acted upon,boeing filed this suit seeking a refund of corporate income taxes and interest in the total amount of.both sides moved for summary judgment.the district court,relying on jude medical,commissioner,cir,accepted boeing method of allocating r d,and granted judgment in favor of boeing for.this appeal followed.
we review de novo a district court interpretation of the and corresponding treasury regulations.see united states hagberg,cir.
generally,a court must defer to the commissioner interpretation of the by the regulations he issues,so long as those regulations implement the congressional mandate in some reasonable manner.see redlark commissioner,cir quoting rowan united states,d.a court has authority to reject the commissioner reasoned interpretation and invalidate a regulation only when the section to which the regulation applies has a meaning that is clear,unambiguous,and in conflict with the regulation.see id.citing chevron,natural res.def.council,d.
when congress,by explicitly leaving a gap for an agency to fill,delegates authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of a statute by regulation,that delegation is express and the agency regulations issued pursuant to the legislation are legislative regulations.such regulations are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.see id.at citing chevron,at.if delegation to the agency is implicit,however,a court owes deference only to the agency reasonable interpretation of the statutory provisions and related regulations.see mclean crabtree,cir,cert.denied,d.
both reg.e and c are legislative regulations because they were promulgated pursuant to a and b,which contain explicit grants of authority from congress.see black decker commissioner,cir explaining that section a provides express congressional authorization for reg,which describes the allocation of costs,losses,and deductions derived from domestic and foreign sources see also b granting the secretary the authority to prescribe regulations for the allocation of expenditures in computing combined taxable income in those cases where a disc is seeking to establish or maintain a market for export property.
in jude medical,however,the eighth circuit concluded that a was promulgated pursuant to the commissioner general grant of authority in a,not pursuant to any express legislative delegation,and as a result the court owed deference only to the irs reasonable interpretation of the applicable statutes and regulations.see jude medical,at.
in the present case,we need not decide which standard of review applies,because whether we review the commissioner interpretation under an arbitrary or capricious standard,or under the arguably less deferential reasonableness standard,we uphold that interpretation.we agree with the commissioner that boeing method of allocating r d costs and calculating cti on its disc and fsc sales of commercial airplanes violates reg.e requirement for the allocation of total costs and that reg.e is a permissible interpretation of the 
the disc and fsc provisions permit a taxpayer to defer or exempt from tax a significant portion of income from export sales.see these tax incentives are intended to encourage and increase exports by domestic corporations.
qualified discs,which are subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of any state,are not taxed directly a.instead,the parent corporation is taxed on a specified portion of its subsidiary disc profits.see.the disc remaining profits are tax deferred until either they are distributed to the parent corporation or the disc ceases to meet statutory requirements.see a b 
the amount of a disc profit depends on the transfer price at which its parent is deemed to have sold to it the product it resells.there are three methods for calculating this transfer price,and thus
