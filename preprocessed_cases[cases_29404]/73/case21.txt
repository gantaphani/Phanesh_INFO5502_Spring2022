under the internal revenue code,taxpayers receive,subject to various technical requirements,credits against owed income tax for every dollar paid to a foreign country for taxable international business transactions of economic substance.see.over the past decade,some banks have engaged in complicated transactions the very purpose of which is to generate a foreign tax credit in order to take advantage of the deductions,and have done so at the expense of the taxpayer.
this case concerns whether sovereign bancorp,later acquired by santander holdings usa,together,sovereign,a taxpayer,is entitled to a refund from the internal revenue service irs after the irs began disallowing its claim for foreign tax credits and imposing penalties in.the credits at issue here were claimed for tax years to for taxes arranged to be paid to the united kingdom as part of a structured trust advantaged repackaged securities stars transaction that sovereign had engaged in.this stars transaction was initiated in and was scheduled to last five years,but it ended early,in july,when stars and similar transactions became the subject of heightened scrutiny from the irs.see determining the amount of taxes paid for purposes of section,fed.reg.proposed.sovereign and barclays bank barclays,which is chartered in the united kingdom,were the two parties to the transaction at issue.
sovereign brought suit to obtain a refund from the irs in the district of massachusetts in.the amount of the refund sought is approximately million in taxes,penalties,and interest.sovereign asserts that it is entitled to foreign tax credits against its taxes for taxes it paid to the united kingdom as part of the stars transaction at issue.as the government concedes,the stars transaction complied on its face with statutory and regulatory requirements.but the government opposes the refund,arguing that the stars transaction here is an abusive tax shelter and so amounts to a transaction that fails the common law economic substance test.
congress and the irs have long been concerned with taxpayers inappropriately seeking foreign tax credits.irs regulations proposed in and finalized in prohibited stars transactions,but not retroactively.see determining the amount of taxes paid for purposes of section,fed.reg,proposed,determining the amount of taxes paid for purposes of the foreign tax credit,fed.reg.july,codified at pt.the regulations reflect an understanding that stars transactions and similar complex financial structures for which foreign tax credits are sought both pose a danger to the federal fisc and do not serve the purposes intended by congress in enacting the foreign tax credit regime.those purposes include avoiding double taxation and enabling the conduct of business affairs abroad by firms.see,at the foreign tax credit provision was originally designed to produce uniformity of tax burden among united states taxpayers,irrespective of whether they were engaged in business in the united states or engaged in business abroad.this case involves a stars transaction that took place before such transactions were forbidden by regulation,and no one contends the regulation applies.this decision thus directly affects only that transaction.
during roughly the same period as the transaction at issue here,from to,other banks also entered into stars transactions with barclays.they similarly sought tax credits,and the irs similarly opposed them.in bank of new york mellon commissioner bny,cir,the second circuit affirmed a judgment disallowing the credits claimed by bank of new york mellon for its stars transaction with barclays using somewhat different reasoning,the federal circuit in salem financial,united states,fed.cir,also upheld a determination disallowing credits claimed by branch banking trust corporation for a stars transaction with barclays.both circuit court opinions contain extensive factual descriptions of the stars transactions,which also largely characterize the transaction at issue here a third case,involving a wells fargo stars transaction,was tried in a federal district court in the eighth circuit.see wells fargo united states,supp.after trial,a jury found that the transaction lacked economic substance.
the massachusetts district court in this case awarded summary judgment to sovereign.it first entered partial summary judgment for sovereign on the issue of whether a payment sovereign received from barclays should be considered income to sovereign in calculating the stars trust transaction profit.santander holdings usa,subsidiaries united states santander i,supp,mass.it then entered judgment for sovereign after finding as a matter of law that the trust and loan transactions had economic substance,and so sovereign was entitled to deductions on expenses for the loan transaction and a refund on the disallowed foreign tax credits claimed for the trust transaction and the penalties imposed by the irs.santander holdings usa,united states santander ii,supp.the court also denied the government for partial summary judgment in its favor on a number of issues,including whether sovereign taxes should be regarded as expenses in any calculation of sovereign profit from the stars transaction.id.at.the government appeals from the grant of summary judgment to sovereign and the denial of its.
through concessions made by both the government and sovereign,the appeal has been considerably simplified.the government no longer contends that it is entitled to a jury trial on the tax refund claim it seeks a jury trial only on the penalties claim.the government also does not contend any longer that the district court improperly excluded evidence,or that there are any material disputes of fact,or that summary judgment was entered prematurely.rather,the government agrees that the controlling issue is one of law and argues that its for summary judgment as to the trust portion of the stars transaction should have been allowed sovereign,for its part,agrees,for the purposes of summary judgment,that the proper focus is on the trust transaction alone,and not on the loan transaction 
we hold that the district court committed reversible error and that the government is entitled to summary judgment in its favor as to the economic substance of the stars trust transaction.we largely agree with the reasoning of the federal circuit opinion in salem in rejecting the claims that the trust transaction had economic substance and substantially rely on its analysis.
we give a brief description of the transaction and then of this circuit economic substance test.
a.the stars transaction 
sovereign entered into the stars transaction with barclays in.banks were then aware of the tax risks of being denied the full amount of foreign tax credits.see,salem,at.like other stars transactions,the one sovereign entered into had,as the district court put it,a rube goldberg complexity.santander i,supp.at.we explain it briefly and rely on bny and salem for further details.
in,sovereign first created a trust the trust half of the transaction into which it ultimately contributed about billion of its assets.the trustee of the trust was,by its terms,a citizen,a fact which subjected the trust to taxes.the taxes were at a rate of.the trust was also subject to federal income tax at a rate of,but it could claim a tax credit for the taxes paid to the united kingdom.the trust was structured,therefore,to receive foreign tax credits for the amount paid in tax on the trust to the united kingdom.it is undisputed that sovereign paid all taxes for which it claimed tax credits.
barclays acquired an interest in the trust for million in november at the trust initial creation and acquired an additional million interest almost a year later,when sovereign added additional funds to the trust.significantly,barclays was required to sell its interest in the trust back to sovereign for billion at the end of the transaction.
sovereign treated this billion contribution from barclays as a loan the loan half of the stars transaction for accounting and regulatory purposes,including in all of sovereign filings to the securities and exchange commission and the office of thrift supervision.the offsetting agreements that converted barclays purchase of an interest in the trust into the loan effectively resulted in barclays lending sovereign million at a floating monthly rate of libor plus basis points and million at libor plus basis points 
the trust engaged in a series of actions that generated a tax benefit for barclays.the trust distributed funds to a barclays blocked account,which barclays could not access,but which allowed barclays to formally hold the funds in its name.the barclays blocked account then immediately returned the funds to the trust.barclays owed taxes on the distributions made to the barclays blocked account,but,importantly,barclays was entitled to a tax credit for the tax paid on this income by the trust,and barclays also was permitted to deduct its to the trust as a tax loss.the combination of the tax credit and deduction creat ed a net tax deduction for barclays that it could use to offset tax on other income unrelated to the stars transaction.
in exchange,barclays paid sovereign a monthly sum,referred to as the barclays or bx payment.the amount of the bx payment was calculated to equal of the tax sovereign paid on the trust income.in a sense,the was a return to sovereign of half of its tax payment,whether or not it was technically a rebate.the bx payment was netted against sovereign interest obligation on the loan.
the benefits for both parties can be illustrated by a hypothetical also employed by the second and federal circuits.see bny,at salem,at.assume of income in the trust for a given month.through its ownership interest in the trust and the trust structure,barclays would be liable for a corporate tax on the trust income,amounting to.bny,at.barclays would then claim a credit for the tax paid on the trust by sovereign amounting to,bringing barclays own tax liability down to.id.the trust would set aside to settle the tax owed by sovereign the remaining would be shuttled into and out of the barclays blocked account.id.sovereign would claim a foreign tax credit for the it paid in taxes.id.
upon redistributing the to the trust from the barclays blocked account,barclays would claim a trading loss deduction on the which,at the corporate tax rate of,would amount to.id.barclays would make a bx payment to sovereign calculated to be half of the tax paid by sovereign,which would amount to.id.barclays then deducted this payment at the tax rate as well,resulting in a deduction.id.in the end,barclays would save in taxes for each of trust income,and sovereign would save the amount of the bx payment calculated against sovereign tax exposure.id.both parties ultimately reduced their tax exposure barclays through the various deductions generated by the trust transaction and sovereign through the bx payment.
b.the economic substance doctrine 
the federal income tax is,and always has been,based on statute.the economic substance doctrine like other common law tax doctrines,can thus perhaps best be thought of as a tool of statutory interpretation as breyer characterized it in his opinion for this court in dewees commissioner,cir.
the common law economic substance doctrine traces back to the supreme court decision in gregory helvering,the court there looked beyond the fact that a corporate reorganization technically complied with the statutory requirement and found that it lacked economic substance.id.at.it found as such because the reorganization was 
an operation having no business or corporate purpose a mere device which put on the form of a corporate reorganization as a disguise for concealing its real character,and the sole object and accomplishment of which was the consummation of a preconceived plan,not to reorganize a business or any part of a business,but to transfer a parcel of corporate shares to the petitioner.
id.at.the court reached this conclusion from the fact that the transaction upon its face lies outside the plain intent of the statute.id.at.
the court clarified the doctrine further in frank lyon united states,where it reversed the eighth circuit decision that a transaction did not meet the economic substance test.id.at.the court explained that i n applying this doctrine of substance over form,the court has looked to the objective economic realities of a transaction rather than to the particular form the parties employed.id.at emphasis added.
the first circuit has addressed challenges to the economic substance of transactions in a number of cases,although the cases often have not invoked the economic substance doctrine by that name.see,stone comm r,cir.fabreeka prods.comm r,cir.granite tr.united states,cir.this court has been particularly wary of inquiring into the subjective motivations of taxpayers u nless congress makes it abundantly clear,we do not think tax consequences should be dependent upon the discovery of a purpose,or a state of mind,whether it be elaborate or simple.fabreeka prods,at.
dewees is our most recent significant case on the economic substance doctrine.there,this court upheld a tax court decision that a loss the petitioners incurred while engaged in straddle trading on the london metals exchange was not an ordinary loss deductible from their income.dewees,at.the tax court held that the loss was not deductible because the straddle trades were sham transactions and not entered into for profit within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code.id.
this court upheld the tax court decision for four principal reasons.we emphasized that the case was one of some consolidated by the tax court,from the general pattern of which the tax court could infer that the transactions were designed to avoid taxes that the promotional material for the transactions focused exclusively on their tax effects that although margin accounts were opened for the transactions,none of the investors in any of the transactions ever received a margin call and that no investor ever made a net profit or was ever asked to pay a loss,beyond the initial margin deposit for the transactions id.at.we rejected the petitioner argument that we must analyze the taxpayer subjective motivation under the relevant statutory framework.id.at.among other reasons,the court noted that the tax court had concluded that the transactions were shams in substance,and that c ase law makes clear that a taxpayer can not deduct a sham transaction loss,irrespective of his subjective profit motive.id.at.
dewees instructs that the economic substance doctrine is centered on discerning whether the challenged transaction objectively lies outside the plain intent of the relevant statutory regime.id.at quoting gregory,at.it further instructs that a transaction fails the economic substance test if,though it actually occurred and technically complied with the tax code,it w as mere ly a device to avoid tax liability.id.at see also schussel werfel,cir.noting that courts may disregard the form of transactions that have no business purpose or economic substance beyond tax evasion.in other words,when a transaction is one designed to produce tax gains not real gains,dewees,at such as when the challenged transaction has no prospect for profit then it is an act of tax evasion that,even if technically compliant,lies outside of the intent of the tax code and so lacks economic substance.
we review orders granting or denying summary judgment de novo.fithian reed,cir.the general characterization of a transaction for tax purposes is a question of law subject to review.frank lyon,at.
in its first partial summary judgment decision,the district court rejected the government argument that the bx payment was in effect a tax rebate.santander i,supp.at.the district court concluded instead that the bx payment as a matter of law was income to sovereign.id.at.the federal circuit reached the same conclusion as the district court in our case and held that the bx payment must be counted as income under the logic of old colony trust commissioner,ies industries,united states,cir.and compaq computer subsidiaries commissioner,cir.salem,at.by contrast,the second circuit accepted the government argument.bny,at.
we see no need to address the government characterization of the bx payment
