the plaintiffs initiated this litigation in state court,challenging the validity of certain state tax credits and local property tax abatements that were granted to daimlerchrysler corporation as an inducement to the company to expand its business operations in toledo,ohio.they contend that the tax scheme discriminates against interstate commerce by granting preferential treatment to investment and activity,in violation of the commerce clause of the united states constitution and the equal protection clause of the ohio constitution.after the defendants removed the action to federal court,the district court entered an order dismissing the complaint under federal rules of civil procedure b and b for failure to state a claim.because we conclude that the investment tax credit runs afoul of the commerce clause,we can affirm only part of the district court judgment.
factual and procedural background 
in,daimlerchrysler entered into an agreement with the city of toledo to construct a new plant near the company existing facility in exchange for various tax incentives.daimlerchrysler estimated that it would invest approximately billion in this project,which would provide the region with several thousand new jobs.in return,the city and two local school districts agreed to give daimlerchrysler a percent property tax exemption,as well as an investment tax credit of percent against the state corporate franchise tax for certain qualifying investments.the total value of the tax incentives was estimated to be million.
ohio investment tax credit grants a taxpayer a credit against the state corporate franchise tax if the taxpayer purchases new manufacturing machinery and equipment during the qualifying period,provided that the new manufacturing machinery and equipment are installed in ohio.ohio ann.b.the investment tax credit is generally percent of the excess of the cost of the new manufacturing machinery and equipment purchased during the calendar year for use in a county over the county average new manufacturing machinery and equipment investment for that county.see ohio ann.c.the rate increases to percent of the cost of the new investment if it is purchased for use in specific economically depressed areas.see ohio ann.c,a.the credit may not exceed million unless the taxpayer has increased its overall ownership of manufacturing equipment in the state during the year for which the credit is claimed.see ohio ann.b a.to the extent that the credit exceeds the corporation total ohio franchise tax liability in a particular year,the balance of the credit is carried forward and can be used to reduce its liability in any of the three following years.see ohio ann.d.
the personal property tax exemption is authorized under and it permits municipalities to offer specified incentives to an enterprise that agrees to establish,expand,renovate,or occupy a facility and hire new employees,or preserve employment opportunities for existing employees in economically depressed areas.ohio ann.c.an exemption may be granted for a specified number of years,not to exceed ten,of a specified portion,up to per cent,of the assessed value of tangible personal property first used in business at the project site as a result of the agreement.ohio ann.c a.the exemption may exceed percent with consent of the affected school districts.see ohio ann.d.
the district court held that the investment tax credit and the property tax exemption do not violate the commerce clause because,although an increase in activity in ohio could increase the credit and exemption amount under the two statutes,an increase in activity outside the state would not decrease the amount of the tax credit or exemption and therefore would not run afoul of the united states supreme court ruling in westinghouse electric tully,d.from that decision,the plaintiffs now appeal.
ii.analysis 
we review de novo a district court order granting a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.see inge rock fin,cir.in considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b,all factual allegations of the complaint must be accepted as true and the complaint construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.id.it is that dismissal of a complaint is proper only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.hishon king spalding,d citing conley gibson,d.
on appeal,the plaintiffs primary contention is that the ohio statutes authorizing the investment tax credit and personal property tax exemption violate the commerce clause of the united states constitution.secondarily,the plaintiffs claim that the tax incentives violate ohio equal protection clause.
commerce clause claim 
the united states constitution expressly authorizes congress to regulate commerce with foreign nations,and among the several states,const.art.i,cl,and the negative or dormant aspect of the commerce clause implicitly limits the state right to tax interstate commerce.a tax provision satisfies the requirements of the commerce clause if the activity taxed has a substantial nexus with the taxing state the tax is fairly apportioned to reflect the degree of activity that occurs within the state the tax does not discriminate against interstate commerce and the tax is fairly related to benefits provided by the state.see complete auto transit,brady,d.
the parties do not dispute that the tax provisions at issue have a sufficient nexus with the state,are fairly apportioned,and are related to benefits provided by the state.nor do the parties dispute that it is legitimate for ohio to structure its tax system to encourage new intrastate economic activity.indeed,the united states supreme court has indicated that the commerce clause does not prevent the states from structuring their tax systems to encourage the growth and development of intrastate commerce and industry,nor does it prevent a state from compet ing with other states for a share of interstate commerce so long as no state discriminatorily tax es the products manufactured or the business operations performed in any other state.boston stock exch.state tax comm n,d see also bacchus imports,dias,d the federal commerce clause limits the manner in which states may legitimately compete for interstate trade.rather,the parties dispute whether ohio method for encouraging new economic investment tax incentives and property tax against interstate commerce.
the united states supreme court has never precisely delineated the scope of the doctrine that bars discriminatory taxes.the court has made clear,however,that a tax statute constitutionality does not depend upon whether one focuses upon the benefited or the burdened party.bacchus imports,at.the fact that a statute discriminates against business carried on outside the state by disallowing a tax credit rather than by imposing a higher tax is therefore legally irrelevant.westinghouse tully,d.

investment tax credit 
although the investment tax credit at issue here is equally available to and businesses,the plaintiffs nevertheless maintain that it discriminates against interstate economic activity by coercing businesses already subject to the ohio franchise tax to expand locally rather than.specifically,any corporation currently doing business in ohio,and therefore paying the state corporate franchise tax in ohio,can reduce its existing tax liability by locating significant new machinery and equipment within the state,but it will receive no such reduction in tax liability if it locates a comparable plant and equipment elsewhere.moreover,as between two businesses,otherwise similarly situated and each subject to ohio taxation,the business that chooses to expand its local presence will enjoy a reduced tax burden,based directly on its new investment,while a competitor that invests will face a comparatively higher tax burden because it will be ineligible for any credit against its ohio tax.
the plaintiffs argument principally relies on the supreme court own explanation of its commerce clause jurisprudence in cases invalidating tax schemes that encourage the development of local industry by imposing greater burdens on economic activity taking place outside the state.in boston stock exchange,for example,the supreme court held unconstitutional amendments to new york securities transfer tax that aimed to offset the competitive advantage that the transfer tax otherwise created for exchanges that did not tax transfers.see boston stock exchange,at.prior to the amendment,new york uniformly taxed transfers of securities without regard to the place of sale.see id.at.the amendment created a percent reduction in the tax rate on transfers by nonresidents and limited liability on transfers of large blocks of shares as long as the sales were made in new york.see id.at.as a result,the amendment caused transactions involving sales to be taxed more heavily than transactions involving sales.see id.at.the court held that the reduction offended the commerce clause principle by converting a tax that was previously neutral as to and sales into one that which would induce a seller to trade through a new york broker in order to reduce its tax liability.see id.at.in doing so,new york effectively foreclose d decisions and creat ed both an advantage for the exchanges in new york and a discriminatory burden on commerce to its sister states.id.at.the diversion of interstate commerce from the most economically efficient channels that resulted from new york use of its power to tax an operation as a means of requiring other business operations to be performed in the home state,id.at.quoting pike bruce church,d,was seen by the court as wholly inconsistent with the free trade purpose of the commerce clause.
shortly thereafter,in maryland louisiana,d,the supreme court reviewed a louisiana statute that imposed a tax on natural gas extracted from the continental shelf in an amount equivalent to the severance tax imposed on natural gas extracted in louisiana.see id.at.taxpayers subject to the tax were entitled to a direct tax credit on any louisiana severance tax owed in connection with the extraction of natural resources within the state.see id.at.most louisiana consumers of offshore gas were eligible for tax credits and exemptions,but the tax applied in full to offshore gas moving through and out of state.see id.at.noting that the state severance tax credit favor ed those who both own offshore gas and engage in louisiana production and that the obvious economic effect of this severance tax credit was to encourage natural gas owners involved in the production of offshore gas to invest in mineral exploration and development within louisiana rather than to invest in further offshore development or in production in other states,the court held that the statute unquestionably discriminate d against interstate commerce in favor of local interests.id.at.
in westinghouse electric tully,d,the supreme court invalidated a new york franchise tax that gave corporations an income tax credit based on the portion of their exports shipped from new york.under the law,income from a subsidiary engaged exclusively in exports was to be combined with the income of its parent company for state tax purposes.see id.at.in an effort to provide an incentive to increase export activity in new york,the parent company was given a partially offsetting credit against income tax attributable to the subsidiary income generated from new york exports.see id.because the credit was based on the ratio of the subsidiary new york exports to its income from all export shipments,a company overall new york tax liability would decrease as exports from new york increased relative to exports from other states.conversely,a company new york tax liability increased when exports from new york decreased relative to exports from other states.see id.at.the court found that the tax scheme penalize d increases in the export shipping activities in other states,id.at,and that it was therefore a discriminatory tax that advantaged new york firms by placing a discriminatory burden on commerce to its sister states.id.at.quoting boston stock exchange,at.
analogizing to the provisions considered in boston stock exchange,maryland louisiana,and westinghouse,the plaintiffs argue that the investment tax credit at issue here encourages the development of local business through the use of ohio power to tax an operation as a means of requiring other business operations to be performed in the home state.boston stock,at.quoting bruce church,at.thus,they contend that like the tax credit in maryland louisiana,the economic effect of the ohio investment tax credit is to encourage further investment at the expense of development in other states and that the result is to hinder free trade among the states.boston stock,at.
the defendants maintain that the supreme court opinions should be read narrowly to hold that tax incentives,like the ohio tax credit,are permissible as long as they do not penalize economic activity,citing philip tatarowicz rebecca,an analytical approach to state tax discrimination under the commerce clause,vand,elaborating upon and applying this distinction to the court precedents.in their view,the commerce clause is primarily concerned with preventing economic is,regulatory measures designed to benefit local interests by burdening commerce.according to their theory,the only tax credits and exemptions that would run afoul of the commerce clause fall into two categories those that function like a tariff by placing a higher tax upon business or products and those that penalize economic activity by relying on both the taxpayer and activities to determine the taxpayer effective tax rate.
although it is arguably possible to fit certain of the supreme court cases into this framework,it is clear that the court itself has not adopted this approach in analyzing dormant commerce clause cases,undoubtedly because it rests on the distinction between laws that benefit activity and laws that burden activity.such a distinction is tenuous in light of the court acknowledgment that v irtually every discriminatory statute allocates benefits or burdens unequally each can be viewed as conferring a benefit on one party and a detriment on the other,in either an absolute or relative sense.bacchus imports,at.indeed,economically speaking,the effect of a tax benefit or burden is the same.moreover,the court command to examine the practical effect of challenged tax schemes suggests that constitutionality should not depend upon whether one focuses upon the benefited or the burdened party.see also westinghouse,at.nor is it relevant that new york discriminates against business carried on outside the state by disallowing a tax credit rather than by imposing a higher tax.
although the defendants liken the investment tax credit to a direct subsidy,which would no doubt have the same economic effect,the court has intimated that attempts to create location incentives through the state power to tax are to be treated differently from direct subsidies despite their similarity in terms of economic impact.the majority in new energy noted in dicta that subsidies do not ordinarily run afoul of the commerce clause because they are not generally connect ed with the state regulation of interstate commerce.new energy,at.see also west lynn creamery,at.we have never squarely confronted the constitutionality of subsidies,and we need not do so now.we have,however,not
