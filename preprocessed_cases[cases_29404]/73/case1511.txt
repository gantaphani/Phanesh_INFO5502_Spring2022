in an action against a city for allegedly imposing and collecting a general tax on its residents without the voter approval mandated by proposition,when does the statute of limitations begin to run defendant,the city of la habra the city,contends the statute started to run on the date the city enacted its ordinance authorizing the tax.plaintiffs,three taxpayer advocacy groups and three la habra taxpayers,argue the statute began to run when this court,in santa clara county local transportation authority guardino cal th,d,guardino,declared proposition to be constitutional.in the alternative,plaintiffs argue the limitations period starts to run anew each month when the tax is collected.the lower courts agreed with the city and held untimely plaintiffs action to establish the tax invalidity and prevent its continued collection,which action was filed more than three years after the ordinance enactment.
we agree with plaintiffs second contention we conclude that if,as alleged,the tax is illegal,its continued imposition and collection is an ongoing violation,upon which the limitations period begins anew with each collection.we therefore find the action for declaratory judgment and writ of mandate timely consequently,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeal,which affirmed the trial court dismissal of the action.
background 
in november,the voters approved proposition,a statewide initiative providing,inter alia,that local governments may not impose any general tax until that tax is submitted to the electorate and approved by a majority of voters.a few years after the passage of proposition,an appellate court declared its voter approval requirements unconstitutional.city of woodlake logan d.provisions requiring submission of new local taxes to voters unconstitutionally imposed referendums on tax measures.
in december,the city adopted la habra ordinance the ordinance,establishing a utility users tax to raise revenue for general governmental purposes.the ordinance became effective immediately upon its enactment,though it was not operative until may.the city did not submit the ordinance to the voters for approval.
in september,we issued our opinion in guardino,supra,cal th,d.rejecting claims that the voter approval requirements of proposition established an unconstitutional referendum system for tax enactments see cal,art.ii,subd.a,we held invalid a tax imposed without the required voter approval.guardino at,d.
on march,more than three years after the ordinance was adopted,jarvis taxpayers association,against city tax,paul gann citizens committee,and three individuals described as citizens,voters and taxpayers of the city of la habra filed the instant action against the city and the auditor controller of the county of orange the county for declaratory relief code civ,taxpayers injunctive relief code civ,and ordinary mandamus code civ.the complaint sought a declaration that the city utility tax was invalid under government code section,an injunction against its enforcement,and a writ of mandate compelling the city to cease collecting the tax until approved by a majority of the voters.it also sought to compel the county to withhold from the city share of property tax revenues the amounts collected under the utility tax.see.finally,plaintiffs prayed for any other relief deemed proper,including,but not limited to,refunds of past taxes collected in violation of law.
the city demurred on the grounds the action was barred by the statute of limitations applicable to a liability created by statute code civ,subd.a,and the taxpayers injunctive relief cause of action failed to allege an illegal expenditure of public funds code civ.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and entered judgment in favor of the city.although it decried the city conduct in not having held an election,the court concluded the limitations period commenced when the ordinance was enacted in december.
the court of appeal affirmed,agreeing with the city and the trial court that the limitation period commenced with the ordinance enactment first,expressly disagreeing with the decision in mcbrearty city of brawley th,d,the appellate court rejected plaintiffs argument that accrual of plaintiffs causes of action was deferred until the filing of guardino,supra,cal th,d,due to the existence,before that time,of appellate decisions holding proposition unconstitutional.second,the lower court disagreed with plaintiffs contention that their causes of action accrue continually as the tax is collected and paid.the gravamen of plaintiffs complaint is the legality of the adoption of an ordinance imposing a utility tax without complying with the voter approval requirements of proposition.the legality of that act must be timely challenged and can not be said to accrue continuously with each month utility bill.the court of appeal affirmed the dismissal on demurrer.
we granted plaintiffs petition for review.
discussion 
in reviewing a judgment of dismissal after a demurrer is sustained without leave to amend,we must assume the truth of all facts properly pleaded by the plaintiffs,as well as those that are judicially noticeable.blank kirwan cal d.here the issue is purely legal the city argues the statute of limitations began to run on the date the ordinance was adopted plaintiffs argue for a later date of accrual or for continuous accrual.
government code section provides no local government may impose any general tax unless and until such general tax is submitted to the electorate of the local government and approved by a majority vote of the voters voting in an election on the issue.that this is a general tax,imposed for general fund purposes,is undisputed,nor is there any dispute that the city failed to comply with the statutory mandate before it imposed its utility tax.
also undisputed is that this action is one upon a liability created by statute,to which a limitation period applies.code civ,subd.a.as no different time of commencement is stated,the limitations period began when plaintiffs cause of action accrued.code civ.generally,a cause of action accrues and the statute of limitation begins to run when a suit may be maintained.citations.ordinarily this is when the wrongful act is done and the obligation or the liability arises,but it does not accrue until the party owning it is entitled to begin and prosecute an action thereon.citation.in other words,a cause of action accrues upon the occurrence of the last element essential to the cause of action.citations.county of san diego myers d.
delayed accrual 
it would appear a cause of action to challenge the validity of the city utility tax first arose when the ordinance was adopted,that being the first act allegedly in violation of government code section.plaintiffs,however,contend that accrual of the cause of action was delayed until the filing of guardino,supra,cal th,d,when the sole justification for not submitting the city utility tax to the voters for supposed unconstitutionality of proposition was removed.at that time,plaintiffs assert,the city became obligated to hold an election.
plaintiffs find support in mcbrearty city of brawley,supra,th,d mcbrearty,for their contention that they had no cause of action against the city until this court issued its opinion in guardino,supra,cal th,d.in mcbrearty,as here,the defendant city adopted a utility tax ordinance without seeking voter approval.at the time of adoption,the court of appeal in city of woodlake logan,supra,d,had declared proposition unconstitutional,but we had not yet disapproved that decision in guardino.after our decision in guardino was filed,and more than three years after the ordinance imposing the tax was adopted,a citizen petitioned for a writ of mandate compelling the city to put the tax to a vote.mcbrearty,at,d.the appellate court ruled the cause of action did not arise until guardino was decided.it reasoned that,under the controlling case law prior to guardino,the city had no duty to submit the measure to a vote,and the plaintiff therefore had no valid basis for seeking mandamus relief until guardino overruled woodlake.mcbrearty at,d.
the rationale of mcbrearty is inconsistent with the principle that a change in the substantive case law governing a cause of action does not revive a claim otherwise barred by the statute of limitations.see jolly eli lilly cal d,jolly see also monroe trustees of the california state colleges cal d,monroe civil decisions do not supersede the operation of the statute of limitations so as to revive old claims which were not pursued because of a previously prevailing contrary rule of law id.at,fn,the mere existence of a contrary precedent has never been considered sufficient to toll the running of the statute of limitations.
jolly,supra,cal d,is closely on point.the plaintiff had delayed bringing suit for injuries resulting from her mother use of des while the plaintiff was in utero because she could not identify the specific manufacturer of the drug supplied to her mother.appellate case law prevailing at the time the plaintiff discovered the facts creating her cause of action mccreery eli lilly d.held a plaintiff in such a case must identify the precise manufacturer of the drug.we disapproved mccreery in sindell abbott laboratories cal d,see jolly at,holding a plaintiff who was harmed by des and who was unable to identify the particular manufacturer could state a cause of action by joining defendants that manufactured a substantial percentage of the market share of the drug.jolly filed her suit less than one year after sindell,but more than one year after her action would ordinarily be deemed to have accrued.she attempted to avoid the bar of the statute of limitations by arguing that the issuance of the court opinion in sindell was what started the limitations period running.jolly at.
we rejected the claim of delayed accrual,observing that the principle that a change in the law does not revive stale claims,though sometimes working harsh results,encourages people to bring suit to change a rule of law with which they disagree,fostering growth and preventing legal stagnation.jolly,supra,cal d at.a contrary rule,we further noted,would allow virtually unlimited litigation every time precedent changed.id.at.
the mcbrearty court acknowledged the principle articulated in monroe,supra,cal d at pages,and jolly,supra,cal d,but declined to apply it because strict application of the general rule in this case would have required mcbrearty to bring a lawsuit challenging the validity of the tax at a time when the legal landscape suggested her only chance of success would be upon review of the issue by the california supreme court.short of such a herculean effort,the city could at no time have been compelled to conduct an election for the tax in question.mcbrearty,supra,th at,d.
we properly rejected the same reasoning in jolly,where the plaintiff,as in mcbrearty and the case at bench,would have faced an adverse court of appeal decision,one later overruled by our decision in sindell abbott laboratories,supra,cal d.p laintiff legal situation was not as dismal as it initially appears.first,she was in no worse a position than judith sindell,who ultimately prevailed in changing the law although mccreery eli lilly,supra,d,appeared to foreclose such a suit,that case was an intermediate appellate court decision.in this regard,the last word on the subject had not been spoken,and other courts of appeal were free to disregard that case.therefore,plaintiff was not entirely forestalled,even as a practical matter,from bringing a timely suit.jolly,supra,cal d at.
here too,plaintiffs may have been discouraged by an adverse appellate decision,but were in no manner precluded from bringing an action against the city at the time of the ordinance enactment.not only were they in no worse a position jolly,supra,cal d at,than the plaintiffs in guardino,who ultimately succeeded in changing the law,but one of them,the howard jarvis taxpayers association,was itself a plaintiff in guardino.see guardino,supra,cal th at,d.plaintiffs were free to challenge the tax when it was first imposed,and might,as in guardino,have obtained a favorable result in the court of appeal despite the adverse city of woodlake logan decision supra,d.see guardino at,d.failing that,they could have sought review here.obtaining review of a decision of the court of appeal on a recurring matter of statewide concern is simply not the herculean labor the mcbrearty court supposed.mcbrearty,supra,th at,d see cal.rules of court,rule review will be ordered where it appears necessary to secure uniformity of decision or the settlement of important questions of law.therefore,plaintiff was not entirely forestalled,even as a practical matter,from bringing a timely suit.jolly,at.
in a variation of their claim,plaintiffs contend that,in the absence of voter approval,the city has never enacted its utility tax ordinance at all,making it impossible for plaintiffs to challenge the enactment immediately.plaintiffs rest this argument on two passages from the court opinion in guardino.in distinguishing proposition voter approval process from a referendum,we described the former process as follows as we have seen,the sections prescribing the voter approval requirements of the measure,declare that no local entity may impose a general or special tax unless and until the tax is submitted to and approved by the required proportion of the electorate.it is apparent that if a tax is not deemed imposed which in this context means enacted unless and until it is approved by the voters,the approval is a precondition to such enactment.without that approval,the measure will not take other words,will not become law.guardino,supra,cal th at,d.b ecause the electorate votes on the measure before it is enacted,a favorable vote does not lift the stay of an effective date that the ordinance never had rather,it is only after that vote has been held that the ordinance is enacted,acquires an effective date,and becomes law.id.at,d.
unlike plaintiffs,we do not read these passages as suggesting that a tax put into force without the required voter approval has never been enacted or imposed and therefore can not be challenged as to its validity.no question regarding the timeliness or ripeness of such actions being before us in guardino,we did not express any opinion as to when such actions might first be brought.our description of the voter approval process was of the process as it operates under the statutes,not of the result when,as allegedly happened here,the statutory process was bypassed.that under proposition a local tax may not validly be imposed without voter approval does not imply that,when a city disregards the approval requirement in imposing a tax,the imposition has never happened and thus may not be challenged.indeed,a remedial provision of proposition clearly implies to the contrary.see,if any local government or district imposes any tax without complying with the requirements of this article,the amount of property tax revenue allocated to the jurisdiction shall be reduced by one dollar for each one dollar of revenue attributable to such tax for each year that the tax is collected.nothing in this section shall impair the right of any citizen or taxpayer to maintain an action to invalidate any tax imposed in violation of this article.
ii.continuous accrual 
finding plaintiffs claim of delayed accrual without merit,we next consider their claim of continuous accrual.plaintiffs contend that even if the ordinance original enactment was an event giving rise to a cause of action,it was not the only such event.the city continued collection of a tax now known to be invalid and its simultaneous continued refusal to hold an election are,they claim,ongoing violations of proposition,continuously giving rise to a cause of action to invalidate the tax.
the city,in answer,contends that t he injury that plaintiffs are clearly addressing in their present action is the enactment of the ordinance without voter approval,not the subsequent payments in compliance with the already enacted ordinance.the city claims t he right which plaintiffs are attempting to enforce is the right to vote on new taxes the accrual of plaintiffs cause of action with respect to that right occurred at the time the ordinance at issue was adopted the consequence of that tax,the collection of money from taxpayers each month,does not constitute a new or further injury which somehow tolls the running of the statute of limitations in this case.
plaintiffs reply that they are seeking redress for two types of injury the violation of their right to vote on new taxes,and the city continued collection of the tax without valid legal authority.the city is under no compulsion to continue collecting the tax,they note,and e very month the city chooses to send out another round of bills and collect more money without voter approval,it commits a new injury.
although plaintiffs have,throughout this action and appeal,emphasized the allegedly improper enactment of the ordinance,we find well taken their contention that they have,as well,complained of,and sought redress for,the city continued collection of the allegedly unauthorized tax.thus,in their complaint they allege the city imposed the utility tax b eginning in,and that it is currently imposed at a rate of.the taxpayer plaintiffs allegedly have paid one or more of the challenged taxes within one year before the commencement of this action.the city refusal to submit the tax to a vote allegedly evidences the city belief no vote is required and demonstrates that a n actual controversy exists between the city and plaintiffs.the taxpayer plaintiffs claim to have no adequate remedy at law for the harm which will be caused by defendant city continued imposition of the taxes at issue in this case or for the harm which will be caused by defendant city continued refusal to seek voter approval for its utility tax.by continuing to impose the general tax at issue in this case,plaintiffs allege,defendant city is failing to perform the legal duties required of it by proposition.italics added throughout.in their prayer for relief,they seek not only a declaration of the tax invalidity,but also a writ of mandate commanding defendant city to cease collecting its utility tax or submit it to the voters for approval.finally,as noted earlier,plaintiffs pray for other appropriate relief,including refunds of past taxes collected in violation of law.
true,plaintiffs have refrained from pursuing their refund claim in this action.in the trial court,counsel for plaintiffs conceded that,while they had prayed for a refund,we are not all that serious about it.we are more serious about the vote.in a brief filed in the court of appeal,plaintiffs noted that they had prayed for refunds,but in their opening brief in this court they state without qualification that plaintiff taxpayers are not seeking a refund of the taxes they have already paid 
plaintiffs have,however,consistently claimed the city continued collection of its utility tax is illegal,and have consistently sought equitable remedies and writ relief to prevent further illegal collections.the question is whether,having abandoned their refund claim,they have timely sought such prospective,a declaration of the tax invalidity and a writ ordering the city to cease collecting the tax or put it to a on the city recent and continuing collection of the tax.the city,indeed,does not dispute that the action would be timely as to individual payments of the tax the disputed point is whether plaintiffs,having essentially abandoned any claim for refund,may nonetheless base the timeliness of their cause of action for declaratory relief and petition for writ of mandate,both challenging the validity of the ordinance enactment and continued collection,on the tax ongoing collection.
we agree with plaintiffs that the lack of an outstanding refund claim in this case is a distinction without a difference,for it does not affect the choice or application of the statute of limitations to plaintiffs claims for mandamus and declaratory relief.both mandamus and declaratory judgment are remedies available to enforce a variety of obligations choice of the statute of limitations applicable to these remedies depends on the right or obligation sought to be enforced,and the statute application generally follows its application to actions for damages or injunction on the same rights and obligations.see witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions.thus,a declaratory judgment action or mandate petition to enforce a statutory liability must be brought within the same period after accrual of the cause of action code civ,subd.a as an action for damages or injunction on the same liability.abbott city of los angeles cal d,dillon board of pension commrs.cal d.plaintiffs causes of action for a declaration of the currently collected tax invalidity and for a writ of mandate to prevent future collection of the tax are no more barred by the statute of limitations than would be an action for refund of taxes paid.
that plaintiffs could have brought an action for declaratory judgment at the time of the ordinance enactment,before the city began actually collecting its tax,does not imply such an action was untimely because brought later,at a time when the city had collected the tax for some years and was continuing to do so.so long as an action for refund or injunction could have been brought during the period of continued collection,so could an action for declaratory relief.we explained the applicable principle in a case involving a city continuing statutory obligation to pay pensions calculated on a certain basis i f declaratory relief is sought within the statutory period after the breach,the right to such relief is not barred by lapse of time.here,as we have seen,the statutory time limitation upon the right to sue for each pension instalment commences to run from the time when that instalment falls due.it follows that even though plaintiffs might have earlier brought suit for declaratory relief their failure to do so does not operate to bar their right to declaratory relief with respect to future pension payments abbott city of los angeles,supra,cal d at,quoting maguire hibernia soc.cal d.
in short,plaintiffs have alleged an ongoing violation of proposition commands,for which they seek relief in mandamus code civ,subd.a,and a presently existing actual controversy between themselves and the city over the validity of the utility tax,which they seek to resolve by declaratory judgment code civ,those causes of action are not barred merely because similar claims could have been made at earlier times as to earlier violations,or because plaintiffs do not at this time also seek a refund of taxes paid.
the principal cases relied on by defendant and the court of appeal to defeat the theory of continuous accrual,none involving tax collection,are materially distinguishable.
in dillon board of pension,supra,cal d at pages,dillon,we held a mandamus action to compel payment of a widow pension was barred because it was not brought within three years of her husband death,even though,as we acknowledged,the right to receive a pension is a continuing one.our holding depended,however,on the premise that the plaintiff could not establish the right to a pension in an action to compel payment of a particular installment an action to determine the existence of the right thus necessarily precedes and is distinct from an action to recover instalments which have fallen due after the pension has been granted.id.at.we are aware of no comparable rule requiring an action to invalidate a tax be brought before,and separately from,an action for relief from particular payments of the tax.indeed,in the absence of an independent bar on equitable or writ relief a person aggrieved by the required payment of a tax is not limited to seeking a refund,but may challenge the validity of the taxing agency policy or continuing conduct by a claim for declaratory relief.agnew state bd.of equalization cal th,d,see,brown county of los angeles th,d t he availability to brown of an action at law for a refund is not a bar to a declaratory judgment in her favor without a declaratory judgment,the county could continue to tax her at the wrong rate.unlike in dillon,then,plaintiffs failure to establish the tax invalidity within three years of its enactment does not preclude them from complaining,on grounds of suc
