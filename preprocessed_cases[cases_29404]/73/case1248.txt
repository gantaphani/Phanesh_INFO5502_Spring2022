jack carl ryals ryals appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the united states of america the government on its complaint,and the court dismissal of certain counts,and summary judgment on other counts,of ryals counterclaim.the government filed suit against ryals seeking to reduce certain tax assessments to judgment.ryals filed a counterclaim for tax refunds.
the lower court granted the government motion for summary judgment,dismissed counts one through eight of the counterclaim on the basis that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to entertain them,and granted summary judgment for the government on counts nine and ten the remaining counts of the counterclaim.ryals argues that summary judgment was improvidently granted because the applicable statute of limitations had expired prior to the government suit.ryals also asserts that the lower court erred when it dismissed the counterclaim,finding that ryals did not follow the proper administrative claim procedure as a prerequisite to his first eight claims,and as to the final two counts of the counterclaim,that ryals had not shown he had overpaid any tax and was not entitled to exemption from levy.finding no error in the lower court decision,we affirm.
background 
ryals failed to pay his federal income taxes for the and tax years.in,the united states tax court entered a finding that ryals was liable for deficiencies in income tax and statutory additions for the and tax years.in june of,notices of the assessment and demand for payment were issued to ryals.the total amount of deficiencies,statutory additions and interest assessed was.
despite the notices of the assessment and demand for payment,ryals did not pay the federal income tax assessed for and.by march,he owed the sum of for these two tax years.
between the notices of the assessment and march,ryals,who had previously been convicted of a criminal tax offense,submitted two offers in compromise to the internal revenue service irs.the first offer in compromise was presented on august,and related to the and tax years.the offer in compromise was presented on a form that provided that the statute of limitations on an assessment would be suspended during the period that the offer was pending and for one year thereafter.by letter dated july,ryals appealed an initial rejection of the offer,but on january,he faxed and mailed a withdrawal of the offer,requesting that the irs the running of the tax collection statute expiration date.notwithstanding the january,communication,the offer was finally rejected on january.
on june,ryals submitted a second offer in compromise that also related to the and federal income tax liabilities assessed.he appealed an initial rejection of that second offer by letter dated july.the second offer was finally rejected on march.
each offer in compromise was submitted to the irs on form.subsection m of form contains the following pertinent language the offer is pending starting with the date an authorized irs official signs this form and accepts waiver of the statutory period of limitation.the offer remains pending until an authorized irs official accepts,rejects,returns or acknowledges withdrawal of the offer in writing.doc,exs.a c emphasis added furthermore,subsection n provides that t he waiver and suspension of any statutory periods of limitation for assessment continue s to apply while the offer is pending and for one additional year id.an authorized irs official signed each of the forms submitted.
during the offer in compromise process and thereafter,ryals maintained that the revenue officer had improperly failed to allow him a statutory exemption amount under a because the officer was erroneously imputing income to him.thus,in may,ryals submitted forms,amended united states individual income tax returns,seeking the refund of amounts he maintained had been improperly and unlawfully seized by the irs and applied to his tax deficiencies from to.ryals and his wife had filed joint federal income tax returns for the tax years through.while the forms that ryals sent in may appear to have been received by the irs,they were returned to ryals because they included only ryals signature and social security number,not his wife.the refund claims were returned to ryals without processing by the irs.
ryals and his wife also filed joint federal income tax returns for the and tax years.in september,ryals filed a form also missing his wife signature for the years and,seeking a return of what he again maintained were illegally seized earnings.on april,he filed a second set of forms and included his wife signature.on may,the irs disallowed the claims in full.
the government filed suit on may,seeking payment of the federal income taxes assessed by the tax court for the years and.the sum requested was,plus fees and interest from march.among the defenses raised by ryals was a statute of limitations defense.he also presented a counterclaim seeking refund of taxes he maintained had been erroneously and illegally collected for the years to.the total demand in the counterclaim was,plus interest and costs.each count corresponded to a different tax year.
the district court entered judgment on december.this appeal was timely filed.
ii.standard of review 
the parties agree that each of the issues presented involves a question of law subject to de novo review.see broughton.int l underwriters,cir.the construction of federal statutes,including statutes of limitations,is a question of law.see united states gibson,cir.furthermore,an order granting summary judgment is reviewed de novo.see dixon burke county,cir.
iii.analysis 
tolling of the statute of limitations by the offers in compromise 
ryals first asserts that the lower court erred in concluding that the complaint for collection after assessments was timely filed.the lower court decision,and this court de novo review of that issue,depends on a detailed review of the facts presented as applied to several revisions in the applicable statutes.before embarking on that review,it bears noting that statutes of limitations that bar the collection of taxes otherwise due and unpaid,as they are here,are strictly construed in favor of the government.see atl.land improvement united states,cir see also lucia united states,cir a period of limitations runs against the collection of taxes only because the government,through congressional action,has consented to such a defense.absent government consent,no limitations defense exists.citations omitted.
when a taxpayer fails to pay assessed taxes after notice and demand,the government may bring a suit to reduce the assessment to judgment.see.under a the government has ten years from the date of an assessment to collect a federal tax liability by bringing suit.
offers in compromise operate as one way to suspend the running of the statute of limitations.see k and i.offers in compromise contain a waiver of the limitations period in order to enable the government to consider the offer without the prejudice resulting from a running of the limitations period against collection of the tax.see united states ressler,cir citations omitted.the running of the statutory period is suspended until the offer of compromise is terminated,withdrawn,or formally rejected.id.citation omitted.furthermore,one additional year is added to the suspension period in accordance with the parties agreement as contained in the forms used by the taxpayer and the irs here.
an attempted withdrawal of an offer in compromise by the taxpayer,as ryals attempted to effect with his offer,becomes effective only once an authorized irs official returns or acknowledges withdrawal of the offer in writing,as is stated in the form submitted.see also united states donovan,cir offer ceases to be pending for purposes of statute of limitations when irs officer,in writing,accepts,rejects or acknowledges withdrawal of the offer.while ryals certainly communicated his withdrawal of the first offer in compromise,no written acknowledgment of the withdrawal by an irs official was ever made.
ryals tax liabilities were assessed on june,and this event triggered the statute of limitations.in the absence of any offers in compromise or statutory provisions altering the period,the statute of limitations on collection would have expired on june.a little less than two years before the expiration of the limitations period,on august,the first offer in compromise was submitted.this offer had the effect of suspending the statute of limitations for the time it was pending,plus one additional year.the appeals office rejected the first offer on january.thus,the limitations period was extended by three years,five months and seven days,from the original deadline of june,to november.
however,just over one month was added to this extension by congress passage,during the pendency of the first offer,of the internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of reform act,c stat.the reform act took effect on january,and applied to requests to extend the period of limitations made after december.see reform act at c,stat.as to requests to extend the limitations period made on or before december,however,the reform act amended section a and provided that where a taxpayer agreed to extend such period beyond the period contained in section a of the internal revenue code of,the extension would expire on the latest of the last day of the period december,or the day after the end of the period of an extension in the case of an extension in connection with an installment agreement.see reform act at c,stat.because here the first offer was presented before december,and the last day of the period was june,the effect of the reform act was to extend the november,deadline previously computed to december,the latest of the three possible dates set forth in the reform act section c.see,united states elton,d,applying reform act.
analysis of the relevant events and relevant statutes for tolling purposes does not end here,however.on june,also after the effect of the reform act,ryals submitted his second offer in compromise.this offer remained pending until march,when it was rejected.several additional statutory provisions govern the effect this second offer had on the expiration of the statute of limitations.
another change in the reform act,which operates to suspend the statute of limitations on collection while an offer in compromise made on or after december,is pending,is the addition of section k.under k,which was added by,b,stat,the irs is prohibited from making a levy on property or the rights to property of a person with respect to an unpaid tax while an offer in compromise by such person is pending,or if the offer is rejected,during the days thereafter an offer in compromise is pending beginning on the date the secretary accepts the offer for processing.id.pursuant to section i,the period of limitations is suspended while the irs is prohibited from making a levy,and section k provides that rules similar to section i apply.because ryals second offer was accepted for processing on june,section k applied to suspend the statute of limitations from june,to april.
later statutory enactments also apply to the determination of how this second offer in compromise served to extend the statute of limitations.these are the community renewal tax relief act of renewal act,stat.and the job creation and worker assistance act of worker assistance act,e,stat.effective december,the renewal act eliminated the statutory suspension of the limitations period therefore,the second offer suspended the limitations period only from june,through december,the effective date of the renewal act.the worker assistance act,effective on march,reinstated the statutory suspension thereby tolling the limitations period until march,the date the irs rejected the second offer.
thus,a total of six months and nine days of suspension,from june,to december,plus three days from march,to march,are added to the suspension period derived by operation of the first offer in compromise.each of the statutory amendments discussed applies to the second offer,and section a of the reform act applies to the first offer,because the forms that ryals executed specifically reference any statutory periods of limitation,and the statutes at issue were each enacted before expiration of the limitations period s agreed upon.see foutz united states,cir t he form that taxpayer signed expressly referenced extending the statutory period.treating the waiver not as a contract but as an extension of the statute of limitations,the amendments were made before the time for collection had expired.because the first offer served to toll or suspend the statutory limitations period until december,and adding six months and nine days to that date extends the period until july,the suit was timely filed on may.
ryals raises two principal arguments in support of his position that the suit is not timely.the first is that the reform act had absolutely no effect on the original tax collection statute of limitations expiration date,and thus did not extend the suspension period of the first offer in compromise from november,to december.this argument is premised on ryals attempting to discern congressional intent in first limiting reform act,and then eliminating renewal act,and then reinstating worker assistance act,the tolling or suspension associated with offers in compromise in the various statutes discussed above.the argument,ryals insists,finds support in regulations promulgated during the relevant time period,and even in the initial position the government expressed in its motion for summary judgment.
the second argument is that because the irs did not suspend its collection activities while the second offer in compromise was pending,the collection statute of limitations was not suspended.this argument is premised on the language of the applicable statute and regulation.
addressing ryals first argument,the lower court correctly discerned the effect of the reform act on the first offer in compromise,because it applied the clear words used in the statute.the reform act certainly limited the government ability to contractually extend the statute of limitations.however,as to requests to extend the period of limitation made before december,as this one was,that remained pending on december,a sunset provision stated that the statute of limitations expires on the latest of a the last day of the period b december,or c in the case of an extension in connection with an installment agreement,the day after the end of the period of such extension.see reform act,c,stat,emphasis added.this express statutory language applied to the first offer in compromise.whether or not such a construction is at odds with temporary regulations issued congressional intent,or the initial position of the government as stated in its motion for summary is irrelevant because the clear words of the statute command this result.see united states orozco,cir where a statute language is plain,the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms citations omitted.
ryals second argument is that the statute of limitations on the irs collection suit should not be considered suspended during the pendency of his second offer in compromise from june,to march,because the irs continued collection activities during that period of time in violation of the relevant statute.in,the irs issued a wage to ryals employer,and payments from his employer have been sent to the irs since that time.the wage levy issued by the irs in continued in effect throughout the pendency of ryals second offer in compromise.
ryals argument that the statute of limitations should not be considered suspended during the pendency of his second offer in compromise is based on the interplay between two provisions of.the first one,contained in section k a,provides that no levy may be made on the property of any person with respect to any unpaid the period that an by such person is pending with the secretary.the second one,contained in section i provides that the period of limitations under section shall be suspended for the period during which the secretary is prohibited from making a levy.relying on these two provisions,ryals argues that,to the extent the irs continued to levy on his property his paychecks during t
