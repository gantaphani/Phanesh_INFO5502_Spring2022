discussion 
whether the district court erred in determining the government was liable to as a matter of law under when it filed certain liens in.
we review de novo the question of whether the district court erred in finding the government was liable to as a matter of law.see moulton city of beaumont,cir.
on appeal,the government maintains the district court erred when it concluded that was entitled to recover under as a matter of law.specifically,the government argues the district court improperly concluded liability had been established either in the district court first order,or by this court opinion in gandy i.the government suggests that while the district court made numerous findings in its first order,none of these findings specifically addressed whether there was a specific violation of the internal revenue code the code when the government filed certain liens against in april and september of the government further contends that nowhere in the language of this court opinion in gandy i is there a determination that the government violated when it filed the liens.moreover,according to the government,the district court on remand failed to substantively address any liability issues relating to and the liens.the government maintains that the absence of such support in the record renders the district court finding of liability under to be without foundation and therefore erroneous.
appellees,meanwhile,argue the district court supplied the necessary findings supporting its liability determination for the liens filed in in both its first order and its order on remand.in addition,appellees maintain that this court decision in gandy i also provides a finding of liability against the government.
in order to prevail under,a taxpayer must establish that the government recklessly or intentionally disregarded a provision of the code in connection with the collection of federal taxes.see a gandy i,at.we begin our analysis by reviewing the relevant portions of each of the previous orders issued by the courts in this proceeding to evaluate whether there has been a finding of liability against the government.in its first order,the district court states in its findings of fact 
the underlying taxes and penalties in regard to the tax liens had been paid by the appellees and the penalties associated with such taxes had been abated.
certain penalties that had been abated by the austin irs service center were again reassessed against the appellees without notice or demand as required under.
the irs office in tyler later reassessed penalties against the appellees and placed the penalties and interest back on the transcripts without providing proper notice and demand.

while the district court makes several explicit findings relating to the lien filed in by the government against dennis gandy as an individual,nowhere in the first order,however,does the district court mention the liens filed against,either expressly or impliedly.accordingly,in the absence of any other relevant findings,nothing in the district court first order can be read as supporting a liability determination against the government for the liens filed against in april and september.
appellees suggest that on the first appeal,this court previously made a liability determination against the government,and thus the issue is law of the case.the specific language relied upon by appellees focuses on a statement in a footnote that provides 
t estimony and other evidence in the record clearly shows that the irs filed a lien in april.there is also record evidence of a lien filed in september.
gandy i,at.without more,the above statement simply notes the existence of liens filed in and fails to even acknowledge against which entity those liens were filed.again,we can not interpret this language as supporting a specific finding of liability against the government for filing the liens against.
in another portion of this court prior opinion,the panel addressed appellees contention that they were entitled to recover under for the government failure to release the liens in addition to the recovery they sought under the same statute for the government initial filing of those liens.id.at.this court discussed in general terms how the filing of a lien can constitute an unauthorized collection activity under,but held that the failure to release such a lien can not.id.at.therefore,the court concluded,the district court should have considered damages with respect to the filing of the liens with respect to section.accordingly,these claims fit within the scope of section and therefore should be remanded to the district court for further adjudication.id.
admittedly,the directive to the district court to consider damages can arguably be read to assume that any underlying liability had been established.however,when read in conjunction with the remainder of the opinion,any perceived ambiguity is necessarily eliminated.specifically,the gandy i court,in its concluding paragraph,stated 
accordingly,we remand to the district court for further consideration regarding whether the filing of th
