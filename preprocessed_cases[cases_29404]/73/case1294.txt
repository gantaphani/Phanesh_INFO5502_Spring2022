this case involves the proper ratemaking treatment of opebs,benefits other than pensions,including health and life insurance for retirees,following a change in the method of accounting for them.at t corporation petitions for review of an order of the federal communications commission allowing verizon exogenous treatment of opeb costs by treating those costs as beyond verizon control even though verizon implemented the accounting change before the compliance deadline,and allowing local exchange carriers lecs,like intervenors verizon and bellsouth,to use their tariffs to rectify the consequences of an erroneous staff order that opeb liabilities be deducted from their rate bases.because the commission interpretation of its control test is consistent with precedent and because the commission approval of the tariffs placed the lecs in the position they would have been in had the staff not erred,we conclude that at t has failed to show that the commission rulings were arbitrary and capricious.accordingly,we deny the petition.
before,the commission set interstate access charges under a regime.lecs reported their costs to establish a rate base and the commission set prices that allowed lecs to earn a formulated rate of return on their capital.see rural telecom.ass fcc.in,the commission adopted a price cap regime.see second report and order,policy and rules concerning rates for dominant carriers,price cap order.carriers services are grouped into various baskets for which a maximum price,the price cap index pci,is determined.from the initial price cap,rates are adjusted annually based on inflation and expected productivity advances.unlike the system,costs do not generally affect the prices lecs may charge.thus,if carriers reduce costs,they earn greater profits than the set rate of return under the former system.see bell atlantic.fcc.
two exceptions by which costs affect the pci are relevant to this appeal.first,the exogenous costs rule allows carriers to adjust price caps to account for costs that are triggered by administrative,legislative or judicial action beyond the control of the carriers.price cap order,at.changes in generally accepted accounting principles gaap ordered by the financial accounting standards board fasb can be treated exogenously if the commission determines the changes are compatible with its regulatory accounting needs.id.second,the sharing rules repealed in,see price cap performance review,require a carrier whose rate of return on its rate base is abnormally high to share a portion of the excess with ratepayers,like at t,by reducing its pci for the following year,a check harkening back to the regime.see bell atlantic,at.
in december,the fasb adopted,which requires carriers to account for opeb obligations in the year in which they accrue rather than when they are paid.see financial accounting standards board,statement of financial accounting standards,employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions.the transition from cash to accrual accounting applied to ongoing amounts,the annual expense that a firm recognizes when its current employees earn retirement benefits to be paid in the future,and to the transitional benefit obligation,the unfunded opebs owed at the time of adopting.in,the common carrier bureau required lecs to implement because the change in gaap was consistent with the commission regulatory objectives and stated that t he effective date of is for fiscal years beginning after december,although earlier implementation is encouraged by the fasb.order,notification of intent to adopt sfas.
the accounting change presented both rate base and exogenous treatment issues.the bureau issued rao letter to lec accounting officers,explaining that because opebs are similar to pension expenses they should be given the same rate base treatment,such that the interstate portion of unfunded accrued opebs should be deducted from the rate base.rao letter,re uniform accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions in part,rao letter.in,the commission rescinded the rate base portion of rao letter on the ground that the bureau had exceeded its authority by adding an exclusion not provided for in the commission rate base rules.see order,rao letter.the following year,the commission,upon determining that the bureau had come to the right policy conclusion,amended its regulations to require that opebs be deducted from the rate base in future years.see report and order,rao letter.
through the exogenous cost feature of the ratemaking regime,several lecs sought in to increase their pcis to reflect the new costs booked as a result of.the commission rejected the rate increases on the ground that lecs can exercise substantial control over the level and timing of opeb expenses,such that the costs were not beyond the carriers control in a way that would justify exogenous treatment under commission rules.order,treatment of lec tariffs implementing sfas.in southwestern bell telephone fcc,the court concluded that the commission rejection was arbitrary and capricious because earlier orders showed that the commission meant for the control test to be satisfied simply by the fact of exogenous imposition of the accounting rule,without concern for the underlying costs covered by the rule.id.at.the court held that a fasb change adopted by the commission is not a change under control of the carrier,and,once mandated by the commission,the change satisfies the control criterion of the exogenous cost rule.id.
thereafter,the lecs renewed their requests for exogenous treatment for opeb adjustments in their tariffs.verizon,which had implemented in and it was approved by the commission but before the deadline for exogenous pci increases to recover opeb costs from those earlier years.see order,bell atlantic.tariff fcc.the common carrier bureau suspended the verizon tariffs for one day,imposed an accounting order,and began an investigation.id.at.while that investigation was pending,the commission adopted a rule that prohibited exogenous treatment of opebs in the future because they do not have or actual economic impact.see order,price cap performance review,price cap order.
after the commission rescinded rao letter,the lecs restated their rate bases for the years during which the letter had wrongly instructed them to deduct opebs from their rate bases.because they had incurred greater sharing obligations as a result of the exclusion of opebs during those years,the lecs sought in their tariffs a increase in their pcis as an exogenous cost to recoup the amount they lost as a result of complying with rao letter.see order,annual access tariff filings.the common carrier bureau suspended the tariffs for one day,imposed an accounting order,and began an investigation.see id.at.
the commission resolved these investigations in march.see order terminating investigation,annual access tariff filings phase,order.it approved verizon request for exogenous treatment of opeb costs incurred before january.the commission stated that it would apply the price cap rules in effect when the tariffs were filed,see id.at,whereby an accounting change proposed by the fasb was considered outside the control of carriers requiring exogenous treatment once it had been actually approved by the fasb and the commission had not objected within ninety days to a carrier notification that it would implement the change,see id.at.the commission concluded that verizon has justified exogenous treatment for accrued opeb costs for the years and because the costs were associated with implementing a change in the gaap that the commission had approved and had directed to be put into effect on or before january.id.at.rejecting at t view that verizon actually had control over the costs because it did not have to implement until the commission deadline of january,the commission explained that the real control test turned on whether the accounting change itself was mandated by the commission.id.at.verizon early implementation of the accordance with the encouragement of the fasb and the did not make its compliance with voluntary.
the commission also approved the lecs filings seeking exogenous
