this appeal concerns whether louisiana prestige license plate program facially discriminates against views in contravention of the first amendment.the program diverts excess charges over handling and ordinary registration fees for the plates to organizations endorsed by the legislature.because of this feature of the program,we conclude that we lack jurisdiction over the case because of the tax injunction act.
background 
a.the first appeal 
this case is on appeal for the second time.the plaintiffs originally filed suit seeking to have.ann,which authorized the adoption of a choose life prestige license plate,declared unconstitutional.the district court found louisiana prestige license plate program created a forum for speech that was not viewpoint neutral,granted both declaratory and injunctive relief,and certified the case for interlocutory appellate review.see henderson stalder henderson i,d.
on appeal,this court,sua sponte,concluded that the plaintiffs lacked standing.see henderson stalder,cir.see also,women emergency network bush,cir rejecting challenge to florida choose life plate for lack of standing.the court thus reversed,vacated,and remanded the case for an entry of dismissal.henderson,at.on petition for rehearing,however,the court slightly amended its decision by issuing an order,which reads in part the petition for rehearing is denied.the case is remanded to the district court with instructions to dismiss the case for lack of standing unless the plaintiff keeler amends her petition within a reasonable time to challenge the state overall policy and practice of issuing specialty license plates.henderson stalder,fed.appx,wl cir,unpublished order emphasis added.the district court vacated the previous judgment and allowed keeler to amend her complaint.
the third amended complaint named individuals henderson,keeler,loewy,and lamothe,and organizations national council of jewish women and planned parenthood of louisiana as plaintiffs,and each attempted to establish standing.see henderson stalder henderson ii,d.importantly,the third amended complaint raise d a first amendment facial challenge to the entire overall policy and practice under which louisiana makes available certain specially designed license plates for the expression of certain views by louisiana vehicle owners.id.the third amended complaint also raised new establishment clause claims.
the defendants moved to dismiss on several grounds,and the plaintiffs responded with a motion for partial summary judgment contesting the constitutionality of the license plate program.
the district court first determined that the fifth circuit mandate did not prevent each of the plaintiffs from attempting to reassert standing.see id.at.nevertheless,the district court dismissed all the plaintiffs,save keeler and ppl,for lack of standing based on the reasoning the fifth circuit provided.see id.at as to keeler,the court concluded that she sufficiently amended her complaint to present a viable facial challenge to the overall program.the district court also concluded that the amendments to keeler complaint cured the redressability problems that were fatal to ppl funding claim.furthermore,the district court dispatched the defendants argument that the tax injunction act barred the challenge.see id.at.
on the merits of keeler first amendment claim,the court again accepted keeler argument that the license plate program created a forum that permitted only some groups to express their chosen viewpoint.relying on the fourth circuit decision in sons of confederate veterans,commissioner,virginia of motor vehicles scv,cir,reh g en banc denied,cir,the district court held that louisiana prestige license plate program effectuated unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination and enjoined its enforcement the court refused to stay the enforcement of its ruling.this appeal ensued.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as did the district court.hodges delta airlines,cir en banc.
iii.discussion 
the defendants raise three principal arguments on appeal the district court exceeded the scope of its mandate by allowing ppl to amend its claim the tax injunction act bars the suit in its entirety and the prestige license plate program does not violate the first amendment.for reasons that will be obvious,we do not reach the merits of the case.
ppl standing 
the defendants rightly contend that the district court exceeded the scope of this court mandate by permitting ppl to seek to file a complaint on remand.t he mandate rule compels compliance on remand with the dictates of a superior court and forecloses relitigation of issues expressly or impliedly decided by the appellate court.united states lee,cir citing united states bell,cir.
the district court failed to abide by this rule.where,as here,further proceedings in the district court are specified in the mandate of the court of appeals,the district court is limited to holding such as are directed.crowe smith,cir citations and quotations omitted.this court order permitting keeler to amend her complaint must be read in light of the original decision in which the case was remanded only for entry of dismissal.henderson,at.this court narrowly altered that ruling on rehearing to permit keeler to add a facial challenge to the entire claim that was absent from her original complaint.this narrow amendment to the henderson ruling was not an invitation for keeler to add new claims or rationales for ppl standing.the appellate court might have explored other avenues by which ppl could establish standing,and might have included remand instructions to that end,but we did neither.judicial economy district court justification for its insufficient to overcome the appellate court express ruling.ppl is therefore dismissed from the suit.
tax injunction act 
the defendants next contend that the tax injunction act tia bars keeler first amendment challenge to the prestige license plate program.the tia prohibits a federal court from enjoining,suspending or restraining the assessment,levy or collection of any tax under state law where a plain,speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such state.keeler goal in this suit,and the remedy ordered by the district court,in fact enjoined the state collection of revenue for its entire specialty license plate program.nevertheless,the tia would not deprive federal courts of jurisdiction if a the fees charged by the state are not taxes for purposes of tia,or if b hibbs winn,d can be read to encompass this suit.although reasonable minds can differ on both questions,we are persuaded that the additional amounts that the state collects for specialty handling and ordinary vehicle registration indeed taxes rather than regulatory fees.further,hibbs interpretation of the tia does not contemplate or authorize a suit whose object is to diminish the flow of state revenues.the tia deprives the federal courts of jurisdiction over keeler claim.
a review of the program operation will illuminate further discussion.under louisiana law,the secretary of the department of public safety and corrections secretary and dps is charged with the task of issuing license plates for private passenger vehicles.see.ann.a a.this legislation also permits the secretary to issue special prestige license plates if the legislature so authorizes and certain administrative requirements are satisfied.id.a few rudimentary administrative requirements apply to all prestige plates 
other varying preconditions are included in the specific legislation authorizing the individual prestige license plates.for instance,there are monetary differences.more than half of the specialty plates are distributed in exchange for additional charges above the handling charge,and in many cases,like that of the choose life plates,the charges so collected are distributed to organizations as determined by the legislature.see henderson i,d at explaining that proceeds from choose life plates will be distributed to organizations that counsel women to place their children up for adoption.when such an additional charge is required,however,the amount varies from statute to statute.see,id.at no fee fee same fee as the regular motor vehicle registration license fee.moreover,the extra charge may recur annually or may be a charge.see,id.at charge annual charge.second,the moniker associated with the extra fee also varies.see,id.at fee royalty donation.finally,the allocation of the proceeds differs from statute to statute.see,id.at funds deposited in state treasury funds directed to louisiana environmental education fund funds directed to new orleans recreation department.
other distinctions less critical to this case exist among the statutes authorizing specialty plates.the statutes differ in the measure of editorial and aesthetic discretion afforded to the recipients and the secretary some,but not all,of the statutes require that a minimum number of purchasers apply for the specialty plates prior to their production.see,id.at no minimum applicant requirement for special plates honoring congressional medal of honor recipients conditioning the life center full gospel baptist cathedral plate on a minimum of one thousand applicants conditioning the choose life plate on a minimum of one hundred applicants.finally,beyond administrative and monetary distinctions,the statutes mandate different eligibility criteria to obtain specialty plates 
from keeler standpoint,the first basis for sustaining federal jurisdiction is that the additional charges louisiana citizens incur for specialty plates,above the handling charges and ordinary vehicle registration taxes,are fees,not taxes,hence the program is not covered by the tia.the district court so held,in part because the state statutes characterize the additional charges for the specialty plates as fees.on the contrary,what is a tax for purposes of the tia is a question of federal law on which a state legislative label has no bearing.home builders ass of.city of madison,cir.while this court has acknowledged that distinguishing a tax from a fee is often a difficult task,id.at,judge wisdom distilled the following workable distinctions from the caselaw 
the classic tax sustains the essential flow of revenue to the government,while the classic fee is linked to some regulatory scheme.the classic tax is imposed by a state or municipal legislature,while the classic fee is imposed by an agency upon those it regulates.the classic tax is designed to provide a benefit for the entire community,while the classic fee is designed to raise money to help defray an agency regulatory expenses.
home builders,id.omitting internal citations.this court added that a broad construction of tax is necessary to honor congress goals in promulgating the tia,including that of preventing delays in the collection of public revenues by state and local governments.id.citing tramel schrader,cir.
a few brief examples flesh out the distinction between a tax and regulatory fees.in hager city of west peoria,cir,the seventh circuit held that graduated fees on the weight of truckloads had been legislated to discourage heavy trucks from using a particular road and thus were passed to control certain activities,not to raise revenue.at.this court has,on the other hand,routinely characterized local improvement assessments imposed on a selected class of business as taxes,not fees,in line with the understanding that a tax embraces any extraction of property from a private person by a sovereign for its use.tramel,at.home builders reaffirmed this characterization of an impact fee ordinance,which was passed to enhance the provision of municipal services in a rapidly growing city,deeming it a tax in light of the broad public purpose to be served by the funds collected under it.at.
acknowledging this distinction,keeler relies on neinast texas,cir,in which this court found no tia bar to adjudicating handicapped persons challenge to a texas statutory fee for obtaining handicapped parking placards.revenue obtained from the fee was paid into the state highway fund for the purpose of defraying the cost of the handicapped placards.at.the court characterized fees,exempt from the tia,as charges imposed by an agency,not the legislature upon those it regulates,not the community as a whole and for the purpose of defraying regulatory costs,not simply for general purposes.id.while the first two criteria tugged in opposite directions,the court held that the fee was tagged for the benefit of the program itself,to reimburse the costs of the placards.this fact served to distinguish home builders.further,responding to an argument of the state,the court noted that the question is not where the money is deposited in general revenue or segregated accounts,but the purpose of the assessment.id.
keeler advances three reasons,allegedly rooted in neinast,to support her contention that the specialty plate program involves the payment of fees.first,she contends that because the program is administered by the motor vehicle unit of the department of public safety and corrections,the fees are charged by a regulatory agency.second,the charges are imposed only upon those that the scheme regulates,rather than upon the community as a whole or even the entire community.third,she asserts that the additional specialty plate fees are not simply imposed for purposes but are earmarked for very specific organizations and thus defray the cost of moneys expended to these special programs,which are not intended for the benefit of the entire community.these arguments are either logically attenuated from the facts or inconsistent with our governing caselaw.
first,the fees for louisiana specialty plates are directly set by the legislature,even though they are collected by a state agency motor vehicle unit.neinast concluded that an analogous feature of the handicapped parking fees suggested a tax.
second,the fact that specialty plate charges are paid by some,though not all,purchasers,much less all license plate purchasers,is suggestive of neinast,which held that the charge for handicapped placards represented in this respect a fee rather than a tax.on the other hand,this court has held that special assessments imposed on a limited subgroup of the population,were tia taxes because their revenue was used for community improvements.see home builders tramel.thus,this factor,whether the charges are imposed only upon those that the scheme regulates,is ultimately interrelated with the purpose of the charge assessed against a limited subgroup.
finally,keeler argument that specialty plate fees can not be taxes because they do not serve the general community welfare,inasmuch as they are earmarked for special recipient organizations,is unpersuasive.the fees in question exceed the ordinary motor vehicle registration fees which are based on a vehicle value and an additional handling charge they are not tied to vehicle regulation as such.as neinast noted,the question is not where the money is deposited,but the purpose of the assessment.the louisiana legislature decreed that the excess charges would be used for a number of purposes,ranging from but not limited to park development to university education to adoption support.none of these purposes is regulatory as to the specialty plate purchasers.keeler view of the public benefit served by these expenditures may differ from that of the louisiana legislature,but it does not transform the additional charges for specialty plates into fees designated for a regulatory purpose.
the district court emphasized two features of the specialty plate program in concluding that the additional charges above the handling fee and registration tax are fees rather than taxes.the additional charges,it pointed out,are paid voluntarily by vehicle owners,whereas taxes are normally considered involuntary charges.further,the charges are not imposed uniformly even among purchasers of specialty plates.the court inferred from the inconsistency of the policy that the legislature was benefiting only a few groups rather than the community at large.both points merit discussion.
the voluntariness of the vehicle owner payment constitutes,in our view,at most a superficial distinction for purposes of the tia.voluntariness is an overinclusive term
