regulations of the department of the treasury,implementing the national firearms act of,govern the manufacture,possession and transfer of certain types of firearms.the issues in this appeal center on the regulatory requirement that those seeking permission from the treasury department to make or transfer these firearms must obtain a certification from a law enforcement official in the jurisdiction of their residence.there are nine plaintiffs.five are individuals who claim that although they are eligible for a certification,they are unable to obtain one two are persons whose ability to sell or transfer these firearms allegedly has been impaired by the inability of prospective purchasers to obtain certifications two are local chief law enforcement officers.
the emergence of organized crime as a major national problem led to the enactment of the national firearms act of.see david hardy,the firearms owners protection act a historical and legal perspective,cumb.representing the first major federal attempt to regulate firearms,the act concentrated on particularly dangerous weapons and devices such as machine guns,sawedoff shotguns and silencers.see united states kenney,cir sonzinsky united states.hardy,cumb.at.when we speak of firearms in this opinion we mean to include only those currently covered by the act.the act required the maintenance of a registry of firearms containing,among other things,the name and address of the person possessing the weapon,see national firearms act,ch,a,stat,it required persons seeking the transfer of firearms to file an application with the commissioner of internal revenue,see id.at and it imposed a tax on firearm manufacturers,dealers and importers,as well as on the transfer of firearms.id.at.
under the treasury department regulations,anyone seeking permission to transfer a firearm had to support his application with a certificate of the local chief of police,sheriff of the county,united states attorney,united states marshal,or other such person whose certificate may in a particular case be acceptable to the commissioner of the internal revenue,that he is satisfied that the fingerprints and photograph appearing on the application are those of the applicant and that the firearm is intended by the applicant for lawful purposes.treasury department,bureau of internal revenue,regulations relating to taxes on certain firearms and machine guns under the national firearms act,chap,for reasons described by justice jackson,see robert jackson,the struggle for judicial supremacy,congress passed the federal register act in.see federal register act,ch,stat.treasury regulations dealing with the transfer of firearms first appeared in the code of federal regulations in.see.the regulations remained with minor changes until,when the bureau of alcohol,tobacco and firearms atf to which the secretary had delegated his authority under and the certification authority of united states attorneys and united states marshals because this required them to perform services outside their normal operations.see.according to the government,a benefit of giving state and local officials rather than federal officials certification powers is that local officials are in a better position to know about the particular status of an individual who seeks to make or receive a firearm and whether that transfer would be consistent with state and local law.brief for appellees at.
today applicants to make or transfer firearms can obtain a certification only from the local chief of police,sheriff of the county,head of the state police,state or local district attorney or prosecutor,or such other person whose certificate may in a particular case be acceptable to the director of atf.see.as in,the application form must contain a photograph of the applicant and two completed cards of his fingerprints.id.the officer making the certification must state that he is satisfied that the photograph and fingerprints are those of the applicant and that he has no information indicating that possession of the firearm by the applicant would be in violation of state or local law or that the applicant will use the firearm for other than lawful purposes.id.the tax,payable to the treasury by the transferor or,in the case of a manufacturer,by the maker of the weapon,is currently set at per the exception of firearms classified as any other weapon under e,which are taxed at per transfer.see.
the complaint was in four counts,each of which the district court dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.lomont summers,d.the court rejected plaintiffs claim that the certification requirement violated the taxpayer privacy provision of the court reasoned that applicants not federal officials are disclosing return information to state officials.id.at.plaintiffs tenth amendment claim failed because state and local officials participate voluntarily in providing certifications.id.at.the regulations did not impinge upon the secretary duty to collect taxes the secretary duty to collect a transfer tax arises only after an application is approved and a transfer effected.id.at.on the fourth count,the court sustained the secretary authority to issue the regulations under a,and a,and held that regulations were not arbitrary and capricious.id.at.
we will address first the contention that the certification regulations violate the tenth amendment by commandeering state and local officers to administer federal law but without making them accountable to anyone.brief for appellants at.two of the plaintiffs,if not any of the others,have standing to raise this claim plaintiff dennis mcclure is the sheriff of orange county,vermont and plaintiff stephen hose is the chief of the clinton,indiana police department.fraternal order of police united states,held that because the fraternal order of police had members who were chief law enforcement officers,the organization had article iii standing to bring a tenth amendment challenge to amendments to the gun control act.this much may follow from printz united states,d,in which the court reached the merits of a tenth amendment challenge to the brady act in cases brought by county sheriffs.neither the majority opinion nor the opinions of the five justices who wrote separately questioned the sheriffs standing to sue.the government believes that chief law enforcement officers have standing only if they are authorized by state law to act on behalf of the state.brief for appellees at.but as the government recognizes,to impose that prerequisite would be to depart from our decision in the fop case,and perhaps the supreme court disposition of printz.
on the merits,we agree with the district court that plaintiffs tenth amendment claim fails.unlike the brady act,the certification regulations do not command the states officers,or those of their political subdivisions,to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program.printz united states,at.at.local and state officials have the option of participating or not.see.there is no federal carrot to encourage participation,and no federal stick to discourage nonparticipation.printz did not hold that the federal government is forbidden from setting up regulatory programs,such as this one,in which state or local governments may voluntarily decide to assist in administering federal laws.see printz,at.at,concurring united states nathan,cir.
chief of police hose alleges that citizens of his jurisdiction have the impression that his refusal to participate in the certification program is injurious to such citizens.complaint e plaintiffs spell this out in their brief local and state officers who do not join in the program offend constituents who thereby can not get their applications approved and face pressure to issue certifications.brief for appellants at.we will assume the allegation to be true,although one wonders how large a constituency is involved in transferring or making machine guns,silencers,shotguns and the like.in any event,we can not see how this affects the analysis of the tenth amendment question.the pressure,whatever it is,comes not from the federal government but from the frustration of those unable to obtain certifications to transfer and receive or to make firearms.state officers may experience pressure from citizens if they do not or perhaps if they do participate in many federal programs,such as state implementation plans to enforce federal environmental laws.yet the principle of the tenth amendment articulated in printz is that the federal government may not direct,compel or commandeer state officials,see minnesota united states,d,except perhaps when the federal law is one of general applicability.see printz,at.at.no such direction or compulsion can be attributed to the federal government here.the certification regulations contemplate voluntary participation on the part of state and local officials.nothing in printz forbids cooperation between state and federal governments.see nathan,at.
we turn next to plaintiffs contention that the certification regulations violate the taxpayer privacy provision.amended in in the wake of watergate and white house efforts to harass those on its enemies list,now restricts government officers and employees from revealing any return or return information.tax analysts irs.the gist of the argument is that the atf application forms to make firearms,which require applicants to disclose to local officials personal information such as their identity,address and the tax,run afoul of this provision in the internal revenue code.
apart from the other plaintiffs,daniel employee of a licensed firearms standing to bring this claim.he alleges that he can not obtain atf permission to make a firearm because he refuses to reveal return information to local or state officials,which he must do in order to obtain a certification.
whelan,like anyone else who seeks to make a firearm,must include with his application a check or money order made out to the treasury department for,representing what atf calls a making tax.b.the completed form,at least once it is filed with atf,constitutes a return and it contains what qualifies as return information.the term return means any tax or information return which is filed with the secretary,b.an element of return information is that it be received by,recorded by,prepared by,furnished to,or collected by the secretary.b.yet here state and local officers obtain the information from the person seeking to make a firearm before the return is filed with the secretary.thus,no employee of the federal government is disclosing a return or return information received by,recorded by,prepared by,furnished to,or collected by the secretary in violation of b.stokwitz united states,cir.
count iv of the charged that the certification regulations are arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act and are otherwise unlawful the regulations are unlawful,plaintiffs argue,because the secretary lacked rulemaking authority to issue them.the government responds by pointing to a,and a.these provisions,according to the government,delegate broad authority to the secretary to promulgate regulations governing applications under the national firearms act,a contention with which the district court agreed.
one of the provisions the secretary authority to prescribe all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement of this title.a.this is nothing more than a general grant of interpretative rulemaking power,and therefore can not support the certification regulations.see stanley surrey,the scope and effect of treasury regulations under income,estate and gift taxes,concluding that regulations issued under treasury general rulemaking grant are merely interpretative and do not possess the vital current of legislative power ellsworth alvord,treasury regulations and the wilshire oil case,colum,stating that specific rulemaking grants given to the commissioner of internal revenue authorize legislative rulemaking but that the general rulemaking grant authorizes only interpretative rules to assist in the execution of the statute michael asimow,public participation in the adoption of temporary tax regulations,tax law,t ax authorities almost uniformly assume that regulations adopted pursuant to the treasury general rulemaking power in section a of the code are interpretive and that rules adopted pursuant to specific grants of rulemaking authority are legislative.the two other and of a different sort.section,which deals with transferring firearms,gives the secretary broad authority to promulgate regulations governing application forms,including regulations pertaining to the identification of the transferee,the transferor and the firearm.see a similarly,gives the secretary broad authority over the form of applications for permission to make firearms.see both sections provide that applications shall be denied if the transfer,receipt,making,or possession of the firearm would place the transferee or person making the firearm in violation of law,see a,but neither restricts the secretary broad power to grant or deny applications in any other respect.the certification regulations thus fall well within the secretary statutory authority.
as to the administrative procedure act,plaintiffs complain that the regulations allow local and state officials to act arbitrarily in deciding whether to execute certifications.but this is not enough to render the regulations invalid on their face.general rules need not work perfectly in all their applications,illinois commerce comm interstate commerce comm n.according to the complaint,there are some state and local officials who potentially may issue certifications.plaintiffs allege that two of these in arlington,virginia,the other in anchorage,refused their certification requests the arlington chief of police required them to submit to a search of their home,or as they put it,to waive their fourth amendment rights the anchorage chief of police would execute certifications only for friends.even if these allegations are true,settled precedent in the supreme court and in this court holds that a regulation is not itself arbitrary and capricious merely because it might be applied in an arbitrary fashion by those implementing it.skinner ry.labor executives ass n,d american hosp.ass nlrb,d illinois commerce comm n,at.if the law were otherwise hardly any regulation could be sustained.most rules and,for that matter,most statutes are susceptible to capricious administration.so long as there is some discretion,there is room for abuse.bad faith,malfeasance,and outright dishonesty are regrettably always a possibility.the regulations say only that the local official must certify that he is satisfied that the photograph and the fingerprints are those of the transferee or maker,and that the official has no information that possession of the firearm by such person would place him in violation of law or that he will use the firearm for unlawful purposes.on the face of the regulations,there is nothing irrational or unreasonable about this condition.indeed it appears eminently reasonable to insure that the person wanting to possess a machine gun is who he says he is and that there is no indication he will break the law.if local officials add anchorage,you must be a friend of the chief of police,or in arlington,you must submit to a search of your are doing so on their own authority,not because the regulations confer this power on them.
we therefore sustain the certification regulations as against plaintiffs facial attack.we have not decided whether,in a particular application,the regulations would be arbitrary and instance,when every qualified local and state official has decided not to issue certifications for anyone within their jurisdiction or when unlawful conditions are attached to the issuance of a certification.amfac resorts,united states dep t of the interior,wl.the complaint alleged only that the regulations were invalid on their face allegations regarding the specific circumstances of several plaintiffs were meant to show as much.the district court construed the complaint as raising only a facial challenge and decided the case accordingly,without mentioning any challenge.see lomont,d at.on appeal,plaintiffs briefs did not contest the district court construction of their complaint,nor did the
