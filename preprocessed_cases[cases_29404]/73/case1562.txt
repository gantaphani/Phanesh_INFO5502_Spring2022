in this appeal from the granting of a petition for a writ of administrative mandate,the parties have filed a motion to settle the case pursuant to a stipulation requiring that we vacate the trial court judgment and reinstate the agency decision.we deny the motion for vacatur because the interests of the public would be adversely affected if the judgment were vacated.
in particular,the judgment faults a state agency which allocates local sales tax revenues among cities and hears taxpayer appeals concerning corporate and personal income taxes for rendering a decision without due regard for the statutory and constitutional laws that govern its decisionmaking.the agency decisions affect the fiscal condition of california and its subdivisions and the finances of state taxpayers.to vacate the judgment and reinstate the agency decision would not only imply the agency acted properly,it would also undermine the effectiveness of the judgment in exposing the agency deficiencies in handling the administrative appeal.unless and until reversal on appeal,the judgment should remain intact as a reminder to the agency that it must comply with the laws that restrict its decisionmaking authority.
background 
the pertinent evidence and allegations are taken from the complaint,the exhibits to the motion to vacate the judgment,the parties stipulated facts,and the underlying record.
as the trial court explained california cities and counties are authorized to impose a local sales tax and a local use tax by adopting ordinances local taxes are administered by the state board of equalization board,which collects the local taxes and remits the revenues to participating local jurisdictions 
local sales tax revenues are distributed to the place of sale.the place of sale is the city where the retailers have a business location that,under rules and regulations adopted by the board,is identified as the place where the sales in question occur.that location,however,does not have to be the same place as the location where title transfers 
local sales tax revenues are distributed in one of two ways.about ninety percent of all local tax revenue is distributed directly to each city at the end of each tax quarter.the remaining ten percent is distributed to the cities indirectly through the pool systems.citations omitted,italics added.
in the motion to vacate the judgment,the parties describe the warehouse rule and the pool system t he warehouse rule was used for many years by the board to allocate sales tax revenues among cities,redevelopment agencies,and other local entities in a county.for many years,the board followed a rule providing that sales tax revenues generated by sales from a warehouse were allocated according to whether the warehouse held its own resale permit.if the warehouse held such a resale permit,sales were considered to be local and all such sales tax revenues were allocated to the city or governmental agency where the warehouse was situated.if the warehouse did not hold such a resale permit and it was not required to have one under past rules then all sales tax revenues derived from sales from such a warehouse were distributed to all cities and agencies in the county the countywide pool.italics added.
as the trial court stated the sales at issue in this case involve transactions where the tangible personal property sold was ordered from an retailer but fulfilled from an belonging to the retailer.specifically,a retailer of telecommunications hardware maintained a warehouse in the city of pomona.the retailer sold products through an number located in atlanta,georgia,and merchandise was delivered to the customer from the pomona warehouse location.
historically,local tax revenue derived from transactions subject to the warehouse rule could only be distributed through the pool system,tit,former b.on november,and effective december,the board amended regulation to provide that sales tax revenue derived from sales could be allocated directly to the location of the warehouse as long as an sales office did not participate in the transactions.regs,tit,c.thus,the amendment changed the method of allocation from a pooled allocation to a direct one.
also in,the board amended a corollary regulation,regulation,tit,which interprets and implements the statutes addressing when permits may be issued.before its amendment,regulation did not require a warehouse not customarily visited by customers to purchase goods to obtain a seller permit.a warehouse was only required to hold a seller permit if the retailer had no other location in california holding a permit.the rule was changed to require a permit for warehouses at which merchandise is stored and from which retail sales of such merchandise negotiated are delivered and fulfilled.
the board discusses the history of the warehouse rule since the inception of the location tax system in,the board has concluded that when the retailer had no sales offices in the state,the sales where negotiated out of state but shipped its goods from a stock of merchandise stored in the state,the location of the warehouse stock was regarded as the place of sale as to all items shipped from that location even if the retailer did not own the warehouse the warehouse rule.the local sales tax revenue was distributed to that location through the medium of the pool system.operative october,the board amended california code of regulations,title,section,former subdivision b to provide that local sales tax revenues derived from sales subject to the warehouse rule should be distributed directly to the location of the stock of goods,the city or redevelopment agency,rather than through the pool system to all cities and redevelopment agencies in the county.the amendment did not address what happened when the retailer did have sales offices in this state in addition to the stocks of goods.
on august,the board concluded that it should be clarified that local sales tax revenue derived from sales subject to the warehouse rule should be distributed to the location of the stock of goods from which delivery is made in all cases,namely,to the city or redevelopment agency where the warehouse is found.the board has also concluded that placing the regulatory provisions governing such sales in california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision b,which generally addressed the issue of sales negotiated in this state by specified types of sellers,caused confusion as to the basis for asserting local sales tax on sales subject to the warehouse rule.in that situation,the participating jurisdiction where the stock of goods is located asserts its jurisdiction based not on where the sales were negotiated but on the fact that the retailer property is located in the jurisdiction.as a result,the board concluded that california code of regulations,title,section,former subdivision b should be deleted and its current language moved to a new subdivision to which is added language providing for direct allocation to the city or redevelopment agency when the retailer has sales offices located in state in addition to the stock of goods.initial statement of reasons as of may.
the new subdivision,california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision c,states if an retailer does not have a permanent place of business in this state other than a stock of tangible personal property,the place of sale is the city,county,or city and county from which delivery or shipment is made.local tax collected by the board for such sales will be distributed to that city,county,or city and county.if a retailer has a permanent place of business in this state in addition to its stocks of tangible personal property,the place of sale,in cases where the sale is negotiated and there is no participation by the retailer permanent place of business in this state,is the city,county,or city and county from which delivery or shipment is made.local tax collected by the board for such sales will be distributed to the city,county,or city and county from which delivery or shipment is made.
before the amendments,the board had pooled the local sales taxes generated by the number located in atlanta the telecommunications hardware retailer and allocated those tax revenues to all cities,redevelopment agencies,and other governmental entities in los angeles county,including pomona.from july,to december,the retailer paid local sales taxes,which were distributed through the countywide pool,in the amount of.
in june,pomona petitioned the board to reallocate a portion of the retailer local sales tax revenues,requesting a significant increase in pomona share of the taxes.on september,a local tax hearing advocate issued a decision and recommendation,denying the petition on the ground that the retailer had multiple california sales offices with permits,but the pomona warehouse lacked a permit.consequently,any local sales tax due on the deliveries made pursuant to orders from the order desk should be allocated to all cities and redevelopment agencies through the countywide pool.italics added.pomona appealed that decision to the next level,board management,which denied the appeal by written decision on july.
in the late and early,an appeal from board management to the board was governed by the process for questioning local tax allocations,which created a multistep administrative system of review.the process was revised in october.neither the original appeal process nor the revision complied with the administrative procedure act.in february,the board adopted a regulation setting forth the process for pursuing an administrative appeal of local sales tax allocations,tit.the regulation,adopted in accordance with the administrative procedure act,incorporated much,but not all,of the review process as amended in.under the new regulation,a petition seeking to reallocate local sales tax revenues is initially reviewed by the sales and use tax department,tit,subd.b,then by the appeals division,subd.c,and,finally,by the board,subd.d.
on september,almost two years after the amendment of regulation,which governs the reallocation of local sales tax revenues,pomona requested that the board review the july,denial of its reallocation petition by board management.the board staff had already informed pomona that the board management decision was not subject to correction under the amendments to regulations and because the decision had become final.
on december,the board over the objections of its chief counsel and staff attorneys granted pomona request for a hearing.on or about may,the affected cities in los angeles county were notified of the nature of the upcoming hearing.
on august,the board conducted the first of two public hearings on pomona petition for reallocation.at the second hearing,on december,the board voted to grant the petition in part,ordering the los angeles county tax pool to reallocate to pomona.the board concluded that there was no misallocation of local sales tax from july,through september,but that for the period from october,through december,local sales tax of allocated through the los angeles countywide pool,from sales negotiated outside california and delivered from the pomona warehouse location,without participation by any other california location of the retailer,should have been allocated directly to pomona.based in part on additional factors pomona agreement to a percent reduction in what it was owed and the date on which the board first obtained knowledge of the improper distribution see,the board ordered that be reallocated to pomona.
on january,the board gave written notice to all interested parties of its december,decision,indicating that the decision was final and pomona had exhausted all administrative remedies.
on february,seven cities and three redevelopment agencies filed a petition against the board,seeking a writ of administrative mandate to overturn the board january,decision city of palmdale state board of equalization,no.on the same day,a similar petition was filed by the city of los angeles city of los angeles state board of equalization,no.on february,eight cities and one redevelopment agency filed a third petition against the board city of alhambra state board of equalization,no.for clarity,we will refer to those cities and redevelopment agencies collectively as plaintiff cities.each of the three petitions listed pomona as the real party in interest.
on april,the trial court,judge david yaffe presiding,ordered that the three petitions be consolidated for all purposes and that the board january,decision be stayed.plaintiff cities filed memoranda supporting the petition.the board and pomona filed memoranda in opposition.on february,the trial court,judge ann jones presiding,heard argument on the petition,granted it in part,and issued a written ruling.the trial court deemed the written ruling to be its statement of decision,which was incorporated into the judgment,filed on march.on march,the trial court issued a peremptory writ of mandate,commanding the board to set aside its january,decision,to take no further action to enforce or implement the decision,and to conduct further proceedings consistent with the trial court statement of decision.
thereafter,plaintiff cities moved for an award of attorney fees in the trial court.see code civ.the motion was denied.
the board and pomona separately appealed from the judgment.we consolidated the appeals.
the record on appeal has been filed,which covers the trial court proceedings and the administrative appeals.the opening brief in this court is not yet due.
all parties in the case the twenty plaintiff cities,pomona real party in interest,and the board defendant brought the pending motion to vacate the judgment.under the parties stipulation for order vacating judgment upon settlement,the judgment of the trial court would be vacated,the peremptory writ of mandate would be recalled,and the action would be dismissed with prejudice.each party would bear its own attorney fees and costs.under a separate settlement agreement between pomona and each plaintiff city,the board january,decision would be reinstated,the board would pay pomona in accordance with that decision,and pomona,in turn,would reimburse each plaintiff city in an amount to which pomona and the city previously agreed.
in the motion,the parties pay scant attention to what the trial court decided,stating only,the primary issue in this appeal will be whether the trial court correctly determined that the board proceeding was in nature requiring a resolution setting forth findings and conclusions 
instead of focusing on the effect of vacating the judgment,the motion is devoted almost exclusively to the monetary benefits of the settlement,including t he net effect of this settlement will be that the city of pomona will voluntarily reimburse approximately of the reallocation ordered by the board the city of los angeles,the largest beneficiary of the settlement,will recover the entire amount in controversy,or a large percentage of it,could be consumed by legal fees and costs if the case does not settle plaintiff cities have already spent in excess of on legal fees in general,cities serve the public,such that the settlement proceeds would assist plaintiff cities in providing police and fire protection,libraries,public parks,and a host of other public services in an era of dire financial circumstances after two and years of administrative wrangling,the parties are nowhere near a resolution of this dispute on the merits absent settlement,the parties face protracted litigation further administrative proceedings,then another writ petition and possible appeal and the present appeal involves one of the last of several disputes before the board regarding the revision of the warehouse rule.
