the credit repair organizations act croa or the act creates a cause of action for consumers harmed by the unscrupulous business and advertising practices on the part of credit repair organizations.see et.but the act does not permit lawsuits against any nonprofit organization which is exempt from taxation under section c of the internal revenue code.see b i.the question we face is whether an internal revenue service irs determination that an entity is under section c is sufficient to bring the entity within the statutory exclusion set forth in a b i.
saddled with substantial debt,the plaintiffs,andrew and kelly zimmerman,sought assistance from cambridge credit counseling corporation cambridge near the end of the plaintiffs had seen advertising from cambridge claiming that it could help debtors obtain lower interest rates,eliminate fees,debt,and otherwise assist in debt management efforts.the plaintiffs say that they were drawn to cambridge because it identified itself as a nonprofit organization.this led the plaintiffs to believe that cambridge would charge low fees for its services.cambridge is organized as a charitable organization under massachusetts law,see.laws ch,and has obtained an irs determination that it is under section c of the internal revenue code,see c 
in early,the plaintiffs enrolled with cambridge.for a fee of per month,cambridge developed a customized debt management program for them.several months later,the plaintiffs cancelled their contract with cambridge after they became dissatisfied with its services.at the time of cancellation,the plaintiffs owed more money and had worse credit scores than before contracting with cambridge.believing that they had been swindled,the plaintiffs sued cambridge,its owners john and richard puccio,and several related entities for violations of the croa they alleged that cambridge was subject to suit under the act because its claimed nonprofit status was a sham.
the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that cambridge was a section c organization and therefore within the exclusion specified in b i.the district court agreed and dismissed the croa claim.see zimmerman,d at.the court found the croa exclusion applicable because the irs had determined that cambridge qualified for section c status.see id.the court based its interpretation principally on a policy rationale.it concluded that permitting courts to go behind the irs designation and proceed to make their own independent determinations,on a basis,of an entity substantive classification according to section c would create excessive uncertainty concerning the validity of an entity status,and that this uncertainty could destabilize the operation of the nonprofit sector.see id.at.the plaintiffs timely appealed.
our review of the district court grant of the motion to dismiss is de novo see goldings winn,cir.at issue is the reach of b i,which provides that a credit repair organization does not include any nonprofit organization which is exempt from taxation under section c of the internal revenue code.b i.the plaintiffs argue that the exclusion requires that the credit repair organization actually operates as a nonprofit entity and that the credit repair organization meets the eligibility requirements in in section c of the tax code.the defendants respond that the phrase exempt from taxation under section c defines nonprofit organization.therefore,the defendants contend that a credit repair organization must only have received section c from the irs to qualify for the exclusion.
as in any case of statutory construction,our analysis begins with the language of the statute.hughes aircraft jacobson,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the act qualifies a large group of entities for the nonprofit then limits the excluded group to a smaller group of nonprofit organizations which are under section c b i.the most natural reading of the text is that it establishes two requirements.the nonprofit language excludes some entities from eligibility namely,profit making entities,and the language distills the excluded group to the kinds of organizations identified in section c,charitable or educational organizations which are,in fact.read in this way,the act does not define nonprofit organization as an entity with section c status but rather establishes two independent criteria for the exclusion nonprofit status and section c status.
this plain reading of the exclusion is supported by the surrounding text.see massachusetts morash,d.in addition to excluding nonprofit organizations with section c status,the croa excludes creditors and depository institutions.but as to these latter exclusions,congress defined the excluded entities by reference to another section of the united states code.see b ii excluding any creditor as defined in section of this title b iii excluding any depository institution as that term is defined in section of title.had the drafters of the croa intended to define nonprofit simply by reference to section c of the internal revenue code,they had at their disposal a method for doing so method they employed for other exclusions under the croa.see king vincent,d.
this drafting choice can not be considered accidental because the united states code is replete with statutes which clearly define a nonprofit organization as an entity that is under the internal revenue code.indeed,several statutes expressly define a nonprofit organization to mean an organization described under section c of the internal revenue code.see,a stating that nonprofit organization means an organization determined by the secretary of the treasury to be an organization described in section c of the internal revenue code of similar similar w b similar d similar similar this construction links the definitional term nonprofit directly to the organization federal status.we may assume that,when drafting the croa,congress was aware of this archetypal language for equating nonprofit status with federal status.see dakota yankton sioux tribe,d.yet congress chose a different formulation for the croa.this is strong evidence that congress did not intend to conflate nonprofit status with section c status 
the plaintiffs interpretation of the exclusion also honors the principle that a ll words and provisions of statutes are intended to have meaning and are to be given effect,and no construction should be adopted which would render statutory words or phrases meaningless,redundant,or superfluous.united states,cir.the defendants read the exclusion as if it said only that the croa excludes any organization which is under section c they have ascribed no independent meaning to the term nonprofit.
additionally,the plaintiffs reading is consonant with the rule favoring the narrow construction of exclusions in remedial statutes.see hogar agua y vida en el desierto,cir.congress enacted the croa to remedy abuses in the credit repair industry.the act includes a finding by congress that c ertain advertising and business practices of some companies engaged in the business of credit repair services have worked a financial hardship upon consumers,particularly those of limited economic means and who are inexperienced in credit matters.a.the croa expressed purpose is to to protect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising and business practices by credit repair organizations.b.its remedial goal is thus unmistakable.see fed.trade comm gill,cir.
if a credit repair organization only needed to obtain a section c designation to qualify for the exception,the exception might well eviscerate the provisions.see generally marta lugones moakley,credit repair organizations after regulation,describing the increase in credit repair organizations seeking section c status after the passage of the croa.after all,the irs usually grants section c status based solely on representations made by the applying entity.see irs form.in fact,the irs subsequent notification that an entity has qualified for status contains a disclaimer stating that the irs has made its determination based solely on representations provided to it by the party seeking the status.see letter from irs district director
