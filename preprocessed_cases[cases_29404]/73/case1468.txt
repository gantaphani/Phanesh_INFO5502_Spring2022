in this complex federal tax case,the taxpayer,principal mutual life insurance company and subsidiaries principal,seeks a refund of income taxes that it paid for taxable years,and.the united states court of federal claims rejected principal claim in a thorough and lucid opinion.we have carefully reviewed principal detailed critique of the trial court opinion and are not persuaded that the trial court erred in construing the pertinent provisions of the internal revenue code.although the statutory framework is intricate and the language of a key provision ambiguous,we find that related statutory provisions give reasonably clear guidance as to the proper interpretation of the provisions at issue here,and we sustain the trial court interpretation of the statutory language.
principal is an mutual life insurance corporation.mutual life insurance companies are owned by their policyholders,from whom they receive equity capital in the form of premiums.stock life insurance companies,by contrast,are owned by their shareholders,who provide equity capital the policyholders are simply customers who pay premiums to purchase policies.
stock life insurance companies frequently rebate to their policyholders part of the premiums paid.those premium rebates are tax deductible by the company.stock life insurance companies also pay their shareholders a portion of their profits as dividends.those dividend payments,however,are not tax deductible.mutual life insurance companies give premium rebates to their policyholders,but because the policyholders are also the company owners,payments to policyholders are in part price rebates,in part policyholder benefits,and in part returns on equity.see cuna mut.life ins.united states.if payments to policyholders were fully deductible from the income of mutual life insurance companies,those companies would have an inherent tax advantage over stock life insurance companies,because the mutual companies would be deducting payments that were,in part,returns on equity,while the dividend payments made by stock companies to their shareholders would not be deductible.
on several occasions,congress has adopted legislative mechanisms designed to provide parity of tax treatment for stock and mutual insurance companies.in,as part of the deficit reduction act of,pub,stat.act,congress substantially revised the provisions of the internal revenue code governing the deductions that life insurance companies could take.under the act,stock companies and mutual companies were both permitted to deduct payments to policyholders,but the amount of the deduction for mutual companies was reduced to prohibit mutual companies from deducting the portion of the payments that the statute treated as a return on equity to owners rather than a price rebate to customers.
the method congress devised to achieve that end is complex.the statutory scheme begins with a provision permitting an insurance company to deduct policyholder dividends,which are defined as any dividend or similar distribution to policyholders in their capacity as such.a.section c provides that policyholder dividends may be deducted in the year paid or accrued,but are subject to certain reductions for mutual insurance companies.
the reductions for mutual insurance companies are set forth in section,which provides the means for determining which portion of the policyholder dividend is deductible and which is not.in essence,section establishes a formula for comparing the earnings rate in the stock life insurance company industry with the earnings rate in the mutual life insurance industry for the taxable year in question.the statute attributes the difference to a distribution by mutual companies of earnings to their policyholder owners.using that rate,the statute provides that each mutual company deduction for payments to policyholders will be reduced by the product of that rate and the particular company average equity base,which is also calculated according to a statutory formula.see b.the result is that the deductions for payments to policyholders are limited for mutual companies to payments that can reasonably be considered premium rebates and not returns on equity.
an individual company average equity base is the average of its equity base at the end of the preceding taxable year and its equity base at the end of the current taxable year.b.the larger the company average equity base,the greater the reduction in the company policyholder dividend deduction,and thus the greater the company tax liability.the equity base consists of the company surplus and capital,adjusted pursuant to sections b,and.b.for present purposes,the most important of those adjustments is the one in section b,which provides that the company equity base will be increased by the amount that the aggregate amount of its statutory reserves exceeds the aggregate amount of its tax reserves.b a.statutory reserves are defined as the aggregate amount set forth in the annual statement with respect to items described in section c,while tax reserves are defined as the aggregate of the items described in section c as determined for purposes of section.b b.
congress created the distinction between statutory reserves and tax reserves to address the following problem states impose reserve requirements on life insurance companies,including mutual companies such as principal,to ensure that the companies have sufficient assets to make payments on their policies.the reserves required by state law are recorded as liabilities on an insurance company balance sheet and represent contractual claims against the company assets by its policyholders.because of emphasis on ensuring the solvency of life insurance companies,the methods and assumptions that the states require insurance companies to use in calculating reserves are fiscally conservative.at the time of the legislation,congress was concerned that the methods of calculating reserves resulted in a significant overstatement of liabilities in comparison to those measured under realistic economic assumptions.prt,vol,at.accordingly,congress required that federal standards be used to calculate reserves for purposes of determining the size of the equity base of mutual companies and thus the size of their allowable policyholder dividend deductions.by requiring that the difference between a company statutory reserves and its tax reserves be added to the company capital and surplus,congress sought to ensure that only those reserves that it deemed to reflect true liabilities of the company were excluded from the calculation of the company equity base.
this case involves the proper treatment within this scheme of reserves for an item known as excess interest.excess interest is the interest guaranteed on an annuity or investment contract that exceeds the prevailing state assumed interest rate.during the taxable years in question in this case,principal maintained several classes of accounts in which the guaranteed interest rates exceeded the prevailing state assumed rate.the guarantee period for those accounts ranged from two to eight years.the interest reserves for those accounts consisted of the present value of the excess interest guaranteed on the accounts for the rest of the guarantee periods.the issue in this case is how to classify reserves for excess interest guaranteed beyond the end of the taxable year for purposes of calculating statutory and tax reserves under section b.
with respect to the application of section b to its returns for taxable years,and,principal took the position that it was not required to include its reserves for excess interest guaranteed beyond the end of the taxable year in either its statutory reserves or its tax reserves.principal argued that the version of section d of the code,d supp.v,required it to exclude excess interest reserves from both sets of reserves when calculating the company average equity base under section b,which would result in the excess interest reserves not being added to its equity base.
the internal revenue service irs disagreed.it took the position that principal should have included its reserves for excess interest guaranteed beyond the end of the current taxable year in its statutory reserves but not in its tax reserves,and that it should have increased its equity base accordingly.principal paid the full amount that was due under the irs construction of the statute and then filed refund claims with the irs.when the irs denied the refunds,principal sued in the court of federal claims.on for summary judgment,the court agreed with the irs interpretation of the statutes at issue and granted summary judgment for the government.
the trial court focused on section d,which principal contended required that excess interest reserves be omitted from both statutory and tax reserves.section d,which is entitled method of computing reserves on contract where interest is guaranteed beyond end of taxable year,provides as follows 
for purposes of this part other than section,amounts in the nature of interest to be paid or credited under any contract for any period which is computed at a rate which 
exceeds the prevailing state assumed interest rate for the contract for such period,and 
is guaranteed beyond the end of the taxable year on which the reserves are being computed,
shall be taken into account in computing the reserves with respect to such contract as if such interest were guaranteed only up to the end of the taxable year.
principal argued that the reference to computing the reserves with respect to such contract referred to both statutory and tax reserves,and thus required that the excess interest reserves be excluded from both categories.the government responded that the reference to computing the reserves with respect to such contract referred only to the tax reserves.the effect of omitting the excess interest reserves from only the tax reserves,and not from the statutory reserves,would be to increase principal equity base,since the statute provides that the company equity base is to be increased by the difference between the statutory reserves and the tax reserves.an increase in the company equity base would in turn lead to a decrease in its policyholder dividend deduction.
the trial court reasoned that the term computing in section d most naturally referred only to tax reserves,since statutory reserves were not computed as such,but were simply taken directly from the reserves set forth in the insurance companies annual statements,while tax reserves were computed according to the formula set out in the tax code.the court further concluded that its statutory construction was consistent with other provisions of the statute as well as with its legislative history.
the dispute in this case turns on whether section d requires reserves for excess interest guaranteed beyond the end of the current year to be excluded from both tax reserves and statutory reserves,as principal contends,or only from tax reserves,as the government contends.
section d provides that excess interest to be paid or credited under a contract in which the interest is guaranteed beyond the end of the taxable year on which the reserves are being computed,shall be taken into account in computing the reserves with respect to such contract as if such interest were guaranteed only up to the end of the taxable year.at first blush,that language would appear to apply to both tax reserves and statutory reserves.the government argues,however,that the use of the words computing and computed indicates that section d applies only to tax reserves,because statutory reserves are not computed,but are simply imported directly from the insurance company annual statement.principal responds that while the components of the statutory reserves may be taken without modification from the company annual statement,the various components of the statutory reserves must be aggregated to produce a single amount of statutory reserves,which involves computing of a sort and thus makes section d applicable by its terms to statutory reserves as well as to tax reserves.
we conclude that the language of the statute is ambiguous on this point.the term computed could be read broadly enough to include aggregation,but the context does not compel such a broad reading.section b b defines statutory reserves as the aggregate amount set forth in the annual statement with respect to items described in section c,which includes various specific reserves and other obligated funds tax reserves,on the other hand,are defined as the aggregate of the items described in section c as determined for purposes of section.b b emphases added.the use of the term determined in the definition of tax reserves suggests computation,while the reference to the amount set forth in the annual statement in the definition of statutory reserves does not.the method of obtaining the two numbers underscores this difference the numbers for the items making up the statutory reserves are taken from the company annual report without adjustment,while the numbers for the items making up the tax reserves must be calculated afresh in light of the rules set forth in section.moreover,the subsection of section referred to in the emphasized portion of the definition of tax reserves subsection d is entitled method of computing reserves for purposes of determining income,which parallels the language used in the definition of tax reserves.the phrase computing the reserves in section d therefore appears most naturally to refer to the reserves computed by the formulas in section d,which are tax reserves,not statutory reserves.
for those reasons,it is reasonable to conclude that the reference in section d to the reserves that are computed applies to tax reserves only,not to both tax reserves and statutory reserves.more telling than the language of section d,however,is the statutory context in which it appears,which provides substantial support for the government position.
in examining the statutory context in which section d appears,we look first at the second sentence of section b b i,which provides that statutory reserves shall not include any reserve attributable to a deferred and uncollected premium if the establishment of such reserve is not permitted under section c.section c forbids establishment of a reserve for items not included in a mutual company income.the definition of statutory reserves does not,however,include any similar proviso excluding the reserves for excess interest guaranteed beyond the end of the year,which is the subject of section d.because congress expressly included a reference to section c in the definition of statutory reserves,it seems likely that if congress had intended for section d to apply to statutory reserves,it would have stated so directly.
another provision of the statute,the transitional rule set forth in g,also supports the government construction of section d.the transitional rule exempts mutual life insurance company subsidiaries from section d for purposes of section b for life insurance policies issued before january.
the transitional rule is understandable if the normal rule is that reserves for excess interest guaranteed beyond the end of the taxable year are included in statutory reserves but excluded from tax reserves by operation of section d.in normal operation,section d would create a larger excess of statutory reserves over tax reserves,which would increase the mutual company average equity base,thus decreasing the company policyholder dividends deduction.by exempting certain contracts from the normal operation of section d,the transitional rule allows a mutual company to add reserves related to excess interest guaranteed after the end of the current taxable year to its tax reserves,thus ensuring that no excess of statutory reserves over tax reserves is created,and thereby preserving the mutual company policyholder dividend deduction.
the legislative history of the act provides support for this construction of the transition rule.in reports prepared contemporaneously with the consideration and enactment of the statute,both the joint committee on taxation and the senate committee on finance described the special transition rule and its effect on the calculation of the average equity base for mutual companies as follows 
for purposes of determining the excess o
