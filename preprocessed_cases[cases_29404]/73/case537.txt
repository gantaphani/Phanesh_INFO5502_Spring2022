introduction 
united states of america commenced this suit on october,in the united states district court for the western district of michigan,seeking to enjoin charles conces from promoting an alleged scheme and engaging in other conduct that allegedly interfered with the administration and enforcement of the federal tax laws.after conces failed to make the initial disclosures mandated under.a,the government sought,and the district court granted,an order compelling these disclosures.when conces did not comply with this order,the district court entered a default judgment against him,permanently enjoined him from promoting any scheme to avoid federal tax liability,and granted the government permission to conduct discovery to ensure his compliance with the terms of the court injunctive award.
during discovery,the government served five interrogatories and a document production request upon conces,who responded by answering only two of the interrogatories and refusing to provide the requested documents.after many delays due to conces numerous objections to the interrogatories,and after the entry of two orders directing him to respond to the government discovery requests,the district court entered a february,order finding conces in civil contempt and directing that he be incarcerated until he purged this contempt by complying with the court prior orders.
conces now appeals from this order,raising a number of challenges to the district court finding of contempt and to other rulings made in the course of the lower court proceedings.as explained below,we find that certain of the challenges advanced by conces are not properly before us,and we affirm the district court rulings as to all remaining issues.
ii.factual and procedural background 
according to the government complaint,charles conces is the founder and chairman of the national lawman committees for the public interest the lawmen,an unincorporated organization based in battle creek,michigan.the government alleges that conces has counseled and assisted clients in filing fraudulent tax returns,based on his belief that the sixteenth amendment authorization of federal income taxation without apportionment extends only to corporate profits and not to unincorporated businesses or individuals.conces also has allegedly promoted this belief through seminars,electronic mail groups,and internet websites.
in october of,the government filed suit against conces in the united states district court for the western district of michigan,seeking to enjoin him from promoting his purportedly fraudulent schemes to avoid payment of federal income taxes in its plea for injunctive relief,the government sought to enjoin conces from promoting or marketing any tax shelter that advises others to attempt to violate the internal revenue laws require conces to contact persons he has assisted in preparing federal income tax returns and inform them of the court findings and require him to provide these individuals contact information to the government.the government also requested discovery to monitor conces compliance with the requested injunction.
in february of,the government filed a motion to compel conces to make the initial disclosures mandated under.a,as well as a motion for a preliminary injunction.on march,the district court granted the motion to compel and ordered conces to make the requisite disclosures by march.in this order,the court expressly note d,for defendant benefit,that rule c authorizes a court to impose additional sanctions for a party failure to disclose,up to and including rendering a judgment by default against the disobedient party.order at quoting.b c.
when conces failed to make the disclosures ordered by the court,the government filed a motion for entry of a default judgment against him as a sanction for his refusal to comply.following a hearing on april,the court entered an april,default judgment against conces as requested by the government.in determining that this was an appropriate sanction,the district court found that conces failure to cooperate in discovery and comply with the court order was due to wilful bad faith that the government was prejudiced by this lack of cooperation and compliance that conces had been warned about the possibility of a default judgment and that a less drastic sanction was unlikely to have any effect in light of his past conduct.in addition,the court granted a permanent injunction,and gave its permission for the government to pursue discovery to monitor conces compliance with the court injunctive award 
in july of,the government served upon conces its first interrogatories and request for production of documents.these discovery requests sought information dating back to january regarding,among other matters i any individuals for whom conces drafted any portion of a federal income tax return interrogatory ii any individuals for whom he drafted any portion of a letter to any government agency or to whom he provided advice related to federal income taxes interrogatory iii all bank accounts held in conces name or the name of the lawmen interrogatory and iv any individuals with whom he had contact regarding,or who were responsible for,the internet website www.lawmenamerica.com interrogatory.the government also requested copies of all tax returns,letters,or other documents that conces had assisted in drafting for the persons described in interrogatories and.
conces initially responded by letter dated august,stating that he would respond to the government discovery requests only if the court wishes that i respond to the interrogatories under oath before this matter is settled.when the government advised conces in an august,letter that it would seek an order from the court if he did not provide responses by august,conces sent an august,letter to the government in which he lodged various general objections to the government discovery requests and answered only some,but not all,of the interrogatories.
specifically,in answering interrogatory,conces stated that he could not recall having drafted any federal tax returns for anyone during the period in question.similarly,conces responded to interrogatory by stating that he had no lists of persons and their personal information that were responsive to this interrogatory,and that a s i recall,all documents were based on authoritative sources such as the constitution and rulings of the supreme court.he then objected to the interrogatories regarding his bank accounts and the lawmen website,claiming that they were irrelevant due to the fact that the researched information contained large amounts of information,and was based on authoritative sources,and asserting that t here never was at any time,an attempt to make false claims or false or misleading statements.finally,in response to the government document request,conces stated that he had not done any tax returns for other individuals,as i can recall,for the period in question,and he objected to the remainder of the request as overly broad,vague,and irrelevant.
in a september,letter to conces,the government maintained that his discovery responses and objections were deficient in various respects.first and foremost,the government contended that conces interrogatory answers were inconsistent with his testimony at a june,hearing,at which he purportedly admitted i that he had provided the sorts of materials referred to in interrogatory to other individuals just weeks before the hearing,ii that he had received payments for selling his research to others,thereby implicating interrogatory,and iii that he had corresponded by electronic mail with someone in california regarding the lawmen website,thereby implicating interrogatory.accordingly,the government asserted that conces had lodged inappropriate objections to its discovery requests,and had failed to make the reasonable inquiry called for under.g in providing responses to these requests.the government closed its letter by advising conces that it would file a motion to compel if he did not supplement his responses by september.
although conces responded before this deadline,he did not provide any additional information or documentation as sought by the government.rather,in a letter dated september,conces again advanced several general objections to the government discovery requests,as well as many of the same specific objections raised in his earlier letter.in addition,he contended that he could not identify any individuals in response to interrogatory because anyone was free to use the information collected in the library presumably,a resource maintained by the because he did not have the power to restrict access to these materials,which consisted almost entirely of publicly available information.conces further opined that the word drafted as used in interrogatory was unclear.as to interrogatories and,beyond restating his objection that the information sought in these interrogatories was irrelevant,conces asserted that he could not be compelled to identify any bank accounts or individuals involved with the lawmen website absent a showing of probable cause for the fourth amendment seizures that these requests purportedly entailed.
not satisfied with these responses,the government sought an order compelling conces to respond to its discovery requests.at the conclusion of a november,hearing before a magistrate judge,the government motion was granted and conces was ordered to provide responses to interrogatories and produce the documents requested by the government within ten days.in addition,the magistrate judge expressly warned conces that if he failed to comply,the court can impose sanctions in this matter including finding you in contempt of court.
conces did not comply with this order and,on december,the government filed a motion for an order to show cause why he should not be held in contempt.on january,the district court entered an order directing conces to appear at a february,hearing and show cause why he should not be held in contempt for failing to comply with the magistrate judge directives at the november,hearing.following this february hearing,the court issued an order that same day directing conces to respond to the government outstanding discovery requests by february,and informing him that his failure to provide complete answers as required by this order shall result in defendant being incarcerated until defendant purges himself of contempt by answering the government discovery requests.
once again,conces failed to comply with the court order.instead,he served upon the government two motions that the district court deemed frivolous,in which he demanded that the district judge produce his oaths of office and challenged the court subject matter jurisdiction accordingly,the government filed a renewed motion for contempt in accordance with the district court instructions in its february,order.by order dated february,the court determined that conces had willfully disregarded the february order,found that he was in civil contempt of the court,and ordered him to report to the united states marshals service on march,and remain in custody until such time as defendant purges himself of contempt by providing complete answers to the government discovery requests,as directed in the february,order.
when conces reported to the marshals service on march,the district court convened a hearing to afford conces one final opportunity to comply with the court orders and produce the requested discovery responses and documents.once again,however,he refused to provide any such responses,but instead reiterated his claims of government misconduct,objected that the government requests were vague and violative of the fourth amendment,and professed an inability to respond to the government requests because of the purported lack of records of his activities and contacts.more generally,conces contested the basis for the underlying judgment against him.finding that none of this excused conces lack of compliance with its orders,the district court ordered his incarceration.this appeal followed,with conces again representing himself as he did throughout the proceedings in the court below 
iii.issues raised on appeal 
conces seeks to raise the following issues in his brief on appeal 
whether his activities as alleged in the complaint could properly be found to have interfered with the lawful collection of federal income taxes,where the government purportedly lacks the authority to impose taxes on the income of individuals 
whether the district court violated his fourth amendment rights by ordering him to respond to the government discovery requests and ordering his incarceration without a showing of probable cause to believe that he committed a legal violation that would justify such seizures 
whether the district court violated his first amendment right not to speak and his fifth amendment protection against by ordering him to respond to the government discovery requests 
whether the district court improperly permitted discovery,where this discovery was predicated on an injunction and default judgment that,in conces view,were unlawfully entered,where the federal rules of civil procedure purportedly do not authorize discovery,and where the information sought by the government does not satisfy the standard of relevance set forth in.
whether the district court lacked jurisdiction because of the district judge failure to keep his oaths of office on file and produce them upon the request of a party 
whether the entry of a default judgment against conces was improperly predicated on the district court erroneous determination that he had not filed an answer to the complaint 
whether conces was denied due process and his right to be heard before the district court ordered his incarceration for civil contempt of court and 
whether the government improperly commenced this suit without first securing the authorizations purportedly required under the pertinent provisions of the internal revenue code.
we first determine which of these challenges are properly before us,and then turn to the merits of those issues that are subject to our review.
iv.analysis 
several of the issues raised in conces brief on appeal are not properly before this court and will not be considered.
in his present notice of appeal,conces states that he is challenging only the district court february,order finding him in civil contempt and ordering his incarceration until he purges this contempt.as we have previously explained,i f an appellant chooses to designate specific determinations in his notice of than simply appealing from the entire the specified issues may be raised on appeal.mclaurin fischer,cir.as a general matter,then,conces designation of the district court february,contempt order in his notice of appeal narrows our inquiry solely to those issues raised in conces appellate brief that relate to this particular order 
indeed,it is especially clear in this case that we lack the power to review the underlying april,default judgment and permanent injunction that preceded the contempt order.as noted earlier,conces previously filed a may,notice of appeal from this judgment,as well as a may,amended notice of appeal.in orders dated may and june,however,this court construed letters from conces as motions to voluntarily dismiss these appeals,and then proceeded to grant these motions and dismiss his appeals.so far as may be discerned from the record,conces made no effort to either reinstate these appeals or commence a renewed appeal from the district court underlying default judgment and permanent injunction,and the period for appealing from the april,judgment and order has long since expired.see b fed.a b.
as a result,we can not consider several of the issues identified in conces brief on appeal.first,we can not entertain conces claim that the district court entry of a default judgment was erroneously predicated on the mistaken belief that he failed to answer the complaint next,we can not consider any challenges to the truth of the factual allegations in the government,conces assertion that the default judgment and permanent injunction rested upon false or disputed allegations,as well as his contention that,contrary to the allegations of the complaint,the government failed to secure the requisite approval of the secretary of the treasury or an authorized delegate pursuant to a prior to commencing this action because,upon the entry of a default judgment,conces liability was deemed to be established as a matter of law and the factual allegations of the complaint were no longer open to dispute.see,black lane,cir goldman,antonetti,ferraiuoli,axtmayer hertell medfit int l,st cir alan neuman,albright,cir dundee cement howard pipe concrete,cir.finally,while the entry of a default judgment did not,by itself,necessarily foreclose conces from seeking review as to whether the complaint allegations were sufficient to state a claim and support a judgment of liability,see black,at alan neuman,at,his failure to timely appeal from the entry of this judgment precludes such review at this late date.it follows that conces can not challenge the sufficiency of the complaint allegations to sustain a claim of interference with the collection of federal income taxes notwithstanding his contention that the government lacks the authority to tax individual income 
this leaves only four issues for us to resolve in the present appeal.first,we must consider whether the district court violated conces rights under the first,fourth,or fifth amendments to the constitution by ordering him to respond to the government discovery requests similarly,we may entertain conces claims that the government discovery effort was contrary to the federal rules of civil procedure and sought irrelevant information and materials.we also must address conces argument that he was denied due process and a right to be heard before being jailed for civil contempt.finally,because jurisdictional challenges may be entertained at any time,we will consider whether the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction in light of the district judge failure to produce his oaths of office in response to conces repeated demands.
b.the district court did not violate conces constitutional rights by ordering him to respond to the government discovery requests.
conces various constitutional challenges to the district court underlying february,discovery order are readily resolved.first,conces has failed to identify any support for the proposition that ordinary discovery requests in civil litigation must satisfy the fourth amendment standard of probable cause,in addition to or apart from the usual standards set forth in the federal rules of civil procedure.there is no indication in the record that the government discovery effort was intended to assist in any pending or anticipated criminal investigation or prosecution.rather,the district court authorized discovery for the limited purpose of monitoring conces compliance with the court judgment and award of injunctive relief.so long as the government discovery requests were narrowly tailored to this we find no basis for concluding was no need for the district court to undertake any sort of fourth amendment probable cause inquiry before ordering conces to respond to these requests.
neither has conces suggested any way in which the district court order posed a genuine threat to his fifth amendment privilege against.to the extent that he vaguely contends that any sort of response to the government discovery requests might tend to incriminate him,his blanket assertion of a fifth amendment privilege is impermissible,and he has failed to demonstrate a real danger of incrimination if he were to respond to any particular discovery request.brennan comm r,cir.moreover,the supreme court has explained that the fifth amendment protection against does not extend to consequences of a noncriminal nature,such as threats of liability in civil suits.united states apfelbaum,d.nor may conces properly interpose a fifth amendment objection to the government discovery effort on the ground that the government purportedly vague requests were designed to entrap him into committing perjury,because conces fifth amendment privilege does not protect him against false testimony that he later might decide to give.apfelbaum,at.at.
finally,we find no merit in conces contention that the district court order violated his first amendment right of free association or privilege not to speak.as the government correctly observes,the courts have rejected comparable claims by promoters of unlawful schemes that their first amendment rights or privileges were violated through orders directing them to comply with discovery requests or enjoining them from continuing to promote these schemes.see,united states bell,cir united states schiff,cir.we concur in the reasoning of these decisions,and therefore reject conces first amendment challenge to the district court discovery order.
c.the district court acted in accordance with the federal rules of civil procedure in ordering conces to respond to the government discovery requests.
conces fares no better in his contention that the district court discovery order was contrary to the federal rules of civil procedure.the federal rules expressly authorize discovery i n aid of a judgment in the manner otherwise provided in these rules.a,and the courts have confirmed that t he scope of postjudgment discovery is very broad,legrand,cir.the relevance of the information and materials sought in the government discovery requests is clear,and conces offers no argument to the contrary.instead,he opposed these requests in the court below on constitutional grounds,by questioning the district court jurisdiction,through semantic quibbles about the meaning of straightforward terms,and on the ground that he was unable to produce the information and documents sought by the government.while we address the merits of these objections elsewhere in this opinion,it is evident that none of these challenges,even if,lends any support to conces generalized contention that the district court acted contrary to the federal rules by ordering him to respond to the government discovery requests.thus,we reject this claim of error in the district court discovery order.
d.the district court had no obligation to produce any oaths of office.
conces next challenges the district court subject matter jurisdiction over this case,in light of the district judge failure to comply with his demand to produce certain oaths of office.yet,the statutes upon which he principally relied in advancing this same jurisdictional challenge in the court below,and apply by their terms only to individuals elected or appointed to an office of honor or profit in the civil service or uniformed services,emphasis added,and not to judicial officers.see miller johnson.while federal judges have an analogous statutory obligation to take an oath before performing the duties of their office,see,nothing in this statute or elsewhere in the law requires that a district judge demonstrate to the satisfaction of a litigant in a particular case that he or she has taken this oath.nor has conces suggested any reason why a district court subject matter jurisdiction over each case on its docket should hinge upon the district judge ability or willingness to provide the parties with such proof of his or her compliance with.accordingly,the district court properly rejected this jurisdictional challenge as frivolous 
e.the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding conces in civil contempt for failure to comply with its february,order.
having addressed conces various threshold challenges to the district court rulings and subject matter jurisdiction,we now turn to the central issue on,whether the district court erred in holding conces in civil contempt and ordering his incarceration until he complied with the court february,order directing him to respond to the government discovery requests.we review the district court finding of contempt under an abuse of discretion standard.liberte capital group,llc capwill,cir.an abuse of discretion exists where the district court relied upon clearly erroneous findings of fact or applied an incorrect legal standard.id.
a district court unquestionably has the power to hold a litigant in civil contempt for failure to comply with a discovery order.see int l union,united mine workers bagwell,d see also authorizing the federal court
