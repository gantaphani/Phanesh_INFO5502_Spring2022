the internal revenue service audited the tax return of nick and helen kikalos and found that they underreported their income and thus owed more tax than they had paid.the irs also assessed an penalty against the pair in the amount equal to twenty percent of the underpayment.the couple petitioned the united states tax court for a redetermination of the deficiency and after a hearing,the court sustained both the deficiency and the penalty.nick and helen kikalos appeal and we affirm.
in,the tax year at issue,nick and helen kikalos owned four liquor stores in hammond,indiana.the stores,operating under the name nick liquor mart,sold beer,wine,liquor and cigarettes,among other things these ventures were sole proprietorships,with daughter elizabeth managing one of the stores.elizabeth and her brother,nick,together owned a fifth store called nick cigarette city.at the time of this audit,nick and helen kikalos we will call them the taxpayers for shorthand were no strangers to the irs,having been audited every year from through.a recurring theme in these audits had been the irs displeasure with the taxpayers.in,at the conclusion of the audits for tax years,and,the irs and the taxpayers executed an agreement to maintain adequate books and records,which specified certain records for the taxpayers to keep in the future.the records included daily cash register tapes and daily cash reconciliations.the daily cash reconciliations were to include the amount of cash which was withdrawn from the business for whatever purpose,the amount of cash available for bank deposits,and a record of the amount,date and type of draw being withdrawn from the business.the audit was triggered in part when the mercantile national bank contacted the irs to report unusual financial activity by nick kikalos kikalos had purchased cashier checks from the mercantile national bank in in an amount totaling.kikalos used cash and checks to purchase the checks.
the audit ultimately focused on the cigarette aspect of the taxpayers stores.nick liquor participated in cigarette company programs called buydowns.a buydown is a discount a cigarette manufacturer provides to a retail outlet for each pack or carton of cigarettes sold during a certain time period.the manufacturers give the discount directly to the retailer with the expectation that the retailer will then pass on the savings to the ultimate consumer.there are no coupons involved in buydown programs.rather,the cashier at the point of sale must be aware of the buydown programs for particular brands of cigarettes and ring up the sale accordingly.at nick liquor,the store managers were responsible for informing the cashiers about the cigarette brands on buydown at any particular time.some cigarette companies attempted to verify that retailers were passing the discounts on to their customers by checking the prices displayed in the retailers windows.manufacturers also asked retailers to take inventory at the beginning and end of a buydown period to verify the amount of buydown reimbursement a retailer should receive.nick liquor conducted its own inventories that were not audited or verified by the cigarette companies.
after the close of a buydown period,nick liquor would submit a request for reimbursement to the manufacturer sponsoring the program,and the manufacturer would then issue a check based on the number of cartons purchased during the buydown period multiplied by the discount per carton.the delay between the request for reimbursement and issuance of a check would sometimes be as long as two months.because of this delay,some checks received in early were due to sales made in and some payments for buydown sales were not received until early.in addition to buydowns,nick liquor honored manufacturers paper coupons.cigarette companies reimbursed nick liquor for the face value of submitted coupons plus postage costs.for the sake of simplicity,we will use the term buydown to include both buydown and coupon income,unless otherwise indicated.
according to the irs,nick liquor received substantial payments from cigarette companies in that were not deposited to the stores business bank accounts,were not reported to the stores accountant and consequently were not disclosed on the couple tax return.instead of recording this income through normal channels,kikalos took more than worth of buydown reimbursement checks,combined them with other third party checks and used them to purchase more than worth of cashier checks from the mercantile national bank.after the bank contacted the irs,a revenue agent commenced an audit and attempted to determine whether these cashier checks represented unreported income.the taxpayers and their accountant provided a number of records to the revenue agent,including spreadsheets that purported to document cigarette buydown income.the spreadsheets contained many different and conflicting numbers for this type of income so the revenue agent selected the largest figure given in any spreadsheet,and used that as the baseline figure for buydown income.the taxpayers had reported of buydown income on their return,leading the revenue agent to conclude that the taxpayers had underreported their income by.the agent issued a deficiency notice for the amount of tax due on this additional income,and also imposed an penalty equal to twenty percent of the underpayment pursuant to a.
the taxpayers petitioned the tax court for a redetermination of the deficiency.after a hearing,the court determined that the taxpayers had in fact their income by,nearly twice the agent determination.the court therefore upheld the irs deficiency notice as well as the penalty.in reaching this result,the court took a different evidentiary path than the revenue agent.the court noted that three of the four spreadsheets provided by the taxpayers reflected in buydown income but the fourth indicated.the court found that,despite requests from the revenue agent,the taxpayers failed to furnish adequate records to substantiate the amount of buydown income recorded by each of the four stores on a daily,monthly or annual basis.nor did the taxpayers provide records to reconcile cigarette company reimbursement payments with the amounts reported as buydown income.the court noted the unusual purchase of cashier checks,which kikalos accomplished by using buydown reimbursement checks,other checks,and cash in amounts less than to avoid irs reporting requirements.kikalos did not tell his accountant about these cashier checks and he did not record the receipt of the third party checks in the accounting records for nick liquors.all in all,kikalos converted of buydown reimbursement checks into cashier checks.the court remarked that kikalos admitted in his testimony that one of his objectives in purchasing the cashier checks with checks rather than cash was to avoid reporting cash transactions exceeding to the irs.the court found significant the taxpayers failure to demonstrate that the checks used to purchase the cashier checks were included in gross business income.moreover,the accountant for nick liquor testified that she was unaware of the existence of the cashier checks.the accountant verified that the only entry in the for cigarette company checks was the entry in october.she could not recall what documentation she was given to support this entry but said,i would imagine it was checks.tr.at.she said the basis for the amount of the entry was p robably a deposit appearing in the bank,but i could say for sure.id.she then clarified that although she could not recall the documentation exactly,she believed it was a deposit slip.id.the taxpayers did not produce credible evidence that the cigarette company checks used to purchase the cashier checks were part of this october entry.
from these facts,the court concluded that kikalos had not reported in buydown checks that had been used to purchase cashier checks.the accountant for nick liquor had noted in buydown income in the october records for the stores.the court added those two figures for a total of.the court then adjusted to exclude buydown income that was received in a subtraction,and to include income that was not received until a addition.the irs conceded that it had in rack and promotional income from cigarette companies,so the court excluded that amount as well.all in all,the court calculated in buydown income.kikalos and his wife reported in buydown income on their tax return,and the court concluded that unreported buydown income equaled.although this figure was nearly double the amount originally claimed by the irs,the government did not seek an increased deficiency.because kikalos did not have adequate records to challenge this calculation,the court upheld the original deficiency.the court also upheld the penalties imposed by the irs under section.that section allows a penalty on any understatement of tax attributable to negligence or disregard of the rules and regulations,or any substantial understatement of income tax.the court found that kikalos violated this section when he failed to keep adequate books or records after repeatedly being warned by the irs to do so.the court again noted kikalos testimony that his practice of purchasing cashier checks was designed in part to conceal large cash transactions from the government.these two factors justified the penalty,according to the court.the taxpayers appeal.
on appeal,kikalos and his wife raise three issues.first,they assert that the tax court impermissibly allowed the irs to introduce a new theory of unreported income in its brief.second,they contend that the tax court then clearly erred in accepting that theory that the couple received in buydown income in.finally,the taxpayers maintain that the tax court clearly erred in imposing a negligence penalty against them.in reviewing decisions of the tax court,we assess questions of law de novo,and review factual determinations for clear error.estate of kunze commissioner,cir kikalos commissioner,cir.moreover,we review applications of law to the facts for clear error.kunze,at kikalos,at pittman commissioner,cir.we will reverse findings of fact for clear error only when,on reviewing the entire record,we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.pittman,at.
the taxpayers complain that the tax court improperly allowed the irs to change its theory and method of proof in its brief and then embraced this new theory in its decision.according to the taxpayers,the government original theory was that a spreadsheet produced by the taxpayer showed in buydown income but their tax return reported only of buydown income,a difference of some.in its brief,the government suggested a different method of calculating the shortage,this time noting that the taxpayers accountant recorded in buydown income in october,and bank records showed that kikalos had purchased cashier checks using in buydown checks.because the accountant testified she was unaware of the purchase of the cashier checks and because kikalos did not produce sufficient records to demonstrate that he had reported any of that on his return,the government urged the tax court to add these figures together for a baseline of buydown income.after adjustments,and after subtracting the amount of buydown income the taxpayers did report on their return,the tax court adopted this new calculation and found that they underreported buydown income in the amount of.because this amount was nearly double the shortage the irs sought to prove,the tax court upheld the deficiency notice.the taxpayers urge us to find that this change in the calculation of the shortage constituted a whole new method of proof and theory that came too late in the proceedings.the taxpayers assert that because the irs raised these new positions in amended pleadings,the burden of proof,normally borne by the at this stage of the proceedings,should have been shifted to the irs.the taxpayers also maintain that allowing these new theories so late in the case prejudiced them and constituted reversible error.
deficiencies determined by the commissioner of internal revenue are presumed to be correct and the taxpayer bears the burden of proving otherwise.tax court rule a reynolds commissioner,cir pittman,at zuhone commissioner,cir.however,tax court rule also specifies that with respect to any new matter,increases in deficiency,and affirmative defenses,pleaded in the answer the burden of proof is on the commissioner.tax court rule a friedman commissioner,cir.the government did not seek an increase in the deficiency and affirmative defenses are not at issue thus the only dispute is whether the irs raised a new matter in its brief when it suggested a different calculation for the buydown income shortage.this is not a close call.the change in the method of calculation of the buydown income is not a new matter.a new position taken by the irs commissioner is not a new matter if it merely clarifies or develops the commissioner original determination without requiring the presentation of different evidence,being inconsistent with the commissioner original determination,or increasing the amount of the deficiency.friedman,at.see also estate of kanter commissioner,cir,rev on other grounds,d.
in kanter,we stated 
the commissioner is allowed the latitude to amend his pleadings and even adopt entirely new theories supporting assessed deficiencies without triggering rule shift in burden,so long as the new theory is not inconsistent with the original allegation,does not require new evidence in its support,nor increases the amount of the deficiency.
kanter,at emphasis in original.the original deficiency notice specified that the taxpayers failed to report coupon buy downs in the amount of,ex.another exhibit in the deficiency notice further detailed the shortage in a paragraph entitled statement regarding adjustment for coupon buy downs 
it is determined that all coupon income was not included in gross income.coupon income shown on each store general ledger data input sheet was totaled and compared to checks received and to your accountant summary of total coupon money.this comparison revealed additional income of and an adjustment is made accordingly.
ex.the calculation raised in the brief and largely adopted by the tax court was completely consistent with the original deficiency notice.both the notice and the brief sought to document unreported coupon and buydown income and both noted the difference between the accountant records and the buydown reimbursement checks received.no new evidence was required to conduct this new calculation.finally,although the new calculation demonstrated an even greater shortage than the deficiency notice specified,the government agreed to limit its recovery to the amount detailed in the original deficiency notice.the taxpayers were clearly on notice that the irs was examining buydown income in general and the difference between income reported to their accountant and total checks received.because this was not a new matter,the burden remained on the taxpayers to demonstrate that the commissioner deficiency determination was incorrect.
now that we have determined that the burden was on the taxpayers to demonstrate error in the deficiency determination,we turn to whether the taxpayers met this burden.according to the taxpayers,the theory adopted by the tax court relies on factors not supported by the evidence.in particular,the taxpayers claim that the court erroneously assumed they had a secret bank account,and also wrongly assumed that there was no overlap between the in buydown income recorded by their accountant on october,and the in buydown checks that kikalos used to purchase cashier checks.the taxpayers complain that the tax court erroneously manipulated the evidence regarding transactions near the end of the prior year and the beginning of the subsequent year.much of the taxpayers brief is devoted to attacks on the methodology and credibility of the revenue agent who conducted the audit.aside from the fact that nothing in the record undermines the credibility of the agent,we need not address these arguments because the tax court did not,in the end,rely on the agent original calculations in upholding the deficiency.we will therefore address only those arguments that relate to the tax court ultimate determi
