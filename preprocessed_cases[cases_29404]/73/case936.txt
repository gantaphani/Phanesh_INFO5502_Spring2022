the internal revenue service irs or government challenges the district court ruling denying its motion to enforce a summons against,mark richey,seeking production of an appraisal work file.the irs contends that the district court erred when it found that the summons was not issued in good faith,and that the appraisal work file was protected by the privilege and doctrine.
we hold that the irs summons was issued in good faith,and that the district court erred in finding that richey entire appraisal work file was protected by both the privilege and the doctrine.we therefore reverse and remand to the district court.
factual and procedural background 
alan and wendy pesky the peskys or taxpayers owned general and limited partnership interests in fawpeas,an idaho limited partnership.fawpeas,in turn,was the owner of certain real property located in ketchum,idaho the property.in january,the peskys retained the law firm of thornton byron llp thornton to provide legal advice to them concerning the granting by fawpeas of a conservation easement on the property the easement.on march,the peskys caused fawpeas to execute a conservation deed for the property in favor of the nature conservancy.on may,thornton retained mark richey,an appraiser,to provide valuation services and advice with respect to the conservation easement.in response,richey prepared an appraisal report to be filed with the taxpayers federal income tax return,and a work file concerning the value of the easement.
given their partnership interest in fawpeas,the peskys claimed an approximately charitable contribution deduction on their federal income tax return,stemming from their proportionate share of the alleged value of the easement.the approximately million bulk of the deduction was carried over on the peskys and federal income tax returns.richey appraisal report was attached to the peskys federal income tax return,as required by treasury regulation section c.the appraisal report noted t his report may not include full discussion of the data,reasoning,and analyses that were used in the appraisal process to develop the appraiser opinion of value.supporting documentation concerning the data,reasoning,and analyses is retained in the appraiser file.
on july,the irs mailed a summons to richey instructing him to appear before irs agent shane cole,and to provide testimony,documents,books,records,and information related to the services richey provided to the peskys.asserting the protections of the and privileges,thornton directed richey not to comply with the summons and richey followed thornton instructions.in october,the government filed a petition to enforce the summons.agent cole attached a declaration to the petition,stating that he was conducting an investigation of the peskys and federal income tax returns,had summoned richey to inquire about the valuation of the easement,and did not have the documents needed to determine the peskys correct tax liability.
in december,the irs issued a notice of deficiency to the peskys,which disallowed any charitable deduction stemming from the easement for the and federal income tax returns.the peskys responded to the notice of deficiency by paying the assessment,interest,and penalties claimed by the irs.on february,the district court granted the peskys motion to intervene in the government summons enforcement action against richey.the district court also ordered richey to show cause why he should not be compelled to comply with the summons.at the show cause hearing,the district court ordered the parties to provide supplemental briefing addressing whether the irs investigation had closed as the result of the peskys agreement to pay the assessment,interest,and penalties claimed by the irs in the notice of deficiency.on march,the district court issued a memorandum order quashing the summons.the irs appeals the decision of the district court.

discussion 
good faith and the summons 
the irs is authorized by statute to inquire into tax liabilities.in order to ascertain the correctness of any return,the irs may issue a summons for records and documents from third parties in connection with a tax liability investigation.a.summonses issued under section must be served personally or left at the person last and usual place of abode.a.
to obtain enforcement of a summons,the government has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case showing that the investigation will be conducted for a legitimate purpose,the inquiry is relevant to the purpose,the information sought is not already within the irs possession,and the administrative steps required by the irs code have been followed.united states powell,ponsford united states,cir.the government burden is a slight one,and may be satisfied by a declaration from the investigating agent that the powell requirements have been met.united states dynavac,cir.
once the government establishes a prima facie case,a party challenging the summons must show that the government is not entitled to use the court process to enforce the summons.powell,at.a court will not enforce a summons if an abuse would take place if the summons was issued for an improper purpose,such as to harass the taxpayer or to put pressure on him to settle a collateral dispute,or for any other purpose reflecting on the good faith of the particular investigation.id.it is a heavy burden to show an abuse of process or lack of good faith.fortney united states,cir.
the validity of a summons is normally tested as of the date of its issuance.united states cromer,cir.however,the court may inquire as to the reasons for the summons and may not permit its process to be abused in enforcing the summons.powell,at.
the government prima facie case 
generally,submitting a declaration from the investigating agent that the powell requirements have been met is sufficient to establish a prima facie case.dynavac,at.here,irs agent cole submitted a declaration that he was investigating the peskys tax liabilities,that he did not have the relevant appraisal work file,and that the administrative process was followed.
agent cole declaration was not wholly accurate.the administrative process was not completely followed because richey was served by certified mail rather than by personal service.see a.nonetheless,as the district court found,richey had actual notice of the summons,there was no prejudice to the taxpayers who timely intervened,and the government acted in good faith when it tried to effect service by certified mail.we agree with the reasoning of the eighth and fifth circuits that substantial compliance with a service requirements is sufficient if the irs acted in good faith and there is no prejudice to the taxpayer 
in this case,the irs service error was clearly harmless.the minor service error was properly excused by the district court,and the government satisfied its initial burden to establish a prima facie case in october,with agent cole declaration.thereafter,the burden shifted to richey and the peskys to show that the
