constitutional,statutory and regulatory chain of authority 
in california,county assessors are charged with assessing all property subject to general property taxation at its full value.except for property,all taxable property in a county is assessed annually to the person who owns,possesses,claims or controls it on the lien date,which is january,subd.a.
adopted november,article xiii,section of the california constitution empowers the legislature to authorize local taxing entities to provide for the assessment or reassessment of taxable property physically damaged or destroyed after the lien date to which the assessment or reassessment relates.pursuant to this authority,the legislature enacted section,a broad property tax disaster relief statute.subdivision a of section authorizes county boards of supervisors to pass ordinances which allow assessees of taxable property whose property was damaged or destroyed without his or her fault to apply for reassessment of that property.the statute goes on to state to be eligible for reassessment the damage or destruction to the property shall have been caused by any of the following a major misfortune or calamity,in an area or region subsequently proclaimed by the governor to be in a state of disaster,if that property was damaged or destroyed by the major misfortune or calamity that caused the governor to proclaim the area or region to be in a state of disaster.as used in this paragraph,damage includes a diminution in the value of property as a result of restricted access to the property where that restricted access was caused by the major misfortune or calamity.a misfortune or calamity.a misfortune or calamity that,with respect to a possessory interest in land owned by the state or federal government,has caused the permit or other right to enter upon the land to be suspended or restricted.as used in this paragraph,misfortune or calamity includes a drought condition such as existed in this state in and,subd.a.
in turn,rule represents an attempt to interpret the term damage as used in section.of interest in this action are the following provisions a for purposes of determining property eligible for reassessment pursuant to section,the term damage or destruction includes diminution in the value of the property resulting from a period of restricted physical access to the property.b restricted physical access to the property means that access to the property was wholly or partially denied to the property owner operator,or that the normal business activities of the property owner operator were suspended as a result of compliance with a directive,order,law or other exercise of police or regulatory powers by the federal,state or local government.rule,subds.a b.
ii.procedural background 
the sbe duly promulgated rule in accordance with the procedures set forth in the administrative procedures act apa,et following its enactment,the assessors of the counties of san mateo,santa clara,alameda and san diego sought declaratory relief concerning the validity of the rule and the assessors of riverside,sacramento and orange counties quickly and successfully applied to intervene.the sbe was named as the defendant several airlines,appellants herein also intervened.the sbe has not appealed the judgment.
the parties filed for summary judgment.the trial court granted the assessors motion and denied the motions of sbe and airlines.this appeal,by airlines only,followed.

scope of review 
the parties squabble over whether rule is a rule implicating the sbe exercise of a delegated lawmaking power,or an interpretive rule in which the agency construed section legal meaning and effect.we afford rules the dignity of statutes.therefore,when we scrutinize the validity of such rules,our scope of review is narrowly confined to determining whether the regulation comes within the scope of the controlling statute and is reasonably necessary to carry out the statutory purpose.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,yamaha.however,courts do have the last word when it comes to deciding whether a regulation lies within the scope of the authority delegated by the legislature.id.at,fn,d.in short,agencies do not have discretion to promulgate regulations that are inconsistent with the governing statute,or that alter or amend the statute or enlarge its scope.ontario community foundations,state bd.of equalization cal d.
an agency expertise with respect to pertinent legal and regulatory issues lends presumptive value to interpretive regulations.nonetheless,agency interpretations,whether expressed in a regulation or less formal statement,are nothing more than legal opinions freighted with a diminished power to bind.yamaha,supra,cal th at,d.the final construction of a statute rests with the courts,and in exercising that power we accord weight to an administrative interpretation based on the particular context.id.at,d.
courts have identified certain factors signifying that the agency interpretation of a given statute is probably correct.these include evidence that the agency consistently followed the interpretation in question,and the interpretation was contemporaneous with enactment of the statute subject to interpretation.yamaha,supra,cal th at,d.judicial deference is more deserving under circumstances indicating that the interpretation was part of a regulation adopted by the agency in accordance with the apa,rather than contained in an advice letter prepared by a staff member.however,even formal interpretive rules do not command the same weight as rules.id.at,d.again,in the end it is the courts that discern the meaning of statutes.
our supreme court has acknowledged that administrative rules do not always fall neatly into one category or the other the terms designate opposite ends of an administrative continuum,depending on the breadth of the authority delegated by the legislature.yamaha,supra,cal th at,fn,d,see ramirez yosemite water cal th,d.as further explained in ramirez,supra,at page,d,regulations falling somewhere along the continuum may share characteristics of and interpretive rules,as when an administrative agency exercises a legislatively delegated power to interpret key statutory terms.
here the sbe indicated it was promulgating rule pursuant to government code section,subdivision c.among other duties,this enabling statute mandates that the sbe p rescribe rules and regulations to govern assessors when assessing ibid.on the side of our analysis,without question the enactment of rule comes within the scope of duties delegated to the board by government code section because rule elaborates the meaning of damage or destruction for the purpose of applying section,therefore prescribing a rule that would govern all assessors when providing calamity reassessment relief under that statute.
however,government code section does not entrust sbe with discretion to promulgate a rule that conflicts with section or any other property tax law that is within its purview to enforce.whenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt regulations to implement,interpret,make specific or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute,no regulation adopted is valid or effective unless consistent and not in conflict with the statute and reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute.and because the sbe implied authority to interpret key terms in the property tax statutory scheme is an interpretive function,ultimately it is our job to decide whether a given interpretation is consistent and not in conflict with the operative statute.
weighing against attributing considerable judicial deference to sbe interpretation are the following its interpretation was not contemporaneous with the enactment of section and sbe has not historically and consistently maintained the interpretation codified in rule and indeed the board has abandoned its adherence to that interpretation by not defending it on appeal.weighing in favor of more deference is the fact that the promulgation of rule complied with all apa rulemaking procedures,including public notice and comment.some,but not substantial,deference is due in this case 
rule is not consistent with section,subdivision a or the constitutional provision that section,subdivision a implements.
airlines plain language argument does not hold.
airlines first insist that rule is consistent with the plain language of section,subdivision a,quoted above.since the provision states that it applies to damage due to a misfortune or calamity,they argue eligibility for reassessment thus is not restricted to any particular type of misfortune or calamity.continuing in this vein,airlines assert that the events of september,clearly constitute a misfortune or calamity as required by section,subdivision a.therefore,because the language does not forbid reassessment as prescribed by rule,we should construe the statute in a manner that effects the salutary purposes of affording taxpayers the remedy of reassessment due to a calamity or misfortune.
airlines omit a key fact in this argument the september,events did not occur in california and,other than the crashed aircraft which apparently were taxed in california but are not at issue here,no california property was physically damaged.
more to the point,airlines interpretation does not hold.the rules of statutory construction teach us that courts should ascertain the legislature intent so as to effect the purpose of the law in question.in fulfilling this rule,we look first to the language of the statute itself,considering that language in the context of the entire statute and statutory scheme.further,we are called to give effect to statutes according to the ordinary,usual import of the language used in framing them.we construe words in their context,mindful of the nature and obvious purpose of the statute where they appear.renee superior court cal th,d.
section spells out procedures for reassessment where there has been damage or destruction to the property brought about by a misfortune or calamity as delineated in section,subdivision a through.the term damage as it appears in the to these subsections can be viewed as ambiguous in that it does not specify the type of damage for which relief is available.however,section implements article xiii,section of the california constitution.the plain language of this constitutional provision permits reassessment where taxable property is physically damaged or destroyed.statutes inconsistent with our constitution are void.hotel employees restaurant employees internat.union davis cal th,d.it goes without saying that where possible,as it is here,we will construe statutes in favor of their validity.turner board of trustees cal d.
we are aware that the constitutional revision task force on article xiii as well as the ballot argument in favor of the proposition leading to enactment of the proposed article xiii,section that the revisions were not intended to be substantive in nature.from this airlines argue that section took the meaning of the predecessor section,which did not explicitly require that the property be physically damaged.first,we do not consult legislative history where,as here,the language is clear and unambiguous.title ins.trust county of riverside cal d.second,rather than ignoring the insertion of the word physical and violating the admonition that we give significance,if possible,to every word,phrase and part of an enactment mercer perez cal d,we conclude that inclusion of the term expressed the literal understanding and intent of the task force as it interpreted former section.in other words,physicality has always been a constitutional requirement,even when not explicitly stated.as explained by the legislative analyst in the very ballot argument to which airlines refer us,one of the purposes of the proposition was to clarify wording.insertion of the word physical did just that.
direct physical damage is a requirement of section,subdivision a but not of subdivision a and.
moreover,looking to the whole of the statute and its purpose,it is clear the legislature intended the qualifying damage to be physical damage.first,the one appellate court decision that has construed section states that its overall objective is to afford financial relief to the owners of property physically damaged or destroyed by an unforeseeable occurrence beyond their control.enterprises,county of los angeles d,italics added.second,looking to the context of the statute we observe that section,subdivision g states that t he assessed value of the property in its damaged condition shall be the taxable value of the property until it is restored,repaired,reconstructed italics added.property can not be restored,repaired or reconstructed unless it is physically damaged.
nonetheless,we recognize that in section,subdivision a and the legislature delineated two exceptions to the general meaning of damage or destruction as implying direct physical injury to the property,thereby providing limited relief for indirect physical damage.thus,in subdivision a the term damage includes diminution in value due to restricted access to the property,where the restricted access was caused by a major misfortune or calamity which spurred the governor to proclaim the area to be in a state of disaster.additionally,reassessment is available under subdivision a for a possessory interest in government land where a misfortune or calamity has restricted access to that land.however,no expanded meaning is set forth in subdivision a.where the legislature carefully uses a term or phrase in one place but excludes it in another,we will not imply the term or phrase where excluded.pasadena police officers city of pasadena cal d.further,where an exception to a general rule is specified by statute,we will not imply or presume other exceptions.mutual life ins.city of los angeles cal d.here the legislature provided for reassessment due to restricted access in section,subdivision a and,but not in subdivision a.moreover,construing subdivision a to apply in cases of restricted access would render mere surplusage the terms restricted access in subdivision a and the right to enter upon the land to be suspended or restricted in subdivision a.we always seek to avoid a construction that renders some words surplusage.estate of macdonald cal d.
attorney general opinions do not help airlines.
airlines also claim that the attorney general has opined that section applies to economic loss or damage caused by restricted physical access to property.their argument is convoluted and wrong.
in the attorney general construed former section,a predecessor to section,subdivision a which,like the current statute,defined damage as including diminished value due to restricted access,see stats,ch.that opinion addressed the issue whether former section allowed for reassessment of property that was not physically damaged and did not suffer impaired access but nonetheless experienced economic devaluation by reason of its location in the disaster area.the attorney general concluded it did not encompass such devaluation,supra,at.
three years later the attorney general turned attention to former section,a predeces
