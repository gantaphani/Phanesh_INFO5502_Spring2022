background 
formerly a federal government agency,fnma is a private,entity that provides liquidity for mortgage investments.fnma had a series of tax disputes with the government during the and early.one such dispute was resolved in by the tax court,which determined that fnma had overpaid its income taxes by and its income taxes by.fed.mortgage ass commissioner.the irs refunded the amounts overpaid,together with overpayment interest,in several installments between august and november.
meanwhile,in and,respectively,fnma made tax and deficiency interest payments to the irs as a consequence of income tax underpayments for the and tax years.the periods during which the irs owed fnma refunds of overpaid tax for and plus overpayment interest overlapped with the periods during which fnma owed the irs for the and deficiencies.during the periods of overlap,fnma owed no net tax.a net liability for fnma arose for each overlap period nonetheless,because the irs charges taxpayers a higher interest rate on underpayments than it pays in overpayment interest.
section d of the internal revenue code was enacted in as part of the irs restructuring and reform act of the rra,pub,stat.codified at d.it requires the irs to apply a zero net interest rate to overlapping periods of mutual indebtedness between a taxpayer and the irs,as follows 
elimination of interest on overlapping periods of tax overpayments and the extent that,for any period,interest is payable under subchapter a and allowable under subchapter b on equivalent underpayments and overpayments by the same taxpayer of tax imposed by this title,the net rate of interest under this section on such amounts shall be zero for such period.
d this provision applies to interest accrued after the rra july,date of enactment.however,the rra uncodified special rule allows taxpayers to request that a zero net interest rate be applied to,periods of overlapping mutual indebtedness in some circumstances 
special to any applicable statute of limitation not having expired with regard to either a tax underpayment or a tax overpayment,the amendments made by this section shall apply to interest for periods beginning before the date of the enactment of this act if the taxpayer 
a reasonably identifies and establishes periods of such tax overpayments and underpayments for which the zero rate applies and 
b not later than december,requests the secretary of the treasury to apply section d of the internal revenue code of to such periods.
pub.no,c,stat,amended by,d,stat.fnma filed an administrative claim with the irs pursuant to section d and the special rule for the application of a zero net interest rate to the overlapping periods at issue here in december.the irs disallowed fnma claim on june,it cited its revenue procedure,which interprets the special rule as requiring that both periods of limitation applicable to the tax underpayment and to the tax overpayment must have been open on july.proc,wl.the irs concluded that the limitations periods for the and underpayment years had expired it determined,therefore,that fnma claim did not satisfy the requirements of the special rule.
fnma then filed the present refund action pursuant to.the parties premised their for partial summary judgment on their differing interpretations of the s ubject to any applicable statute of limitation not having expired with regard to either a tax underpayment or a tax overpayment condition in the special rule fnma argued that retroactive application of section d via the special rule is available where the limitations period for either the overpayment period or the underpayment period had not expired as of july.the government argued that the special rule authorizes interest netting for,periods only if both limitations periods had not expired.
in a very careful and thorough opinion,the court of federal claims granted summary judgment in favor of fnma,holding that the special rule applies as long as at least one of the applicable statutes of limitations remains open.fed.mortgage.at.it concluded that it is impossible to tell from the plain language of the statute which interpretation congress intended,id.at,and discerned no guidance from the sparse and ambiguous legislative history,id.at.it held that no deference was due the irs interpretation set forth in revenue procedure under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,or skidmore swift.it found,however,compelling principles supporting the conclusion it reached,including a rule of statutory construction that doubt in matters of statutory interpretation be resolved against the government and in favor of the taxpayer together with the principle that remedial statutes should be interpreted broadly in order to effectuate congressional goals.fed.mortgage,fed.cl.at.

discussion 
we review the court of federal claims grant of summary judgment without deference.agwiak united states.
as the court of federal claims noted,statutory interpretation begins with the language of the statute.duncan walker,d.here,however,we agree that the language at issue s ubject to any applicable statute of limitation not having expired with regard to either a tax underpayment or a tax overpayment is equally subject to both proffered interpretations,the parties efforts to persuade us to the contrary notwithstanding.
we further agree that revenue procedure is not entitled to chevron deference.the court of federal claims correctly noted that an agency pronouncement not promulgated pursuant to an explicit or implicit congressional delegation of authority is not entitled to deference under chevron.fed.mortgage,fed.cl.at citing united states mead,d.the government argues that a revenue procedure qualifies for chevron deference,noting that all irs forms of agency regulations,revenue rulings,and revenue procedures are promulgated with a comparable degree of formality and care,and that there is,therefore,no sound basis for distinguishing between treasury regulations and other irs pronouncements.united states cleveland indians baseball,d affording treasury regulation substantial judicial deference.as the court of federal claims observed,however,the issue is not whether the irs voluntarily subjected revenue procedure to a measure of formalized review,but whether congress intended for the irs to do so.fed.mortgage,fed.cl.at.furthermore,the irs limited solicitation of public comment did not extend to the statute of limitations issue 
the government notes that we have left undecided the question of whether revenue rulings are entitled to chevron deference in accordance with mead.am.mut.life ins.united states.even assuming,however,that revenue rulings may,in some circumstances,qualify for deference under chevron,the pronouncement at issue here is a revenue procedure,not a revenue ruling.the government asks that we ignore the distinction between the two,but the distinction is of the irs own making.as the court of federal claims noted,treasury regulations define a revenue ruling as an official interpretation by the irs published for the information and guidance of taxpayers,irs officials,and others concerned.d i a.a revenue procedure is defined as a statement of procedure that affects the rights or duties of taxpayers or other members of the public under the code and related statutes or information that,although not nec
