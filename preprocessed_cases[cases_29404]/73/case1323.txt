this case is before us on appeal by the taxpayer from a decision of the tax court denying innocent spouse relief under.we affirm that decision for the reasons that follow.
background 
the facts necessary to this decision are not in dispute.see mitchell commissioner,cch,wl.appellant ella marie mitchell was married to herbert mitchell for many years before his death in.in,mitchell received a distribution from the teacher retirement system of the state of maryland in two checks dated june,totaling.he also received two form information returns aggregating the total and showing of it as taxable,and the parties stipulated that amount was taxable.mitchell did not roll over the distribution into an individual retirement account or other exempt trust or arrangement.he purchased treasury securities with the distribution.
after mitchell sudden death in march,mitchell filed a joint return for.the return as filed with the internal revenue service irs reported the entire gross distribution to mitchell accurately,but reported that only was taxable.in explanation,an attachment claimed,accurately,in employee contributions and,inaccurately,as an excluded rollover into a qualified plan as a matter of fact,there was no effective rollover.the irs determined a deficiency,and in due course mitchell appeared in the tax court,seeking innocent spouse relief under.
the tax court found as fact that mitchell did know of the receipt,amount,and nature of the distribution to mitchell but that she did not know that its treatment on the return was incorrect.relying upon his finding of mitchell knowledge and on the tax court decision in cheshire commissioner,wl,aff,cir,the presiding judge held that mitchell was not entitled to relief under either of subsections b or c of.mitchell,at.in addition,the judge held that the irs had not abused its discretion in denying equitable relief under f.mitchell,at.mitchell,a resident of the district of columbia,appealed to this court.a.
ii.analysis 
subsection b relief,b 
there are three grounds for relief under section,set out respectively in subsections b,c,and f thereof.mitchell sought relief under each,and we address each in turn.
subsection b provides in pertinent part 
under procedures prescribed by the secretary,if 
a a joint return has been made for a taxable year 
b on such return there is an understatement of tax attributable to erroneous items of one individual filing the joint return 
c the other individual filing the joint return establishes that in signing the return he or she did not know,and had no reason to know,that there was such understatement 
d taking into account all the facts and circumstances,it is inequitable to hold the other individual liable for the deficiency in tax for such taxable year attributable to such understatement and 
e the other individual elects in such form as the secretary may prescribe the benefits of this subsection not later than the date which is years after the date the secretary has begun collection activities with respect to the individual making the election,
then the other individual shall be relieved of liability for tax including interest,penalties,and other amounts for such taxable year to the extent such liability is attributable to such understatement.
b.the parties agreed that subparagraphs a and e were satisfied,but the irs contested b,c,and d.the tax court decided the issue on the basis that subparagraph c was not satisfied because of mitchell knowledge of the facts,and therefore did not address subparagraphs b and d.
we find no error in the tax court determination of this issue.the tax court found as fact that,although mitchell did not know the tax consequences,she did know that her husband had received the distribution from the retirement system,when he had received it,the amount of the distribution,and what he had done with it.it was she who informed the tax return preparer that mitchell had not rolled over the funds and provided accurate forms to the preparer.there was some indication in the record that the distribution could not have been rolled over in any event,but that is irrelevant as neither mitchell nor mitchell attempted a rollover within any otherwise applicable time period.accordingly,it is clear that she knew every fact necessary to determine that the distribution,less mitchell investment,was fully taxable and not excludable.thus,although the tax court found she did not know in fact of any understatement,the facts that she did know gave her reason to know of the understatement of tax on the joint return within the meaning of b c.
our holding on this point,although apparently one of first impression in this circuit,is consistent with the holdings of other circuits under current subparagraph b c,see cheshire commissioner,cir,and under its predecessor,e c.see buchine commissioner,cir bokum commissioner,cir clevenger commissioner,cir shea commissioner,cir.the current version differs from its predecessor only in the replacement of the former spouse by the current individual filing the joint return and of the former substantial underpayment by the current underpayment simpliciter.accordingly,decisions interpreting the former subparagraph e c that do not turn on these differences remain persuasive,if not controlling,under the current subparagraph b c.butler commissioner,wl.madley parole comm n,same re.
mitchell observes that many of these cases are omitted income cases applying what is called the knowledge of the transaction test.she contends that we should instead follow the ninth circuit decision in price commissioner,cir,and its progeny,which she argues employ a different standard of knowledge in innocent spouse cases involving erroneous deductions.fundamentally the standard for which mitchell argues is that her lack of knowledge of the tax consequences of the income received,or of its proper treatment on the return,establishes that she did not have reason to know of the underpayment.no decision,not even price,has gone that far.price itself expressly stated that it was not addressing an ignorance of law defense.the price court opened its discussion of whether the claimant there had reason to know with the following 
of itself,ignorance of the attendant legal or tax consequences of an item which gives rise to a deficiency is no defense for one seeking to obtain innocent spouse relief.in bernadette price commissioner,cch,wl,for example,the tax court denied innocent spouse protection to a joint return taxpayer who admitted she knew about unreported funds her husband had embezzled despite the fact she did not know that embezzled funds constitute taxable income.bernadette price,at.thus,if a spouse knows virtually all of the facts pertaining to the transaction which underlies the substantial understatement,her defense in essence is premised solely on ignorance of law.id.in such a scenario,regardless of whether the spouse possesses knowledge of the tax consequences of the item at issue,she is considered as a matter of law to have reason to know of the substantial understatement and thereby is effectively precluded from establishing to the contrary.
here,while the tax court properly concluded that patricia price,no relation to bernadette knew certain facts about the ccm investment for which her husband claimed an erroneous deduction,it can not be said that patricia was so intimately involved with the investment such that she knew virtually all of the facts of the transaction underlying the deduction,leaving her no option but to rely solely upon ignorance of law as a defense and therefore leaving us no option but to conclude that she had reason to know of the understatement.because patricia ignorance extends beyond the legal consequences of the deduction,we proceed to determine on the facts before us whether patricia had reason to know that the return contained a substantial understatement.
cir citations omitted emphasis added.on the facts before us,however,it is perfectly clear that mitchell knew every fact necessary to determine the legal consequences of the income,and that her defense is simply that she did not know those consequences.we hold that mitchell complete factua
