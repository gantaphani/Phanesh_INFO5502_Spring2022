discussion 
itimeliness of application 
kuperman contends the trial court erred in finding the assessor lacked jurisdiction to revise the base year value.he contends revenue and taxation code section authorized the assessor to correct the base year value in the assessment year after the easement was discovered,not just during the first four years after the base year value was first determined.
under the california constitution,article xiii a,section,subdivision a,a county assessor must determine a base year value for property when it changes ownership,that is,the full cash value or fair market value of the property,subd.b.for purposes of determining the full cash value or fair market value of real property full cash value or fair market value is the purchase price paid in the transaction unless it is established by a preponderance of the evidence that the real property would not have transferred for that purchase price in an open market transaction.the purchase price shall,however,be rebuttably presumed to be the full cash value or fair market value if the terms of the transaction were negotiated at arms length between a knowledgeable transferor and transferee neither of which could take advantage of the exigencies of the other,subd.b.a fter a property base year value is determined,subsequent entries onto the assessment rolls generally are done pro forma without the need to exercise one judgment as to value,simply by applying an inflation factor to the previous year entry.montgomery ward county of santa clara th,d montgomery ward.
section allows a taxpayer to request the assessor to correct the base year.in relevant part,section,states 
a notwithstanding any other provision of the law,any error or omission in the determination of a base year value,including the failure to establish that base year value,which does not involve the exercise of an assessor judgment as to value,shall be corrected in any assessment year in which the error or omission is discovered.
b an error or an omission described in subdivision a which involves the exercise of an assessor judgment as to value may be corrected only if it is placed on the current roll or roll being prepared,or is otherwise corrected,within four years after july of the assessment year for which the base year value was first established.
in enacting section,the legislature added a preamble to section,stating 
a the legislature finds and declares that fairness and equity require that county assessors have express authority to make corrections to property tax values whenever it is discovered that a value does not reflect applicable constitutional or statutory valuation standards or the value was omitted.any limitations imposed upon the assessor authority to correct these errors would result in a system of taxation which,on the one hand,denies the benefits of article xiii a of the california constitution to some taxpayers where the barred error or correction would reduce the value and,on the other hand,encourages even the most honest person to engage in deception and concealment in order to delay discovery of changes in ownership or new construction beyond the point where a correction of the value can be made.further,the failure to place any value on the assessment roll for property which completely escapes taxation because of limitations on the authority to correct errors would violate the constitutional requirement that all property in the state shall be subject to taxation.nothing in this act violates either the spirit or the letter of article xiii a of the california constitution since all corrections permitted by it must be consistent with applicable constitutional and statutory valuation standards.
b the legislature further finds and declares that the provisions of law relating to escape assessments are in no way inconsistent with article xiii a of the california constitution.an escape assessment merely reflects the amount by which the property has been underassessed and is a mechanism which permits the correction of the effects of that underassessment.the amount of the underassessment must be determined,however,in accordance with the applicable statutory valuation standards.thus,an escape assessment is merely a mechanism for implementing existing property tax law and can not be in conflict with it.accordingly,the amendments to sections and of the revenue and taxation code made by this act are necessary to make clear that an escape assessment resulting from the correction of an error in a value may be made within four,six,or eight years,as applicable,after the first day of july of the assessment year,as defined in section of the revenue and taxation code,in which the property either wholly escaped taxation or was underassessed,as determined by applying the applicable article xiii a valuation standards.stats,ch,a,b,reprinted at historical and statutory notes,west ann.ed.foll,italics added.

the courts have found challenges to fall within the scope of section,subdivision b when they involve a claim the assessor determination of the base year value failed to reflect the fair market value of the property.see metropolitan culinary services,county of los angeles th,d claimed incorrect method of calculation used in computing base year value for a possessory lease interest found to be a situation under section,subdivision b,in that an assessor exercised discretion in initially setting the base year value see also plaza hollister.partnership county of san benito th,d challenge claiming overassessment of property and erroneous base year value is a matter involving the exercise of judgment as to value blackwell homes county of santa clara d.where the assessor has already had one bite at the apple,where he has once exercised his judgment as to value of the property and now wants to change his mind,under the statutory scheme,including section,the assessor should do it within four years or not at all.
kuperman contends his situation falls within the scope of section,subdivision a,which allows correction of the base year value in any assessment year in which an error or omission was discovered.he argues language in the preamble to section supports an unconditional expansion of authority to correct any error in the determination of base year values whenever discovered.kuperman also relies on quotations and characterizations of the legislative history of section contained in sunrise retirement,supra,th,d.the sunrise retirement court stated 
t he legislative history of the law strongly supports the view that lifting time restrictions on correcting nonjudgmental mistakes was meant to be a street,benefiting taxpayers and assessors equally.
the senate revenue and taxation committee report on senate bill reg.sess.states,since it is possible for assessment errors to go either way,both in favor of and against the taxpayer,the dreyer case can result in higher taxes on a property due to a assessment error.if,for example,a property is appraised too high based on incorrect information,and neither the taxpayer nor the assessor realize the error for more than four years,existing law would prevent the tax from being reduced now or in any future year until the property changes ownership.comments,tax.com.dig,bill,italics added.the assembly report emphasizes that the correction must be made in the year the error or omission was discovered,regardless of when the valuation was originally made.bill on bill,assem.com.on tax.june,italics added.the report also boasts of the new law ameliorative effect on property owners bill protects taxpayers from overassessments.it is possible for assessment errors to occur which either underassess or overassess properties.if a property is inadvertently valued too high,and the overvaluation is not discovered within four years,under current law the tax could not be reduced until the property changes ownership.this bill is intended to protect taxpayers from this kind of inflexibility,id.at,italics added.sunrise retirement,supra,at,d.
while the preamble and the quoted legislative history contain some sweeping language that apparently support kuperman argument,we must focus on the actual legislation enacted and apply the rules of statutory construction.
in interpreting a statute,we must look first to the words of the statute,giving to the language its usual,ordinary import and giving significance to every word,phrase and sentence if possible.quintano mercury casualty cal th,d.when used in a statute,words must be construed in context,keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute where they appear.citation.moreover,the various parts of a statutory enactment must be harmonized by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.pueblos del rio south city of san diego d.if the language of the statute is not ambiguous,the plain meaning controls and resort to extrinsic sources to determine the legislature intent is unnecessary.kavanaugh west sonoma county union high school dist.cal th,d.when the statutory language is unambiguous,we presume the legislature meant what it said and the plain meaning of the statute governs.bonnell medical board cal th,d,quoting diamond multimedia systems,superior court cal th,d.
here,the words of section unambiguously state that only some errors in the base year value are subject to correction at any time.under subdivision a of section,errors or omissions in the base year value not involving the exercise of an assessor judgment as to value are correctable in any assessment year in which the error or omission is discovered.in contrast,under subdivision b of section errors or omissions in the base year value involv ing the exercise of an assessor judgment as to value may be corrected only if it is placed on the current roll or roll being prepared,or is otherwise corrected,within four years after july of the assessment year for which the base year value was first established.simply put,while the legislative history and preamble cited by kuperman refer to correction of errors whenever discovered,the language of section,subdivision b unambiguously provides that errors involving the assessor exercise of judgment as to value are subject to a limitations period.since the words of the statute are clear in this regard,we must rely on the language actually used and not the legislative history.
kuperman contends the language of section supports a conclusion that an assessor exercise of judgment as to value occurs only when the assessor enrolls the property at some value other than the purchase price and since the assessor enrolled his property at the purchase price,the assessor exercised no judgment as to the value of the property.the record,however,shows the assessor office did not simply enroll the property at the purchase price.instead,the assessor,believing the purchase price was below the fair market value of the property since the property had sold for in,conducted an investigation.only after considering declines in the real estate market from to,information about the property contained in the multiple listing service,comparable sales,and evidence showing the parcel possibly had unexploded military ordnance from camp pendleton,did the assessor conclude the purchase price was within the range of market value for the property.the assessor in this case clearly made a judgment call that the purchase price adequately reflected the fair market value of the property.
kuperman contends the assessor failed to take into account the sdg e easement when the property was valued in and therefore the assessor did not exercise judgment as to the value of the easement.the easement here,however,was recorded and,thus,we must presume the assessor took into account the easement at the time the base year value was determined.kuperman has not provided any information supporting a contrary conclusion.moreover,at a minimum,both the assessor and kuperman must be charged with constructive notice of the easement.recording an easement gives notice to prospective purchasers and to the assessor office that the land is encumbered with an easement.
whatever is the ultimate scope of section,subdivision a,it clearly was not intended to encompass recorded easements.recorded easements necessarily are encompassed within an assessor exercise of judgment as to value since recorded easements directly affect the fair market value of property and thus the assessor judgment as to that property value.to hold a taxpayer late discovery of a recorded easement falls within subdivision a of section would create the anomalous situation that,on the one hand,the taxpayer is charged with notice of the easement at the time of the purchase because it is recorded and,on the other hand,the taxpayer is given an unlimited period in which to discover the easement.we do not believe the legislature intended this result.
we conclude kuperman claim fell within the scope of section,subdivision b and was not timely brought within the limitations period.
due process and equal protection 
kuperman asserts the constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection require that he be permitted an opportunity to have the base year value corrected.he asserts it is fundamentally unfair to deny a property owner the opportunity to have corrected an error in the determination of his base year value whenever an error is discovered.he asks,why should a taxpayer get stuck with an inflated base year value simply because an error in the purchase price enrolled by the assessor in lieu of appraising the property was not discovered within four years of the enrollment of the base year value according to kuperman,the legislature clearly recognized the problem,and i n light of the obvious harm and the absence of any legitimate countervailing interest any limitation on the assessor authority to correct such an error would violate substantive due process and equal protection.he urges us to interpret,subdivision a to apply to his application.we find these arguments unpersuasive.
first,as the assessor points out,kuperman did not raise these issues below and therefore did not preserve them for appeal.richmond dart industries,d.
second,as appellant,kuperman is obligated to support his assertion of error with relevant legal authority and analysis he has the burden of showing error occurred.see atchley city of fresno d.where a point is merely asserted by appellant counsel without any argument of or authority for the proposition,it is deemed to be without foundation and requires no discussion by the reviewing court howard thrifty drug discount stores cal th,d,burden of showing error occurred city of lincoln barringer th,d rejecting due process argument when appellants failed to develop any argument or cite relevant authority to support their argument.in his argument,he cites only two cases lassiter department of social services,d,in support of his due process argument and nordlinger hahn,d,in support of his equal protection argument.lassiter involves a claimed violation of procedural,rather than substantive,due process and whether an indigent parent was entitled to have appointed counsel during a parental termination hearing.nordlinger involves an equal protection challenge to california property tax scheme on the basis that persons owning similar property were paying different amounts of taxes depending on when the property changed ownership.nordlinger did not address a challenge to a limitations period and upheld the statutory scheme.kuperman does not explain how either case is relevant to or supports his argument.we fail to see the significance.nor does he engage in any meaningful argument or analysis as to his due process or equal protection claims other than to assert imposition of a statute of limitations is unfair.
third,kuperman us to find unconstitutional a limitations period created by the law recognizing that s tatutes of limitation are within the jurisdictional power of the legislature of a state scheas robertson cal d.a constitutional right is always subject to reasonable statutory limitations as to the time within which to enforce it,if the constitution itself does not provide otherwise.the power of the legislature to provide reasonable periods of limitation,therefore,is unquestioned,and the fixing of time limits within which particular rights must be asserted is a matter of legislative policy the nullification of which is not a judicial prerogative.muller muller d.adams roses d.fontana land laughlin cal,norgart upjohn cal th,d,regents of university of california superior court cal th,d.statutes of limitations further a public policy of promot ing repose by giving security and stability to human affairs.wood carpenter.shain sresovich cal,norgart upjohn,supra,at,d.
there is nothing inherently unreasonable in the legislature determination to limit an assessor authority to exercise its judgment to change the base year value to a period.such a limitations period gives property owners a reasonable time to discover latent problems or encumbrances on the property or to challenge the method the assessor used to calculate the base year value.montgomery ward,supra,th,d,where the court rejected an argument that allowing an assessor to correct an error at any that case a failure to set a new base year value upon a change of inherently unfair.
finally,we note that a property owner is not left without other remedies.for example,here,kuperman sought recourse against his title insurance company for failing to disclose the encumbrance that reduced the property value additionally,if an undisclosed encumbrance or circumstance subsequently reduces the value of the property below the base year value,the property owner may seek a reassessment of the property,subd.a.
the limitations period of section,subdivision b for errors in the base year value involving the assessor exercise of judgment in determining value does not violate the constitutional guarantee of due process or equal protection.
disposition 
the judgment is affirmed.respondent is awarded costs on appeal.
introduction 
while acknowledging that both the legislative history and the preamble to revenue and taxation code section refer to correction of errors whenever discovered,the majority asserts that the language of section,subdivision b unambiguously provides that errors involving the assessor exercise of judgment as to value are subject to a limitations period,and concludes that,s ince the words of the statute are clear in this regard,we must rely on the language actually used and not the legislative history,ante,at,italics added.
i do not agree that the language of is unambiguous,since it is not at all clear what the phrases does not involve the exercise of an assessor judgment as to value,subd.a and involves the exercise of an assessor judgment as to value,subd.b connote.under the majority view,this language apparently means that if the assessor exercised judgment in determining the base year value of a property,a limitations period would apply to any attempt to correct any error in that valuation.in my view,an equally or more plausible interpretation of this statutory language would be that if the alleged error or omission involves the exercise of the assessor judgment as to value,the assessor knew about an easement but chose not to reduce the assessed value of the property based on the existence of the easement,a limitations period would apply to any challenge to the assessed value based on the impact of the easement.but if the allegation were that the assessor valuation was incorrect because the assessor unknowingly failed to consider material information affecting the value of the property,an unrecorded easement,even where the assessor otherwise exercised judgment in determining the base year value,that error may be corrected in any year in which the error or omission is discovered.
to the extent the majority opinion can be read to suggest that the statute unambiguously provides that a statute of limitations would apply in any case in which the assessor exercised judgment in arriving at the value,i disagree.however,i concur in the result the majority reaches because i agree that in the particular circumstances of this case,both the assessor and kuperman must be charged with constructive notice of the san diego gas electric company sdg e easement,since w hatever is the ultimate scope of section,subdivision a,it clearly was not intended to encompass recorded easements,ante,at.while we need not determine the precise meaning of section in order to resolve this case,i write separately to note the ambiguity in the statute.
the enactment of section a.the decision in dreyer grand ice cream,county of alameda and the impact of proposition 
according to the legislative history of section,the statute was enacted in response to dreyer grand ice cream,county of alameda d.dreyer.see reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended,hereafter reading analysis cal.of finance,enrolled bill on bill reg.sess.prepared for governor deukmejian,hereafter enrolled bill state bd.of equalization,legislative bill analysis of bill reg.sess.as introduced,hereafter state bd.of equalization analysis com.on,analysis of bill reg.sess.as introduced,hereafter com.analysis.
in dreyer,the county assessor physically inspected and appraised a cold storage warehouse that had recently been built on a property owned by dreyer predecessor,associated food stores,associated.the appraisal was done as of march,the lien date for the assessment year.dreyer,supra,d at.in june,proposition,which redefined the base year values of both and properties,was adopted.dreyer,supra,d at.as a result of the enactment of proposition in,property taxes in california were reassessed at the lower of the fair market value or the base year value,which was defined as the county assessor valuation as of the tax year.after the enactment of proposition,increases in value were limited to a maximum of percent per year.further,a change in base year value would occur only upon a transfer of ownership.metropolitan culinary services,county of los angeles th,d.thus,an inflated or underassessed base year value,if left uncorrected,would result in either over or of the property at issue until such time as the property changes hands.
after the enactment of proposition,the county assessor in dreyer reassessed the warehouse improvements by adopting the value shown on the assessment roll and adding a percent inflation increase.dreyer,supra,d at.in the fall of,the county assessor conducted an audit of the books and records of associated and discovered that the warehouse improvements had been substantially underassessed for,and for all subsequent years.ibid.
in february of,the assessor revised the base year value of the warehouse and levied escape assessments for the tax years,and.dreyer,supra,d at.associated paid the increased taxes,under protest,and ultimately filed a lawsuit for a refund of the escape assessments.id.at.while that case was pending,dreyer,which had purchased the warehouse,was substituted as plaintiff.ibid.
the issue in dreyer,as stated by the court of appeal,was whether the statutory bar prescribed for escape assessments begins to run from the time when the base year value of the property was originally determined under proposition cal,art.xiii a,and its implementing legislation,or whether it commences to run from the assessment year in which the property,in whole or in part,escaped taxation.dreyer,supra,d at.
dreyer argued that 
proposition brought about radical changes in our property taxation system which,of necessity,impacted the whole statutory scheme relating to property taxes proposition made the base year value of the property the cornerstone of taxation which can not be revised or altered under the guise of escape assessments.while escape assessments are still available to the taxing authority in case the property was underassessed or escaped taxation altogether,this power of the assessor must be exercised in harmony with proposition.it follows that the limit prescribed by the statute must commence from the base year and may not depend on the happenstance when the assessor discovers the error in assessment.dreyer,supra,d at.
the dreyer court agreed with this argument and affirmed the judgment,holding that the assessor could not correct a proposition base year thus,that taxes could not be an underassessment that was not discovered until more than four years after the base year value was established.in explaining its reasoning,the court observed that in enacting section,the legislature intended to set a deadline for challenging the base year values outlined in section.since section allows the taxpayer four years from the time of the original determination of the base year value to file a challenge,elementary fairness requires that the county shall have only the same period of time within which to correct the base year values by way of escape assessments.dreyer,supra,d at.
the language of section 
the uncodified preamble to section provides in part,
the legislature finds and declares that fairness and equity require that county assessors have express authority to make corrections to property tax values whenever it is discovered that a value does not reflect applicable constitutional or statutory valuation standards or the value was omitted.any limitations imposed upon the assessor authority to correct these errors would result in a system of taxation which,on the one hand,denies the benefits of article xiii a of the california constitution to some taxpayers where the barred error or correction would reduce the value and,on the other hand,encourages even the most honest person to engage in deception and concealment in order to delay discovery of changes in ownership or new construction beyond the point where a correction of the value can be made 
the pertinent portions of section provide,
a notwithstanding any other provision of the law,any error or omission in the determination of a base year value pursuant to paragraph of subdivision a of section,including the failure to establish that base year value,which does not involve the exercise of an assessor judgment as to value,shall be corrected in any assessment year in which the error or omission is discovered.
b an error or omission described in subdivision a which involves the exercise of an assessor judgment as to value may be corrected only if it is placed on the current roll or roll being prepared,or is otherwise corrected within four years after july of the assessment year for which the base year value was first established.
the statutory preamble at the very least implies that in enacting section,the legislature intended to rectify the unfairness it perceived in limiting the ability of either the assessor or the property owner to correct under or overassessed base year values that would otherwise,under proposition,affect the property tax in perpetuity.reading analysis,supra,at see discussion of,ante,at.if that was the intent of the legislature,then the interpretation of section that would make the most sense would be to say that where the error or omission did not involve the assessor judgment as to value,in determining the base year value,the assessor unknowingly failed to take into consideration information bearing on the value of the property,under section,subdivision a,such error or omission may be corrected in any year in which it is discovered.but in cases in which the assessor did exercise judgment as to the subject matter of the alleged error or omission,under subdivision b,a statute of limitations would apply.however,the statute itself is not clear as to what the legislature meant by the phrase an error or omission which involves the exercise of an assessor judgment as to value,subd.b.
legislative history of section 
where the language of a statute is ambiguous,courts must examine the history and background of the statutory provision in an attempt to ascertain the most reasonable interpretation of the measur
