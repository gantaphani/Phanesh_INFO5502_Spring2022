square d company attempted to take deductions for certain interest payments to its french parent that accrued in and.relying on treasury regulation a,the commissioner of the internal revenue service adopted the position that any such deductions had to be taken when the interest payments were actually made,not when they accrued.square d challenged this regulation and the commissioner actions before the tax court.the tax court sided with the commissioner,and we affirm.
square d company square d and the commissioner of the internal revenue service the commissioner agree on nearly all of the pertinent facts and stipulated to them in the tax court.before diving into the particulars,however,we will sketch the relevant tax code sections and regulations because these provisions supply not only the frame,but also the subject of the disagreement between the parties.
the internal revenue code the code allows a taxpayer to take a deduction on all interest paid or accrued within a taxable year on indebtedness.irc a.other provisions of the code determine which of these two deduction in the year of accrual or.generally,corporations with gross receipts of more than million are taxpayers that must use the accrual method of accounting.irc a,b.under the accrual method,a taxpayer must include income and deductions in the taxable year in which the income or liability is fixed and can be determined with reasonable accuracy.reg.c ii.this compares to the other primary accounting method,the cash method,under which a taxpayer must include all income and deductions in the taxable year in which they are actually received or paid.irc c,reg.c i.
special rules govern if a taxpayer attempts to take a deduction based on a transaction with a related person or corporation.irc.as a general matter,a taxpayer can not take a deduction for a loss from a sale or exchange of property with a related person.irc a.a taxpayer can,however,claim a deduction for other types of payments to a related person.irc a.however,if the parties employ different systems of accounting,the taxpayer can obtain this deduction only in the taxable year in which the related payee claims the income.id.any deduction allowable under this chapter in respect of such amount shall be allowable as of the day as of which such amount is includible in the gross income of the person to whom the payment is made.the determination of when a taxpayer can claim this deduction,therefore,depends on which method of accounting the related payee employs.if the related payee is on the accrual method,the taxpayer will claim the deduction when it accrued,even if the taxpayer is on the cash method.likewise,if the related payee is on the cash method,the taxpayer will claim the deduction when it pays the money,even if it reports on the accrual basis.
the code treats payments to a foreign related party separately,granting the secretary of the treasury the secretary power to enact regulations in this sphere.specifically,irc a provides that the secretary shall by regulations apply the matching principle of a in cases in which the person to whom the payment is to be made is not a united states person.in response to this directive,the secretary promulgated treasury regulation a.in general,this regulation provides for the cash method of accounting when claiming deductions for payments to a related foreign person.reg.a b.the regulations,however,proceed to exempt certain types of payment to a related foreign person from the cash method of treasury regulation a b and irc a.reg.a c.this exemption applies to any amount that is income of a related foreign person with respect to which the related foreign person is exempt from united states taxation on the amount owed pursuant to a treaty obligation of the united states,except for interest.id.in the case of interest that is not effectively connected income of the related foreign person the cash method of reg.a b continues to govern.id.
having swallowed this preliminary dose of the code and its regulations,we proceed to the relevant facts of the present case.square d is an accrual basis taxpayer with its principal place of business in illinois.schneider schneider,a french corporation,acquired square d on may.while the precise mechanics of the deal are not particularly important for our purposes,basically schneider created an acquisition subsidiary through which it financed the purchase of square d stock in the amount of billion.as part of this arrangement,the acquisition subsidiary obtained loans in the amount of million from schneider and two of its affiliates.after the purchase of square d,schneider then merged the acquisition subsidiary and its massive loans into square d,thus passing the responsibility for repaying the loans to square d.in,square d obtained a direct loan from schneider in the amount of million.square d accrued in interest on these loans in and in,but did not attempt to deduct these amounts in its tax returns for those years.square d then paid off the interest on these loans in and.as schneider and its affiliates excluding square d were bona fide residents of france,they were exempt from united states taxes on the interest payments because of treaties.
as part of a audit,the irs determined that square d had a tax deficiency in and.square d challenged this determination before the tax court in part by arguing that it should be allowed to deduct the loan interest amounts in the years in which they accrued,and more specifically,square d contended that treasury regulation a constituted a flawed interpretation of the statutory mandate contained in irc a and was invalid.square d argued in the alternative that,if it were valid,treasury regulation a violated the nondiscrimination clause contained in the convention between the united states of america and the french republic with respect to taxes on income and property,signed on july,the treaty.
the tax court sided with the commissioner.this was not the first time the tax court had considered this issue.previously,the tax court had concluded treasury regulation a was invalid.see tate lyle,comm r of internal revenue,wl.however,the third circuit reversed the tax court,concluding,after a chevron analysis and an examination of the legislative history,that treasury regulation a was not manifestly contrary to the congressional intent expressed in irc a.see tate lyle,comm r of internal revenue,cir.now,the tax court has abandoned its prior view of this regulation by a vote in light of the third circuit opinion.the tax court also found that this regulation did not impose any obligations on square d that offended the treaty.square d appeals.
as before the tax court,square d presents two challenges to the validity of treasury regulation a,which the commissioner relied on when denying the requested and deductions.first,square d argues that irc a simply directs the commissioner to implement the matching principle of irc a in the foreign context with no additions or subtractions.square d contends that treasury regulation a did not follow the congressional imperative contained in irc a and,therefore,did not constitute a reasonable interpretation of the enabling legislation.square d wants a strict implementation of irc a in the foreign context because of its reading of the matching principle.square d asserts that because schneider,a french corporation,can not be taxed on interest payments,square d has nothing to match against.therefore,square d believes that it would be outside the ambit of irc a and could simply take its normal accrual deduction.square d alternative line of attack focuses on the nondiscrimination clause contained in the treaty and argues that treasury regulation a runs afoul of this provision by imposing burdens on foreign owners of american companies that do not exist for their american counterparts.
when reviewing decisions of the tax court,we review in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions tried without a jury.irc a.we therefore examine questions of law de novo and factual determinations and the application of legal principles to the factual determinations for clear error.see baker comm r of internal revenue,cir kikalos comm r of internal revenue,cir plenary review of validity of treasury regulations fruit of the loom,comm r of internal revenue,cir.we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the tax court finding.see toushin comm r of internal revenue,cir.
we begin our analysis by considering whether treasury regulation a is a valid regulation pursuant to chevron,natural resources defense council,d.this is a matter of first impression in this circuit.we recognize that the third circuit specifically dealt with this question in its tate lyle decision,eventually concluding that reg.a was valid.at.as a general matter,r espect for the decisions of other circuits is especially important in tax cases because of the importance of uniformity,and the decision of the court of appeals of another circuit should be followed unless it is shown to be incorrect.bell fed.savs.loan ass comm r of internal revenue,cir quoting fed.life ins.united states,cir see also hubbard rest.united states,cir although we are not bound by them,we carefully and respectfully consider the opinions of our sister circuits.
the chevron inquiry involves two analytical steps.first,we must determine whether the plain meaning of the relevant code provisions either supports or opposes the regulation.see bankers life cas.united states,cir see also chevron,at.kikalos,at.if the plain meaning is either silent or unclear as to the regulation validity,we proceed to the second step and evaluate the reasonableness of the commissioner interpretation.see chevron,at.kikalos,at bankers life,at.in the second step,the court determines whether the regulation harmonizes with the language,origins,and purpose of the statute.bankers life,at see also bell,at.as long as a regulation is a reasonable reading of the statute,we give deference to the commissioner interpretation.see kikalos,at bankers life,at t he issue before us is not how we might resolve the statutory ambiguity in the first instance,but whether there is any reasonable basis for the resolution embodied in the commissioner regulation.quoting fulman united states,d.
advancing to the first stage of the chevron analysis,we consider whether the plain meaning of the code either clearly supports or opposes treasury regulation a.like the third circuit and the tax court,we conclude that it does not.see tate lyle,at square d comm r of internal revenue,wl.square d argues that the code unambiguously opposes this regulation,grounding its argument on irc a,which empowers the commissioner to enact regulations to implement the matching principle of irc a in the foreign context.square d takes this language to mean that the commissioner can do nothing more than just mechanically import the matching principle to issues regarding foreign companies without deviation.by the act of creating regulations that vary from the matching principle,including treasury regulation a c,the commissioner has violated the plain language of the code according to square 
we disagree.we consider the statutory scheme as a whole when evaluating whether the plain meaning unambiguously opposes or sanctions a particular regulation.see,food drug admin.brown williamson tobacco,d k mart cartier,d i n ascertaining the plain meaning of the statute,the court must look to the particular statutory language at issue,as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.internal citations omitted.square d reading,that irc a merely authorized the direct implementation of the matching principle to foreign persons without any possible changes,would make that provision redundant.the language of irc a never distinguishes between the foreign and domestic and naturally applies to both,which would seem to make irc a pure surplusage see tate lyle,at.we read a statute to avoid such redundancy.see alaska dep t of envtl.conservation epa,d it is,moreover,a cardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute ought,upon the whole,to be so construed that,if it can be prevented,no clause,sentence,or word shall be superfluous,void,or insignificant.internal citations omitted see also cole capital,cir united states power eng g,cir.the statutory structure,therefore,suggests that irc a does not have the clear meaning that square d ascribes to it.since we conclude that the plain language of the code is ambiguous,we proceed to the second step.
arriving at the second step of the analysis,we consider whether treasury regulation a was a reasonable interpretation of irc a.in cases such as this one in which congress has made an express delegation of authority to enact regulations,s uch legislative regulations are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.chevron,at.we assess the reasonableness of treasury regulation a in light of congress purpose in enacting the relevant statutes,which requires us,in this situation,to review the legislative history.see bankers life,at.
our examination first leads us to the historical landscape surrounding a.congress has been working to restrain fraud and abuse from related transactions for nearly seventy years.at first,congress concentrated on interest transactions and applied a rather strict limitation.revenue act of.c.under the law which became irc a in,congress specifically disallowed deductions for interest accrued in a related party transaction between taxpayers with different accounting methods unless the accrued interest was paid within two and a half months after the close of the taxable year.id.in other words,congress refused to allow a deduction merely for accruing an interest obligation to a related party to get the deduction,the taxpayer had to pay the interest within approximately the same taxable year as accrual.in the legislative history,congress expressed concern that interest payments between related taxpayers with different accounting methods were particularly subject to abuse.in a report on this regulation,for example,the house ways and means committee noted that the government would have difficulty monitoring when payments were actually made and thus could be taxed if an accrual taxpayer took a deduction when accrued,while waiting several years before payment,reprinted in pt.the committee indicated this could lead to phantom deductions for payments that were either never made or made in a year to minimize the tax burden.id.
in,congress altered this system somewhat,replacing it with the present version of irc a.despite the changes,congress explained that the general purpose remained to prevent the allowance of a deduction without the corresponding inclusion in income.ii,reprinted in vol.the new version was not primarily focused on interest payments,as in the prior system,having a wider scope to address all payments between related parties with different accounting methods.as described previously,congress mandated that,in the case of accounting mismatches,deductions for payments to related persons could be taken in the taxable year the payee included the payment.
two years later,congress revisited the subject in light of questions about payments to foreign related taxpayers,eventually promulgating irc a.as noted earlier,that statutory provision requires the secretary to apply the matching principle of irc a in cases in which the person to whom the payment is to be made is not a united states person.when addressing this issue,congress did not limit its consideration to situations involving accounting mismatches between domestic and foreign related parties.see tate lyle,at congress anticipated other reasons for the mismatch of interest and expense income between related persons.rather,in the committee reports,congress specifically mentioned a situation in which there was no match at all as square d describes its circumstance because the foreign related party was not subject to american taxes,at,vol,at reprinted in vol.see also tate lyle,at square d.the committee included an example of a foreign company that provided services outside the united states to a related domestic corporation.see tate lyle,at square d.the reports noted that the foreign parent was not subject t
