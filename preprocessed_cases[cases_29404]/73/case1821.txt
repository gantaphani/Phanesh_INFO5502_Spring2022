plaintiffs,edward and annette czarobski,purchased a home from defendants,grzegorz and anna lata.after plaintiffs learned that the real estate taxes on the home were more than the credits they received at closing,they filed an action in the circuit court of cook county against defendants seeking money damages based on a reproration.the circuit court granted defendants section motion to dismiss ilcs west,accepting defendants argument that the merger doctrine precluded recovery by plaintiffs.the appellate court reversed the judgment of the circuit court,holding that the merger doctrine did not apply to plaintiffs cause of action,and remanded the cause to the circuit court for further proceedings.d.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the judgment of the appellate court.
background 
in june,plaintiffs and defendants entered into a real estate contract for the purchase and sale of certain residential property located in orland park,illinois.the contract provided for proration of real estate taxes as follows 
prorations of general taxes shall be on the basis of of the last ascertainable bill.if said bill is based on a partial assessment or on an unimproved basis for improved property,a written agreement with escrow for final proration when the complete assessment information is available from the county assessor shall be signed at closing by the parties hereto.
at the september,closing,plaintiffs received a real estate tax credit of for,and a credit of for.the credits were based on the real estate tax figure,as shown on the title commitment,prorated according to the above contract provision.after closing,the final tax bill issued,disclosing a tax liability of,substantially more than the credit plaintiffs received at closing.
according to the allegations of plaintiffs complaint,upon receipt of the tax bill,investigation revealed that the tax figure was based on a partial assessment plaintiffs position was summed up in an october,letter from plaintiffs attorney to defendants attorney,which was attached to the complaint.the letter stated 
enclosed is a copy of the tax bill that just came out.as you can see,taxes went up quite a bit.we checked with the county to find out why.they tell us that the bill was based on a partial assessment.no one had disclosed that fact to us at or prior to closing.in these types of situations,under the contract we should have entered into a agreement.
the amount due from your client to mine for taxes is the actual bill of less the credit of.
the amount due from your client to mine for the reprorated taxes is x x.the total due then is.
plaintiffs alleged that the discrepancy in the taxes was either a mutual mistake of fact,or was known by the defendants and not disclosed by them.plaintiffs sought damages of,plus court costs.
defendants answered the complaint,generally denying that plaintiffs were entitled to a reproration.defendants also asserted,as an affirmative defense,that they had no knowledge that any real estate taxes,past or present,were based on a partial assessment,and that defendants gave to plaintiffs what they believe was a proper real estate tax credit at the time of closing based upon the available information and per the contract.
defendants also filed a motion to dismiss under section of the code of civil procedure ilcs west.defendants argued that under the merger doctrine the real estate contract merged into the deed,thus precluding recovery by plaintiffs.although plaintiffs argued that mutual mistake and fraudulent concealment are recognized exceptions to the merger doctrine,defendants argued that this court had never sanctioned a broad mutual mistake exception and that,in any event,this court opinion in lenzi morkin,controlled.the circuit court granted defendants motion to dismiss with prejudice.plaintiffs appealed.
the appellate court reversed the judgment of the circuit court.d at.the appellate court distinguished lenzi because the merger doctrine was not at issue in that case,and held that the doctrine does not apply to plaintiffs action for real estate taxes.d at.we allowed defendants petition for leave to appeal.see.
a motion for involuntary dismissal under section admits the legal sufficiency of the plaintiff claim but asserts affirmative matter outside of the pleading that defeats the claim.wallace smyth,ilcs a west.the purpose of a section motion is to dispose of issues of law and easily proved issues of fact early in the litigation.van meter darien park district.invocation of the merger doctrine is an affirmative matter properly raised in a section motion.see neppl murphy,d.when ruling on such a motion,the court must construe the pleadings and supporting documents in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.van meter,at.on appeal from a section motion,the reviewing court must consider whether the existence of a genuine issue of material fact should have precluded the dismissal or,absent such an issue of fact,whether dismissal is proper as a matter of law.kedzie currency exchange,hodge.our review proceeds de novo.van meter,at.
the doctrine of merger by deed also referred to as simply the merger doctrine or merger rule is well established in our case law.under this doctrine,all prior agreements between a buyer and a seller are merged in the deed upon its acceptance.daniels anderson,petersen hubschman construction,chicago title trust,trapp gordon.the deed supersedes the provisions of the real estate contract and becomes the only binding instrument between the parties.daniels,at,trapp,at.the merger doctrine evolved to protect the security of land titles petersen,at,and brings finality to real estate contracts.see goldman berghel,common law doctrine of merger the exceptions are the rule,balt.
this court has recognized an exception or qualification to the merger rule where the contract contains provisions that delivery of the deed does not fulfill.as to those provisions,the contract is not merged in the deed,and the contract remains in force until the contract has been fully performed.daniels,at,petersen,at,chicago title trust,at,trapp,at.illinois courts have applied this exception where,for example,the contract created an easement that was not referenced in the deed daniels,at,the contract expressly warranted the condition of the heating system at closing neppl,d at,and the contract called for construction of a building on the conveyed property brownell quinn,d.in each instance,the court determined that the contractual provision was an independent or collateral undertaking,incidental to the main purpose of the agreement,and did not merge with the deed.
plaintiffs,however,do not rely upon this exception to the merger rule,but upon two exceptions recognized by our appellate court mutual mistake or misrepresentation when the deed was delivered.see beal schewe,d,recognizing mutual mistake and misrepresentation exceptions to merger rule batler,capitel schwartz tapanes,d,same hagenbuch chapin,d,recognizing exception to merger doctrine where the parties were mutually mistaken about the parcel acreage.
plaintiffs direct our attention to holec heartland builders,d,which the appellate court here found persuasive.in holec,the second district held that the merger doctrine did not apply where the parties were mutually mistaken about the latest assessed valuation,and the buyer was entitled to a judgment for the difference in the taxes.holec,d at.
defendants direct our attention to chapman anchor lumber,d.in chapman,the third district declined to follow holec and held that the buyer could not recover real estate taxes where the parties miscalculated the tax proration based on a mutual mistake of fact.chapman,d at.chapman explained because our supreme court has not sanctioned a broad mutual mistake exception to the merger doctrine,we find no compelling reason to follow the second district holdings in batler and holec.chapman,d at.
although chapman is correct that this court has not sanctioned a broad mutual mistake exception to the merger doctrine chapman,d at,we agree with the appellate court observation here that neither has this court prohibited such an exception d at.the simple fact is that thi
