in,the legislature confronted two troubling trends in california the loss of agricultural land to development and the haphazard growth of suburbia,requiring the extension of municipal services to remote residential enclaves,and interfer ing with agricultural activities.sierra club city of hayward cal d,sierra club,superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in friends of east willits valley county of mendocino th,d.the legislature perceived as one cause of these problems the prophecy of the property tax system taxing land on the basis of its market value compels the owner to put the land to the use for which it is valued by the market.ibid.in response,it enacted the williamson act,et which employs a strategy to conserve agricultural lands.the local government first establishes and regulates agricultural preserves,and then executes land conservation contracts with landowners.these contracts limit the land to agricultural and compatible uses for their duration and may also include terms and conditions more restrictive than those required by the williamson act,subd.a.in return for accepting restrictions on the land,the landowner is guaranteed a relatively stable tax base,founded on the value of the land for open space use only and unaffected by its development potential.sierra club,at.the hallmark of this statutory scheme is its reliance on voluntary agreements between the government and the landowner,where the landowner chooses,on an annual basis,to accept certain limits on his or her use of the land in return for an explicit property tax reduction.
in,plaintiff county of humboldt county and arthur tooby made and entered into a williamson act contract,which covered a class b agricultural preserve consisting of approximately acres.among other things,this contract set a minimum parcel size of acres for subsequent divisions of the land,consistent with the agricultural preserve guidelines then in effect.one year later,through regulation,the county board of supervisors the board revised those guidelines,increasing the minimum parcel size for divisions to acres the guidelines.in,defendants buck mountain ranch limited partnership bmr,robert mckee and valery mckee purchased this acreage,and then divided and sold much of the land.though each parcel sold was larger than acres,some were less than acres.

background 
the tooby guidelines 
on february,the board adopted resolution,which established approximately acres of the tooby ranch as a class b agricultural preserve tooby preserve.on february,the board rescinded resolution and replaced it with resolution the tooby guidelines,which contained a corrected legal description of the tooby preserve the tooby guidelines provided in part whereas,the land to be included within the agricultural preserve is,and will continue to be,used for the purposes of producing agricultural commodities for commercial purposes and uses compatible with agriculture and whereas,this board is authorized by statute to determine according to uniform rules what constitutes a compatible use of land within each preserve now,therefore,be it resolved as follows.the hereinafter described real property located in the county of humboldt is hereby designated and established as an agricultural preserve within the meaning of and pursuant to the williamson act,including amendments thereto,and shall be known as and may be referred to as agricultural preserve.underscoring in original.
the tooby guidelines listed compatible uses permitted on the tooby preserve.the guidelines further provided that the land described herein shall not be divided if,as a practical matter,it would result in the reduction of land devoted to the production of agricultural commodities for commercial purposes.this section shall not prohibit a division of land if the parcels created thereby are of such size,shape and other physical characteristics that they are capable of producing agricultural commodities and if as a practical matter the amount of land devoted to agricultural uses will not be reduced.all divisions of land shall comply with all applicable local ordinances and state laws.
the tooby contract 
on february,the same day the board established the tooby preserve,arthur tooby entered into a williamson act contract with county tooby contract the tooby contract restricted the tooby preserve to agricultural and compatible uses.
the tooby contract stated,in relevant part,whereas,owner warrants that he owns certain land particularly described hereinafter,which is presently devoted to agricultural and compatible uses and whereas,said land is located in an agricultural preserve heretofore established by county by resolution,and whereas,both owner and county desire to establish binding restrictions which will limit the use of said land to agricultural and compatible uses now,therefore,the parties agree as follows.this contract is made and entered into pursuant to the the williamson act and is subject to all the provisions of said act as it now exists.during the term of this contract or any extension thereof,the land described herein shall not be used for any purpose other than agricultural uses,as defined by said act,or those compatible uses as set forth in resolution.this contract shall be effective on the date first written above,hereinafter the anniversary date,and shall remain in effect and shall be for an initial term of ten years.on the first anniversary date and on each succeeding anniversary date,one year shall automatically be added to the unexpired term unless notice of is given as provided by law.this contract shall run with the land described herein and shall be binding upon,and inure to the benefit of,all successors in interest of the owner.land subject to this contract may not be divided into parcels of less than acres except for purposes of rental or lease for agricultural and compatible uses provided no additional dwellings shall be constructed or placed upon such divided parcels.
the and guidelines 
resolution guidelines,adopted by the board on december,was in effect at the time the tooby contract was executed.the guidelines set forth the regulations governing agricultural preserves,and provided in part,land within a class a preserve and under contract may not be divided into parcels less than acres.land within a class b preserve and under contract may not be divided into parcels of less than acres.
on march,the year after the tooby preserve was established and the tooby contract was executed,the board adopted the guidelines.the guidelines set forth revised regulations governing agricultural preserves,and stated in part,land within a class b preserve and under contract shall not be divided into parcels smaller than acres.land within a class a or c preserve and under contract shall not be divided into parcels smaller than acres.effective for preserves and under contract.the guidelines expressly rescinded the guidelines.
sale of the tooby ranch 
in august,mckee formed bmr for the purpose of purchasing and selling the tooby ranch.on october,mckee closed escrow on the purchase of acres of the tooby ranch from the estate of arthur tooby in march,omsberg company,a surveying and engineering firm,submitted a report to county in support of mckee application for lot line adjustments on the tooby ranch.the report explained mckee plans to divide the tooby ranch into parcels of acres or more and sell them as ranchettes.
since,mckee has transferred approximately separate parcels of land to third party purchasers.some of the parcels conveyed to third party purchasers are smaller than acres,but there is no evidence that any of the transferred parcels are smaller than acres.at the time of trial,in,mckee retained ownership of approximately acres of the tooby ranch.
mckee has not filed a notice of nonrenewal of the tooby contract.mckee has continued to receive a preferential tax assessment and has paid an average of cents per acre,to percent of the taxes he would have paid had the land not been under a williamson act contract.
procedural history 
on december,county filed a complaint against mckee and third party purchasers alleged to have bought parcels of the tooby ranch from mckee.county filed a first amended complaint on april.county alleged causes of action for violation of the williamson act,violation of the subdivision map act,breach of contract,nuisance,and violation of the unfair competition act.county sought penalties,damages,and declaratory and injunctive relief,including an order prohibiting future transfers of tooby ranch land and declaring the prior transfers null and void.
bmr filed a against county and assessor on june,and filed a first amended on august.bmr alleged that assessor continued to assess property taxes to bmr for parcels transferred to third party purchasers.the sought declaratory relief and an injunction prohibiting assessor from assessing taxes to bmr for the transferred parcels.
on december,the trial court issued the first of two bifurcation orders.the court granted mckee motion to bifurcate the proceedings into two phases trial of county claims against mckee,followed by trial of county claims against the third party purchasers.the court ordered that the third party defendants would not participate or be subject to discovery until the second phase of the action 
on july,the trial court issued its second bifurcation order.the court separated out two predominantly legal issues to be briefed and decided prior to trial of county claims against mckee whether county can legally nullify mckee conveyances of parcels of the tooby ranch to third parties and whether county williamson act g uidelines can be applied retroactively to williamson act c ontracts.
on november,the court issued a ruling on these two legal issues.first,the court ruled that county guidelines could not be applied to the tooby contract.the court reasoned that application of the guidelines,which amended the minimum parcel size for class b preserves from to acres,would violate the contract clauses of the state and federal constitutions.the court concluded that application of the parcel minimum would substantially impair the tooby contract,and found that county had failed to show that this impairment was reasonable and necessary to an important public purpose.second,the court ruled that county could not seek nullification of the parcel conveyances in the instant proceeding.following a motion for reconsideration by county,the court permitted supplemental briefing and oral argument from both parties.on february,the court issued a ruling on reconsideration of bifurcated issues,affirming its november decision and clarifying that in light of its finding that the guidelines could not constitutionally be applied to the tooby contract,it did not reach the issue of nullification.
beginning on august,the court held a bench trial on county causes of action against mckee for violation of the williamson act,violation of the subdivision map act,breach of contract,declaratory relief,and violation of the unfair competition act to the extent this violation was predicated on violations of the williamson act or subdivision map act.the court also tried bmr first amended complaint against county and assessor.county dismissed its cause of action for violation of the subdivision map act prior to the presentation of evidence.on november,after county completed its presentation of evidence,mckee moved for judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure section.the court issued an oral ruling granting the motion for judgment on november,and issued a written statement of decision and judgment in favor of mckee on january.
in its statement of decision,the court concluded that mckee had not violated the williamson act or the tooby contract.the minimum in the guidelines could not constitutionally applied to the tooby contract,and county had produced no evidence that any parcel conveyed by mckee to third party purchasers was less than the minimum established by the tooby contract and the governing guidelines.county had also failed to produce evidence of other alleged breaches of the tooby contract county failed to produce any evidence that the division of the tooby ranch created parcels of such size,shape and other physical characteristics that they are not capable of producing agricultural commodities.indeed,county could not identify a single parcel that failed to meet this requirement of the tooby guidelines.in addition,county failed to produce any evidence that mckee conveyance of parcels,as a practical matter,reduced the amount of land devoted to agricultural uses.the court issued a judgment in favor of mckee as to county claims for violation of the williamson act,breach of contract,declaratory relief,violation of the unfair competition act,and injunctive relief,and in favor of bmr as to its.the judgment awarded costs to mckee in an unspecified amount.on april,the court issued an order fixing costs in the amount of.
on march,county and assessor filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment.
discussion 
i.the williamson act 
the williamson act is a legislative effort to preserve agricultural and open space land and discourage premature urban development.it authorizes local governments to establish agricultural preserve s,which consist of lands devoted to agricultural and compatible uses.the preserves shall be established for the purpose of defining the boundaries of those areas within which the city or county will be willing to enter into contracts pursuant to this act.local governments are required to adopt rules governing the administration of agricultural preserves and apply those rules uniformly throughout the preserve.
after establishing agricultural preserves,the local government may enter into contracts with landowners with respect to land within a designated preserve and devoted to agricultural use.these contracts must limit the land to agricultural and compatible uses for the duration of the contract,and,in return,the landowner is guaranteed a relatively stable tax base,founded on the value of the land for open space use only and unaffected by its development potential.sierra club,supra,cal d at.
because the williamson act permits preferential tax assessment of land under contract,the california constitution requires enforceable restrictions on the use of contracted land.cal,art.xiii.the california constitution states,in relevant part,to promote the conservation,preservation and continued existence of open space lands,the legislature may define open space land and shall provide that when this land is enforceably restricted,in a manner specified by the legislature,to recreation,enjoyment of scenic beauty,use or conservation of natural resources,or production of food or fiber,it shall be valued for property tax purposes only on a basis that is consistent with its restrictions and uses.cal,art.xiii.
the williamson act was intended to deny the tax benefits of the act to short term speculators and developers of urban fringe land and to e nsure that the constitutional requirement of an enforceable restriction is met and,therefore,the legislature deliberately required a commitment to agriculture or other use.sierra club,supra,cal d at.each contract between the landowner and local government must have an initial term of at least years,and shall provide that on the anniversary date of the contract or such other annual date as specified by the contract a year shall be added automatically to the initial term unless notice of nonrenewal is given as provided in section.if either the landowner or local government does not wish to renew the contract,the party shall serve written notice of nonrenewal of the contract upon the other party in advance of the annual renewal date of the contract.unless such written notice is served by the landowner at least days prior to the renewal date or by the city or county at least days prior to the renewal date,the contract shall be considered renewed as provided in section or section.the contract is binding on all successors in interest of the owner,subd.b.
if the local government or landowner serves a notice of nonrenewal,the land use restrictions in the existing contract remain in effect for the balance of the contract term.upon notice of nonrenewal,taxes on the landowner property gradually return to the level of taxes on comparable nonrestricted property,as the term of restriction draws nearer to expiration.sierra club,supra,cal d at,citing.
ii.applicability of the guidelines to the tooby contract 
a.the guidelines were intended to apply to preserves 
county and assessor contend the guidelines were intended to apply both to preserves established in and to preserves established before,including the tooby preserve established in.mckee asserts that the guidelines were intended to apply only to preserves established in and later,and therefore do not govern the tooby preserve.
we review this issue of statutory interpretation de novo.city of saratoga hinz th,d.the interpretation of local ordinances and resolutions is subject to ordinary rules of statutory construction.da vinci group san francisco residential rent.bd.th,d.in statutory construction cases,our fundamental task is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citation.we begin by examining the statutory language,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.citations.if the terms of the statute are unambiguous,we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citations.if there is ambiguity,however,we may then look to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.citation.in such cases,we select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.citations.city of saratoga,at,d.
we agree with county and assessor.the guidelines provided that in order to qualify for a class b preserve and contract,land shall comply with the following requirements minimum preserve area.the preserve area shall contain not less than acres of land,and no individual lot or parcel of land shall be less than contiguous acres.underscoring in original.the guidelines further provided,land within a class b preserve and under contract may not be divided into parcels of less than acres.the revised guidelines retained the requirement that in order to qualify for a class b preserve,the preserve area must contain at least acres of land and individual parcels must be at least contiguous acres.however,the guidelines revised the restriction on divisions of land under contract in class b preserves.the guidelines stated,land within a class b preserve and under contract shall not be divided into parcels smaller than acres.land within a class a or c preserve and under contract shall not be divided into parcels smaller than acres.effective for preserves and under contract.the guidelines further provided that resolution the guidelines is hereby rescinded.
in interpreting the guidelines,both parties focus on the parenthetical that follows the restriction on divisions of land in class b preserves effective for preserves and under contract.county and assessor urge that this parenthetical means the minimum parcel size is effective both for land in preserves and for land in preserves already under contract.mckee argues that this phrase means the minimum is to be applied only to land within preserves created in or later and then placed under contract.we find the language of this parenthetical ambiguous and susceptible to both constructions 
the construction suggested by mckee,however,would lead to an absurd result.the final provision of the guidelines rescinds the guidelines,rendering them void and inoperative.if the guidelines were intended to apply only to preserves established from onward,as mckee suggests,then the passage of the guidelines would have left county with no operative regulations for preserves established before.this result is contrary to the apparent purpose of the guidelines,to establish revised regulations governing agricultural preserves.moreover,county failure to maintain operative regulations for preserves would violate the williamson act,which requires local governments to adopt rules governing the administration of agricultural preserves.we construe the guidelines so as to avoid this consequence,and conclude the guidelines were intended to apply to both preserves and preserves already under contract,that is,both preexisting and future preserves.therefore,the guidelines were intended to apply to the tooby preserve,which had been established in.
at oral argument,mckee contended that his interpretation of the guidelines would not leave county without operative regulations for preserves.mckee appeared to argue that the guidelines rescinded only those provisions of the guidelines related to the establishment of new preserves,leaving intact the provisions related to the ongoing regulation of preserves.but,the guidelines broadly state that resolution the guidelines is hereby rescinded,without limiting that rescission to any particular aspect of the guidelines.
mckee also contended at oral argument that divisions of the tooby preserve need not be governed by the or guidelines,because those divisions were governed by the tooby guidelines.but this argument provides little comfort to mckee.the tooby guidelines directly address the issue in our case and provide,all divisions of land shall comply with all applicable local ordinances and state laws.this provision is properly interpreted to require compliance with the local and state laws in existence at the time of the land divisions.city of torrance workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,when an instrument provides that it shall be enforced according either to the law generally or to the terms of a particular statute,the provision must be interpreted as meaning the law or the statute in the form in which it exists at the time of such enforcement hermosa beach stop oil coalition city of hermosa beach th,d hermosa.thus,even if mckee is correct and the tooby guidelines govern,any division of land in the tooby preserve would be subject to the board rules in existence at the time of division.
mckee also contends the guidelines can not be construed to apply to preserves absent a clear indication of intent to do so,because this is a retroactive application of the guidelines.it is well settled that s tatutes do not operate retroactively unless there is a clear indication of intent that they do so.citations.hermosa,supra,th at,d.however,application of the guidelines to preserves established before is not,as mckee suggests,a retroactive application.a statute has retroactive effect if it substantially changes the legal effect of past events.citations.a statute does not operate retrospectively merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating the statute enactment citation,or upsets expectations based on prior law.rather,the court must ask whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.id.at,d,quoting landgraf usi film products,d.application of the parcel minimum in the guidelines to preserves established in and earlier is a prospective application of the law so long as it applies only to future that is,divisions of existing class b preserves.as with a new zoning regulation,this revision of the minimum parcel size for existing class b preserves may upset the expectations of landowners,but it is not a retroactive application of the law.see landgraf,at,fn.e ven uncontroversially prospective statutes may unsettle expectations and impose burdens on past conduct a new property tax or zoning regulation may upset the reasonable expectations that prompted those affected to acquire property.thus,we do not require a clear indication of intent that the guidelines apply to preserves.
finally,mckee argues that county advised mckee that the minimum parcel size governed the tooby preserve,and county and assessor current position that the guidelines were intended to apply to preserves is simply contrary to the repeated admissions of county.mckee refers us to several letters written by county staff persons between and,which informed mckee that the tooby ranch land could not be divided or conveyed in parcels of less than acres.however,these letters do not discuss either the or the guidelines,and make no representations as to whether the guidelines apply to the tooby preserve.indeed,two of the three letters expressly refer mckee to county zoning regulations for class b preserves,which prohibit conveyances of parcels of less than acres.a county agricultural preserve guidelines are separate from,and may be more restrictive than,its zoning regulations.see.
mckee also relies on a memorandum from county deputy counsel to its planning director regarding a different agricultural preserve.the memo stated the deputy counsel opinion that a proposed rezoning of land under contract in the branstetter estate would be permissible the land under contract is governed by the williamson act provisions of the government code,humboldt county resolution the guidelines which sets forth the guidelines for establishing agricultural preserves at the time this preserve was established,resolution which established this specific preserve,and the land conservation contract entered into by branstetter because the contract does not prohibit divisions except those into parcels of less than acres,the proposed minimum parcel size for parcel would not appear to violate the contract because the minimum proposed parcel size is acres.this memo was not written to mckee and did not relate to the tooby preserve.
mckee reliance on county prior admissions as to the applicability of the guidelines is,in essence,an argument that county should be estopped from applying the guidelines to the tooby preserve.in general,the four required elements for application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel are the party to be estopped must be apprised of the facts he must intend that his conduct shall be acted upon,or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel had a right to believe it was so intended the other party must be ignorant of the true state of facts and he must rely upon the conduct to his injury.city of long beach mansell cal d.in addition,a government agency may be bound by an equitable estoppel only if the elements requisite to such an estoppel against a private party are present and,in the considered view of a court of equity,the injustice which would result from a failure to uphold an estoppel is of sufficient dimension to justify any effect upon public interest or policy which would result from the raising of an estoppel.id.at.estoppel against a government agency will be applied only in the most extraordinary case where the injustice is great and the precedent set by the estoppel is narrow.smith county of santa barbara th,d.
mckee can not demonstrate that this is an extraordinary case justifying application of the narrow doctrine of government estoppel.mckee does not attempt to satisfy the four required elements of estoppel against a private party,or to meet the heightened standard for application of an estoppel against the government.mckee never seeks to explain why opinions regarding zoning laws or opinions provided to different landowners should estop the application of the guidelines to the tooby preserve.county is not estopped from applying these guidelines to the tooby preserve.
b.the tooby contract incorporated the guidelines upon renewal 
having concluded that the guidelines were intended to apply to preexisting preserves,including the tooby preserve,we next address the trial court ruling that the contract clauses contained in the federal and california constitutions barred application of the guidelines to the tooby contract.county and assessor argue the contract clause analysis was unnecessary,because the guidelines were incorporated into the tooby contract when the parties renewed the contract following adoption of the guidelines.mckee contends that interpreting the tooby contract to incorporate the guidelines upon contract renewal would permit county to unilaterally amend the tooby contract,rendering the contract unjust and inequitable.this presents issues of statutory and contract interpretation subject to de novo review.city of saratoga hinz,supra,th at,d hermosa,supra,th at,d.
under the williamson act automatic renewal provisions,each contract must provide that on the contract anniversary date or another specified annual date,a year will automatically be added to the contract term unless the landowner or local government gives notice of nonrenewal.if,in a given year,either party wishes not to renew the contract,the party must serve written notice of nonrenewal in advance of the annual renewal date.in the absence of timely notice of nonrenewal,the contract shall be considered renewed on the anniversary date or other specified date.
in county of marin assessment appeals bd.d.marin,the court of appeal held that,because a williamson act agreement was renewed by the parties each year,laws enacted after the original contract date could be considered when analyzing the agreement.id.at,fn.in marin,landowners entered into several williamson act agreements in and that restricted the land to agricultural use.the agreements expressly incorporated all provisions of the williamson act,and stated,in compliance with the renewal provisions of the act that this agreement shall be automatically renewed at the end of each year for an additional ten year period,unless notice of is given as provided in section.id.at fn.in,following legislative amendments to the williamson act,the county requested that the landowners consent to modification of the agreements.the landowners refused,and the assessor then denied preferential tax assessment for the land.id.at.on appeal,the county argued that the agreements did not contain enforceable restrictions,as they did not contain substantially similar or more restrictive terms than those required by the williamson act.marin,at.the court of appeal rejected this argument,holding that the agreements contained enforceable restrictions and therefore the land was entitled to preferential tax treatment.id.at.
the court of appeal acknowledged an apparent conflict between provisions in the agreements and the williamson act the eminent domain clauses in the agreements were more favorable to the landowners than the eminent domain provisions in the williamson act and the amendment to the williamson act.marin,supra,d at.the court relied on the amendment in its analysis of the earlier and agreements,reasoning that t he amendment to the williamson act may be properly considered in this contractual dispute,because in a legal sense every year a new agreement is entered into between the parties.as noted earlier,pursuant to an express proviso,the agreements are automatically renewed at the end of each year for an additional period unless a notice of nonrenewal is given by the parties id.at,fn.the court held that because the agreements expressly incorporated all provisions of the williamson act,the disputed provisions of the agreements would be interpreted to conform with the more restrictive provisions of the act.id.at.
as in marin,the guidelines may be properly considered in this contractual dispute,because the parties entered into a new contract each year pursuant to the automatic renewal provisions in the tooby contract and the williamson act.marin,supra,d at,fn.in compliance with the williamson act renewal provisions,the tooby contract provided that this contract shall be effective on the date first written above,hereinafter the anniversary date,and shall remain in effect and shall be for an initial term of ten years.on the first anniversary date and on each succeeding anniversary date,one year shall automatically be added to the unexpired term unless notice of is given as provided by law.neither party to the tooby contract has given notice of nonrenewal of the tooby contract,and mckee has continued to receive preferential tax treatment on the tooby preserve land.in the absence of timely notice of nonrenewal,the contract shall be considered renewed on each anniversary date.thus,the tooby contract,originally entered into between arthur tooby and county on february,was renewed on february,again on february,and on each anniversary date thereafter.
we agree with the reasoning in marin that,as a legal matter,by renewing a williamson act contract on each anniversary date,the parties entered into a new contract each year.see black law dict.ed,defining renewal as.the of a legal relationship or the replacement of an old contract with a new contract,as opposed to the mere extension of a previous relationship or contract.each year,a landowner bound by a williamson act contract has a choice give timely notice of nonrenewal,which preserves the current contract,or decline to give notice of nonrenewal,which renews the contract for a new term.by choosing not to give notice of nonrenewal,the landowner gains both the burdens and the benefits of a new contract.the landowner remains burdened by restrictions on the use of the contracted land for the balance of the new term,but also benefits from the preferential tax assessment guaranteed for enforceably restricted agricultural land.sierra club,supra,cal d at.this preferential tax assessment is not available once the landowner gives notice of nonrenewal upon notice of nonrenewal,taxes gradually return to the level of taxes on comparable nonrestricted property,sierra club,at.thus,the decision not to give a notice of nonrenewal binds the landowner to a new contract.
because the parties to the tooby contract entered into a new contract on february,all applicable laws and ordinances then in existence,including the guidelines,became part of the tooby contract.castillo express escrow th,d.in the years after adoption of the guidelines,arthur tooby and mckee collectively renewed the original contract at least times.the minimum parcel size for divisions of class b preserves imposed by the guidelines applied to the subsequent divisions of the tooby preserve.
mckee argues that marin is distinguishable,because the renewal provision in the marin agreements is worded differently than the renewal provision in the tooby contract.the marin provision stated that t his agreement shall be automatically renewed at the end of each year for an additional ten year period,unless notice of is given as provided in section.marin,supra,d at,fn.the tooby contract provided,this contract shall be effective on the date first written above,hereinafter the anniversary date,and shall remain in effect and shall be for an initial term of ten years.on the first anniversary date and on each succeeding anniversary date,one year shall automatically be added to the unexpired term unless notice of is given as provided by law.mckee argues that the tooby contract language indicates that the original contract remains in effect,whereas the marin language suggests the contract is renewed.
although the tooby contract renewal provision is worded slightly differently than the marin renewal provision,we do not find this difference significant.the tooby contract provision,together with the governing williamson act provisions,make it clear that the tooby contract is automatically renewed each year absent notice of a contrary intent.the tooby contract states that a year is automatically added to the initial contract term on each anniversary date unless notice of is given as provided by law.this provision is in compliance with the williamson act,which requires each contract to provide that a year shall be added automatically to the initial term unless notice of nonrenewal is given and states that unless timely notice of nonrenewal is given prior to the renewal date,the contract shall be considered renewed.these provisions make clear that the contract is annually renewed,and does not simply remain in effect.in addition,published decisions addressing the williamson act have consistently described sections and as effecting automatic renewal of the contract each year.our supreme court explained,i f neither party gives timely notice to the other of a contrary intent,the contract automatically renews itself each year,tacking on an additional year to the period of restriction.sierra club,supra,cal d at,see also borel county of contra costa d,fn.honey springs homeowners board of supervisors d.
mckee contends that interpreting the tooby contract to incorporate the guidelines upon renewal would make the contract extraordinary,harsh,unjust,and inequitable.in interpreting williamson act contracts,ordinary principles of contract interpretation apply.marin,supra,d at.among these principles,w here a contract is susceptible of two interpretations,the courts shall give it such a construction as will make it lawful,operative,definite,reasonable and capable of being carried into effect if it can be done without violating the intention of the parties.citation.t he court shall avoid an interpretation which will make a contract extraordinary,harsh,unjust,inequitable or which would result in absurdity citations.id.at,italics omitted.mckee argues that county and assessor proffered interpretation would violate these principles,because it would subject the contract to unilateral amendment by resolution at any time.we disagree.
under the interpretation advanced by county and assessor,county is not free to unilaterally amend the tooby contract.the board is authorized,and indeed required,to pass uniform rules applicable to agricultural preserves.when,as here,the board adopts a resolution that affects land under contract,the landowners who are parties to those contracts and do not wish to be governed by the new resolution may choose not to renew their contracts.if,however,a landowner decides to renew the contract,and avail him or herself of continued preferential tax treatment,the renewed contract incorporates the recently adopted resolution.we do not find this scheme inequitable or unjust.
mckee further argues that such putative power to amend existing williamson act contracts by resolution conflicts with numerous provisions in the williamson act which limit that power.mckee points to provisions of the williamson act that authorize local governments to enter into contracts with terms more restrictive than those required by the act,and permit parties to rescind a contract upon mutual agreement under certain circumstances.mckee argues that permitting local governments to unilaterally amend the use of agricultural land would render williamson act contracts meaningless.again,we disagree.the williamson act expressly contemplates regulation of agricultural preserves by local government resolutions,as well as by contract.interpreting williamson act contracts to incorporate new regulations upon renewal does not allow local governments to unilaterally amend williamson act contracts,because the landowner who chooses to renew the contract agrees to accept the burdens as well as the benefits of the new agreement.we do not find this interpretation in conflict with any of the cited provisions of the williamson act.
the facts of this case,on the other hand,demonstrate the inequity that would result from adopting the interpretation put forth by mckee.for more than years after adoption of the guidelines,the owners of the tooby ranch elected,on an annual basis,to obtain the tax benefits offered by county.they should not be able to ignore the reciprocal burdens imposed.
the significance of this inequity can not be overstated.as noted by amicus curiae california state association of counties,approximately million acres of agricultural land in california,or roughly half of all agricul
