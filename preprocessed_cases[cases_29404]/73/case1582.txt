the statutory scheme 
the california redevelopment law crl provides for the formation of redevelopment agencies to help eradicate blight.the law was adopted in,and after voter approval was made a part of the california constitution now in art.xvi,in city of dinuba county of tulare cal th,fn.
under the crl,redevelopment is financed through tax increment financing.in essence,a redevelopment agency,which is not empowered to tax,but which is empowered to acquire debt through loans or the sale of bonds,finances a redevelopment project through borrowing.when the redevelopment results in increased property values in the redevelopment area,the tax attributable to the increase in tax distributed by the taxing authority to a special fund of the redevelopment agency,to pay the principal of and interest on its debt,subd.b.this way,the redevelopment project in effect pays for itself.citations.city of dinuba county of tulare,supra,cal th at community development com of city of oxnard county of ventura th.
taxes which are not attributable to the increase in property values,but which are instead attributable to a base year value,are distributed as they would have been had a redevelopment plan not been adopted.redevelopment agency county of san bernardino cal d,subd.a.
importantly,an agency is entitled to the increment only in the amount of its indebtedness,less available revenue,subd.g.any tax increment in excess of that amount is distributed as base year taxes are distributed,subd.b.
the amount of tax increment to which an agency is entitled each year is calculated through an annual soi.under section b not later than october of each year,for each redevelopment project for which the redevelopment plan provides for the division of taxes pursuant to section,the agency shall file,with the county auditor or officer described in subdivision a,a statement of indebtedness and a reconciliation statement certified by the chief financial officer of the agency.the statute specifies the information about debt and revenue which must be included in the soi.
in september,appellant glendale redevelopment agency the glendale agency submitted a fiscal year soi for its san fernando road corridor redevelopment project area.this soi showed of indebtedness and in available revenue.the county distributes property taxes over months,beginning in november,and based on the soi,it distributed to the glendale agency.this was million less than the total tax increment created by the redevelopment project.that tax increment was distributed to other agencies,including the county general fund.
however,in may,the glendale agency realized that its soi had omitted debt associated with a owner participation and development agreement opa between the agency and the walt disney company.the crl provides that a redevelopment agency may pledge its tax increment to fund expenses related to a certain project and that such a pledge shall have priority over any other claim to those taxes not secured by a prior express pledge of those taxes.pursuant to this statute,the glendale agency had pledged percent of the tax increment attributable to the opa.the county knew of this indebtedness and the pledge,having entered into an agreement with the glendale agency and the city of glendale,under which the county agreed to pass back to the glendale agency a portion of the county share of tax increment.on may,the glendale agency submitted a revised soi to the county,reflecting the disney opa.
the revised soi for appellant redevelopment agency of the city of compton the compton agency concerns fiscal year.the compton agency soi for that year both overstated revenue and understated debt.pursuant to this soi,compton was allocated in tax increment payments,leaving million in tax increment.that sum was distributed to other entities.the compton agency submitted its revised soi on january,showing that it was entitled to the entire tax increment for.
in each instance,the county refused to accept the revised soi,writing that the county has no discretion to accept an amended statement of indebtedness soi after the statutory deadline,much less to reallocate property tax revenues on that basis.
with their petitions,appellants produced evidence that it was not unusual for the county to make adjustments to correct accounting discrepancies or to correct miscodings.for example,in,the county acknowledged that over a period of three years,the county had paid approximately of the azusa redevelopment agency tax increment to the los angeles county fire protection district,and agreed to reallocate funds so that the agency received all the increment which was due to it.
discussion 
the parties agree,correctly,that the issue is statutory interpretation and our review is de novo.redevelopment agency of the city of long beach county of los angeles th.
appellants contend that section is silent on the question of revised sois,and is ambiguous.they ask us to construe the statute in light of the crl as a whole,and argue that the statute does not prohibit the county from accepting,and acting on,a revised soi,and that the county has a duty to distribute the additional tax increment.they cite the statutory and constitutional requirement that tax increment which reflects revenues and debt shall be distributed to the redevelopment agency cal,art.xvi,subd.b,subd.a and point out that under the county reading of the statute,that revenue is instead given to entities which have no statutory or constitutional entitlement to it.they also point out that the entire statutory and constitutional scheme for community redevelopment depends on a market for redevelopment agencies debt,and argue that if an error in a soi can not be corrected,and tax increment may be distributed to other agencies,the stability of that market is threatened.
the county sees no ambiguity,and argues that with section,the legislature limited the time within which an agency can claim a given year tax increment.the county further argues that the legislature was empowered to enact such a limit,citing california constitution,article xvi,section,which provides,inter alia,that t he legislature may provide that any redevelopment plan may contain a provision for the tax increment financing and that t he legislature shall enact those laws as may be necessary to enforce the provisions of this section.cal,art.xvi.the county sees appellants argument as a facial challenge to section constitutionality and argues that restrictions on the authority of the legislature are to be strictly construed schabarum california legislature th.
we agree with appellants.section is ambiguous.the statute does,as the county argues,provide that an agency shall file an soi no later than october,but we can not see that with that language,it also provided that an agency can never amend an soi if an error is discovered.nor do we agree with the county that anything else in section so provides.
the county first argument on this point concerns section,subdivision h,which provides that the soi constitutes prima facie evidence of the loans,advances,or indebtedness of the agency,but that a county auditor may dispute that amount through a procedure and within the time limits set out in the statute.the county argues that the time limits require prompt review,and that the subdivision means that the october soi must be the final one,so that the challenge,if any,can commence.we see something different in subdivision h.it does not provide that an soi may never be revised,but instead indicates that the october soi is not necessarily the end of the process.if an agency soi may be challenged,it may also be corrected.
subdivision c leads us to the same conclusion.it provides that t he agency may estimate the amount of principal or interest,the interest rate,or term of any loan,advance,or indebtedness if the nature of the loan,advance,or indebtedness is such that the amount of principal or interest,the interest rate or term can not be precisely determined.a statute which allows estimates when precise data is not available clearly contemplates that an estimate may be corrected when the data is available.
nor are we persuaded by the county reference to section,subdivision g,which provides that the county must pay the tax increment at the same time or times as the payment of taxes into the funds of the respective taxing entities.we see nothing in this direction to counties which places a limit on a redevelopment agency ability to correct an error in an soi.this is especially true because the county makes its payments over time.
thus,the question before us is not whether the legislature could constitutionally limit redevelopment agencies to the tax increment justified by a single annual soi,with no possible revision,but whether the legislature has done so.in answering that question,we turn to the well established rules of statutory construction.our fundamental task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citation.day city of fontana cal th.however,the meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence the words must be construed in context,and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible.citation.lungren deukmejian cal d.e ach sentence must be read not in isolation but in the light of the statutory scheme.citation.ibid.these rules apply as well to the interpretation of constitutional provisions.ibid.
our review of the statutory and constitutional scheme and the cases which have interpreted that law leads us to conclude that appellants are correct.section does not prohibit the county from accepting a revised soi.to the contrary,on receipt of a revised soi,it is required to pay redevelopment agencies all the tax increment to which they are entitled.
a county duty to distribute tax revenue in accord with the provisions of the crl and the rest of the statutory scheme is mandatory.city of dinuba,supra,cal th at.article xvi,section and section identically provide that tax increment shall be allocated to and when collected shall be paid into a special fund of the redevelopment agency to pay the principal of and interest on loans,moneys advanced to,or indebtedness whether funded,refunded,assumed or otherwise incurred by the redevelopment agency to finance or refinance,in whole or in part,the redevelopment project.cal,art.xvi,subd.b,emphasis added.subdivision a of section is very similar the portion of taxes required to be allocated pursuant to subdivision b of section shall be allocated and paid to the agency by the county auditor,subd.a,emphasis added.it is not until the loans,advances,and indebtedness have been paid,that all moneys thereafter received shall be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies as taxes on all other property are paid.cal,art.xvi,subd.b.
in this context,section,subdivision b is a procedural provision which sets out the method through which a county is to perform its duty.it is not a limit on the county duty to distribute all the tax increment to which a redevelopment agency is legally entitled 
in interpreting a statute,we must embrace the meaning which best effectuates the legislative purpose.santa ana unified school dist.orange county development agency th.case law tells us that the legislative purpose behind the crl and the tax increment financing scheme was to further redevelopment by ensuring that redevelopment agencies may acquire,and repay,debt.marek napa community redevelopment agency,supra,cal d,community development com of city of oxnard county of ventura,supra,th.
the issue in marek,supra,cal d,was the meaning of indebtedness in the crl,and whether,as the agency asserted,the term included executory obligations.the supreme court agreed with the agency that it did,finding that the purpose of the crl and the structures created by it supported the agency view.the court noted that redevelopment agencies are responsible for implementing the crl and thus have broad powers to acquire property and make contracts,and that they rely on tax increment funds for the exercise of their powers.the court concluded that since redevelopment agencies are statutorily empowered to enter into binding contracts to complete redevelopment projects,the term indebtedness must be interpreted in a way that will enable those agencies to perform their contractual obligations.in this light,we think it clear that indebtedness was meant to include all redevelopment agency obligations,whether pursuant to an executory contract,a performed contract or to repay principal and interest on bonds or loans.to insure its ability to perform its obligations,a redevelopment agency is entitled to all tax increment funds as they become available,until its loans,advances and indebtedness,if any,and interest thereon have been paid art.xvi.id.at.
marek,supra,cal d also rejected the auditor theory that the auditor was a kind of guardian of tax increment revenues to ensure that other local tax entities receive their fair share,finding that it is the auditor function to see that the aggregate amount of tax increment revenues paid to the agency does not exceed the aggregate of its indebtedness.in other words,it is only when the agency total indebtedness has been paid that tax increment revenues are to be paid to the other tax entities.redevelopment agency county of san bernardino,supra,cal d.until that time the county auditor is required to pay all available tax increment funds up to the amount of the agency indebtedness to the redevelopment agency for deposit into its special fund.contrary to the position of the auditor,it is not the purpose of the procedure to permit other tax entities to share in tax increment revenues at any time before the agency total indebtedness has been paid or the amount in its special fund is sufficient to pay its total indebtedness.art.xvi,see fn,ante.id.at.
in community development com of city of oxnard county of ventura,supra,th the court was called on to construe section,which concerns the base year determination,and to decide whether escape assessments assessments made because the property in question was not assessed during the initial assessment period should be included in the computation.id.at.the court determined that,based on the language of the statute,escape assessment must be included.the court also found that another factor compels our conclusion that such mistakes,no matter how innocent,should not accrue to the detriment of the redevelopment agency.redevelopment agencies frequently issue bonds to pay for the cost of redevelopment.bell community redevelopment agency woosley d.the marketability of those bonds is based in part on the redevelopment agency ability to pay the principal and interest due on the bonds.see generally in re nathan estate cir,fn.davis.an investor must be able to estimate the tax revenue that the redevelopment agency will receive.it would be difficult for investors to evaluate the bond issue if the redevelopment agency revenue were dependent upon the efficiency of the assessor office.the legislature could not have intended such instabili
