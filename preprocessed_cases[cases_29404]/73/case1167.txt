charles wheeler,proceeding pro se,appeals from two decisions of the united states tax court.the first decision,in case number,decided that there was a total deficiency in income tax due of for tax years through.the court also imposed an addition to wheeler tax of under a for failing to file tax returns for those years and an addition of for that period under for underpayment of an estimated tax the second decision,in case number,decided there was a deficiency in income tax due of for tax year.the court also imposed additions to wheeler tax of under a and of under for that tax year.finally,the tax court assessed a penalty in each case under a for instituting proceedings primarily for the purpose of delay and for advancing frivolous and groundless arguments.wheeler appeal from these two tax court decisions is also related to appeal.see wheeler comm r,cir.in that appeal wheeler contested a tax court decision imposing a deficiency for a single tax year,plus an addition to tax and a penalty for that year.
in the appeal at hand,wheeler argues that the commissioner violated his right to procedural due process by not providing him with the statute or statutes upon which the deficiencies at issue are based the requirement that he sign his forms under penalty of perjury violates his fifth amendment right against the joint stipulations of fact are void because he agreed to them under duress evidence was improperly entered into the administrative record and the penalties assessed against him were improper because the forms he eventually provided did not possess a valid control number from the office of management and budget omb.
the commissioner has responded to wheeler appeal,and also moves for sanctions in the amount of on the ground that wheeler appeal is frivolous.exercising our jurisdiction under a,we affirm the decisions of the tax court and award a sanction in the amount of to the commissioner 
we review tax court decisions in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions tried without a jury.scanlon white,comm r,cir quotations omitted.in his first point,wheeler argues that the commissioner violated his right to procedural due process by not providing him with the statute or statutes upon which the deficiencies at issue are based.he argues that he has never been informed of the statutory authority for the taxes imposed upon him.
a review of the record shows that this is simply the latest version of a broader argument challenging the statutory power of the government to tax income.the very first section of the internal revenue code,imposes an income tax on the taxable income of every citizen or resident of the united states.see a.taxable income is gross income minus allowable deductions,a,and gross income is all income from whatever source derived,id.a.we have held that an argument that no statutory authority exists for imposing an income tax on individuals is completely lacking in legal merit and patently frivolous.lonsdale united states,cir see also charczuk comm r,cir holding that the argument that there is no law or statute that imposed an income tax on taxpayer was meritless and unreasonable.although on appeal wheeler attempts to persuade the court that he would have willingly paid his taxes if someone had simply directed him to the proper sections of the tax code,a review of the proceedings below shows that wheeler is well aware of the relevant tax code provisions but believes they are not applicable to him.
in case,wheeler argued in a december,reply to the commissioner answer to his petition that he disagreed that the commissioner has statutory authority through public law to determine the petitioner liable for deficiencies in income tax,doc.at.he went on to claim that t he commissioner erred by relying on title rather than the underlying statutes at large.id.
in his april,petition in case,wheeler argued that neither the commissioner nor the tax court could produce a statute at large that makes the petitioner liable for the tax the commissioner is attempting to assess,doc.at.he went on to argue that title is a law and is,therefore,a special united states code that applies to a specified segment of the population of the united states of america.id.at.
at a tax court hearing on various motions filed in both cases,wheeler argued 
well,your honor,i not very argumentative,and i just asked a simple question.what the taxing statute what the implementation regulation and what taxable activity have i been involved in 
i do dispute income tax at all.what i questioning is what makes my compensation for labor taxable people refuse to answer that.
doc.at.the tax court answered 
well,wheeler,i not sure specifically what sort of an answer you seek.there are numerous cases that have been decided that have clearly indicated that gross income includes income from whatever source derived,unless it specifically excluded in the code.
and the sixteenth amendment has clearly been found to be a valid amendment that permits what we know of as the internal revenue code,title.
id.at.the tax court went on to state 
i bound by the courts above me,and those courts have already found that the internal revenue code is a valid enactment of the congress,and that it does apply to citizens who have an increase in their net worth,that have received an accretion of income as defined,very broadly,to be any increase,unless you can show a code section that specifically excludes it.
at the trial before the tax court,wheeler again claimed that he had never been directed to a specific taxing statute.he argued t he answer that it an income tax is a little too broad and a little too general,doc.at.
in its tax court memorandum,the court noted that wheeler had represented in correspondence to the irs that he had been researching tax issues for almost fourteen years,doc.at.in its decision,the court referenced the fact that imposes a federal tax on the taxable income of every individual and that g ross income for the purposes of calculating taxable income is defined as all income from whatever source derived.id.at quoting a.
wheeler thereafter filed what was essentially a motion to reconsider which,among other things,argued without citation to authority the deficiency notice that he had received failed to reference the taxing statute authorizing income tax,and that this failure rendered the notice void on its face,deprived the tax court of subject matter jurisdiction,and deprived him of his due process rights,doc.at.wheeler had not raised these arguments previously.
wheeler also filed an objection to the commissioner submitted computation.in his objection he claimed that he had been denied due process in a multitude of ways.among other things,he claimed,without authority,that the notice of deficiency and the commissioner computation failed to provide proper notice because they did not reference the specific statute under which the income tax was being assessed.despite the fact that the tax court opinion had referenced and,wheeler also claimed that the commissioner and the tax court failed to inform him of any statutory basis for the tax assessed against him,that the only information that he had ever been provided was that he owed an income tax,and that no sections of title had been cited by either the tax court or the commissioner.the tax court thereafter entered its decisions in both cases.
on appeal,wheeler continues to profess ignorance as to the contents of the tax code.changing course from his earlier correspondence and filings,he claims that he does not question the right of the government to tax the citizens of the united states and is only request ing the government to notify him as to why he is being taxed,by citing the statute s under which he owes the tax.aplt.opening br.at even following the commissioner response brief,wherein the commissioner cites to numerous statutory cites relevant to wheeler case,including and,wheeler claims that d espite years of requests on the part of the appellant,however inarticulate these requests may have been,the appellee has not once provided appellant with the notice he has continually requested.aplt.reply br.at.
from the above,it is clear that wheeler is well aware,and has always been aware,of the provisions of the tax code and the statutes the commissioner relied on to assess income tax against him.in fact,in the same correspondence referenced by the tax court,wherein wheeler claimed that he had researched tax law for almost fourteen years,wheeler made numerous arguments as to why the provisions of the tax code should not apply to his income.in making his arguments,he referenced numerous sections from the code and their accompanying regulations,including and.see,ex.at.wheeler present argument that he has not received due process because he has never been informed of the statutory authority for this country income tax was not raised until after the tax court had issued its opinion,and is frivolous in that it is grounded on a complete misrepresentation of the record.
in his second point,wheeler argues that the requirement that he sign his forms under penalty of perjury violates his fifth amendment right against.wheeler failed to properly raise this argument before the tax court and we will not address it for the first time on appeal.adolph coors comm r,cir.but even if we were to address the merits,the claim is frivolous.see united states stillhammer,cir the fifth amendment does not serve as a defense for failing to make any tax return.
in both and,wheeler and the commissioner executed joint stipulations as to certain facts.in his third claim on appeal,wheeler makes the frivolous argument that he was under duress from the commissioner and the tax court when he signed the stipulations.although he made no claim of duress to the tax court,he now argues that the spectre of sanctions hung close over his head and that t he commissioner version of shock an d awe is a constant barrage of inference,veiled threats of sanctions,and the response that every issue raised by wheeler is frivolous.aplt.br.at.he argues that he felt forced to sign the stipulations despite his strong disagreement to their validity because he felt he would be sanctioned if he did not sign them.
under the traditional doctrine of duress in a contract setting,courts often speak of an alleged victim of duress as having been deprived of free will or free agency,or of having acted involuntarily as the result of some imminent and wrongful or unlawful act or threat.richard lord,williston on contracts ed.under tax court rule a 
the parties are required to stipulate,to the fullest extent to which complete or qualified agreement can or fairly should be reached,all matters not privileged which are relevant to the pending case,regardless of whether such matters involve fact or opinion or the application of law to fact.included in matters required to be stipulated are all facts,all documents and papers or contents or aspects thereof,and all evidence which fairly should not be in dispute.
the tax court judge reminded wheeler during the tax court proceedings that he could be sanctioned for raising frivolous arguments,as he eventually was.further,at a motions hearing,in setting a trial date,the tax court cautioned the parties that it intended to enforce rule.the judge stated 
now,you do have to stipulate to things that are true,but if something is not reasonably in dispute,and you refuse to stipulate to it,then,when somebody tries to introduce it here in court,i going to want to know why it was stipulated to and why the rule has been violated.
vol.ii,doc.at.clearly,the tax court merely instructed wheeler,a pro se litigant,that he would be expected to follow tax law and the procedural rules of the tax court.far from an imposition of duress,the tax court warnings appear to be an attempt to prevent a pro se litigant from inadvertently violating the court procedural rules.kay bemis,cir holding that pro se parties must follow the same rules of procedure that govern other litigants.
further,none of the stipulated facts appear to be reasonably disputable,including,for example,the fact that wheeler did not timely file returns for the years in question and the amounts that wheeler received as compensation for labor for those years.but a thorough review is hindered by the fact that wheeler makes no attempt to specify as to which of the stipulated facts he disagrees.
in his fourth point,wheeler argues that the evidence presented in the tax court was not properly authenticated.this point is patently frivolous.wheeler does not specify to which pieces of evidence he is referring.wheeler did not object to the admission of any of the evidence in the tax court.furthermore,the parties stipulation of facts stated that all exhibits referred to in the stipulation and attached to it were authentic.
in the heading of his final point,wheeler argues that the penalties assessed against him were improper because the forms he completed were requests for information subject to the paperwork reduction action pra,which was originally enacted in and then recodified and reenacted in,and failed to possess a valid control number from the office of management and budget omb.
specifically,wheeler directs us to,which reads 
a notwithstanding any other provision of law,no person shall be subject to any penalty for failing to comply with a collection of information that is subject to this subchapter if 
the collection of information does not display a valid control number assigned by the director in accordance with this subchapter or 
the agency fails to inform the person who is to respond to the collection of information that such person is not required to respond to the collection of information unless it displays a valid control number.
b the protection provided by this section may be raised in the form of a complete defense,bar,or otherwise at any time during the agency administrative process or judicial action applicable thereto.
the forms referenced by wheeler all display omb control numbers on their faces.in his opening brief,wheeler does not specify exactly what it is about the omb control numbers that he alleges is invalid,although he makes reference to a requirement that a current omb control number be displayed.see aplt.opening br.at.if,as the government theorizes,wheeler is complaining of the absence of expiration dates with the omb control numbers,we are bound by our decisions in united states collins,cir,and lewis commissioner of internal revenue,cir,which held that expiration dates are not required on forms.
since wheeler is proceeding pro se,we read his brief liberally.doing so,we conclude that he is also attempting to argue not only that the forms at issue did not display valid control numbers,but that the forms themselves were required to also inform the person who is to respond to the collection of information that such person is not required to respond to the collection of information unless it displays a valid control number.a see also c b iii v.this information is instead contained in the instruction booklet to the form.the form then directs the taxpayer to the booklet as the location of the paperwork reduction act notice.wheeler apparently contends that this is inadequate 
we rejected precisely this argument in our recent holding in lewis.in that opinion we explained that the pra does not require each form requesting information to inform the person responding to the request that he or she is not required to respond unless a valid control number is displayed.the requirement is simply that the agency must provide that information.we held that t he irs,an agency,satisfies this obligation by making these disclosures in the instruction booklet associated with form.lewis,at 
the commissioner has filed a motion asking that wheeler be sanctioned for filing a frivolous appeal.an appeal may be frivolous if it consists of irrelevant and illogical arguments based on factual misrepresentations and false premises,or when the result is obvious,or the appellant arguments of error are wholly without merit.id.at citations and quotations omitted.under federal rule of appellate procedure if a court of appeals determines that an appeal is frivolous,it may,after a separately filed motion or notice from the court and a r
