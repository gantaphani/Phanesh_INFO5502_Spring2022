in the late and early,the tribe brought various claims against the united states before the indian claims commission.these claims were brought pursuant to the indian claims commission act,repealed.this remedial legislation was passed to settle claims arising from the taking by the united states,whether as the result of a treaty of cession or otherwise,of lands owned or occupied by the claimant without the payment for such lands or compensation agreed to by the claimant.as a result of these claims,the tribe was awarded judgments against the united states in the and,which were held in trust by the secretary of the interior.
the indian tribal judgment funds use or distribution act,et the distribution act governed the distribution of the judgment awards to the tribe.pursuant to the distribution act,the tribe and the secretary of the interior developed a use and distribution plan which became final and was published in the federal register on september,the plan.
under the plan,percent of the funds were distributed pro rata to the members of the tribe,and percent of the funds were set aside for programming,to be held in perpetual trust by the secretary of the interior,with the income from such funds to be used for real estate acquisition,development of the tribe,including increasing the effectiveness of the government,and the maintenance of the property of the tribe.as required by the distribution act,see stating that none of the funds which are held in trust pursuant to a plan approved under the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to federal or state income taxes,the plan states none of the funds distributed per capita or made available under this plan for programing shall be subject to federal or state income taxes.plan,b.

as required by the plan,the tribe and the secretary of the interior developed the plan.the plan defined the terms acquisition,development and maintenance,as used in the plan.development is defined as those activities actions undertaken by the tribe to in some way cause growth,building up,expansion,strengthening,increased effectiveness or other evolutionary process toward the program of the tribe economically socially governmentally.plan.
in,the american indian trust fund management reform act of,et,was passed,which,inter alia,allowed tribes to withdraw and manage any trust funds held by the secretary of the interior on their behalf,subject to the approval of the secretary of the interior.in,the tribe members voted to withdraw all trust funds from the control and management of the secretary of the interior,and to place control and management of the trust funds with the tribe.after withdrawal,the funds maintained their status as trust funds.in,the business committee of the tribe passed resolution,which authorized barrett,as the chairman of the tribe,to effectuate the transfer of the management of the trust funds from the secretary of the interior to the tribe,pursuant to management policies and guidelines that were to be approved by the secretary of the interior.
as part of the tribe request for approval of of the trust funds,the tribe also submitted for approval a detailed investment management policy for the investment and use of the trust funds.under the investment management policy,the purposes and uses for the expenditure of the earnings withdrawn from the trust,pursuant to the annual budget approved by the electorate,remained the same as those in effect during the secretary of the interior tenure as manager of the trust funds,to acquire real estate,develop the tribe,and maintain tribe property.
in,the secretary of the interior approved the transfer of the trust funds to the tribe,subject to the tribe use and management of the funds in a manner consistent with the investment management policy.the tribe now maintains the trust fund in a separate trust account held with the first national bank trust company the tribe trust fund earnings which are to be expended for the year are placed in the tribe general fund account as a,and accounted for separately from the tribe general fund monies.any earnings from the trust fund that are not included in the budget,or approved for expenditure by the general membership of the tribe,remain in the trust fund and become part of the principal of the trust fund.the secretary of the interior requires the tribe to hire an independent auditor to perform a yearly audit of the trust funds.when completed,the tribe submits the audit report to the secretary of the interior.
in,barrett concluded that his salary as chairman could be paid from the earnings on the tribe trust fund,and that he would not be taxed on that income.barrett suggested to the business committee of the tribe that he be paid from those funds,and then he informed the accounting department of this plan.barrett also instructed the accounting department not to withhold taxes from his compensation and not to issue a form to him.
in,barrett received in compensation from the tribe for his duties as chairman.this compensation was paid from the trust funds which had been previously managed by the secretary of the interior but were now by the tribe.the business committee of the tribe,with the approval of the tribe general electorate at its annual meeting,directed that the chairman compensation be paid from the trust funds.
after the completion of an audit,the irs determined that compensation paid to barrett by the tribe was taxable income to barrett.in june,the irs issued a notice of deficiency proposing to assess barrett for additional income taxes for the tax year.the proposed assessment by the irs was for income taxes in the amount of and penalties of,pursuant to.these amounts were ultimately assessed by the irs,and,after payment of all amounts assessed in september,barrett,in march,requested a refund of the amounts paid pursuant to assessments relating to the compensation which had been paid to barrett as chairman of the tribe in tax year in may,the irs denied barrett refund claim,and barrett filed his complaint in the district court in september,seeking review of the irs denial of his refund claim.
on for summary judgment,the district court denied barrett motion and granted the motion of the united states.in its order,the district court rejected barrett argument that the compensation paid by the tribe was exempt from income tax because it fell within the plan definition of development or that the compensation paid to barrett was a programming expenditure under the plan.the district court also found that the penalty should be sustained because,while there might be a factual question as to barrett subjective good faith,barrett had not presented sufficient evidence to create a triable issue of fact as to the objective reasonableness of his position regarding the taxability of his salary.

exemption from federal income tax 
barrett acknowledges that american indians,as united states citizens,generally are subject to the federal income tax.see squire capoeman.indians are citizens and in ordinary affairs of life,not governed by treaties or remedial legislation,they are subject to the payment of income taxes as are other citizens.barrett claims,however,that his compensation as chairman is not taxable income because the source of the funds used to pay him was trust fund money previously awarded by the indian claims commission to the tribe,and that funds received from that source are tax exempt.aplt.br.at.
under the internal revenue code,gross income is all income from whatever source derived,a,and an exemption from the payment of taxes should be clearly expressed,squire,at.see also allen comm r,cch,aff.cir unpublished it is well established that native americans,or american indians,as citizens,are subject to the federal income tax unless an exemption is created by treaty or statute.for such an exemption to be valid,it must be based upon clearly expressed language in a statute or treaty.internal citations omitted.barrett claims the plan specification that none of the funds made available under this plan for programing shall be subject to federal or state income taxes,plan,b,is an express exemption for his compensation because his compensation was paid from the programming funds.
specifically,barrett argues that his compensation as the chairman of the tribe furthers the development of the tribe,defined in the plan as the growth,building up,expansion,strengthening,increased effectiveness or other evolutionary process toward the progress of the tribe,plan.barrett argues that the chairman oversight of the tribe operations is one way of developing strong and stable tribal governments,aplt.br.at,which helps achieve the government expressed goal of promoting strong tribal economic development,and,id.at citing the indian and education assistance act of,et,the indian financing act of,et.tax comm citizen band potawatomi indian tribe of,d,and prairie band potawatomi nation wagnon,cir,as examples in support of the government consistent stated goal of tribal.barrett contends the compensation paid to him as chairman fits within the programming aspect of the plan,and as such,the express language of the plan that exempts the programming funds from tax also exempts his compensation from tax.
we disagree.the express exemption authorized by congress,for funds made available under this plan for programing,plan,b,does not encompass the compensation paid to barrett as the chairman of the tribe.the funds available under the plan for programming were the funds authorized by the plan.the plan authorized the use of the funds for acquisition,development and maintenance.barrett argues his compensation falls within the definition of development,but the plan defines development as those activities actions undertaken by the tribe to in some way cause growth,building up,expansion,strengthening,increased effectiveness or other evolutionary process toward the progress of the tribe economically socially,governmentally.plan.barrett compensation for the oversight of operations can not be considered development under the expressed definition of the term.payment of a salary to barrett,who filled the and position of tribal chairman is not an expenditure for an evolutionary process toward the progress of the tribe economically socially,governmentally.
in addition,even if the compensation paid to barrett as chairman of the tribe would satisfy the criteria of the programming funds,the tax exemption reference in the plan is not sufficiently specific to exempt barrett salary from federal taxation.see mescalero apache tribe jones,d noting that the supreme court has repeatedly said that tax exemptions are not granted by implication and that if congress intends a tax exemption,it should say so in plain words.such a conclusion can not rest on dubious inferences internal quotations omitted.if the annual compensation paid to a tribal chairman was to be exempt from taxation,it could have been easily and plainly expressed.
as a result,because barrett compensation was not expressly exempt from federal income tax,the district court was correct to grant summary judgment in favor of the united states on barrett claim for a refund although barrett cites sources which emphasize the government strong desire for american indians to progress toward tribal,this goal does not trump the requirement that an exemption from the payment of taxes must be explicitly stated.see.tax comm n,at.noting congress desire to promote the goal of indian,including its overriding goal of encouraging tribal and economic development and therefore refusing to modify the principle of tribal sovereign immunity internal quotations omitted squire,at.recognizing that the united states has authority to tax american indian citizens as long as there is no express exemption from tax.
section of the internal revenue code imposes a percent penalty on the portion of underpayment of tax attributable to negligence or disregard of rules or regulations.see a mandating a tax equal to percent of the portion of the underpayment,b applying penalty for n egligence or disregard of rules or regulations.
the negligence contemplated by the statute is any failure to make a reasonable attempt to comply with the provisions of the tax law.id.c.negligence is defined as the lack of due care or failure to do what a reasonable or ordinarily prudent person would do under the circumstances.van scoten comm r,cir quoting anderson comm r,cir.
the term disregard includes any careless,reckless,or intentional disregard of rules or regulations.reg.b.disregard of rules or regulations is careless if the taxpayer does not exercise reasonable diligence to determine the correctness of a return position and is reckless if the taxpayer makes little or no effort to determine whether a rule or regulation exists,under circumstances which demonstrate a substantial deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable p
