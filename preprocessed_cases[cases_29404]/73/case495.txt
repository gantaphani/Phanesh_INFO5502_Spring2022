debtor prescription home health care,based in san antonio,texas,is a provider of home health services.edward pena is prescription president and sole owner.
in august,prescription filed a petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code.the irs was,by far,prescription chief creditor prescription owed approximately in unpaid taxes,interest,and penalties.in fact,the irs impending collection efforts motivated the filing by prescription.
the irs claim included a priority claim of approximately,consisting of a unemployment and payroll taxes that prescription,as an employer,was required to pay,and b approximately in trust fund taxes income and payroll taxes that prescription had withheld from its employees wages during all of and three quarters of,but had failed to remit to the irs and a general unsecured claim of approximately for penalties that had accrued on the taxes through the date of the bankruptcy petition.

in addition to prescription trust fund liability,pena,as a responsible person,was personally liable,pursuant to.it is undisputed that both prescription and pena were liable for the unpaid trust fund taxes.
section a states 
any person required to collect,truthfully account for,and pay over any tax imposed by this title who willfully fails to do so,or willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any such tax or the payment thereof,shall,in addition to other penalties provided by law,be liable to a penalty equal to the amount of the tax evaded,or not collected,or not accounted for and paid over.

prescription filed a plan of reorganization in january and an amended plan that april.the latter provided pena would retain his interest in the debtor upon receipt by prescription of funds equal to the professional fees incurred by prescription as of the confirmation date the priority portion of the irs claim would be paid in full in equal quarterly installments over a period and the general unsecured claim would be paid by pro rata distributions from an unsecured claims fund over a period,so that the irs would receive payments equal to approximately percent of the general unsecured portion of the claim.
the plan further provided all payments made toward the priority claim would be applied to the trust fund portion until that liability had been paid in full and,upon,all creditors would be enjoined from any act to collect from the debtor management and employees any portion of a claim against the debtor,as long as it complied with the plan.
it is the irs policy not to assess the penalty against a responsible person as long as the debtor is compliant with the terms of its bankruptcy payment plan,unless statute of limitations concerns are present.administration,internal revenue manual cch,at.the limitations period for assessing the liability against pena will expire in april three years after prescription filed its employment tax returns.see lauckner united states,cir.therefore,if prescription were to comply with its plan until then,the period for assessing the penalty against pena would expire while the injunction remained in effect.in other words,if the debtor made its payments until the end of the limitations period,but defaulted thereafter,and the trust fund taxes had not been paid in full,the irs could be barred from making an assessment against pena.the government concedes that there is a strong argument that the period should be tolled and that this court could do so.
the irs objected,on a number of grounds,to confirmation of prescription proposed plan.it contended,inter alia a bankruptcy court could order plan payments to be first applied to the trust fund portion of a tax liability only upon a showing that such an allocation was necessary for an effective reorganization,and prescription had not made that showing the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin an assessment against a third party and the proposed injunction for the assessment violated the act,a.
at the confirmation hearing,pena was asked why,for an effective reorganization,it was necessary to designate all plan payments to the trust fund portion and to enjoin all collection against him.he responded to make reorganization successful,he would have to devote his time to the debtor operations and it very difficult to do that when i realize i can be assessed.when asked whether the lack of these provisions would interfere with his performance on behalf of the debtor,he answered 
it a dark cloud hanging over me and i just very distracting to realize that being a single parent of two,an and,both girls,it a lot of responsibility on my shoulders to make sure that i am successful in paying back the and without,you know,being able to get into the housing market.
on,pena confirmed that the reason prescription wanted plan payments first applied to the trust fund liability was because of the dark cloud that would be hanging over pena head.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the irs objections were overruled.the bankruptcy judge noted his approval of payments being first applied to the trust fund liability t hat an incentive on the part of the debtor to make sure that the debtor,in fact,performs for as long as possible,because to the extent the debtor does perform,then there a positive benefit,not only for the debtor,but also for pena.the bankruptcy judge determined that,to both prevent the plan undoing and ensure the irs would be paid,it was appropriate to enjoin the assessment.he reasoned the plan would prevent pena from being thrown out of this business,because if he has the chasing him around for the rest of his life,he certainly wo be starting another one of these businesses and would never generate the kind of revenue necessary to pay the irs.
in june,the bankruptcy court confirmed prescription amended plan,with pena being permitted to retain his interest in prescription for a payment of.through what the bankruptcy court termed a conditional injunction,necessary for the successful reorganization of prescription,the irs was enjoined from taking any action under to assess or collect any federal employment tax liability from pena as a responsible party,so long as prescription remained current on its payments injunction.
the irs appealed to district court.in december,that court affirmed the bankruptcy court order,holding,inter alia the debtor offered sufficient evidence through pena testimony to show the designation of plan payments to trust fund liability was necessary for a successful reorganization and the act does not prevent the bankruptcy court from temporarily modifying the irs ability to collect from a responsible person,if that is necessary to the successful reorganization of the debtor,because the bankruptcy court,using its broad discretionary powers under,had jurisdiction to enter the temporary injunction as a proceeding related to the bankruptcy proceeding.
