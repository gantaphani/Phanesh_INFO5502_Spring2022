we have on appeal a decision of a district court of appeal declaring invalid a state statute.dep t of revenue howard,so d dca.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.for the reasons set out below,we reverse the decision of the first district court of appeal and uphold the constitutionality of section,florida statutes,requiring a property appraiser to consider the results of an appeal before a value adjustment board vab in the prior year in determining the current just value of tangible personal property.
proceedings to date 
the appellees include taxpayers who own real estate in broward and counties.the taxpayers sued the department of revenue and the county property appraisers and sought a declaratory judgment in the circuit court contending that section violated the tax assessment provisions of the florida constitution by interfering with the property appraiser discretion to determine just value,and by favoring tangible personal property owners who may have received a reduced assessment from an administrative vab in the previous tax year.
section provides 
property appraiser assessment effect of determinations by value adjustment the property appraiser assessment of the same items of tangible personal property in the previous year was adjusted by the value adjustment board and the decision of the board to reduce the assessment was not successfully appealed by the property appraiser,the property appraiser shall consider the reduced values determined by the value adjustment board in assessing those items of tangible personal property.if the property appraiser adjusts upward the reduced values previously determined by the value adjustment board,the property appraiser shall assert additional basic and underlying facts not properly considered by the value adjustment board as the basis for the increased valuation notwithstanding the prior adjustment by the board.
stat.the trial court concluded that the requirement in section that the appraiser shall consider the reduced assessment by the vab in the prior year did not interfere with the appraiser authority and discretion to determine just value in accord with article vii,section of the florida constitution.howard,so d at.however,the trial court concluded that the provision of the statute requiring the property appraiser to assert additional basic and underlying facts not properly considered by the value adjustment board in order to avoid the effect of the vab ruling did impede the appraiser discretion in determining just value in violation of article vii,section.id.
on appeal,the first district,in a decision,concluded that the statute was unconstitutional in its entirety because it created a separate valuation methodology for a special class of property in violation of article vii,section.id.at.
the department of revenue contends that the first district erred in concluding that section violates the just valuation provisions of article vii,section.while we review decisions striking state statutes de novo,we are obligated to accord legislative acts a presumption of constitutionality and to construe challenged legislation to effect a constitutional outcome whenever possible.see eastern air lines,dep t of revenue,so d,chatlos overstreet,so d.we do so here.
article vii,section of the florida constitution mandates the legislature to prescribe regulations that shall secure a just valuation of all property for ad valorem taxation.this court has held that,under this mandate for just valuation,the just valuation of all property,except for the different classes of property actually listed in section,must be measured under uniform objective standards.see valencia,bystrom,so d,interlachen lakes estates,snyder,so d.
we have also held that while the legislature could establish just valuation criteria to be applied in determining the just value of property for tax purposes,it could not arbitrarily classify some property for favored tax treatment.see bystrom,so d at snyder,so d at.logically,of course,such classification could lead to other property carrying a disproportionate share of the tax burden.see bystrom,so d at williams jones,so d.accordingly,while the legislature has the power to set criteria for taxation purposes to ensure an equitable distribution of the tax burden,it can not establish criteria that favor certain taxpayers over others.williams,so d at snyder,so d at.
in furtherance of the mandate of article vii,section,that all property be assessed at just value,the legislature has enacted section,florida statutes,which lists eight factors the property appraiser must consider in determining just valuation.section provides 
factors to consider in deriving just arriving at just valuation as required under,art.vii of the state constitution,the property appraiser shall take into consideration the following factors 
the present cash value of the property,which is the amount a willing purchaser would pay a willing seller,exclusive of reasonable fees and costs of purchase,in cash or the immediate equivalent thereof in a transaction at arm length 
the highest and best use to which the property can be expected to be put in the immediate future and the present use of the property,taking into consideration any applicable judicial limitation,local or state land use regulation,or historic preservation ordinance,and considering any moratorium imposed by executive order,law,ordinance,regulation,resolution,or proclamation adopted by any governmental body or agency or the governor when the moratorium or judicial limitation prohibits or restricts the development or improvement of property as otherwise authorized by applicable law.the applicable governmental body or agency or the governor shall notify the property appraiser in writing of any executive order,ordinance,regulation,resolution,or proclamation it adopts imposing any such limitation,regulation,or moratorium 
the location of said property 
the quantity or size of said property 
the cost of said property and the present replacement value of any improvements thereon 
the condition of said property 
the income from said property and 
the net proceeds of the sale of the property,as received by the seller,after deduction of all of the usual and reasonable fees and costs of the sale,including the costs and expenses of financing,and allowance for unconventional or atypical terms of financing arrangements.when the net proceeds of the sale of any property are utilized,directly or indirectly,in the determination of just valuation of realty of the sold parcel or any other parcel under the provisions of this section,the property appraiser,for the purposes of such determination,shall exclude any portion of such net proceeds attributable to payments for household furnishings or other items of personal property.
under florida constitution and this court case law the particular method of valuation and the weight to be given the factors set out in section are left to the discretion of the appraiser.see bystrom,so d at.the d etermination of just value inherently and necessarily requires the exercise of appraisal judgment and broad discretion by florida property appraisers.dep t of revenue ford,so d,quoting trial court judgment.thus,t he property appraiser determination of assessment value is an exercise of administrative discretion within the officer field of expertise.mazourek stores,so d,quoting blake xerox,so d.
the department contends that section does not violate article vii,section provisions,because the statute merely adds,in essence,a ninth factor to section vab reduced assessment in the prior the property appraiser to consider along with those other factors set out in section,when assessing tangible personal property.the department further argues that the second sentence in section simply requires the appraiser to explain his or her actions if he or she decides to assess the value of the property at a higher value than that recently lawfully determined by the vab.
on the other hand,the taxpayers argue that section creates an arbitrary and select classification for tangible personal property that has received a reduced valuation in administrative proceedings,and the s
