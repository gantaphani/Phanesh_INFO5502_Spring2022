proposition amended the california constitution by prohibiting the imposition of ad valorem property taxes in excess of one percent of the cash value of property.it contains an exception allowing excess taxes or special assessments to pay the interest and redemption charges on any i ndebtedness approved by the voters prior to july.cal,art.xiii a,subd.b.the issue in this case is whether passage of a new city charter by the voters of real party in interest city of huntington beach city in july constitutes prior voter approval of excess taxation for retirement benefits added after.that charter mandates city participation in a retirement system gives the city council discretion to establish such reasonable compensation and fringe benefits as are appropriate for city employees by ordinance or resolution and expressly provides for an excess tax sufficient to meet all obligations of the city for the retirement system in which the city participates.we agree with the trial court that excess taxation for the added retirement benefits violates proposition and affirm the judgment.
the parties stipulated to the facts.the voters of the city approved a charter in.section of that charter,entitled retirement,provides authority and power are hereby vested in the city,its city council and its several officers,agents,and employees to do and perform any act,and to exercise any authority granted,permitted,or required under the provisions of the state employees retirement act,as it now exists or hereafter may be amended,to enable the city to continue as a contracting city under the state employees retirement system.the city council may terminate any contract with the state employees retirement system only under authority granted by ordinance adopted by a majority vote of the electors of the city 
section of the former charter stated a the city council shall not levy a property tax for municipal purposes in excess of one dollar annually on each one hundred dollars of the assessed value of taxable property in the city,except as otherwise provided in this section b there shall be levied and collected at the same time and in the same manner as other property taxes for municipal purposes are levied and collected,as additional taxes not subject to the above limitation,if no other provision for payment thereof is made.a tax sufficient to meet all obligations of the city under the state employees retirement system,the federal insurance contributions act,or other plan,for the retirement of city employees,due and unpaid or to become due during the ensuing fiscal year.
in,city voters approved amendments to the charter prohibiting the city council from taking any action which had the effect of increasing the amount of tax payable unless approved by a vote of at least of the council.the amendments expressly excluded from this supermajority vote requirement increases in the retirement tax.
in june,city voters approved a new charter.some of the provisions which the city council considered controversial were presented to the voters as distinct propositions.the remaining provisions of the proposed charter,including those relating to the retirement system and its funding,were combined in proposition the city attorney impartial analysis described proposition d as follows the existing city charter contains a number of housekeeping provisions which will be streamlined by approval of proposition the controversial measures,proposition e,f,g,h,and j,are in no way affected by the vote on proposition there is insufficient space in this analysis to describe in detail each provision of the existing charter which will be amended by the adoption of proposition and therefore,a close reading of the text of the proposed amendments is recommended.
the charter changed the prior charter by no longer mandating participation in the state employees retirement system,now the public employees retirement system pers.instead,the new charter merely provides the city shall participate in a retirement system.additionally,the new charter requires that the council establish such reasonable compensation and fringe benefits as are appropriate by ordinance or resolution for offices,officials and employees except as herein provided.consistent with the charter,the new charter specifies that city may impose excess taxes sufficient to meet all its obligations for the retirement system in which the city participates,due and unpaid or to become due during the ensuing fiscal year.as did the earlier one,the new charter imposes a general requirement that increases in taxes must be approved by percent of the council,but again excludes the retirement tax from the vote.
some of city employees have been members of pers since all of them have been members since.benefits under the plan are funded by a combination of contributions from the public agency employers,contributions from employee members,and earnings from investments made by pers.the employee contribution rates are set by the legislature as a percentage of the employee salary,while the employer contribution rates are set annually,as determined by actuarial valuations based on the employer retirement formula,the makeup of employee groups,and pers earnings on investments.
since the early,virtually all city employees have been represented by employee associations the associations and city have entered into collective bargaining agreements,known as memoranda of understanding mou,which establish employee wages,hours,and working conditions,including retirement benefits.
between and the adoption of the charter,city made several changes liberalizing benefits under the pers contract.it added survivor benefits for the families of employees who died prior to retirement,provided for up to four years of military service to count toward pers benefits,and allowed certain employees pers benefits to be based on the employee single highest year of compensation,rather than an average of the employee highest three years.
city continued to change its retirement package even after the adoption of its charter and the passage of proposition.the first of the changes became effective the same date as proposition.on july,pursuant to previously negotiated mou,city began paying part of its employees portion of retirement contributions.during the ensuing years,as part of new mou,city gradually increased the percentage of the employee portion of contributions it paid until the point where it now pays the employees full pers contribution.
in,city also added two new benefits a supplemental retirement benefit,initially provided for all employees,now applies only to employees hired before july.a medical insurance retirement fund permits an employee to continue participating in city health insurance program after retirement,with a portion of the premiums subsidized by city.
in,pers notified city that its retirement plan was,meaning the actuarial value of assets exceeds the present value of benefits.as a consequence,pers substantially reduced city employer contribution for fiscal year.subsequently,pers advised city that its employer contribution for fiscal years and would be zero.but city remained obligated for the other provisions of its negotiated retirement packages,and it continued to fund at least a portion of those other benefits through the retirement tax override contained in the charter.
plaintiffs howard jarvis taxpayers association and one of its members,charles scheid,filed this suit.scheid is a huntington beach resident who paid the property tax override under protest.the complaint seeks a refund of that portion of scheid fiscal year tax override payment that is attributable to retirement benefits,and a declaration prohibiting huntington beach from levying a tax override for retirement benefits not already being provided to employees in june.
after trial,the court ruled in plaintiffs favor,concluding that the voters of huntington beach did not intend their approval of the retirement provisions of the charter to commit the city to an indebtedness for future enhancements in the type or level of city employee retirement benefits beyond those to which city employees were entitled at the time of the election.italics added.the court explained that t he indebtedness approved by huntington beach voters prior to july,when they adopted measure d,was an indebtedness to continue providing all retired,current,and future city employees with the retirement benefits to which city employees were entitled at the time of the election,either through pers or some other singular retirement system,subject of course to any requirements imposed from time to time by the state legislature.at the time of the election,the city was providing a pers pension to all its employees and a pers survivors benefit to its firefighters.consequently,in the absence of what it viewed as voter approval for the subsequently added retirement enhancements,the court concluded that allowing city to levy an excess tax to fund those enhancements violated proposition.
discussion 
interpretation of charter 
city challenges what it calls the trial court cramped interpretation of the charter language in its finding that the voters did not intend their approval of the new charter to commit the city to an indebtedness for future enhancements in the type or level of city employee retirement benefits beyond those to which city employees were entitled at the time of the election.it contends that this conclusion is supported by neither the text of the charter nor its legislative history.rather,it argues,charter language stating it may impose excess taxes to satisfy its obligations for the retirement system clearly shows the voters empowered city to levy an excess tax to pay for any retirement benefit.city position does not persuade.
we review measures adopted by the voters in the same manner as we interpret statutes see hermosa beach stop oil coalition city of hermosa beach th,d,using a de novo standard be western truck exchange th,d.when statutory language is clear and unambiguous,we need not construe its meaning.downen city of hawaiian gardens redevelopment agency th,d.although we regard the language plainly not to support city position,its interpretation is plausible if looking at the language in a vacuum.therefore,because the provisions of the charter arguably are ambiguous,we will engage in statutory construction.ibid.
in interpreting the charter,our charge is to give effect to the intent of the voters adopting it.diamond international boas d.to do so,we must read the language to harmonize with the object and purpose of the new charter.id.at.we construe the words from the perspective of the voters,attributing the usual,ordinary,and commonsense meaning to them we do not interpret them in a technical sense or as terms of art.ibid.
city construction of the charter violates these principles in several respects.throughout its brief it emphasizes the language that provides for an excess tax sufficient to pay for all obligations of the retirement system city then strains the language well beyond its plain meaning by concluding that obligations are the exact equivalent of benefits,stating,approval to pay all obligations obviously reflects the fact that retirement obligations,change over time.italics omitted.a more accurate reading is all obligations,obligations being the operative word.italics added.city obligations do not include benefits added after proposition.
city of watsonville merrill d.watsonville is illustrative.contrary to city claim,watsonville did not approve an excess tax to pay for benefits increased after the effective date of proposition.the case did mention that the city contracts with pers had been amended several times,the last after proposition.but,as plaintiffs correctly point out,there are many reasons pers contracts are amended other than an increase in benefits.moreover,watsonville found the additional tax in dispute was necessary to discharge the city obligation to pers.id.at,italics added.nothing was said about added benefits.
city relies on carman alvord cal d,carman to support its interpretation.however,it is not persuasive when considered in the factual context of our case.there,in the voters approved a measure for the city to fully participate in the state sponsored retirement system,making the city employees members of the system.id.at,fn.the city was empowered to levy and collect annually,as contemplated in the statewide statute,a special tax sufficient to raise the amount estimated by the city council to be required to meet the city obligations to the retirement system.id.at,fn.omitted.after proposition was passed,the plaintiff challenged the levy of a tax in excess of the percent maximum to fund the amount due pers.on appeal,the court found the tax was permissible because it was an i ndebtedness approved by the voters prior to july.cal,art.xiii a,subd.b subdivision b.
city stresses the finding in carman that by approving the city participation in pers and by authorizing a special tax to fund contributions,the voters n ecessarily approved all indebtedness to employees,current and future,that would be incurred.carman,supra,cal d at.under the facts in carman,that was a logical determination.but the conclusion city draws from that holding is not.
it contends the huntington beach voters obviously understood in that city retirement benefits would not remain static and asserts that the rationale in carman as to new employees applies with equal force to benefits added thereafter.however,nothing in carman authorizes an excess levy for new benefits extended after the passage of proposition,even for employees hired before that date.in fact,it supports the opposite conclusion.
the carman court determined that subdivision b did not exempt only traditional,fixed,debt for borrowed funds as the plaintiff had asserted.carman,supra,cal d at.nor was it restricted to indebtedness which was fixed and certain when approved.id.at,fn.instead,the court noted,subdivision b speaks only of the time of approval,not the time an indebtedness is incurred or accrues.ibid.however,when the voters empowered the city to offer the pension plan provided by pers,they authorized the special tax set by statute insofar as necessary to fund the obligations.citation.id.at,italics added.
city seeks to avoid proposition by entering into contracts with added benefits funded through or in connection with a retirement system,classify them as previously approved obligations,and then levy an excess tax to pay for them.carman cautioned against this,prohibiting voter approval,given before proposition,to incur any government expense deemed desirable from year to year and to tax accordingly.carman,supra,cal d at,fn.it explained that subdivision b phrase interest and redemption charges denotes no more or less than the sums from time to time necessary to avoid default on obligations to pay money,including those for pensions.carman,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.the purpose of subdivision b is to prevent the impairment of contracts approved by the voters in reliance upon the power of the district to levy the tax necessary to fulfill that contract.citation.county of shasta county of trinity d,italics added.thus,carman upheld only a levy for a narrowly defined purpose that necessarily would give rise to payment obligations in the future.carman,supra,cal d at,fn.
here,city position is a far cry from narrowly defined.in the trial court,city asserted that the new charter language gives it the right to levy an excess tax for virtually anything,including giv ing a house to every employee as they retire as long as it a retirement related purpose.city construction of the exception created by subdivision b eviscerates proposition.as one court explained in another context,if we were to accept the city interpretation,we would be turning proposition on its head,by narrowly construing the requirements and broadly construing the statutory exceptions to it.citation.shapiro san diego city council th,d.
city obligation as authorized by the voters at the time proposition became effective was to participate in a retirement system.it was not to provide every benefit requested by city employees or advocated by the city council.assume that the obligation was to provide a transportation system for employees,and toyotas or buicks were offered at the time proposition was enacted.no one could reasonably say city was later authorized to levy an excess tax to provide ferraris.yet that philosophy is what city would have us validate.
under city interpretation,it would have virtually unfettered power to spend whatever sum of money and levy excess taxes to obtain the revenue,as long as the expenditure was designated retirement.this was one of the very things proposition was enacted to combat.and the voters of huntington beach obviously favored fetters on city taxing power.simultaneously with approving the new charter,percent of them voted in favor of proposition.
we must understand proposition to be able to properly construe the charter.the proposition ballot pamphlet stated the measure was directed against spendthrift politicians and as r estor ing government of,for and by the people.citation.kennedy wholesale,state bd.of equalization cal d.further,its purpose was to achieve statewide control over escalating local property tax rates.city of rancho cucamonga mackzum d,d.its raison was to limit municipalities taxing power.
subdivision b,which allows for an excess tax necessary to pay for i ndebtedness approved by the voters prior to july,is an exception to the stringent restrictions of proposition.an exception to the main premise of a statute is to be strictly construed.citation.people superior court th,d.thus,city right to tax is subject to the statewide prohibition on excess taxes.centex real estate city of vallejo th,d.
city misses the mark when it asserts there is no evidence to support the trial court finding the voters intended to freeze the status quo when they adopted the new charter.first,we do not read the trial court ruling the way city presents it.more importantly,the argument begs the question.the issue is not whether the voters expressly intended to maintain the status quo or limit retirement benefits to those in existence at the time the new charter was enacted.the voters did not have to specifically intend to limit the benefits proposition did that.for any obligations not approved prior to proposition,the tax is automatically capped,regardless of the charter or the voters intent.instead,the voters must intend to authorize a tax in excess of the percent limit for a specific obligation.subd.b.preexisting obligations are the exception to proposition therefore,they must be specific,real,and existing.if they are not,the tax is barred.
likewise,proposition prohibits a finding that the voters intended to authorize city to levy a retirement tax in an amount equal to that in effect in june,as city suggests.the voters never approved the amount of the tax.and subdivision b speaks of approval of the indebtedness,not the tax.
city maintains the electorate would not have given it discretion to provide new retirement benefits,while at the same time denying it the right to levy an excess tax to pay for them.after all,it continues,the voters knew they would have to pay for those benefits somehow.if their intent was to limit taxing authority,the voters would have specified that limit.
but the voters had no opportunity to set a limit.they did not write the language,nor were they given a choice between provisions with or without limitations.and,as we have noted,the voters did not have to intend to or specifically limit the tax it was limited by proposition.
moreover,the words of the charter suggest the voters did intend to limit the authority to tax the operative language is in a section of the charter entitled tax limits.i t is well established that chapter and section headings of an act may properly be considered in determining legislative intent citation,and are entitled to considerable weight.citation.citations.people hull cal th,d.it is consistent with the remaining provisions of the charter to interpret this section title to mean the voters did not intend to give city carte blanche to levy a property tax in excess of percent to pay for all new retirement benefits.
city also argues the voters must have intended the tax to pay for retirement obligations to also fund the reasonable compensation and fringe benefits authorized by the new charter.we disagree.yes,the charter gives city the right to provide fringe benefits and compensation but it does not obligate it to provide additional retirement benefits.city may provide these benefits it just can not fund them using an excess levy.rather,the employer can provide for the indebtedness in varying ways.carman,supra,cal d at.
nor is city correct in its assertion that the voters are presumed to have known that the pers contracts had frequently been amended before.the presumption that when voters approve initiatives they are aware of existing laws and judicial construction thereof in re lance cal d,fn,does not extend to factual information such as amendments to contracts.
additionally,the language of the charter does not lend itself to city construction.as a rule,courts should not presume an intent to legislate by implication.citation.lubner city of los angeles th,d.f or a consequence to be implied from a statute there must be greater justification for its inclusion than a consistency or compatibility with the act from which it is implied.a necessary implication within the meaning of the law is one that is so strong in its probability that the contrary thereof can not reasonably be supposed.woodland joint unified school dist.commission on professional competence th,d,italics omitted.that condition is absent here.likewise,we reject as pure speculation city claim that if the voters had intended to limit the taxing power,someone,the employee association,would have objected.
the distinction city draws between payments to a retirement system and for a retirement system is of no consequence.contrary to its argument,paying for a retirement system is not the equivalent of approval to tax for benefits offered after june.so,too,city interpretation of the charter term retirement system as something constantly changing does not translate to voter authorization of a tax to pay for benefits.
city challenges what it describes as t he only factual support for the decision,that the proposals relating to retirement were grouped together as part of proposition d,described in the voter pamphlet as housekeeping provisions.it complains the trial court unstated premise is that a provision authorizing an excess tax to pay for future retirement benefits would have been sufficiently controversial to warrant separate submission to the voters.that is not how we see it.
rather,for us to find the voters intended to provide unrestricted power to tax for anything classified as a retirement benefit,the ballot measure or the voter pamphlet had to make such an explanation.courts may assume the ballot materials reflected the voters intent in passing the new charter.traders sports,city of san leandro th,d.here,nothing in proposition d or the voter information package addressed tax authority.absent some indication that the voters were aware of and intended that result,we can not adopt a construction that would require that result.woo superior court th,d.
city devotes several pages to a discussion of the intent of the charter revision commission and the city council in drafting the new charter language.it stresses,for example,the change from the draft that it would participate in pers or several different systems,to the final rendition presented to the voters authorizing city to participate in a retirement system.it interprets this language to mean the voters gave it authority to select the type of plan and how to fund it,including the excess tax.but,except in certain rare circumstances citation,the validity of legislative acts must be measured by the terms of the legislation itself,and not by the motives of,or influences upon,the legislators who enacted the measure.citations.neecke city of mill valley th,d.nothing in the record shows the issue of flexibility was presented to the voters,either in the voter material or in proposition d itself.and we can not consider something not before the voters.see carman,supra,cal d at,fn,drafter explanation of intent does not govern our determination of how the voters understood the provision.
in sum,subdivision b is a safety net it is not an open checkbook.city expansive interpretation can not be reconciled with proposition,which change d the previous system of real property taxation and tax procedure by imposing important limitations upon the assessment and taxing powers of state and local government.amador valley joint union high sch.dist.state bd.of equalization cal d.nor does authorization to participate in a retirement system constitute a prior obligation.the term indebtedness has no rigid or fixed meaning,but rather must be construed in every case in accord with its context.citations.carman,supra,cal d at.in this case,indebtedness does not encompass benefits city added after the passage of proposition.
motion for new trial 
city contends the judgment must be reversed,because it requires an impossibility,pers calculation of the pre and benefits.in the alternative,it suggests a new trial on that issue alone.we deny plaintiffs motion to strike the parts of city brief dealing with this issue.
in support of its motion for new trial,city submitted two declarations of ronald seeling,the chief actuary of pers.he opined that there would be no practical means to calculate what the city pers employer contribution rate would have been during fy had the city provided only those benefits in existence prior to july.he further stated that even determining what portion of the employer contributions is attributable to benefits existing at july,would impose an exceedingly onerous burden on pers.he advised the calculations would have to be done by hand because the necessary information was not in the database.
however,the amended judgment does not require city to make those calculations for any years before.therefore,any calculations needed to limit the tax to existing benefits are prospective only.
in denying the motion for new trial,the court discounted this contention,stating the court heard the evidence.the court feels that the city has acted improperly t he argument that this is an impossible situation for pers or the city to resolve,the court really is buying it.i t would be improper not to give the relief requested because the city or pers is going to have some difficulty in trying to mathematically go back and do what the order requires.
the trial court has broad discretion in ruling on a motion for new trial,and we will not reverse absent an abuse of discretion.sherman kinetic concepts,th,d.our review of the record persuades us the court properly exercised its discretion.
statute of limitations 
city contends the declaratory relief claim is barred by the statute of limitations set out in revenue and taxation code section.that section provides that a taxpayer may file a declaratory relief action where an illegal or unconstitutional tax directly results from a change in the statute or administrative regulations enacted no more than months before the date the complaint is filed.thus,city argues,plaintiffs action filed in december was more than years overdue.
plaintiffs counter that the change in the law triggering the illegal tax was the ordinance city passed in august levying the retirement tax override at issue.we agree.a city ordinance is the equivalent of a municipal statute citation.california aviation council city of ceres th,d.the action was filed within six months of enactment of the ordinance and is timely.
modification of judgment 
in an action seeking refund of taxes levied by a city and collected by the county on the city behalf,any judgment rendered for an assessee shall be entered exclusively against the county.taxes were collected by defendant county of orange,and it must refund the overpayment.
disposition 
the judgment is modified to direct entry of judgment for refund of the overpayment of tax to charles scheid against the county of orange pursuant to revenue and taxation code section,and,as so modified,the judgment is affirmed.respondents are awarded their costs on appeal.
i respectfully dissent.i believe our supreme court exegesis of the application of proposition to city obligations in carman alvord cal d,should inform the analysis of huntington beach retirement benefits in this case.since i am unconvinced by my colleagues attempt to distinguish carman,i have no choice but to dissent.
in carman alvord,supra,cal d,carman,our supreme court held that a city future obligations under its pension plan constituted the type of indebtedness approved by the voters which qualifies as an exception to the property tax limitation of proposition.in carman,the voters of the city of san gabriel had approved the city participation in pers in,and empowered the city to levy and collect annually,as contemplated in the statewide statute,a special tax sufficient to raise the amount estimated by the city council to be required to meet the obligations of said city to said retirement system.id.at.in the wake of california passage of proposition,a taxpayer brought a class action alleging that the city continued levy of an excess tax to fund the retirement system was in violation of article xiii a of the california constitution.
the court explained that c ourts construe constitutional phrases liberally and practically where possible they avoid a literalism that effects absurd,arbitrary,or unintended results.carman,supra,at.it then based its conclusion the pension plan was unobjectionable on two bases subdivision b focus on voter approval implies a concern that irrevocable,obligations,solemnly approved by local electorates and entered on faith in taxing powers then available,not be frustrated by a revolutionary tax limitation imposed from outside the community.citations.it also implies a recognition that failure to create a prior debt exception might lead to problems under the federal contract clause.id.at.
however,the court made clear that the impairment of contract issue was not its paramount concern,and specifically held that the special tax levy could be applied even to benefits voluntarily offered to employees hired after the effective date of proposition.it might be argued that contract clause problems do not arise as to employees hired after the effective date of article xiii a,since they perhaps did not enter service in reliance on city power to levy the special tax.yet we see no reason to carve an exception for such persons.we may not assume that subdivision b sought to force local governments to the complex calculations necessary to separate their obligations to pre and employees.article xiii a exempts interest and redemption charges on any indebtedness previously approved by the electors.san gabriel voters in obviously understood that subsequently hired employees too would be covered.carman,supra,cal d at,fn.
the court also expressly rejected the suggestion that proposition exception applied only to indebtedness which was fixed and certain at the time of voter approval,noting that the subdivision imposes no such restriction.it speaks only of the time of approval,not the time an indebtedness is incurred or accrues.carman,supra,cal d at,fn.
in this case,the issue is not whether the excess tax may be levied to cover benefits offered to subsequently hired employees an issue which respondents understandably concede in light of carman,but whether it may be levied to cover the subsequently added benefits.under the circumstances of this case,i conclude the supreme court reasoning in carman establishes that it may.
first,i can not accept respondents suggestion that the inclusion of the retirement provisions within the noncontroversial proposition d portion of the proposed charter concludes the analysis.i am not convinced by respondents insistence that inclusion somehow indicates that neither the city council nor the voters could have intended to give the council authority to impose taxes for additional retirement benefits negotiated in the future.as the city points out,there is no substantial evidence to support that conclusion.in fact,the city authority to levy a special tax to fund its retirement system was already a part of its charter,and although the city was restricted by t
