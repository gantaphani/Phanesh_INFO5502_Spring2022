on summary judgment,the united states court of federal claims held that nationsbank of texas,acting as independent executor of the estate of ellen clayton garwood,deceased,could not recover estate taxes.nationsbank united states,fed.cl.because the court of federal claims correctly held that section of title xiii of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of,stat,obra,is constitutional,this court affirms.
the federal estate tax law imposes a tax on the transfer of decedents estates.the rate schedule at c sets the amount of the tax.the economic recovery tax act of,stat,contained a scheduled reduction in maximum estate tax rates from the rate of seventy percent down to fifty percent over four years.when the top rate was percent,the deficit reduction act of,stat,extended that rate through.later the omnibus budget reconciliation act of,a,stat,further extended the top rate of percent until january.
in late,congress passed legislation to extend the percent rate again,but did not present it to the president within ten days of adjournment.president bush did not sign it,instead using a pocket veto under article i,section,clause of the constitution.thus,the percent rate lapsed on january.the highest rate defaulted to the previously scheduled rate.
when ellen clayton garwood died in march,with a gross estate of,the applicable estate tax rate was fifty percent.on august,president clinton signed obra into law.section of title xiii of obra amended c,permanently increasing the estate tax rate for the transfer of taxable estates over back to the percent rate.obra also made the rate increase retroactive to include the estates of decedents who died on or after january.under these provisions,garwood estate fell subject to the percent rate.
nationsbank sought a refund of,the difference in tax paid under the retroactively applied percent rate and the former fifty percent rate in effect on the date of garwood death.in its complaint filed in the court of federal claims,nationsbank asserted that obra retroactive rate increase violated several provisions of the constitution,including the separation of powers doctrine,the apportionment clause,the ex post facto clause,the takings clause,the due process clause,and the equal protection clause.on the government summary judgment motion,the court of federal claims addressed counts one through six of nationsbank complaint and held that obra did not violate the constitution.nationsbank,fed.cl.at.the parties then stipulated to the dismissal of count seven,the only remaining count,and the court of federal claims dismissed the complaint.nationsbank appeals.this court has jurisdiction under a.
this court reviews the court of federal claims grant of summary judgment without deference.abrahamsen united states.summary judgment is appropriate where the record shows no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.the determination of the constitutionality of a statute is a question of law,which this court reviews without deference.demko united states.
article i,section,clause of the constitution requires presentation of a bill to the president.that clause also states 
if any bill shall not be returned by the president within ten days sundays excepted after it shall have been presented to him,the same shall be a law,in like manner as if he had signed it,unless the congress by their adjournment prevent its return,in which case it shall not be a law.
const.art.i,cl.as described above,president bush did not sign a bill to extend the percent rate beyond january.because congress prevented return of the bill by adjourning,president bush pocket vetoed the bill under article i,section,clause.
obra made the percent rate retroactive to january,which had the same effect as if president bush had signed the bill presented to him in.however,obra did not abrogate the president pocket veto power.obra was separate from the bill that the president pocket vetoed in.obra independently met the constitutional requirements for enactment,namely passage by both houses of congress and approval by the president.nothing in the constitution prohibits a new congress,or even the same congress,from reenacting defeated legislation.this principle applies as well to legislation rejected by a pocket veto.united states weil.article i,section,clause of the constitution prohibits enactment of a bill not presented in time.article i,however,does not prohibit congress from reintroducing and passing again the same subject matter in another bill.moreover the second bill may have a retroactive effect.therefore,section does not violate the separation of powers doctrine.
the apportionment clause states no capitation,or other direct,tax shall be laid,unless in proportion to the census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken.const.art.i,cl.a tax is direct if levied directly upon property,such as an ad valorem tax on a decedent estate it is not direct if levied on the transfer of property from one person to another.fernandez wiener.the federal estate tax is not imposed on the property itself,but rather on the transfer of property at the time of death.therefore,the estate tax is not a direct tax.id.
the retroactive application of the increased rate in this case did not change the estate tax from an indirect to a direct tax.the lower rate was in effect at the time of the actual property transfer.notably,garwood estate was subject to a fifty percent tax rate at the time of her death.section,however,did not impose a new tax on property already transferred,but merely increased the rate of the indirect tax on the transfer which had occurred earlier.the increase in the rate,even applied retroactively,does not change the character of the estate tax from a tax to a direct tax.the tax is still a tax on the transfer of property.see milliken united states.a mere increase in the tax did not change its character first bank united states.therefore,section does not violate the apportionment clause.
the constitution prohibits enactment of an ex post facto law.const.art.i,cl.this prohibition,however,applies solely to criminal enactments.calder bull,dall.the supreme court decision in burgess salmon,does not make section criminal in nature and thus within the ex post facto prohibition.in burgess,the supreme court stated to impose upon the owner of the goods a criminal punishment or a penalty for not paying a retroactive tobacco tax increase before the tax became effective would subject the owner to the operation of an ex post facto law.id.accordingly,the court held that the tax increase was unconstitutional because the government could have brought a criminal action against the taxpayer for not paying the increased taxes before the tax became effective.id.at.at the outset,the taxpayer in this case has timely paid the tax and seeks a refund.thus,the taxpayer is not subject to any criminal penalty.in this sense,this case is significantly different from burgess.
although the tax code does contain many provisions eventually subjecting recalcitrant taxpayers to criminal liability for refusing to pay taxes,the entire tax code is not criminal in nature.if the entire tax code were criminal,every retroactive tax law would become an unconstitutional ex post facto enactment.to the contrary,the supreme court has acknowledged congress constitutional authority to enact retroactive tax laws.see,united states carlton,d.
in burgess,the statute imposed criminal penalties on taxpayers who refused to pay increased taxes on goods shipped before enactment of the tax increase.at.the taxpayers in burgess sought a refund of the increased amount of the tax because they could not have avoided the increase on goods already shipped.id.at.thus,the burgess taxpayers could not avoid potential criminal penalties.unlike the taxpayer in burgess,nationsbank could have,and did,avoid any possibility of criminal sanctions.nationsbank timely paid the additional tax and brought a refund suit.the government could only have imposed criminal sanctions on nationsbank if nationsbank had committed criminal fraud after the enactment of obra.
this court notes that the dis
