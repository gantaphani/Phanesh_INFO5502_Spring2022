the city of industry and the city of livermore appeal a judgment dismissing without prejudice their petition in intervention for a writ of mandate against the state board of equalization sbe.industry and livermore sought the reallocation of local sales tax revenues in administrative proceedings before the sbe.the sbe allocation group issued a decision in favor of industry and livermore and against the city of fillmore,and later issued a supplemental decision.after the time to appeal had passed with no appeal,fillmore sought to appeal the supplemental decision.the allocation group decided to refer the matter to the sbe appeals division to consider fillmore appeal.
industry and livermore petitioned the trial court to compel the sbe to implement the supplemental decision,alleging that the supplemental decision is final and the sbe has no jurisdiction to consider an untimely appeal.the trial court concluded that it could not interfere with the ongoing administrative review proceedings and therefore sustained fillmore demurrer to the petition without leave to amend based on the failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
we conclude that industry and livermore need not await the completion of the administrative review proceedings before seeking relief in court.after deciding this threshold question,we also conclude that the supplemental decision is final and that industry and livermore are entitled to a writ of mandate compelling the sbe to implement the supplemental decision.
factual and procedural background 
administrative proceedings 
livermore and industry filed petitions with the sbe to reallocate local sales tax revenues.they argued that fillmore and certain retailers had devised a means to divert sales tax revenues away from neighboring cities where the taxable business activities actually occurred by setting up sham offices in fillmore and claiming that the taxable business activities occurred in fillmore.
the sbe allocation group issued a decision on august,stating that sales by a particular taxpayer did not occur in fillmore and that the sales tax revenues allocated to fillmore for the fourth quarter of would be reallocated.the decision stated that fillmore could appeal the decision within days by requesting an appeals conference.the allocation group sent a letter to the taxpayer on august,explaining its decision.on august,fillmore requested a day extension to respond to the decision.the allocation group granted the extension as requested.
fillmore,through its outside counsel,appealed the decision by the allocation group and requested an appeals conference in a letter dated september.fillmore letter referred to the allocation group letter of august,as a supplemental decision.the allocation group stated in a letter dated october,that the matter was being forwarded to the appeals division and that an appeals conference would be scheduled.the letter included a summary analysis explaining the decision by the allocation group.the allocation group sent another letter dated november,confirming that the matter had been forwarded to the appeals division and that an appeals conference would be scheduled.the letter also stated that fillmore appeal had not presented any new information that would cause the allocation group to change its position 
the sbe notified the parties on or about january,of an appeals conference scheduled for february.fillmore,through its outside counsel,requested a continuance to early april in a letter dated january.the sbe notified fillmore in a letter dated january,that the appeals conference has been cancelled because it was scheduled prematurely.the letter stated that the dispute had been referred back to the allocation group so it can issue the supplemental decision required by california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision b.petitioner or any notified jurisdiction may thereafter appeal the supplemental decision by filing an objection with the allocations group within days of the date of the mailing of the supplemental decision,tit,subds.b c.if a timely objection is submitted,the petition will be forwarded to the case management section to schedule a conference.
the allocation group issued a supplemental decision on february,granting the petitions for reallocation.the supplemental decision specified the amounts of sales tax revenues to be reallocated from fillmore to livermore,industry,and other cities and explained in greater detail than the prior summary analysis the basis for the decision.the supplemental decision stated that any party objecting to the supplemental decision must submit a written objection within days after the date of the supplemental decision,pursuant to california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision b.a cover letter also stated that fillmore could appeal the supplemental decision within days.
fillmore,through its outside counsel,requested a day extension to respond to the supplemental decision in a letter dated march.the allocation group granted an extension in a letter dated march,stating that any appeal from the supplemental decision must be filed by april.
meanwhile,a dispute arose regarding fillmore legal representation.the sbe asserted that the private attorneys retained by fillmore could not represent fillmore in administrative proceedings before the sbe unless fillmore adopted a resolution pursuant to revenue and taxation code section,subdivision b certifying that the attorneys were contractually prohibited from performing consulting services for a retailer during the term of the contract ibid.taking the position that the sbe could not disclose confidential taxpayer information to the attorneys absent such a resolution by fillmore,the sbe corresponded with fillmore city officials rather than with its attorneys.
fillmore and its attorneys failed to appeal the supplemental decision by the deadline of april.accordingly,the allocation group stated in a letter to fillmore director of finance dated april,that the supplemental decision had become final 
we did not receive an appeal of our february,supplemental allocation group decision by the date specified,april,in our letter granting your request for an extension.we now consider under regulation b our proposed allocations as estimated in our supplement decision to be final.accordingly,we will process the reallocation of local tax for the fourth quarter in the amount of.
fillmore,through its outside counsel,protested in a letter dated may,stating,fillmore has a pending appeal of the reallocations for which a hearing has been promised but never granted.fillmore argued that the sbe could not summarily deny its purported appeal by declaring the supplemental decision to be final.fillmore filed a formal objection to the supplemental decision on may,and requested an appeals conference.
the allocation group referred the matter to the sbe appeals division on may,noting the existence of a dispute as to the finality of the supplemental decision.the sbe notified the parties on or about july,of an appeals conference scheduled for august.
trial court proceedings 
fillmore filed a petition in the trial court in may,seeking a writ of mandate compelling the sbe to allow fillmore to be represented by its legal counsel of choice in the reallocation proceedings.industry and livermore applied for and were granted leave to intervene in the mandamus proceedings,and filed a petition in intervention in june industry and livermore allege that the supplemental decision is final and that the sbe has no jurisdiction to conduct an appeals conference for the purpose of reconsidering its final decision.they seek a writ of mandate compelling the sbe to implement its supplemental decision by reallocating the tax proceeds for the fourth quarter of and all of,a declaration that the supplemental decision is final and that the sbe has exhausted its jurisdiction,and an injunction prohibiting the sbe from conducting an appeals conference.
industry and livermore jointly filed an opening brief in support of their petition in intervention.sbe filed only a preliminary response arguing that the supplemental decision was not final because the administrative appeal to the appeals division was still pending.fillmore filed an opposition to the opening brief,arguing that the supplemental decision was not final and that industry and livermore were not entitled to a writ of mandate in any event.
after a hearing on both fillmore petition and the petition in intervention,the trial court concluded that the parties had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and dismissed the petitions without prejudice.the court stated in a minute order 
industry and livermore ask the court to insert itself into the administrative procedure at this point and command the sbe to refrain from further processing fillmore administrative appeals because fillmore did request an appeal promptly.
until the administrative procedure has been invoked and completed,there is nothing for this court to review it can not interfere in the intermediate stages of the administrative proceeding.
the trial court entered a judgment in august dismissing without prejudice both fillmore petition and the petition in intervention filed by industry and livermore.industry and livermore timely appealed the judgment.
subsequent events 
the sbe appeals division conducted a hearing on the reallocation dispute in august.it issued its decision and recommendation on november,finding among other things that fillmore objection to the supplemental decision was untimely and that the supplemental decision therefore became final on april,as to tax reallocations for the period from october,to december.fillmore has appealed the appeals division decision to the sbe board members.
contentions 
industry and livermore contend the undisputed facts establish that fillmore failed to timely appeal the supplemental decision,so the decision is final and the sbe has no jurisdiction to reconsider the decision and they are entitled to a writ of mandate compelling the sbe to implement the supplemental decision.
discussion 
industry and livermore contend the supplemental decision is final and the sbe therefore has no jurisdiction to consider fillmore untimely administrative appeal.the finality of the supplemental decision was a question before the appeals division at the time of the trial court decision,and that same question is now under consideration in the pending administrative appeal from the appeals division decision.before we can decide the merits of this question,we first must decide who decides whether the supplemental decision is final.should the trial court,and this court,decline to decide whether the supplemental decision is final because that question is under consideration in the sbe administrative review proceedings,or should we decide that question notwithstanding the pending administrative appeal 
industry and livermore need not await the completion of the pending administrative review proceedings before seeking relief in court 
a party seeking relief for an injury for which an administrative remedy is available ordinarily must pursue relief from the administrative agency before seeking relief in court.campbell regents of university of california cal th,campbell richards department of alcoholic beverage control th.moreover,a party aggrieved by an administrative decision must exhaust any available,nonduplicative administrative review procedures before challenging the decision in court.coachella valley mosquito vector control dist.california public employment relations bd.cal th,coachella valley abelleira district court of appeal cal d,abelleira.the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine encompasses both of these requirements.see jonathan neil,jones cal th,california aviation council county of amador d.

the exhaustion requirement promotes judicial economy by affording the administrative agency an opportunity to provide the relief requested in whole or in part,so as to avoid costly litigation or reduce the scope of litigation recognizes the expertise of the agency tribunal and facilitates the development of a complete factual record,which can assist later judicial review.sierra club san joaquin local agency formation com.cal th,westlake community hosp.superior court cal d.
there are exceptions to the exhaustion requirement,including an exception where the agency authority to act,or jurisdiction,is disputed.e xhaustion of administrative remedies may be excused when a party claims that the agency lacks authority,statutory or otherwise,to resolve the underlying dispute between the parties.citations.coachella valley,supra,cal th at.thus,a party may seek relief in court without exhausting its administrative remedies or despite ongoing administrative proceedings in some circumstances if the agency jurisdiction to resolve the dispute is disputed.
coachella valley set forth three factors that a court must consider in determining whether to decide a question of the agency jurisdiction to resolve the underlying dispute before the agency proceedings have run their course the injury or burden that exhaustion will impose,the strength of the legal argument that the agency lacks jurisdiction,and the extent to which administrative expertise may aid in resolving the jurisdictional issue.citation.coachella valley,supra,cal th at.
coachella valley involved an unfair labor practice charge made to the california public employment relations board perb under the meyers milias brown act,et.acting on the charge,the perb issued an administrative complaint against an employer.the employer moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the perb lacked jurisdiction over the alleged violations because the charge was untimely,but the motion was denied.coachella valley,supra,cal th at.the employer filed a petition for writs of mandate and prohibition in the superior court,alleging that the perb had no jurisdiction to issue the complaint.the perb and the party that had made the charge argued in opposition that because the ongoing administrative proceedings were not concluded,the employer had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies.the trial court concluded that the employer was not required to exhaust its administrative remedies.id.at.the trial court therefore addressed the merits of the jurisdictional question as to the timeliness of the administrative complaint.id.at.
the california supreme court stated that the main issue was whether the limitations period for making an unfair labor practice charge to the perb under the meyers milias brown act was three years or six months.coachella valley,supra,cal th at.but first,the supreme court considered whether the employer was required to exhaust its administrative remedies by defending itself in the pending administrative proceedings before seeking relief in court.coachella valley stated that the question of the applicable limitations period implicates the perb administrative authority or jurisdiction.id.at.the supreme court set forth the test described above,concluded that all of the three factors weighed in favor of excusing the exhaustion requirement,and held that the employer failure to exhaust its administrative remedies was excused.id.at.the supreme court then addressed the merits of the jurisdictional question concerning the applicable limitations period and concluded that the limitations period was six months.id.at.
the test involves a balancing of interests and provides a guide to the exercise of judicial discretion.see pierce,administrative law treatise ed.when all three factors weigh in favor of excusing the exhaustion requirement,as in coachella valley,supra,cal th,and in security national guaranty,california coastal com.th,the answer should be easy.when the three factors point in different directions,however,the answer can be more difficult.see fn,ante see also california nevada annual conference city and county of san francisco th.
the trial court here declined to decide whether fillmore appeal from the supplemental decision was timely because the court concluded that industry and livermore must await the completion of the administrative review proceedings before seeking relief in court.if fillmore administrative appeal from the supplemental decision was untimely,however,the sbe has no jurisdiction to consider the administrative appeal.olive proration.com.agri.com.cal d,olive proration humbert castro valley county fire protection dist.d,humbert the test in coachella valley,supra,cal th,provides a means for a court to decide whether to excuse the exhaustion requirement so the court can decide such a jurisdictional question before the administrative review proceedings have run their course.we conclude that it is appropriate to apply the test in coachella valley in these circumstances.
the first factor to consider is the injury or burden that exhaustion would impose.coachella valley,supra,cal th at.industry and livermore argue that the administrative review proceedings will result in considerable delay and loss of interest on the reallocated funds.absent any regulation requiring a final decision by the sbe by a particular date,industry and livermore argue that the delay and loss of interest are indefinite.the ordinary delay and cost of pursuing an administrative remedy does not constitute an injury or burden for purposes of the test.coachella valley,supra,cal th at.we need not decide whether industry and livermore have established a cognizable injury,however,because we conclude that the second and third factors alone justify excusing the exhaustion requirement in these circumstances.
the second factor is the strength of the legal argument that the agency lacks jurisdiction.coachella valley,supra,cal th at.in our view,the argument that the supplemental decision is final because of the absence of a timely administrative appeal and that the sbe lacks jurisdiction to reconsider the decision is strong,as we discuss below.the sbe regulations and the unequivocal statements by both the allocation group and the appeals division that the supplemental decision became final strongly suggest that the decision is final.the second factor therefore weighs in favor of excusing the exhaustion requirement.
the third factor is the extent to which administrative expertise may assist in resolving the jurisdictional issue.coachella valley,supra,cal th at.we believe that judicial intervention at this time would not deprive us of the benefit of the sbe administrative expertise.the interpretation of administrative regulations and application of those regulations to the undisputed facts is a purely legal question.carmona division of industrial safety cal d.although an agency interpretation of its own regulations ordinarily is entitled to some deference,the provision here at issue concerning the time to appeal a supplemental decision does not implicate the sbe expertise or technical knowledge,so the sbe interpretation of the regulation is entitled to little,if any,deference.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,farmers ins.exchange superior court th.such a legal question is within the expertise of courts.moreover,we have the benefit of the appeals division considered opinion on this issue.see coachella valley,supra,cal th at see also pierce,administrative law treatise,supra,at thus,the third factor therefore also weighs in favor of excusing the exhaustion requirement.
considering the three factors,we conclude that,on balance,the strength of the argument that the supplemental decision has become final and thus the sbe has no jurisdiction to reconsider the decision,together with the fact that the jurisdictional question does not present any issue within the administrative expertise of the sbe,justifies excusing the exhaustion requirement.industry and livermore therefore are excused from exhausting their administrative remedies,need not await the completion of the administrative review proceedings,and instead may seek a judicial decision as to whether the supplemental decision is final.we now will proceed to address that question.
