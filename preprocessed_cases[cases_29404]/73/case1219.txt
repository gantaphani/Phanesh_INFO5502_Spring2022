robert rogers and julia kauffman the taxpayers brought this tax refund suit appealing the denial by the internal revenue service of a bad debt deduction.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the united states on the issue of the characterization of the transaction forming the basis for the requested bad debt deduction.see rogers united states,d rogers i.the taxpayers now appeal that ruling.the taxpayers also appeal the portion of a subsequent summary judgment ruling in which the district court denied them a partial refund for overpaid taxes under the doctrine of equitable recoupment.see rogers united states,d rogers ii.finally,the taxpayers appeal the district court denial of their motion to strike the reports and testimony of one of the government expert witnesses.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm the summary judgment orders of the district court and decline to address the expert witness issue.
background 
because the facts of this case were set forth at length in the district court opinion,see rogers i,d at,we will repeat them here in less detail.this case arises from a series of transactions between ewing kauffman,the deceased former owner of the kansas city royals major league baseball franchise the royals,and avron fogelman,a former part owner of the royals.in,kauffman was the sole owner of the royals,which was organized as an s corporation pursuant to internal revenue code.at that time,kauffman sold a percent interest in the team to fogelman for million.for an additional million,kauffman also sold fogelman an option to purchase kauffman remaining percent interest in the team.the option exercise price was million.in,kauffman also sold fogelman an additional percent of the each with a percent disturbing fogelman option.
beginning in,fogelman experienced severe financial difficulties in his real estate business which resulted in him owing almost billion to his creditors.his only unencumbered asset was his interest in the royals.he began negotiating with the team in order that he might use that interest to obtain cash to fund a reorganization of his other business interests.after protracted and contentious also involved major league baseball and fogelman parties reached an agreement on july.
under this agreement,as characterized by the parties involved in the transaction,kauffman lent million to the royals,which in turn lent million to fogelman.this nonrecourse loan was secured by fogelman ownership interest in the royals and his option to purchase the rest of the team.fogelman nonrecourse note to the team was due on january,unless the team was sold before that date at an auction the parties agreed to hold.in addition,fogelman granted the royals an option the kcrbc option to purchase both his share of the team and his option to buy kauffman share.
the royals exercised this option contemporaneously with the execution of the agreement on july,but deferred the closing of the option until january.under the terms of this option,the purchase price for fogelman interest would be an amount equal to the principal balance outstanding and all accrued,unpaid interest on the kcrbc loan on the kcrbc option closing date.aplts app.vol.iv,at article vii of july,kansas city royals stockholders sic agreement,setting forth terms of the kcrbc option.the parties dispute,however,what would have occurred with this option in the event that fogelman had repaid the full amount of the loan.
the auction process,conducted by morgan,was held in the fall of.as the interests of both kauffman and fogelman were for sale,the entire team was available for a minimum bid price of approximately million.although several parties initially expressed interest,there were no bidders,and morgan subsequently issued an opinion asserting that fogelman interest in the team was of only nominal value.see aplts app.vol.iii,at.
on january,the repayment date of the nonrecourse note,fogelman signed an agreement in which he transferred his royals interest to the team in lieu of its foreclosure on the note.although this was only six months after the royals had loaned million secured by this stock without recourse,made a loan assuming the stock had at least million in value,the royals claimed this collateral as being without value based on morgan assessment and subsequently deducted the full amount of the note,plus interest,as a bad debt pursuant to.because of the royals s corporation status,this loss was passed through to kauffman,who deducted it from his joint individual tax return.the internal revenue service later denied the deduction and assessed additional taxes because it determined that the transaction claimed as the basis of the bad debt question was in substance a redemption of fogelman royals stock and not a loan.after paying that assessment and mounting an unsuccessful administrative challenge,the taxpayers brought this action.
before trial,both sides moved for summary judgment on the issue of whether the transaction was properly characterized as a loan or as a sale.in response to these motions,the district court ruled that the government position in the suit was properly characterized as a substance over form argument.rogers i,d at.the court cited a number of cases in support of the proposition that i n applying this doctrine of substance over form,the supreme court has looked to the objective economic realities of a transaction rather than to the particular form the parties employed.id.quoting frank lyon united states,d citations omitted.
the district court further concluded that 
the plaintiffs attempt to characterize the transfer of million to fogelman as a debt is improper because the economic realities of the transaction,even granting the plaintiffs all the factual inferences to which they are entitled,overwhelmingly dictate the legal conclusion that a sale,or more properly,a redemption of fogelman royals stock,and not a loan,took place.
id.at emphasis added.after reviewing the facts of the case and deciding that there were no material issues remaining,the court granted summary judgment in favor of the united states on the issue of the characterization of the transaction.
in response to this ruling,the taxpayers filed a summary judgment motion to recover a refund for various tax payments they had incurred on the basis of treating the transaction as a loan and not a redemption.since any refund of these payments was barred by the statute of limitations,the taxpayers requested that the court apply the doctrine of equitable recoupment.the district court ruled partially in favor of the taxpayers and partially in favor of the government on this motion.see rogers ii,d at.
finally,the taxpayers filed a motion during the course of the litigation to strike the reports of and preclude testimony from four of the government expert witnesses.the district court denied the taxpayers motion with respect to three of the four designated experts,including andrew zimbalist.
the taxpayers now appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the government with respect to the characterization of the transaction as a sale.the taxpayers also appeal the portion of the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the government relating to the refund requested under the doctrine of equitable recoupment and the district court ruling with respect to the expert testimony of zimbalist.we now affirm the district court summary judgment orders and decline to address the issue of zimbalist expert testimony.
ii.discussion 
characterization of the transaction on summary.standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard as the district court under.c.david city county of denver,cir.we must resolve factual disputes and draw inferences in favor of the taxpayers,who are the nonmoving party.summary judgment is warranted only if the uncontroverted material facts establish that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.
the applicable legal standard 
on appeal,the taxpayers emphatically assert that the district court applied an incorrect legal standard in granting summary judgment.they argue for the application of a tax shelter doctrine called the substantive economic although the government originally sought summary judgment under the economic substance doctrine the taxpayers state that the district court incorrectly concluded that the government argument was properly characterized as a substance over form argument when the court decided that the substantive sham and substance over form doctrines constituted separate and distinct doctrines.aplts br.at.the taxpayers characterize this as mistaken.id.at.no distinction,they contend,exists between the substantive sham and substance over form doctrines.as a matter of law,they are the same.id.at.
in support of this proposition,the taxpayers cite bohrer commissioner,cir.in bohrer,this court stated that in gregory helvering,the supreme court focused on substance over form and held that the transaction upon its face lies outside the plain intent of the statute and would not generate the desired tax benefits.the disallowance of sham transactions has since been applied in a variety of contexts.bohrer,at quoting gregory,at.citation omitted.the taxpayers argue that bohrer thus recognized no distinction between the economic substance and substance over form doctrines.
under either of these doctrines,they propose,a court may not inquire into the substance of a transaction unless it first determines that the transaction was a sham,that is,not bona fide.aplts br.at.in essence,they argue that only a transaction lacking any business purpose may be recharacterized by the government for tax purposes.the taxpayers state that a transaction which has practical economic effects other than tax avoidance must be upheld if it has a business purpose or economic substance which is compelled or encouraged by business or regulatory realities and is imbued with tax independent considerations and is not shaped by tax avoidance features that have meaningless labels attached,or it objectively affects the taxpayer net economic position.id.at quoting james commissioner,cir.the taxpayers also contend that there is no difference between business purpose and economic substance.as the transaction that is challenged in this case resulted in the parties having a different set of legal relationships than before the loan,the taxpayers conclude that the cited cases require the transaction to be deemed a loan.id.at.no other court,they boldly assert,has rewritten or allowed the government to disregard a transaction unless it was designed to manipulated sic the tax code to create tax deductions.id.at citing northern indiana pub.serv.commissioner,cir.put another way,their argument is that if a transaction has economic substance or a business purpose of any kind,its form may not be recharacterized.
in response,the government states that i f the sole purpose of a transaction is to create tax deductions,that is sufficient reason to disregard it for tax purposes.but,the government continues,
the absence of such a purpose does not establish,as taxpayers would have it,that the form of the transaction has economic substance and therefore must be respected for tax purposes.the doctrine of substance over form is a fundamental principle of the tax laws that has application whenever tax consequences turn on the true nature of a transaction.
aple br.at.in support,the government cites several cases,including united states phellis.riley commissioner,cir and hamlin trust commissioner,cir.
the government also distinguishes several cases cited by the taxpayers.for example,the government contends that the northern indiana decision was a far cry from holding,as taxpayer contends,that the doctrine applies only where the transaction is first held to be a sham instead,the government claims that case only held that a foreign subsidiary corporation and the form of its transactions are recognizable for tax purposes,despite any motive,so long as the corporation engages in bona fide business transactions.aple br.at quoting northern indiana,at.the government states that the t axpayers attempt to bootstrap limitations on the sham transaction doctrine into limitations on the doctrine simply is misconceived.id.
it is evident that the distinctions among the judicial standards which may be used in ex post facto challenges to particular tax as the substance over form,substantive substance,and business purpose not vast.indeed,one academic commentator has described them as fairly gossamer.see martin mcmahon,random thoughts on applying judicial doctrines to interpret the internal revenue code,smu.another article characterizes these doctrines as closely related to one another.see joseph bankman,the economic substance doctrine,cal.nevertheless,for several reasons,we can not agree with the taxpayers assertion that there is no difference among these doctrines.
first,the bulk of the academic literature on the subject indicates that there are meaningful differences in the practical applications of the doctrines.for example,one commentator states 
the major purpose of the doctrine is to recharacterize transactions in accordance with their true nature.the economic substance doctrine,in contrast,seeks to deny tax benefits on the ground that the basis for the transaction is insufficient to warrant application of those benefits.
john warner,statutory,regulatory,and common law weapons.supporting this distinction,another author argues that in considering challenges to real world transactions,transactions that are not economic shams,a tax analysis 
attempts to divine the substance of the transaction to determine whether the form adopted properly reflects the substance.if so,the consequences expected to result from the form will in fact obtain.if not,the transaction may be recast with tax consequences appropriate to the substance and not the form.as noted,the can benefit the government or taxpayers.
peter canellos,a tax practitioner perspective on substance,form and business purpose in structuring business transactions and in tax shelters,smu.in contrast,in considering transactions attacked as mere tax shelters,the same article states that this refined substance over form analysis is secondary.the court analysis focuses first on the of the transaction seeking to determine whether they truly arose from business exigencies or from attempts to generate unreasonable tax benefits.id.in other words,the court does not apply the substance over form analysis where the transaction is not bona fide rather,if the transaction lacks economic reality,it is analyzed using the economic substance doctrine.these articles indicate both that there is a distinction between substance over form and economic substance and that the district court was correct to characterize the government position as a substance over form attack.see also bankman,the economic substance doctrine,cal.at the author statement that a d etailed discussion of other doctrines,including substance over form,is beyond the scope of an article on economic substance makes clear that there are distinctions between the two.
additionally,we take note of a comprehensive analysis performed by the department of the treasury that delineates the difference between the substance over form and economic substance doctrines.see of the treasury,the problem of corporate tax shelters discussion,analysis and legislative proposals discussing the judicial responses available when addressing tax avoidance schemes hereinafter the treasury department white paper.the treasury department white paper envisions the appropriateness of applying the substance over form doctrine in a case like the present one while reserving the economic substance analysis for situations where the economic realities of a transaction are insignificant in relation to the tax benefits of the transaction 
second,the doctrine of substance over form has been recognized in a number of our precedents.for example,in true united states,cir,we held that substance over form was a fundamental tax principle,and applied it to look beyond the taxpayers characterization of the challenged business transactions.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.in kornfeld commissioner,cir,we observed that t he taxation scheme set out in the internal revenue code is complicated and the tax consequences of many transactions depend on form,how the transaction is structured,but that at the same time,the incidence of taxation depends on the substance of a transaction.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.and in united states scott,cir,we stated that t he income tax consequences under the internal revenue code depend upon the substance of the situation,not the form.id.at citing diedrich commissioner,d see also riley,at cir.
third,we disagree that the cases cited by the taxpayers are sufficient to establish that this court has,as they put it,recogniz ed no distinction between the substantive sham and substance over form doctrines,presumably for purposes of stare decisis.aplts br.at.bohrer passing reference to substance over form can hardly be characterized as supporting the taxpayers argument,much less as having sufficiently articulate d a point of law to mandate the respect of subsequent panels.see united states meyers,cir.moreover,even if it had somehow abolished any distinction between the economic substance and substance over form doctrines,bohrer would then conflict with earlier panel decisions applying substance over form,riley,and earlier decisions prevail in the case of an conflict.see haynes williams,cir.bohrer therefore provides an insufficient foundation for the taxpayers argument.and while james could support the taxpayers position if one assumes there is no difference between the doctrines of substance over form and economic substance,it more clearly fits neatly into the category of tax shelter cases described by the academic other words,those that apply the economic substance test when the transaction was entered into only to create a tax loss.james is thus as damaging to the taxpayers argument as it is supportive 
but perhaps the clearest discussion we have found elucidating the differences between these doctrines was not supplied by the parties in their briefs but by the district court in its order.judge lungstrum,during his discussion of the differences,references a number of cases and authors.see rogers i,d at.one of the cited authors,david hariton,discusses the means by which the,by extension,the challenge characterizations of tax related transactions.hariton specifies three separate methods that may be used by the commissioner to mete out equitable tax outcomes.they are applying subjective rules set out in the statutes and regulations the form of the transaction under the substance over form doctrine and applying the economic substance doctrine in cases where the economic or business purpose of a transaction is relatively insignificant in relation to the comparatively large tax benefits.see david hariton,sorting out the tangle of economic substance,tax law,see also treasury department white paper at.speaking of the substance over form option,hariton notes 
the second way in which the commissioner can challenge technical results is through a recharacterization of the form of the transaction standards must govern the factual characterization of relationships and arrangements to some extent,and the commissioner must have the ability to challenge the taxpayer description of the relevant the taxpayer advantage would be insurmountable.
hariton,sorting out the tangle of economic substance,tax law.at.by recharacterizing the way in which the taxpayer has designated the form of the transaction,the commissioner and the courts are thus able to apply the appropriate objective rules to the transaction.
this method is distinct from the economic substance doctrine,and it is applicable here.the transaction in question was not an attempted tax shelter entered into for the creation of tax losses,a mere sham devoid of economic substance.since the transaction clearly had economic consequences,application of the economic substance doctrine is not appropriate.rather,this is a case in which the taxpayers seek to characterize a substantive transaction as one thing rather than another and force the this accept the automatic consequences of the characterization.as hariton article points out,however,it is not up to the taxpayers to have the final say on how it is characterized.
we reminded the plaintiffs at oral argument of abe lincoln riddle that has now become a dictum in the sense of that word how many legs does a dog have if you call a tail a leg the answer is four,because calling a tail a leg does not make it one.this not a be treated by the tax code under objective standards based on its form.accordingly,and in light of the aforementioned reasoning,we hold that the district court correctly identified the substance over form doctrine as the legal standard governing the transaction characterization for tax purposes.
grant of summary judgment 
arguments of the parties 
the taxpayers further contend that the district court grant of summary judgment was improper because a sufficient factual dispute remained with respect to the substance of the nonrecourse loan transaction.
they first suggest that the loan was valid because the debt was bona fide.the district court,they argue,found that both parties in this case agreed that the value of the collateral on the loan date exceeded the loan amount,which would normally indicate that the debt was legitimate.aplts br.at.however,the court found that the debt was not in fact bona fide because of the nature of the option that fogelman granted to the royals at the time of the note,the kcrbc option.see rogers i,d at.the option reads in part as follows 
section exercise price.the aggregate purchase price the purchase price for the fogelman interest subject to the kcrbc option shall be an amount equal to the principal balance outstanding and all accrued,unpaid interest on the kcrbc loan on the kcrbc option closing date.
see aplts app.vol.iv,at.the district court stated 
setting aside for the moment the unlikeliness that fogelman,an insolvent debtor,might have miraculously come up with million in five months to repay his loan to the royals,there was a large and specific disincentive for him to have done so u nder the terms of these agreements,any money fogelman would have paid on the alleged loan would have reduced the amount he received from the royals on the option closing date.not only did fogelman have no economic incentive to pay the alleged loan,it would have been a financial disaster for him to have done so without first obtaining kauffman and the royals consent not to close on the option the royals had exercised.
rogers i,d at footnotes omitted emphases in original.
the taxpayers propose that this conclusion was incorrect,at least for the purposes of summary judgment,for several reasons.for instance,they state that an equally reasonable construction of this pricing provision is that if fogelman paid the loan,then the stockholders agreement contained no price.literally,for a price to exist,the loan must have existed with an outstanding balance and accrued,unpaid interest.aplts br.at.if fogelman had paid the loan,they argue,the exercise price would have been the reasonable value of the collateral or the option would have ceased.id.at footnote omitted.in support of this proposition,they cite koch hydrocarbon mdu resources group,cir,and northwest cent.pipeline jer partnership,cir.
with respect to the possibility of repayment,the taxpayers also state that the parties contemplated a possible payoff of the loan when they agreed in section of the stockholders agreement that fogelman could sell his stock to others if he paid the loan.aplts br.at they propose that buyers would not be interested in acquiring fogelman share of the team if the kcrbc option would allow the team to reacquire that share for nothing once the loan had been paid.
the taxpayers then propose that if fogelman paid the loan and the royals attempted to take his stock for nothing,fogelman would not have allowed that to occur without a fight,because he desired to remain an owner of the team.aplts br.at.in support,they cite several excerpts from the deposition of jack magids,an attorney who represented fogelman during the negotiations of the agreement.magids stated that fogelman negotiated the option because he wanted to remain an owner of the team in the taxpayers view,this makes no sense if the royals could have taken fogelman stock for nothing after fogelman paid the loan.id.
next,the taxpayers argue that the district court was incorrect in concluding,for the purpose of summary judgment,that ownership of fogelman interest had been transferred to the team.under cases such as telephone united states,cir,they contend that fogelman did not give up all the benefits and burdens of team ownership on july,indicating that the substance of the transaction was a loan,not a sale.
the taxpayers admit that the district court identified two ownership burdens given up by fogelman on july,the obligation to make capital calls,and any risk that the value of his interest in the royals would fall below million.they argue,however,that the obligation to make capital calls was not an inherent burden of corporate ownership,and that because fogelman desired to retain his royals interest,the possibility of losing that interest was a huge risk for him.aplts br.at.
they also dispute the other ownership benefits that the district court determined fogelman had given up.as stated by the court,these were the ability to exercise his option to purchase kauffman share of the team his right to vote his shares of stock in the team his right to be an officer and director and participate in the team management all his perquisites as an owner,including the right to attend baseball games at the royals stadium the right to receive distributions of cash during the period the loan was outstanding and the right to bid for the team during the auction process.the taxpayers state that fogelman had already in agreed that he would not exercise his option without kauffman consent that he had already given a proxy to kauffman in to vote his stock and could not have reconfirmed a proxy if he did not own the stock that an agreement not to seek office in the corporation does not indicate a transfer of ownership that the same held true for the removal of fogelman perquisites that kauffman also had no rights to receive a cash distribution and that agreeing not to bid in the auction reflects only an agreement,not a sale of fogelman interest.aplts br.at.
the taxpayers note the district court also recognized that fogelman retained two benefits of ownership through january,the right to receive a pass through of the team net operating losses,and the right to receive upside rights in the auction,if any.the court stated,though,that fogelman had no power to retain these benefits beyond january,because the royals option to purchase his stock was set to close on that date.rogers i,d at.the taxpayers argue that a n owner can not logically continue to receive significant ownership benefits and,at the same time,transfer ownership before the benefits stop.aplts br.at.
finally,the taxpayers argue that a list of sale indicia from leahy commissioner,wl,demonstrates that there was no change in ownership and thus that the loan was bona fide.the taxpayers state that legal title to fogelman interest did not pass until january of,when he transferred it in lieu of foreclosure that all the parties treated the transaction as a loan that the royals did not acquire an equity interest in fogelman property until january that the team gained no control over the stock until january that the team never accepted the risk of loss on the property and that the team did not enjoy any benefits from fogelman interest until january.
the government disputes that any of these arguments demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact.with respect to the kcrbc option,the government states that the taxpayers position is contrary to the plain wording of the option.it was not error,the government says,that the purchase price under the option would be nothing if fogelman repaid the loan instead,it reflected the core agreement of the parties that the royals would acquire fogelman stock for million,whether he defaulted on his loan,as was preordained,or whether the impossible happened and he repaid the loan.aple br.at.the government also states that i f the parties had contemplated that the option would terminate if the loan were fully repaid,the termination clause would have so stated.the absence of any such provision confirms that a zero balance equaled a zero purchase price.id.at.and,according to the government,the fact that the royals exercised their option in july of,at the very time the agreement was closing of the option was deferred until at least january,that there was no intent to wait for the possible repayment of the loan and that the parties believed and understood that fogelman ownership in the royals was ended as of july.aple br.at see also aplts app.vol.iv,at notice of exercise of the kcrbc option by the royals on july.
the government then challenges the taxpayers position on the burdens and benefits of ownership.it argues that the taxpayers identify no burdens that fogelman retained,and that prior to the stockholders agreement of july,he was in fact obliged either to contribute capital to the team when called upon to do so,or to forfeit a commensurate amount of his stock.aple br.at.the government also points out that many of the parties with an interest in the outcome of the transaction were concerned about fogelman possible authority to exercise his option to purchase kauffman share or to vote his shares.thus,the government argues,fogelman subsequent relinquishment of this authority in the agreement supports the district court conclusion that fogelman was relinquishing ownership at the time of the transaction.the government concludes that the district court was correct to find that the transaction was,in substance,a sale.
in true,we held that 
cases involving the issue of substance over form require resolution of significant questions of fact.nevertheless,the mere presence of a factual question does not automatically preclude summary judgment.even in cases where some issues of fact remain,if no reasonable could find in favor of the party,then summary judgment is still appropriate.
at footnote omitted.it has been suggested that in the present case,the factual analysis is complicated by the contested nature of the underlying contract,the stockholders agreement,precluding summary judgment.as the district court observed,however,i n the field of taxation,administrators of the law and the courts are concerned with the substance and realities of a transaction,and formal written documents are not rigidly binding rogers i,d at quoting frank lyon,at.how the agreement in question is to be construed depends not upon any particular phraseology used in the document but rather upon what the parties actually did,gleaned from a consideration of the written instrument and the surrounding circumstances and in the light of the record as a whole estate of franklin commissioner,wl,aff on other grounds by franklin estate commissioner,cir.thus,this panel must look at the circumstances surrounding the transaction in question to determine whether any reasonable could find in favor of the party.if not,then summary judgment in favor of the government was appropriate.
as explained above,the taxpayers forward six main arguments in support of their view that the debt was bona fide and therefore that they should be allowed to claim the bad debt deduction.these arguments,which we will address in order,are that the value of the collateral in relation to the amount given to fogelman indicates that the transaction was in reality a loan that the provisions in section of the agreement meant that there was no price if fogelman repaid his loan,thus contradicting some of the district court reasoning that section of the agreement anticipated the actual repayment of the loan by fogelman,further undercutting the district court reasoning that fogelman expressed his desire to retain ownership in spite of his mounting economic troubles,suggesting he would not have sold his share of the team that an analysis of the burdens and benefits of ownership suggest that fogelman was still the owner of his share and that the sale indicia suggest the transaction was a loan.after carefully reviewing the parties positions,we hold that the district court correctly concluded that this transaction was in substance a redemption of fogelman stock and not a loan to fogelman.as the district court observed,the most obvious support for this position derives from the incentives that the kcrbc option gave to the parties involved.however,it is a full analysis of the context of the transaction that convinces us that no reasonable could support the taxpayers view.
the value of the collateral 
with respect to the taxpayers first point,we agree with the district court reasoning that the value of the collateral at the time of the purported loan is hardly dispositive.the nature of the specifically the interaction of sections and,as discussed any support provided by the taxpayers first point,even on a motion for summary judgment.the taxpayers acknowledge that the purpose in looking at the value of the collateral is whether there was incentive for the borrowing party to repay the note.see aplts br.at.however,as discussed below,the incentives were clearly against repayment of the note,and thus a consideration of the value of the collateral is of little help to the taxpayers position.indeed,the very case relied upon by the taxpayers for this point,saviano commissioner,cir,states that in a true lending transaction,there exists the reasonable likelihood that the lender will be repaid in the light of all reasonably foreseeable risks.id.at quoting gibson products united states,cir emphasis added.as discussed below,there was apparently no likelihood of any such,saviano reasoning suggests that the value of the collateral is relatively inconsequential in proving the transaction was a loan.
ii.section of the stockholders agreement 
as for the taxpayers second the agreement contained no price upon repayment and thus the district court misconstrued must begin with an analysis of the content of the agreement.although the parties did not brief the issue of which state law was to apply,and the district court did not explicitly mention it,the stockholders agreement specifies that it is to be construed in accordance with missouri law.see aplts app.vol.iv,at section of the stockholders agreement.under missouri law,t he primary rule in the interpretation of a contract is to ascertain the intention of the parties and to give effect to that intention.speedie food mart,taylor.a contract that is clear and unambiguous on its face is not open to judicial construction the initial question to be determined is thus whether an ambiguity exists.id.regardless of the taxpayers hypothetical assertions as to what might have happened had fogelman paid the loan,the kcrbc option unambiguously states that its exercise price is to be equal to the balance of the loan remaining to be paid where the language of the contract is clear,it is sufficient evidence of the intent of the parties.tuttle muenks.we therefore have no need to consider parol or extrinsic evidence,such as the taxpayers claims about what fogelman might have done had the royals attempted to take his interest for nothing 
iii.section of the stockholders agreement 
as a third general argument,the taxpayers emphatically point to the possibility that fogelman could sell his stock to others upon repayment of the stated by section of the stockholders an indication that the purpose of the transaction is at least debatable and therefore that summary judgment is inappropriate.we disagree.as already mentioned,the taxpayers assert that no buyer would be interested in purchasing fogelman share of the royals if the kcrbc option would allow the team to acquire that share for nothing as the district court determination would require.thus,they argue,section would be rendered meaningless or nonsensical.
it appears from the nature of the transaction,however,that this kind of disincentive to potential outsider buyers is precisely what the parties to the agreement intended.to begin with,the taxpayers seem to acknowledge that partial repayment would have reduced the price of exercising the kcrbc option.for example,if fogelman had repaid million,the exercise price of the kcrbc option would have been million plus interest.thus,any partial repayment by fogelman would decrease the amount he would receive once the royals closed on the kcrbc option.the taxpayers provide no argument refuting this very real disincentive to repayment.further,it was in the parties interest to find ways to discourage potential buyers from interfering with the complex arrangement they had devised for the sale of fogelman share in the royals.at a minimum,the provisions of section,viewed in light of the entire transaction,do not support the taxpayers objections.to the contrary,this arrangement reinforces the idea that no reasonable could rule in favor of the party on summary judgment.
that the parties envisioned a sale or redemption of the stock is further shown by the royals decision on the day the agreement was finalized to exercise the option to purchase fogelman interest.see aplts app.vol.iv,at.indeed,apparently all parties contemplated this specific action before the agreement was finalized.see id.at resolution of the royals board of directors,dated july,directing the royals to exercise the kcrbc option contemporaneously with the finalization of the stockholders agreement.the exercise of the kcrbc option would presumably preclude an attempt by fogelman to repay the loan the exercise of it on the day the loan was made suggests the transaction was never intended to be anything other than a sale of fogelman interest 
the taxpayers suggest that the royals could not have invoked this option to acquire fogelman interest if fogelman had repaid the purported loan.in their view,this construction of the option supports their characterization of the transaction as a loan.to the contrary,however,the evidence reveals two critical facts.first,the possibility of fogelman repaying the loan was never taken seriously.magids,fogelman attorney during negotiation of the agreement,testified that 
it was quite clear that,based upon the totality of all the agreements,that fogelman continued interest in the royals would come to an end some time in early january in the absence of the parties reaching agreements to modify the documents that were signed in july of.
see aplts app.vol.viii,at emphasis added.other evidence in the record reinforces this view indeed,in the words of the government,i f the parties had intended that the royals option to acquire fogelman interest could not be exercised if the loan was fully repaid,the exercise date of the option would have to have been deferred until the note came due to allow for that possibility.aple supl.br.at.second,as previously mentioned,the terms of section of the agreement explicitly contemplate the royals exercise of the kcrbc option upon full repayment of the loan.thus,the taxpayers argument on this point is totally without support.
with regard to the transaction substance,as the district court found,there was clearly no incentive for either fogelman or kauffman to take any additional actions once the stockholders agreement had been reached.if fogelman had repaid the loan,with interest,the royals would have been able to acquire his share of the team for nothing.fogelman thus had no reason to make any payments knowing this,the royals had only to wait for the due date of the nonrecourse note,and the corresponding inevitable both by fogelman financial situation and by the contractual order to gain control of fogelman share of the team.in addition,if the royals had wanted to exercise the option before the note due date,and fogelman had not then made any payments,the option exercise price would have been million.fogelman presumably could not keep that money,though,because he would have had to retire the note on the property he was now selling in order to provide good and marketable title as required by section of the agreement,thus resulting in the exact same consequence kauffman owning fogelman share of the team and fogelman with million as payment for his share.
iv.fogelman ownership desire 
the taxpayers fourth fogelman subjective desire to retain ownership of his share of the team indicates that the transaction was a loan and not a of little relevance in light of the overwhelming evidence that the agreement provided profound disincentives to repayment.this argument is further undercut by the apparently universal even by fogelman own attorney that fogelman would have been unable to find the money necessary to repay the amount of the purported loan.while fogelman may not have wanted to give up his share of the royals,the fact that he owed nearly billion to his creditors makes his desire irrelevant to this transaction.no reasonable could believe that fogelman wishes on this subject were sufficient to indicate that the transaction was a loan.
the burdens and benefits of ownership 
the taxpayers fifth point is also of little help to their appeal.as discussed above,the taxpayers point to the ownership benefits retained by fogelman during the interim period between the signing of the agreement and the closing of the kcrbc option as evidence of the fact that the transaction was a loan and not a sale.however,the district court described these rights as not at all inconsistent with a sale,as it is not uncommon for a seller to retain certain benefits of ownership between the date a contract of sale is signed and the date it is closed.rogers i,d at.we agree with the district court reasoning on this issue.
vi.sale indicia 
the taxpayers sixth general assertion also does not support a reversal of the district court order.they argue that the list of sale indicia from leahy supports the characterization of the transaction as a loan.while some of the indicia from leahy might support viewing the transaction as a loan in another context,the point in the cited section of that case is that the characterization of a transaction as a sale is to be determined by looking at the written agreement in light of the surrounding circumstances.see leahy,at.as already discussed,the attendant circumstances overwhelmingly show that the transaction in question was not a loan 
the analysis above reveals the parties understanding about the loan namely,that the transaction was in substance a sale,regardless of the form in which the parties happened to cloak it.we find it particularly telling that the parties contemplated a direct sale of the team when drafting the agreement and that,apparently,the only two hurdles for drafting the transaction as a sale were fogelman fondness for the team and the negative tax consequences to the creditors of a direct sale.see aplts app.vol viii,at deposition testimony of magids,dated.as magids stated 
i think toward the end of the process of negotiating the agreement,when it became more evident that the benefits of the loan as originally conceptualized includ ing fogelman being able to both take care of his creditors and keep the royals were fading,we revisited the idea of a sale internally,quite frankly,and with the creditors.they were interested in it,but there was no way that the thing could work with a sale,as i recall b ecause the taxes would have taken cash out of the pot.
id.at.while the parties may have found an alternative form to avoid paying these taxes,the substance of the transaction was that of a sale of fogelman interest in the royals.no reasonable would be swayed by the assertion that a man owing nearly billion to his borrowed million secured by his interest in a baseball team and who granted an option eliminating his ownership rights in the had the subjective desire to retain his share of that team.
as stated by the district court 
the transaction gave fogelman no incentive or obligation to repay his purported debt and he parted with all of the burdens,and all but two of the benefits,of his royals interest on the date the loan closed.moreover,he had no way to continue to retain even those two benefits beyond january,and had absolutely no right to retain his royals interest simply by paying off his purported debt in light of the option he granted to the royals as an integral part of the transaction.this is the stuff of substance.legally,it overwhelms the nominal form of the transaction,in which the parties paid a minimal loan tax and overwhelms any evanescent desire fogelman may have had to perpetuate his dream of royals ownership by having the transaction structured as a loan.fogelman agreed on july,to a transaction that gave him no right to retain any ownership in the royals even if he paid off his loan.
rogers i,d at emphasis in original.the conclusion of the district court comports with our analysis.
the substance over form tax doctrine allows the court to ensure that business transactions do not permit some taxpayers to avoid tax at the expense of others in a way that was not intended by the political system.hariton,sorting out the tangle of economic substance,tax law.at.we agree with the district court conclusion that the economic realities of the transaction,even granting the plaintiffs all the factual inferences to which they are entitled,overwhelmingly dictate the legal conclusion that a sale,or more properly,a redemption of fogelman royals stock,and not a loan,took place.rogers i,d at emphasis added.the analysis above shows that the transaction was properly recharacterized as a sale for tax purposes.see,twenty mile joint venture,pnd,commissioner,cir substance prevailed over form where form did not reflect the reality of the situation.because we conclude that no reasonable could find in favor of the party that the transaction was not in substance a sale,summary judgment was appropriate.see true,at.we therefore affirm the district court order on summary judgment regarding characterizing this transaction as a redemption.
equitable recoupment 
upon the district court finding that the transaction in question was a redemption rather than a loan,the taxpayers filed a motion for judgment in their favor on the issue of whether they were entitled to a tax refund since they had treated the transaction as a loan for tax purposes in,and.in particular,the taxpayers pointed out two things.first,the royals had claimed interest from the loan as income,passing through the income interest to the taxpayers.thus,the taxpayers paid taxes on this income the interest overpayment second,the royals had allocated of the royals net operating losses for to fogelman,allegedly based on the assumption that he was a shareholder at the time,thus precluding the taxpayers from claiming for themselves the tax benefits of those losses the partial operating loss allocation.
the taxpayers asserted to the district court that since the transaction was deemed a redemption,they were being unfairly taxed on the amount of the interest overpayment.in other words,the government was receiving tax payments from the taxpayers by treating the transaction both as a loan with taxes assessed on the interest income from the loan and as a redemption by prohibiting the taxpayers from claiming the benefit of a bad debt deduction.the taxpayers objected to the negative tax consequences to them from these inconsistent characterizations of the transaction.
similarly,the taxpayers asserted that the partial operating loss allocation was assigned to fogelman solely based on the assumption that he was a owner of the team at the time.since the district court found that fogelman had sold his interest,the taxpayers complained that they should have been able to claim the partial operating loss allocation for themselves.in essence,they claimed that the government was penalizing them by preventing them from claiming the bad debt deduction stemming from the default of the loan while also asserting an inconsistent position that the taxpayers could not claim the amount of the partial operating loss allocation.hence,the taxpayers requested a tax refund on summary judgment for both overpayments.
the district court determined that,in general,the taxpayers refund request was barred by the statute of limitations contained in section a of the see a.however,the court also found that the doctrine of equitable recoupment allowed the taxpayers to recover
