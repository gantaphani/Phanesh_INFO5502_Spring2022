defendant yooho weon pleaded guilty to five counts of tax evasion,in violation of,pursuant to a plea agreement reached with the government.the district court sentenced weon to a prison term of months,a sentence below weon advisory sentencing guidelines the guidelines range of to months imprisonment.
on appeal,weon argues that the sentence imposed by the district court was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable.weon contends that the actual tax revenue loss caused by his failure to pay corporate income taxes was significantly less than the amount stated in the parties plea agreement,and that the court erred in refusing to consider this alleged discrepancy at his sentencing.upon our review,we conclude that the district court did not err in holding that weon was bound by the tax revenue loss figure to which he stipulated in the plea agreement,and that the court did not commit procedural or substantive error in sentencing weon.accordingly,we affirm the district court judgment.
weon owned and operated parkway pawn shop,parkway,located in bladensburg,maryland,and an business known as earth computer,earth.weon operated these companies as a single business enterprise,maintaining their books and records as one entity.
the government filed a criminal information charging weon with five counts of willfully evading corporate income taxes,alleging that weon failed to file a corporate income tax return for parkway and earth for the calendar years through.weon waived indictment and entered into a written plea agreement in which he admitted all the charges and agreed to plead guilty to them.
in the plea agreement,the parties stipulated that for purposes of this plea agreement and sentencing,the total tax loss is approximately.emphasis added.the figure represented a compromise amount determined by the parties.the government initially maintained that the tax revenue loss was more than,which would have resulted in a greater offense level under the guidelines.weon,however,claimed that the tax revenue loss was much lower than.significantly,during this plea bargaining process,weon received advice from a certified public accountant cpa he had hired to evaluate the amount of the loss before entering into the plea agreement.
in addition to the government agreement to forego any argument that the tax revenue loss exceeded,weon obtained other significant benefits by entering into the plea agreement.the government stipulated in the agreement that weon base offense level under the guidelines was,and agreed not to oppose a reduction in the offense level based on weon acceptance of responsibility.the government also agreed to file a motion under b for an additional reduction in his offense level,lowering the adjusted offense level to,based on certain conditions including that weon would not attempt to withdraw his guilty plea.
by pleading guilty,weon avoided being charged with the additional felony offenses of transporting stolen property and of participating in a money laundering conspiracy,offenses for which several other owners and employees of pawn shops had been prosecuted.as a result of his plea,weon also avoided being charged by maryland state authorities with the felony offense of engaging in the trafficking of stolen goods.
the district court held a hearing pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure the rule hearing,during which the court determined that weon guilty plea was entered knowingly and voluntarily.the parties represented at the rule hearing that the amount of tax revenue loss we have agreed to regarding this plea agreement and sentencing is approximately million,but noted that the figure was subject to change for restitution purposes only depending on the result of an anticipated civil agreement between weon and the internal revenue service irs.in response to the district court questions,weon further confirmed under oath that he had reviewed the factual stipulations in the plea agreement,that he did not wish to change any aspect of those stipulated facts,that those facts were true and correct,and that the government could prove those facts had weon case proceeded to trial.
after the rule hearing,weon obtained a postponement of his sentencing hearing for a period of more than six months.two weeks before the rescheduled hearing,weon informed government counsel that weon only recently had learned that the amount of tax revenue loss was actually around,rather than the figure to which the parties earlier had stipulated.among other reasons offered to explain this discrepancy,weon contended that parkway and earth were separate businesses,rather than the single entity described in the parties plea agreement.
weon advanced this argument in his sentencing memorandum filed with the district court.the court issued an order further delaying the sentencing hearing,and directed weon to produce the report of jeffrey barsky,weon new forensic accountant.the court also ordered that weon make barsky available for a deposition before the sentencing hearing.
two weeks later,the district court held that weon was bound by his stipulation in the plea agreement concerning the tax revenue loss,for purposes of both his advisory guidelines range and the court consideration of the sentencing factors in a.in reaching this conclusion,the district court observed that weon had represented under oath during the rule hearing that the statements in the plea agreement were correct.accordingly,the court prohibited weon counsel from arguing during the sentencing hearing that the tax revenue loss was materially less than,including for purposes of the a factors.nevertheless,the court stated that it would permit weon to move to withdraw his plea at a later date if he could demonstrate that the discrepancy in the revenue loss calculations resulted from a mistaken assumption of facts.
in response,weon filed a motion seeking to withdraw his guilty plea in which he argued,among other things,that the plea was not knowing and voluntary because he entered it under the mistaken belief that the tax revenue loss figure of was accurate.weon further argued that the recently completed full defense forensic accounting analysis conducted by barsky established that the tax revenue loss was in the range.
the government opposed weon motion to withdraw,arguing that weon had entered into the plea agreement knowingly and voluntarily.the government also disputed barsky analysis on its merits,offering an affidavit from bradley whites,a former irs special agent with over years experience.
the district court held a hearing on weon motion during which the court heard argument and considered the evidence of record,including whites affidavit and barsky report and deposition testimony.at the conclusion of the hearing,the court denied weon motion,stating that weon had entered his guilty plea voluntarily.
in denying the motion,the district court further observed that weon had stipulated in the plea agreement to a tax revenue loss of after receiving advice from a cpa,despite weon disagreement concerning that amount.the court also stated that it found barsky report and testimony concerning the purported lower loss figure highly unpersuasive and riddled with holes.finally,the court concluded that weon request to withdraw from the plea agreement was tactical and not based upon an honest mistake,and that allowing him to withdraw would result in prejudice to the government.
following its ruling on the motion to withdraw,the district court conducted weon sentencing hearing.at that time,the government declined to file a motion for an additional decrease in offense level because weon had sought to withdraw his guilty plea.
the district court otherwise adopted the presentence report,which incorporated the stipulations in the plea agreement that the base offense level was,and that weon was entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.the court found that weon guidelines range was to months imprisonment based on an adjusted offense level of and a criminal history category of nevertheless,the court stated that it would base its sentence on an adjusted offense level of as contemplated in the ple
