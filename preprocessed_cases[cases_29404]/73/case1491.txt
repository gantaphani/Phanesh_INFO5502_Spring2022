frank and josie mayer brought an action to quiet title after they learned that a small portion of a piece of commercial property they owned had been sold at a tax sale.the trial court ruled that the mayers had not been given adequate notice of the tax delinquency and tax sale,but the court of appeal reversed the resulting judgment,ruling that the mayers action was barred by the statute of limitations because they had constructive and actual notice of the tax sale,providing them with ample time to comply with the limitations period.we disagree.the mayers were in undisturbed possession of the property until they received notice that a portion of their property had been sold the statute of limitations did not begin to run until that time.they filed the present suit within a year after receiving that notice.accordingly,their action to quiet title was timely filed.
on december,plaintiffs frank and josie mayer purchased from mark gabay,norman gabay and arman gabaee a piece of commercial property on la brea avenue in los angeles on which there was an autozone auto parts store.the grant deed described the property as consisting of three parcels.parcel one was lots and of tract number and parcels two and three formerly had been portions of la brea avenue each year following their purchase,plaintiffs received from the los angeles county tax collector hereafter tax collector assessments for property taxes in amounts that increased from over per year to more than per year,which the mayers timely paid.
on june,the mayers received from the tax collector by certified mail an official notice of auction of property described as por of vac st adj lot tr no on the notice listed the assessee name as moon,henry s and chong the amount to redeem the property was.the notice stated public records indicate you may have an interest in the property described below.this property is scheduled for sale at public auction to the highest bidder.if you do not have an interest in this property or believe we have sent you this notice in error,please return this notice by writing on the envelope wrong party,return to sender and drop in your nearest mailbox 
the mayers compared the assessor parcel number listed on the notice mapbook,page,parcel with the number on their tax bills and noticed that the parcel numbers differed.they also saw that the property description on the notice did not match the property description on their deed,and they had not heard of the named assessees,henry and chong moon.the mayers telephoned either the assessor office or the tax collector to discover the address of the property being auctioned,but whichever office they called could not provide the address of the parcel.concluding that the notice had been sent to them in error,they followed the instructions on the notice and returned the notice to the tax collector.
unbeknownst to the mayers,the property to which the notice referred consisted of the second and third parcels described in their deed.this roughly triangular piece of property was adjacent to the auto parts store and supported a large,sign that read autozone.henry and chong moon had owned the la brea avenue property when they purchased this parcel from the city of los angeles in.in,the moons recorded an agreement to hold as one parcel the three parcels later described in plaintiffs grant deed.that same year,the moons sold the consolidated property to bastian development corporation,which in the same transaction conveyed the property,through an intermediary,to the gabays and gabaee,who later sold the property to the mayers.
despite the fact that the three parcels comprising the la brea avenue property had been consolidated,the assessor office listed the property as two separate parcels,both identified as appearing on page of mapbook.parcel included the double lot upon which stood the store,and parcel consisted of the roughly triangular piece of land upon which stood the sign.listing the property under separate parcel numbers was a departure from the assessor normal procedure for handling consolidated properties,but this error was compounded by a more serious error the assessor office mistakenly assessed parcel in the name of henry and chong moon,leading the tax collector to send the property tax bill and other notices for this parcel to them.not surprisingly,the tax bill of for fiscal year was not paid and notices of delinquency went unheeded.in june,the parcel was declared to be.
these errors remained undetected until may of when parcel was scheduled for tax sale on august.on may,the tax collector sent a letter to the assessor office noting that there was a discrepancy in the ownership of several properties that were scheduled for the august tax sale,one of which was parcel.the letter noted that the name of the owner of record differed from the information supplied by the assessor office and asked the assessor office to conduct an investigation to determine who is the correct owner of the parcels.
despite discovering the error,the tax collector continued with the tax sale and sent to the mayers the notice of auction described above,which the mayers returned,believing the notice had been sent to them in error.on august,parcel was sold at auction to l b real estate for and a tax collector deed was executed.
by letter dated november,the tax collector notified the mayers that parcel had been sold at public auction for nonpayment of taxes and that they could file a claim for any excess proceeds.this notice,for the first time,listed frank and josie mayer as the assessee.the mayers went to the assessor office,where a review of the official maps confirmed their fear that a portion of their property had been sold.they were referred to another branch of the assessor office before being told to go to the tax collector office.
on january,the mayers explained to a representative of the tax collector that a portion of their property apparently had been sold even though they never had received a tax bill or notice of delinquency.they were sent to a second representative,who asked them to reduce their complaint to writing.plaintiffs sent the tax collector a letter dated february,attempting to reinstate this property.the tax collector responded by letter dated february,that it had no legal basis to cancel the sale,as you were properly notified of the sale of the subject parcel.in a second letter dated april,the tax collector repeated that the sale of the subject property is valid.therefore,your request to cancel the sale is denied.
plaintiffs contacted their title insurance carrier,but were told the property had been sold legally.
on september,l b real estate informed autozone that it was the owner of parcel and wished to negotiate a lease agreement.autozone agreed to pay l b real estate rent of per month beginning on october,which sum it deducted from the rent it paid to the mayers.
on october,more than one year after the tax sale but less than one year after the tax collector letter notifying the mayers of the sale,the mayers filed the present action to quiet title to parcel.
following a court trial,the court entered judgment for the mayers declaring the tax sale void,ordering the tax collector to transfer to the mayers in excess proceeds from the tax sale,and ordering l b real estate to pay to the mayers,which represented the l b real estate had collected in rents from autozone offset by the l b real estate had paid at the tax sale plus it had paid in taxes.
the court of appeal reversed the judgment on the ground that the action was barred by the statute of limitations set forth in revenue and taxation code section.that court reasoned that the tax collector november,letter gave the mayers actual notice of the tax sale within three months of the limitations period triggering of the tax collector deed on august.the court of appeal concluded that plaintiffs had actual notice of every fact necessary to bring their quiet title action,and ample time to do so,before the limitations period expired.
discussion 
it long has been the law that whether a statute of limitations bars an action to quiet title may turn on whether the plaintiff is in undisturbed posse
