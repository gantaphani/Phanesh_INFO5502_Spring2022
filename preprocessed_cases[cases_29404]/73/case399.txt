we are presented with the question under the tax code of whether the mailing by the internal revenue service irs of a misaddressed notice of income tax deficiency a the running of the limitations period within which the irs must assess taxes due.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the united states tax court decision that this period of limitations was suspended by the mailing,when the taxpayer received actual notice of the deficiency and still had sufficient time within which to file a petition under a for a tax court redetermination of the deficiency.
joseph lease capital corporation the taxpayer filed federal income tax returns on october,for the tax years.the period of limitations within which the irs could assess a deficiency for those returns was three years,and would thus expire on october,absent tolling.see a.
following an audit of these returns,the irs mailed a deficiency notice to the taxpayer on october,shortly before the expiration of the limitations period.two copies of the notice of deficiency were mailed to the taxpayer,addressed as follows 
joseph lease capital corporation post office box alexandria,virginia 
joseph lease capital corporation tower court alexandria,virginia 
in addition,the irs mailed a copy of the notice of deficiency to the taxpayer attorney,roger pies,at his address in washington.the taxpayer had earlier appointed pies its for purposes of income tax matters for the tax years.the addresses that the irs used were those maintained in its computer and were concededly accurate up until august,although they became inaccurate by the time of the october mailing.
in late august,the taxpayer hired a new attorney,robert levin,to represent it in connection with tax matters,and on september,the taxpayer submitted to the irs a new form,which appointed levin,in place of pies,as taxpayer.around the same time,the taxpayer parent corporation sent the irs a form affiliation schedule that listed a new street address for the taxpayer at north lee street,alexandria,virginia.a few weeks later,on september,the taxpayer itself sent the irs a form change of address by overnight courier,also listing this address as the taxpayer new address.
because the taxpayer change of attorney and new addresses had not,as of october,been incorporated in the irs computer information base,all three copies of the notice of deficiency mailed on october,were misaddressed,and all three were returned.the first returned notice was stamped box closed,no forwarding order.the second was stamped return to sender,unclaimed.and the third was returned unopened with a cover letter from pies stating that he no longer represented the taxpayer.
the irs did nothing with the returned notices until specifically requested to do so several weeks later.when the taxpayer new attorney,levin,discovered on november,that a deficiency notice had been mailed to the taxpayer in early october,he requested a copy of the notice.the irs faxed him a copy on november.it was thus received by the taxpayer more than three years after the taxpayer initially filed its returns.
on january,the taxpayer filed a petition with the united states tax court for a redetermination of its tax deficiency.in that proceeding,the parties filed for summary judgment on whether the irs was barred from assessing a deficiency because it misaddressed the notices of deficiency and the taxpayer received actual notice more than three years after filing its returns.the tax court concluded that even assuming that the irs did not mail the notice of deficiency to the taxpayer at its address a condition that would have conclusively imputed notice to the taxpayer under b its mailing of the october notice effectively tolled the statute of limitations because the taxpayer actually received a copy of the notice by fax on november,and the taxpayer had ample time to file a timely petition with the tax court.
following the tax court ruling,the parties entered into a settlement that resolved their dispute regarding the amount of taxes due,but they expressly preserved the taxpayer right to appeal the tax court determination of the statute of limitations issue.this appeal was taken to review the single issue of whether any of the misaddressed october notices suspended the running of the limitations period pursuant to a,a question of law that we review de novo.see balkissoon commissioner of internal revenue,cir.
the tax code provides that the irs must assess any deficiency in the payment of income taxes within three years after a return is filed,see a,and generally no assessment can be made until a notice of deficiency has been mailed to the taxpayer,see id.a.when a notice of deficiency is mailed to the taxpayer,the period is extended days from the mailing to permit the taxpayer an opportunity to petition the tax court for a redetermination of the deficiency.see id.a,a.if the taxpayer files a petition for a redetermination of the deficiency,the period is extended yet further until days following the date when the decision of the tax court on the taxpayer petition becomes final.see id.a.until the tax court decision becomes final,the irs may not take any steps to assess and collect the taxes claimed.see id.a.if the taxpayer fails to take advantage of the day window within which to petition the tax court for a redetermination,the irs may assess the deficiency and begin collecting the tax immediately after the days have run.the taxpayer,however,does not lose the opportunity to challenge the assessment of deficiency merely because it fails to petition the tax court.it may pay the taxes and then sue the united states for a refund in federal district court.see id.a,a,a.
thus,the irs mailing of a notice of deficiency simultaneously serves two functions.first,it tolls the statute of limitations,and second,it commences a process that enables the taxpayer to challenge the deficiency.
in this case,the parties agree that the irs mailed a notice of deficiency by certified mail within three years after the taxpayer filed its returns.the taxpayer contends,however,that because the irs misaddressed the notice,the mailing was a nullity and ineffective for all purposes.without a mailing,the statute of limitations under a was never tolled,and therefore the irs could not assess any deficiency after october,as it purported to do.the irs contends to the contrary that its october notice of deficiency was valid and,having been mailed to taxpayer before the expiration of three years from the taxpayer filing of its returns,tolled the statute of limitations.it argues that the defect in mailing was of no consequence because taxpayer actually received the notice without prejudicial delay and filed a timely petition.
to resolve this dispute,we begin with the statutory language,as we must.section a provides that the period of limitations for making an assessment is suspended after the mailing of a notice under a.section a requires that the notice of deficiency to the taxpayer include notice of the taxpayer right to contact a local office of the taxpayer advocate and the location and phone number of the appropriate office and authorizes that the notice be sent to the taxpayer by certified mail or registered mail.this section imposes no other requirements for the mailing.significantly,the mailing that suspends the running of the limitations period under a is explicitly a a mailing there is no requirement that the deficiency notice be mailed as required by b,which conclusively imputes notice to the taxpayer if the notice is mailed to the taxpayer address.accordingly,we conclude that a means what it order to suspend the running of the limitations period under a,a mailing must comport with the requirements of a,but need not comport in any way with b.
the taxpayer contends that in reading a,we should infer that a mailing must be received by the taxpayer in order for it to suspend the running of the limitations period.to support this argument,the taxpayer relies upon mulvania commissioner of internal revenue,cir,which held that a misaddressed notice of deficiency was invalid because the taxpayer never actually received a copy of the notice,and reddock commission
