this appeal arises from a dispute regarding the property tax assessment of the ritz carlton half moon bay hotel the hotel or the property and presents the question of how to properly value taxable property,with associated intangible assets,at fair market value.elk hills,supra,cal th at.appellant shc half moon bay,llc shc,the hotel owner,claims the assessment conducted by the san mateo county assessor assessor and approved by the san mateo county assessment appeals board the board erroneously inflated the value of the hotel by including in nontaxable intangible assets.shc principal contention is the variation of the income approach the assessor used to assess the hotel violates california law by failing to identify and remove the value of intangible assets.respondent county of san mateo the county urges this court to uphold the assessment.
applying a de novo standard of review,we conclude the income approach used by the assessor and approved by the board to assess the hotel violated california law because it failed to attribute a portion of the hotel income stream to the enterprise activity that was directly attributable to the value of intangible assets and deduct that value prior to assessment.elk hills,supra,cal th at,subd.d,subd.c sky river llc county of kern th,sky river.specifically,we conclude the income method at issue here violated section,subdivision d by failing to remove the value of the hotel workforce,the hotel leasehold interest in the employee parking lot,and the hotel agreement with the golf course operator prior to the assessment.
factual and procedural background 
the luxury hotel is located on approximately acres of land on the bluffs of the pacific coast at miramontes point road in half moon bay constructed and opened in,the hotel comprises five structures,including a main building with guest rooms,a signature restaurant,a world class spa and salon,a fitness center,and a lounge.t hree adjacent bungalows contain additional guest rooms.the hotel also includes an executive conference center,tennis courts,a basketball court,a pool and jacuzzi,and a parking structure.the hotel is situated between two of the united states finest golf courses and g uests have full privileges at both courses.
shc purchased the hotel for in.the purchase price included real property,personal property,furniture,fixture and equipment,and intangible assets and rights.at the time of sale,the ritz carlton hotel company,llc managed the hotel pursuant to a management agreement.in,the assessor assessed the hotel pursuant to proposition at its purchase price of and deducted the value of personal property,for a total value of.the assessor enrolled the hotel at its purchase price of because the appraised value was within five percent of the purchase price.shc timely paid the property taxes.
shc appeal to the board 
shc challenged the property tax assessment,claiming it erroneously included the value of in nontaxable intangible assets,specifically the hotel workforce the hotel leasehold interest in the employee parking lot the hotel agreement with the golf course operator and goodwill.shc claimed the income approach was not appropriate for california property tax purposes because it failed to identify and exclude intangible assets.
according to shc,the proper method to exclude intangible assets from the assessment was not simply to deduct the hotel management and franchise fee,but to identify,value,and deduct specific categories of assets in accordance with section of the assessors handbook,which provides that the deduction of a management fee from the income stream of a hotel does not recognize or remove the value attributable to the business enterprise that operates the hotel.bd.of equalization,assessors handbook,section advanced appraisal assessors handbook,fn.omitted.shc argued the assessors handbook is completely at odds with the assessor appraisal and claimed the deduction of a management and franchise fee did not adequately remove intangible property from the assessment.
shc valuation and evidence 
james gavin,director of duff phelps,prepared a report allocating relevant tangible and intangible assets of the property pursuant to the accounting and reporting requirements of statement of financial accounting standards,accounting for business combinations fasb the intended use of the analysis was to provide an allocation of value for financial reporting purposes.using the cost method,gavin determined the value of the hotel tangible assets was,comprised of land value of and in building and site improvements.gavin allocated of the property purchase price to tangible assets.he allocated to intangible assets and identified the following intangible assets and estimated their value the hotel assembled workforce the hotel leasehold interest in the employee parking lot the hotel agreement with the golf course operator and goodwill.
at the board hearing,gavin testified as an expert for shc and explained,among other things,how he calculated the value of intangible property.he stated,t he goodwill in this case is a residual.it is basically taking the purchase price and working your way through all the different elements and all the different tangibles and intangibles to get down to what is left over.gavin explained how he calculated the value of goodwill from an accounting perspective,there is some type of premium being paid or value being asserted to a property based on whether it is the flag,brand,whether it the location,whatever it might be.we think there something there.so essentially that how we got that,because again it a residual with all the other numbers combined,and deducted off the purchase price.
gavin conceded the income method is how the people in the marketplace that are trading hotels look at hotels but urged the board to value the hotel in accordance with the assessors handbook,which recommends intangible assets and rights be separately identified,valued,and deducted from the entire business enterprise as a going concern to arrive at taxable value of the property.
b.the county valuation and evidence 
the county claimed the deduction of the management and franchise fee pursuant to the income approach excluded the value of nontaxable intangible assets.it argued shc appraisal applied a controversial methodology that is not generally followed in the appraisal industry or by the assessor offices for valuing hotel real property.as the county explained,shc method essentially places a per square foot dollar value on the land and improvements and subtracts that amount from the purchase price.what is left,shc says,is its intangible goodwill value,which it claims can not be taxed.the county contended shc assumptions and methodology do not reflect the realities of the hotel market.the method used by the assessor popularly known as the rushmore method better recognizes those realities and is supported by the appraisal institute.according to the county,the fasb analysis is used for purposes of financial reporting not for deciding the real property value.
the assessor employed the sales approach,the cost approach,and the income approach to value the hotel and determined the income capitalization approach provided the most persuasive and supportable conclusions when valuing a lodging facility.as the assessor explained,w e used the rushmore approach to valuation which is considered to be the accepted and widely used method in the hospitality industry.basically,the net operating income from a stabilized year is calculated by removing the income attributable to and the concern.what is left is the income attributable to the land and improvements.this is then capitalized into an estimate of value.
using the income approach,the assessor derived a stabilized income stream for the hotel and then estimated the hotel stabilized occupancy rate of percent with net revenue per room of at percent.after reducing projected income for fixed expenses such as insurance,subtracting million in management and franchise fees,and deducting for reserves and taxes,the assessor estimated the hotel net operating income to be percent.utilizing a capitalization rate of percent,the assessor concluded the fair market value of the hotel was.the assessor then deducted in personal property and determined the value of the hotel was million,a value within five percent of the roll value of.according to the assessor,s ince the appraised value is within of the indicated sale price of,the purchase price assumption validates the base year enrollment.
in a written report,thomas callahan,co president and ceo of what is now first service pkf hospitality,critiqued gavin report.callahan determined the cost approach was an inappropriate method to value the property for property tax assessment purposes.according to callahan,h otels,which are income producing properties,are typically valued using the income capitalization approach by the investment community and this is the approach which should be used for property tax purposes.callahan concluded the intangible or business value associated with a hotel is typically removed from the value of the hotel real property through the deduction of a market rate management and if appropriate franchise fee.the resulting income stream after this deduction is typically viewed by the investment community as a return on the hotel real and tangible personal property.in the case of the hotel,the majority of the property business value has been removed through the deduction of the management fee payable to the ritz carlton hotel company,llc.in addition to the deduction of market rate management and franchise fee,the capitalized value of expenses the cost of assembling and training a work force,marketing,necessary to open the business is also often deducted as an intangible value of the hotel.callahan opined gavin report significantly understated the replacement cost per hotel guest room.according to callahan,using a more realistic cost per guest room increases the value of the hotel tangible real and personal property from approximately million to million.
callahan testified as an expert on hotel valuations for the assessor.he explained almost all investors primarily use the income approach or the income capitalization approach in developing the value of a hotel and that,generally speaking in the industry,the view is the deduction of a market rate management franchise fee from the income stream of the hotel strips out the majority not all,but the majority of the intangible value of the property.callahan explained t he reason for that is hotels are operating businesses they do rent guest rooms,sell food and beverage facilities.they put on weddings,events,all those types of things.in lieu of leases,which are typical in most other types of real estate,p eople enter into management agreements with companies like the ritz carlton hotel company.
callahan described management agreements and noted,the concept in the hotel industry is to deduct an appropriate market rate management fee and sometimes franchise fee,and you getting down to pretty much a pure point asset income that a return on the tangible,real and personal property.he noted other components should be deducted such as the deduction of a capitalized value for developing the workplace in force but those are pretty small dollar amounts.callahan conceded these assets the hotel workforce,the hotel leasehold interest in the employee parking lot,and the hotel agreement with the golf course operator totaled million.
later,callahan elaborated a nother argument is also deducting the capitalized value of the labor in force,expenses and working capital.for a property of this caliber,that would probably be about per guest room so the question is whether the majority of the business value is taken out in the management and franchise fee.it either a hundred percent or it like ninety percent.there an argument that i think is worthy of making,of taking off an additional item not the goodwill line item for million dollars but a million dollars for labor in place but it relatively small dollars when we talking about a hotel of this caliber.finally,callahan opined the assessor used the proper methodology to value the property.he testified the cost method was not the appropriate approach to value the real tangible and personal property and was absolutely always wrong for luxury properties.callahan also noted he disagreed with the assessors handbook.
deputy assessor angela hunter explained how the assessment was conducted and testified without explanation the deduction of million for the management and franchise fee accounted for all intangible assets,including goodwill.the county submitted articles describing the rushmore approach for valuing hotel property it also submitted the california assessors association position paper rejecting the assessors handbook and recommending assessors use the california assessors association version of those materials.the county explained the california assessor s association does not agree with the assessor s handbook it not binding on the assessor effort.while it may be interesting,it not the final word on how to value the hotel.
c.the board decision 
the board upheld the assessment.first,the board noted an assessor property assessments generally enjoy the presumption of correctness and applicants typically have the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the assessor valuation was incorrect.second,the board concluded the assessor income methodology is an appropriate and permissible approach to determine valuation.moreover,even if the board were to reject the assessor income approach and use the cost approach,the preponderance of the evidence supported higher construction costs than those set forth in the fasb report.as the board explained,even if the board were to determine that the rushmore approach were deficient,the balance of the evidence still supported the roll value after adjusting shc analysis to reflect increased construction costs.
in reaching this conclusion,the board rejected shc argument that the rushmore approach utilized by the assessor improperly included intangible property.the board noted it understood the criticism of the rushmore approach,but concluded the evidence and testimony presented at the hearing did not persuade it to reject its application to the p roperty in the instant case.as noted above,the balance of testimony was that potential purchasers of the p roperty would generally utilize the rushmore approach,or a substantially similar approach in determining value.further,while shc contended that a better approach would be to capitalize the rent that a typical vendor would pay to lease space in the hotel,shc did not present any such evidence for the board to consider.
third,the board determined the fasb allocation proffered by shc may be acceptable for financial reporting purposes but did not provide an accurate appraisal for property tax purposes and that shc testimony and evidence at the hearing was insufficient to persuade the board to concur with shc s opinion of value.the board instead found that the balance of the evidence supported the assessor opinion of value.the board explained it was not convinced that fasb reports may be utilized in the same manner as an appraisal prepared for california property tax purposes in part because shc did not present credible evidence that the requirements for such reports are the same as those for property tax purposes.additionally,the board agreed with the assessor argument that goodwill in the instant case should be as opposed to million in light of the fact that the management franchise fees would largely capture that goodwill for the benefit of the ritz carlton hotel company,llc as opposed to shc.finally,the board concluded the assessors handbook provides guidance to county assessors and is not binding upon them.on balance,the board finds that the assessor proposed income methodology is an appropriate and permissible approach to determine valuation.the board affirmed the assessment of.
shc trial court action for a property tax refund 
in a verified complaint seeking a property tax refund,shc alleged the board failed to exclude intangible assets from the valuation the board erred by placing the burden on shc to show the assessment was incorrect the assessment failed to comply with federal and california constitutional law and the board findings failed to include a determination of unidentified material points shc raised at the hearing.the complaint sought a refund of taxes paid and a remand to the board for a redetermination of property value.
following a bench trial,the court issued a statement of decision upholding the board decision.relying on ehp glendale,llc county of los angeles th,ehp glendale,the court concluded the income approach was a valid method for determining property value.as the court explained,the assessor selected the rushmore method to sufficiently account for and isolate the income stream attributable to the taxable real property the rushmore approach is widely used to appraise hotel real property for either lending or tax purposes.the court then determined there was substantial evidence supporting the board conclusion that the assessment excluded intangible value.
next,the court determined the assessment was made in accordance with law and the board decision upholding the assessor enrolled value for the property fully complie d with the requirements of the revenue and taxation code.according to the court,t he assessor properly performed his duties in assessing the real property and there is substantial evidence in the record to support the board conclusion that he did.the assessor presented evidence of its analysis utilizing all three methods authorized by statute to determine the fair market value of the property.the assessor provided a comprehensive analysis of each method including details of the parcels at issue,comparable sales of luxury hotels nationwide,marshall swift cost estimates,a discounted cash flow analysis and historical costs,background articles on the valuation of hotels as income producing properties,a position paper by the california assessors association on excluding intangible value from income producing properties by the rushmore approach,expert opinion,and legal analysis and briefing regarding the propriety of the assessment.there is nothing in the record to indicate the assessment is contrary to law.
additionally,the court rejected shc claim that the assessor failure to follow the assessors handbook was contrary to law.the court concluded the assessors handbook was not mandatory but rather a set of recommendations for how to value property.finally,the court rejected shc argument that the board improperly placed the burden of proof on shc,as well as shc claim that the board failed to address all material points raised by shc at the evidentiary hearing before the board.the court entered judgment for the county.
discussion 
to place the issues in context,we review preliminary considerations which are not in dispute or are at least we think well settled,but which require our brief recitation before approaching the central issue of this case.service america county of san diego th,service america.
general taxation principles and principles related to taxation of intangible property 
as we have already stated,the california constitution requires generally the assessment of property at fair market value a ssessors have a constitutional mandate to tax all property at fair market value if not exempt under federal or state law.citations.elk hills,supra,cal th at.fair market value means the amount of cash or its equivalent that property would bring if exposed for sale in the open market under conditions in which neither buyer nor seller could take advantage of the exigencies of the other,and both the buyer and the seller have knowledge of all of the uses and purposes to which the property is adapted and for which it is capable of being used,quoting,subd.a.
intangible property,however,is exempt from taxation pursuant to section,subdivision c,which broadly exempts intangible assets and rights from taxation.elk hills,supra,cal th at.section provides,intangible assets and rights are exempt from taxation and,except as otherwise provided in the following sentence,the value of intangible assets and rights shall not enhance or be reflected in the value of taxable property.ibid.but section also provides that t axable property may be assessed and valued by assuming the presence of intangible assets or rights necessary to put the taxable property to beneficial or productive use.citation.elk hills,supra,cal th at.
section provides rules of construction that harmonize section c tax exemption with the command that assessors tax all property at its fair market value.elk hills,supra,cal th at.s ection d and prevents the direct taxation of intangible rights and assets when assessors use methods of unit valuation.section d prevents tax assessors from including the value of intangible assets that relate to the going concern value of a business within the unit value of property prior to assessment.section d requires taxing authorities to value intangible assets and actively remove that value from a unit taxable base value,so that the intangibles are not directly taxed.elk hills,at.the procedures in section d operate in conjunction with section e.citation.section e provides taxable property may be assessed and valued by assuming the presence of intangible assets or rights necessary to put the taxable property to beneficial or productive use.elk hills,at.section e applies to intangible assets or rights that are necessary to the beneficial or productive use of taxable property.elk hills,at.
put another way,s ection d prevents the value of intangible assets from enhancing or being reflected in the valuation of taxable property.section e allows assessors to enhance the valuation of taxable property,not by including the value of intangible assets in the valuation but simply by assuming the presence of intangible assets when valuing the taxable property put to beneficial or productive use.elk hills,supra,cal th at.as our high court has explained,assessors can not tax the value of intangible assets directly but that principle does not prevent assessors from assuming the presence of intangible assets when valuing taxable property in other words,assessors must do their constitutional duty to assess taxable property at fair market value while making sure that the value of intangible assets is not improperly subsumed within the value of taxable property id.at.
the taxability of intangibles has long been a subject of controversy between assessors and taxpayers.ehrman flavin,taxing cal.property ed,taxing cal.property.in,and in an effort to resolve the controversy,the state board of equalization adopted the assessors handbook,a page statement of its position on the taxability of intangible property,to provide instruction to county assessors.the discussion on intangibles is the most controversial part of the handbook.taxing cal.property,supra,see also.the assessors handbook provides in pertinent part the value of intangible assets and rights can not be removed by merely deducting the related expenses from the income stream to be capitalized.allowing a deduction for the associated expense does not allow for a return on the capital expenditure.for example,allowing the deduction of wages paid to a skilled work force does not remove the value of the work force in place from the income indicator,because the amount of the wages paid does not necessarily represent a return of and on the work force in place,and further bears no relationship to the costs associated with locating,interviewing,training and otherwise acquiring the work force.similarly,the deduction of a management fee from the income stream of a hotel does not recognize or remove the value attributable to the business enterprise that operates the hotel.assessors handbook,supra,at,fns.omitted.
tax assessors use the assessors handbook as a basic guide.exxon mobil county of santa barbara th,fn.exxon mobil.a ssessors handbooks are not regulations and do not possess the force of law,but they serve as a primary reference and basic guide for assessors,and have been relied upon and accorded great weight in interpreting valuation questions.citation.sky river,supra,th at see also watson cogeneration county of los angeles th,fn.the california supreme court cited the assessors handbook with approval in elk hills,supra,cal th at pages,and through.
the income method of determining property value 
of the three appraisal methods,the assessor used the income method to determine the hotel value,which is described in rule.sky river,supra,th at,fn.omitted see fn,ante.rule describes two general methods for estimating future income as relevant here,the second method uses income from operating a property or business operating income so long as sufficient income is excluded to provide a return on working capital and other nontaxable operating assets and to compensate unpaid or underpaid management,tit.
under the income method the assessor capitalizes the sum of future income attributable to the property,less an allowance for the risk of partial or no receipt of income citation.the income method rests upon the assumption that in an open market a willing buyer of the property would pay a willing seller an amount approximately equal to the present value of the future income to be derived from the property.citation.olen commercial realty county of orange th,see also de luz homes county of san diego cal d de luz homes property value under the income method is the sum of anticipated future installments of net income from the property,less an allowance for interest and the risk of partial or no receipt sky river,supra,th at,quoting freeport mcmoran resource partners county of lake th,freeport describing income method.
the de novo standard of review applies 
the parties dispute whether this court should employ a de novo or substantial evidence standard of review.freeport,supra,th at.our high court recently summarized the applicable standards of review when the assessor utilizes an approved valuation method,his factual findings and determinations of value based upon the appropriate assessment method are presumed to be correct and will be sustained if supported by substantial evidence.citations.however,where the taxpayer attacks the validity of the valuation method itself,the issue becomes a question of law subject to de novo review.elk hills,supra,cal th at.numerous courts have restated this law but have struggled to determine whether a challenge is to method or application freeport,supra,th at and have noted it can be difficult to distinguish between the two types of challenges.gte sprint,supra,th at.
shc characterizes the issue as a challenge to the validity of the income method at issue here and urges us to apply a de novo standard of review.according to shc,the assessor failure to remove the value of intangible assets from the assessment presents a question of valuation methodology,which is a legal issue subject to independent review.we agree.shc contention goes to the methodology used by the assessor and approved by the board and,as a result,the appeal presents a question of law.main von karman associates county of orange th.

two cases are instructive.sky river,supra,th elk hills,supra,cal th.in sky river,the assessor used the income approach to value the taxpayers wind farm electricity generation facilities.the assessment appeals board upheld the assessor property valuation and the taxpayers filed actions in the superior court for a partial property tax refund,arguing the assessor overvalued the property.sky river,at.the trial court found in favor of taxpayers,concluding the assessor used a flawed methodology in calculating the value of the property,resulting in an inflated value and an overstated tax.ibid.the county appealed,arguing the trial court should have deferred to the board findings of fact and should have reviewed the decision only to ascertain whether it was supported by substantial evidence.the taxpayers,however,claimed a de novo standard of review applied on appeal because the dispute relate d to one element of the methodology the appropriate income tax rate to apply to the conversion rather than to factual matters.id.at.
the sky river court applied a de novo standard of review.sky river,supra,th at.it explained plaintiffs in this case contend the assessor used an improper method to calculate the value of their property and the amount of their tax.plaintiffs contend that,although the assessor correctly chose the income approach to determine value,and the method to calculate the capitalization rate,he improperly used an estimated average income tax rate,rather than the marginal rate prescribed by the assessor s handbook,when converting the discount rate from an rate to a rate.we conclude that plaintiffs are correct,and the issue presented constitutes a question of law as to an element of the chosen method to be used in calculating the market value of the property.which income tax rate should be used is a question about the method of calculating the appropriate conversion rate determining which rate should be used does not present a question about the facts specific to plaintiffs case or the data to insert when calculating the value of the property.rather,it presents a question about the methodology prescribed by state board of equalization rules for calculation of the property value.id.at.
the california supreme court reached a similar conclusion in elk hills and applied a de novo standard of review to analyze a taxpayer claim that the state board of equalization improperly taxed intangible assets and rights,including emission reduction credits ercs,when it assessed the taxpayer electric power plant.elk hills,supra,cal th at.the elk hills court explained,b ecause elk hills challenges the board methodology that includes the value of the ercs in its unitary valuation of the power plant,the issue here is a question of law.id.at.here as in sky river and elk hills,shc challenges the assessor methodology that includes the value of intangible assets in its valuation of the property.as a result,the issue here is a question of law.elk hills,supra,cal th at sky river,supra,th at.

second,the county reliance on ehp glendaleis misplaced in ehp glendale,eagle,a hotel owner,filed an action for a property tax refund.in the trial court,eagle argued the assessor and board failed to appropriately consider and remove the value of the hotel franchise license agreement,the workforce in place and other claimed intangibles in determining the cash value of the hotel upon transfer.the trial court granted summary judgment for eagle,concluding the assessor and assessment appeals board used the wrong methodology to appraise the hotel.ehp glendale,supra,th at.the county of los angeles appealed and the ehp glendale court reversed,determining the trial court erred by granting summary judgment based on a fragmentary record.id.at.the ehp glendale court rejected eagle claim that the assessor and board employed an invalid appraisal methodology presented an issue of law.id.at.the ehp glendale court rejected this argument.it stated t he assessor in this case applied an income approach to value the hotel.the income approach is a valid methodology for determining full cash value.citations.eagle contention that the assessor improperly applied the income approach by not deducting intangibles presents a question of fact.id.at.
ehp glendale is distinguishable because it concerned an appeal from the grant of summary judgment,which as the court itself explained,call s for the weighing of facts.ehp glendale,supra,th at.as such,the ehp glendale court holding was limited to whether summary judgment was appropriate where an incomplete record suggested there were triable issues of fact the court statement regarding the validity of the income approach is dicta.dammann golden gate bridge,highway transportation dist.th.we have no quarrel with ehp glendale statement that the income approach is a valid methodology for determining full cash value but we are not bound by that court summary conclusion that the assessor failure to deduct intangibles in that case present ed a question of fact.ehp glendale,supra,th at.
as we have explained,where as here the taxpayer contends the challenged method will produce systematic errors if applied to properties in that class,the issue is not factual but legal.the issue is not whether the assessor misunderstood or distorted the available data,but whether he or she chose an appraisal method which by its nature was incapable of correctly estimating market value.union pacific railroad state bd.of equalization d,union pacific see also american sheds,county of los angeles th,de novo review applies where assessing authority adopt s a position concerning the inclusion or exclusion of intangibles,which can be tested as a matter of law against pertinent authority.
the assessor methodology improperly assessed certain intangible assets and rights 
having determined the de novo standard of review applies,we turn to the question in this case whether the income approach used here properly identified and excluded intangible assets prior to the assessment as required by california law.as we explain below,the deduction of the management and franchise fee from the hotel projected revenue stream pursuant to the income approach did not as required by california law identify and exclude intangible assets such as the hotel assembled workforce,the hotel leasehold interest in the employee parking lot,and the hotel agreement with the golf course operator.see elk hills,supra,cal th at authorities cited therein.the deduction of the management and franchise fee did,however,exclude the intangible asset of goodwill.
the assessor expert,callahan,conceded the assessor approach did not remove all intangible assets and rights.his report stated the majority of the property business value has been removed through the deduction of the management fee and acknowledged that i n addition to the deduction of market rate management and franchise fee,the capitalized value of expenses the cost of assembling and training a work force,marketing,necessary to open the business is also often deducted as an intangible value of the hotel.italics added.at the evidentiary hearing before the board,callahan conceded the deduction of the management and franchise fee accounted for the majority.not all,but by in large,the majority of intangible property.callahan admitted other components such as labor in place should be deducted in addition to the management and franchise fee.later,callahan elaborated a nother argument is also deducting the capitalized value of the labor in force,expenses and working capital.for a property of this caliber,that would probably be about per guest room so the question is whether the majority of the business value is taken out in the management and franchise fee.it either a hundred percent or it like ninety percent.there an argument that i think is worthy of making of taking off an additional item not the goodwill line item for million dollars,but a million dollars for labor in place but it relatively small dollars when we talking about a hotel of this caliber.
callahan report and testimony before the board demonstrate the methodology used by the assessor and approved by the board failed to attribute a portion of the hotel income stream to the enterprise activity that was directly attributable to the value of intangible assets and deduct that value prior to assessment.elk hills,supra,cal th at.as a result,the methodology was legally incorrect.sky river,supra,th at.our conclusion is consistent with a long line of authority culminating with elk hills requiring intangible assets and rights that directly enhance a property income stream to be separately identified and deducted from the income stream analysis prior to taxation.elk hills,supra,cal th at,subds.d,d gte sprint,supra,th at,service america,supra,th at assessor erred in using entire income flow earned by franchisee ballpark concession company shubat sutter county assessment appeals bd.th,assessor erred by failing to exclude value of cable television company intangible assets,such as right to conduct business,subscriber list,and going concern county of orange,supra,th at assessor valuation of cable television system failed to exclude value of intangibles that enhanced value of business,existing franchises,licenses to construct,goodwill county of los angeles county of los angeles assessment appeals bd.th,assessment of airport car rental concession based on capitalized fees improperly included value of intangibles such as the right to do business see also assessors handbook,supra,at.the county does not discuss,or attempt to distinguish,these cases.
