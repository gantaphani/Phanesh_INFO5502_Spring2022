the question presented is the meaning of export property under the domestic international sales corporation disc program established by the revenue act of,stat.the act or the revenue act.in a memorandum opinion entered on july,the united states tax court david laro,judge held that general electric company and its subsidiaries ge was not entitled to certain tax benefits under the disc program because aircraft engines engines and thrust reversers reversers sold by ge to boeing aircraft,boeing and mcdonnell douglas corporation mdc,and attached by boeing and mdc to airframes that they had produced for export,did not constitute export property as defined by the act.see general subsidiaries commissioner,cch.the tax court mary ann cohen,judge reduced the memorandum opinion of judge laro to judgment on september,and it is that judgment from which ge now appeals.
as to the engines,we hold that the act is,in relevant part,ambiguous,and that we must therefore defer to the pertinent regulations promulgated by the united states department of the treasury regulations and that under the relevant regulations the engines were not subject ed to assembly or other processing,reg.d iii,by being attached to the airframes.accordingly,we reverse the tax court judgment as to the engines,and remand the cause for entry of judgment as to the engines in favor of ge.
as to the reversers,we note that the tax court did not differentiate in its analysis between engines and reversers and that there are potentially material differences in this context between them.accordingly,we vacate the tax court judgment as to the reversers,and remand the cause for further consideration in light of this opinion.
background 
relevant statutes and regulations 
congress created the disc program to improve the nation balance of payments by increasing our exports,and the program chosen method for increasing exports was to provide united states firms with tax incentives for shipping their products abroad see,reprinted in,reprinted in.
to the extent relevant here,the disc program worked as follows a corporation qualifying as a disc was not itself subject to federal income tax.see rather,a portion of the disc taxable income earned in connection with sales of export property was deemed distributed to and taxable to the disc shareholders in the taxable year in which the income was earned by the disc.see id.b e referring to,inter alia,e a referring to a a.the remaining portion of taxable income earned by the disc in connection with export property sales was generally not subject to federal income tax until it was distributed by the disc,the disc stock was sold,or the corporation ceased to qualify as a disc.see id.b,c,a.this tax deferral on an otherwise immediately taxable portion of net income was the core benefit to firms of exporting their products through a disc.see lecroy research.commissioner,cir.
under the act,export property is property that,inter alia,is held primarily for sale by a disc,for direct use,consumption,or disposition outside the united states.c b.under the pertinent regulations promulgated by the department of the treasury,p roperty is sold for direct use,consumption,or disposition outside the united states if such sale satisfies the destination test.reg.d i.in turn,the destination test is not satisfied with respect to property which is subject to any use manufacture,assembly,or other processing other than packaging by any person between the time of the sale by such seller and the delivery or ultimate delivery outside the united states.id.at d iii.
relevant facts procedural history 
the parties have stipulated to the following facts.further facts are discussed below as relevant.see post sections.
during the period,when airframe manufacturers boeing or mdc received orders from foreign airlines for new aircraft,they asked the foreign airlines to choose the make of the engines and reversers to be installed on the aircraft that they had ordered.if engines or reversers were selected,boeing or mdc would purchase the engines or reversers from ge,install them on an airframe in the united states,and deliver the fully assembled aircraft including engines,reversers,and airframe outside of the united states to the foreign airline.
by notice of deficiency dated april,the commissioner of internal revenue the commissioner informed ge that it had paid insufficient federal income taxes for and.on june,ge initiated this action by petitioning the tax court for a redetermination of the deficiency.
in its petition for redetermination and in its second amendment to the petition,ge argued,inter alia,that it was entitled to a refund for federal income taxes it had paid for and based on commissions it could have paid to one of its wholly owned subsidiaries in connection with the sales of engines and reversers to boeing and mdc.the subsidiary in question was a disc called general electric international sales corporation geisco and the basis of ge claim was that the engines and reversers constituted export property within the meaning of.see ante section describing tax benefits available to disc,to income earned by a disc in connection with sales of export property.
the tax court rejected ge argument.the court held that the engines and reversers were not export property,and therefore that ge was not entitled to claim disc benefits on the basis of them.see general,at.the tax court entered judgment in accordance with this holding,and ge then filed this timely appeal.we have subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to a.
for the reasons stated below,we reverse the tax court judgment as to the engines,vacate its judgment as to the reversers,and remand the cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
ii.analysis 
the tax court conclusion that the engines and reversers were not export property within the meaning of was based entirely on the stipulated facts summarized above.accordingly,there are no disputed facts here,and we review the tax court judgment de novo.see marrin commissioner,cir.we consider first the tax court decision as to the engines and,then,its decision as to the reversers.
a.the engines 
as an initial matter,we must decide whether unambiguously supplies a rule of decision enough so that it controls the precise question at issue here,chevron natural res.def.council,d namely,whether the engines were export property.if clearly supplies such a rule of decision,we must apply that rule,regardless of what the regulations might otherwise dictate.see id.if does not plainly supply a rule of decision,we must defer to the regulations 
to determine whether the revenue act unambiguously supplies a controlling rule of decision,we begin with the language of.see,korea shipping new york shipping ass l longshoremen ass pension trust fund,cir.section provides in relevant part that export property is property held primarily for sale by a disc,for direct use,consumption,or disposition outside the united states,and that phrase might plausibly be read in one of two relevant ways.
on the one hand,the adjective direct in can be read as applying only to the word that follows it use.warner english grammar and composition the complete course stating in a related context that the normal position of an adjective is directly before the word it modifies emphasis added.on this interpretation,export property is,inter alia,property held for direct use,or for consumption,or for disposition outside the united states,and the regulations would be irrelevant here because provides an rule of decision it is clear that the engines were held primarily for at least eventual consumption or disposition outside of the by the foreign airlines that bought the aircraft from boeing and mdc and selected ge engines.
on the other hand,might be read so that direct modifies each of the nouns that follows just use,but consumption and disposition as well.united states ron pair,d assuming that the phrase reasonable fees,costs,or charges means that fees must be reasonable,costs must be reasonable,and charges must be reasonable united states figueroa,cir assuming that the phrase knowingly aids or assists means that aid must be knowingly provided and assistance must be knowingly provided.on this interpretation,the engines qualify as export property only if they were held for direct use,or direct consumption,or direct disposition abroad.emphasis added.
it is far from clear,however,what the terms direct use,direct consumption,or direct disposition might mean,and there is no indication in the record that these terms have been invested with a definite meaning by industry practice or prior legislation.see generally atlantic mut.ins,at.holding that a term is ambiguous so that department of the treasury regulations must be consulted when the term meaning is neither obvious nor established by prior statutes or industry custom.moreover,how these terms are defined will determine whether the engines were or were not export property.accordingly,if is interpreted so that direct modifies use,consumption,and disposition,the statute does not unambiguously supply an rule of decision because it does not define direct use,direct consumption,or direct disposition.
in sum,standing alone,is materially ambiguous it can be plausibly read in disparate ways,and how it is read will determine the outcome of this case.
moreover,we can divine no indication in the legislative history of the revenue act as to whether direct should be understood to modify all of the nouns that follow it in addition,we reject the commissioner argument that the act legislative history demonstrates that congress intended that items such as the engines should not be considered export property.the commissioner notes that the relevant house and senate reports state that under the revenue act a sale of property to an american manufacturer for incorporation in a product to be exported would not be considered an export sale.reasoning from this sentence,the commissioner asserts that the engines were incorporat ed into the airframes,and that the engines were exported,as part of fully assembled aircraft,only after being so incorporat ed.accordingly,the commissioner contends,the engines can not be considered export property.
we are not persuaded.under some definitions of the verb to incorporate,the commissioner argument might be convincing.see,appellee brief at citing american heritage dictionary of the english language ed defining to incorporate as t o unite one thing with something else already in existence.however,on other definitions,the commissioner argument is plainly unavailing.for example,if,as ge maintains,to incorporate means to unite with something already existent so as to form an indistinguishable whole that can not be restored to the previously separate elements without damage,appellee brief at quoting webster third new international dictionary emphasis added,the engines were not incorporate d into the airframes because these were physically distinct products that were intended to be separable from one another without being damaged.see,stipulation noting that ge engines were routinely removed from the airframes to which they were initially attached for on other airframes.
accordingly,even if we assume arguendo that legislative history may be considered for such purposes,see ante note,the house and senate reports are themselves too ambiguous to clarify definitively the meaning of.we hold,therefore,that congress did not speak to the precise issue of whether items like the ge engines at issue here are export property.in these circumstances,the regulations,to which we now turn,must be given controlling weight.chevron,at.see young community nutrition,d holding that where it is unclear which words in a statute are intended to modify another,the statute is ambiguous within the meaning of chevron so that relevant regulations should be consulted.
as noted above,pursuant to the destination test promulgated in the regulations,a firm may not claim disc benefits on the basis of property that is subject to use,manufacture,assembly,or other processing other than packaging,reg.d iii,between its sale in the united states and its delivery outside of the united states.in other words,an item is export property if,inter alia,it meets each of two criteria.first,the item must not be for immediate domestic use that is,it must not be used between the time it is sold in the united states and the time it is delivered abroad.second,after it is sold,the item must be exported without first being subjected or,in many cases,further subjected to the processes whereby finished products are produced from their constituent,assembly,manufacture,and their ilk other processing.accordingly,the item in question must be a completed export product from the moment it is must be sold in the form,though not necessarily in the package,see reg.d iii noting that export property may not be subjected to other processing other than packaging emphasis added,in which it will be delivered abroad.
in this case,the parties agree that the engines were not subject to any domestic use within the meaning of the regulations.see stipulation.moreover,they agree that the engines were complete product s,id,and that they were fully assembled and fully processed when they were sold by ge,id.the parties disagree only as to whether,by being attached to the airframes,the engines were subjected to further assembly or processing.
we hold that they were not.the engines and the airframes were physically separate and distinct from one another.the ge engines,for example,were routinely removed from one airframe,and placed onto another,see id,and a typical ge engine sold as part of a new aircraft would usually spend most of its useful life powering aircraft other than the aircraft to which it was originally attached,id.
in addition to being physically separate entities,airframes and engines were and are recognized as legally distinct.for example,the federal aviation administration the faa,separately tracks airframes and engines,and the commissioner has recognized in a variety of contexts that engines and airframes are separate,discrete products.see,priv.ltr.rul,wl july,noting that the internal revenue service treats aircraft engines as units of property separate from the airframe.
finally,and most importantly,engines and airframes are viewed by the aviation industry as having separate and independent identit ies,general,at accord stipulation t he aviation industry views a ge engine as retaining its independent identity throughout its entire useful life,and they were treated as such by ge.ge actively solicited engine orders from foreign airlines,see stipulation,and had continuing contacts with them,id.at.moreover,whenever ge learned that an airline might be interested in purchasing a ge engine for the first time,it sent sales representatives to meet with airline officials.see id.at such meetings,ge representatives described the advantages of choosing a engine,and would also typically negotiate the terms and provisions that would apply if the airline decided to purchase a ge engine.id.ge representatives would then seek to reduce their negotiations with airline officials to a bilateral agreement between the airline and ge.see id id.w henever ge learned an airline was considering purchasing a new aircraft from a major airframe manufacturer,ge typically had personnel from its sales and marketing department visit that airline,to induce it to select ge engines for use on its new aircraft.as an incentive for the airline to select ge engines,personnel from ge sales and marketing department offered to provide various discounts allowances to the airline,such as cash rebates,free parts,if the airline would agree to select ge engines.
in short,ge marketed its engines directly to foreign airlines,and independently of any marketing efforts that might have been pursued by boeing or mdc ge negotiated directly with foreign airlines as to the cost to the airlines of choosing a ge engine and ge executed bilateral agreements with foreign airlines that governed the terms under which their aircraft would be outfitted with ge engines.
ge engines and the airframes onto which they were installed were commercially distinct from one another not just in terms of marketing and sales,but in terms of warranties and repairs as well.
