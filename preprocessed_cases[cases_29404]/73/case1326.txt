appellants,who are individuals and one corporation seek refunds of special district of columbia taxes enacted by the council of the district of columbia council to finance a new convention center.they alleged in their complaint that the mayor exceeded his authority under the district of columbia and governmental reorganization by collecting the special taxes under an expired statute,and that,notwithstanding later ratifications of the taxes by the council,they were deprived of property without procedural due process and just compensation.they also alleged tortious conversion of their money.the district court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.on appeal,appellants contend that the district court erred in holding that the district of columbia is a state for purposes of the federal tax injunction act,ftia,that the ftia barred their claims under supp.iii,and that their claims may only be presented in the superior court of the district of columbia after exhaustion of administrative remedies.
we need not decide whether the ftia applies to the district of columbia,nor whether the ftia bars appellants claim for monetary damages under.because congress has granted exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to district of columbia tax assessments to the district of columbia courts,see a b,we affirm the dismissal of the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
the washington convention center authority act of,law codified as amended at et act,increased certain income and franchise taxes and certain sales and use taxes on meals,beverages,auto rentals,and hotels.see act.the special taxes were dedicated to the construction of a new convention center in the district of columbia,see id,and the act required the authority board to submit to the mayor and council,within months,a report including a financial statement and feasibility analysis for the center construction.see id.h.the act also included a sunset provision,providing that the special taxes would expire after two years if the authority board failed to submit the report within months,or by september.see id.a.
weeks prior to the deadline for submission of the report,the council concluded that it would be necessary to extend the submission deadline,and thus extend the statute imposing the special taxes.on october,the council passed an emergency act,effective september,extending the submission deadline to months instead of months on december,the council passed a second emergency act,extending the submission date to months instead of months,until february,on january,the council also passed a temporary act,effective after congressional review on april,extending the submission deadline to february,then,in june,the council passed permanent legislation to repeal,as of february,the submission deadline in the temporary act the council report of the committee on finance and revenue stated that a repeal of the sunset provision would remove any concerns that the continued collection of the taxes is contingent upon factual determinations and conditions precedent.report of committee on finance and revenue,dated june,at.finally,in december,the council passed permanent legislation that stated n otwithstanding any other law,surtaxes and dedicated taxes shall be collected by the mayor,for the convention center,until the tax provisions are repealed by legislation enacted after september.this legislation,effective after congressional review on april,states that it applies as of september.
the act would appear to foreclose any argument that the council did not retroactively authorize the special taxes see generally united states heinszen.thomas network solutions.according to appellants complaint,however,the special tax laws expired during all or portions of the period from september,until august,yet the mayor continued to collect,and appellants continued to pay,the special taxes in an amount of not less than it is this amount,and similar amounts on behalf of the class of similarly situated taxpayers,for which appellants seek refunds.the mayor collection of the special taxes after the statute had expired is the basis for appellants allegation that the mayor acted ultra vires,beyond his authority under the act.appellants maintain that the temporary act and the act should not be interpreted to have retroactive application,and that to the extent the act is intended to have blanket retroactive effect,it is an unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation if administrative remedies can not reasonably be pursued.appellants further allege that because taxation is planned and systematic,not random,any reliance by the district of columbia on ratification,rather than prior legislative action,violates the due process clause,citing zinermon burch,d.in addition,appellants allege the tortious conversion of their money.they filed their complaint in the united states district court for the district of columbia,asserting that the district court had jurisdiction under,a,and.
in granting the motion of the washington convention center authority and the district of columbia to dismiss the complaint,the district court ruled that the district of columbia was a state for purposes of the ftia,and hence the ftia barred appellants constitutional claims under because appellants had an adequate remedy under district of columbia law that they had not exhausted because appellants did not seek a declaratory judgment or an order enjoining continued collection of the taxes,the district court ruled that it could not exercise jurisdiction under the multiplicity of suits rationale.regarding appellants statutory and tort claims under district of columbia law,the district court ruled that,in view of its lack of subject matter jurisdiction over appellants claims,it was precluded from exercising supplemental jurisdiction.
on appeal,appellants contend that the district court erred as a matter of law in holding that the district of columbia is a state under the ftia and in dismissing their claims under pursuant to the ftia.appellants also contend that they were not required to exhaust their remedies under district of columbia law,and,alternatively,if exhaustion is required,the administrative remedies were inadequate and exhaustion of them would be futile.in this regard,appellants maintain that because the money was taken from members of the class in countless daily transactions,each involving small amounts of money,it would be unreasonable to require them to keep records of each transaction in order to obtain relief under administrative tax refund remedies,see a,and that because the district of columbia position throughout this lawsuit has been adverse to their claims in every important respect,pursuing administrative remedies under district of columbia law would be futile.
in contending that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction of their complaint,appellants rely on transit system,pearson.they read that case to stand for the proposition that where anticipatory relief is not sought and appellants do not seek to enjoin current or future assessment or collection of the special taxes a suit in district court is not barred by the tax injunction act,in pearson,the court held that in view of adequate remedies under district of columbia law,a suit to enjoin collection of a district of columbia tax would not lie in the district court.at.our review of appellants jurisdictional contention is de novo.see zappia middle east construction emirate of abu dhabi,cir trauma service group united states.because congress has vested exclusive jurisdiction in the district of columbia courts over all challenges to assessments and claims for refunds of district of columbia taxes,we hold that the district court lacked jurisdiction of appellants complaint,and we do not reach appellants contentions regarding the ftia and the tax injunction act.
for many years the courts of the district of columbia were courts of limited jurisdiction and a variety of matters arising under district of columbia law were litigated in the federal courts of the district of columbia.congress changed that in the district of columbia court reform and cr
