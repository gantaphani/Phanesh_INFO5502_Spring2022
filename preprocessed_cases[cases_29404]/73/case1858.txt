we have for review the decision of the first district court of appeal in state department of highway safety motor vehicles sarnoff,so d dca,which is alleged to expressly and directly conflict with this court decision in department of revenue nemeth,so d,cert.denied,d.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.for the reasons explained below,we approve the first district decision.
material facts and proceedings below 
marc sarnoff is a member of a class of automobile owners petitioners who filed an action in the circuit court for declaratory judgment.petitioners challenged the constitutionality of section,florida statutes and the interpretation and implementation of the statute made by the department of highway safety and motor vehicles the department.the circuit court granted class certification.the department appealed the circuit court order granting certification to the first district court of appeal.the department argued that the circuit court had improperly exercised jurisdiction over the case because petitioners had failed to comply with the requirements of section florida statutes,which requires the filing of an administrative claim before bringing an action in circuit court the department also argued that this court decision in nemeth,which allows a taxpayer to file directly in circuit court without filing an administrative claim pursuant to section,was inapplicable to the instant case,because petitioners claim involved an challenge rather than a facial challenge to the constitutionality of a statute.
on appeal,the first district partially reversed the decision of the circuit court.see dep of highway safety motor vehicles sarnoff,so d,dca.the first district found that the circuit court did not have jurisdiction over count i of petitioners amended complaint because they had failed to seek relief from the comptroller pursuant to section the first district recognized that department of revenue nemeth,so d,provided a direct file exception to section.however,the first district reasoned that this court intended for the direct file exception in nemeth to be applicable to facial,rather than,challenges to the constitutionality of a statute.since petitioners challenged only the agency interpretation of section in count i,the first district found that the direct file exception did not apply.
law and analysis 
the resolution of this case requires a determination of the scope of this court decision in nemeth.in nemeth,a group of taxpayers who had failed to seek an administrative refund challenged the constitutionality of a statute imposing an impact fee on a certain class of automobiles.this court expressly held in nemeth 
a florida taxpayer may file directly in the appropriate court without filing an administrative claim pursuant to section if the sole basis for the refund is that the tax is unconstitutional.we recognize that the comptroller can not declare a tax unconstitutional,and thus,when the claim is solely that the refund is required because the tax is unconstitutional,to file the claim with the comptroller would be a futile act.
see id.at emphasis added.however,this court explained that a taxpayer qualifying for the exception is still required to file suit within three years of payment as required by section.
the nemeth decision clarified this court opinion in department of revenue kuhnlein,so d.in kuhnlein,the petitioners challenged the constitutionality of a statute imposing an impact fee on cars purchased or titled in other states by individuals later establishing permanent residency in florida.the state argued that the petitioners should be denied relief because they had failed to comply with the requirements of section,florida statutes.the court rejected this argument and,since the parties had raised a challenge to a facially unconstitutional statute,it held there was no need to request a refund pursuant to section.
since kuhnlein and nemeth involved facial challenges to the same statute,the first district reasoned that the exception created by the decisions should be interpreted as applying only to challenges to the facial validity of a statute.see sarnoff,so d at.
it is well accepted that a challenge to the facial constitutionality of a statute can not be resolved by an administrative agency.see dep t of revenue young am.builders,so d,dca.in key haven associated,board of trustees of internal improvement trust fund,so d,this court acknowledged that i f the statute being implemented by an agency is claimed to be facially unconstitutional,the circuit court may,in appropriate circumstances,entertain a declaratory action on the statute validity.when the administrative process can have no impact on the constitutional issues presented to the court,it would be pointless to require applicants to endure the time and expense of full administrative proceedings.see id.quoting gulf pines mem l park,oaklawn mem l park,so d.conversely,where an challenge to a rule is raised,courts have held that an individual must exhaust administrative remedies before proceeding to circuit court the court in key haven observed 
a suit in the circuit court requesting that court to declare an agency action improper because of such a constitutional deficiency in the administrative process should not be allowed a dministrative remedies must be exhausted to assure that the responsible agency has had a full opportunity to reach a sensitive,mature,and considered decision upon a complete record appropriate to the issue.
here,the crux of petitioners argument is based upon the assertion that this case involves a challenge to the validity of a tax statute.count i of petitioners complaint alleges that section is unconstitutional as implemented by the department because by charging a fee in excess of the actual cost of administration,the excess portion of the fee actually constitutes an unauthorized and unlawful tax.essentially,count i centers around the allegation that the fee imposed by the department rule is in excess of the amount actually needed to administer the program although petitioners have framed count i as a constitutional challenge to section,their challenge is really to the rule promulgated by the department to implement the statute.since petitioners are challenging an agency rule,the administrative process must be adhered to because adequate remedies may exist within the administrative realm.see,rice dep t of health rehabilitative,so d,dca holding that parents seeking to challenge the department rule which required the child of a married couple to be registered under the father surname must first exhaust administrative procedures before filing an action in court.
petitioners contend that section does not permit the comptroller to give a refund outside of the conditions detailed in the statute.section provides the mechanism for receiving a refund from the state.the purpose of this statute is to allow the comptroller to give refunds from the fund to which payment was made.see state ex.rel.hardaway contracting lee,so d.generally,an individual is required to request a refund under this statute before proceeding to circuit court.see westring state dep t of revenue,so d,dca.whenever a request for a refund does not fall within the statutory requirements,it is permissible for the comptroller to refuse to grant a refund.see estate of grant lewis,so d,dca,aff,so d.petitioners argue that it would be futile to seek relief from the comptroller pursuant to section,because the statute does not specifically give the comptroller the power to give a refund where the basis claimed for the refund is that the agency rule setting the fee is unconstitutional.
the first district considered a similar argument in florida livestock board hygrade food prod,so d dca.in that case hygrade filed an action in circuit court seeking a refund of inspection fees paid under protest to the florida livestock board.hygrade argued that the board was not lawfully authorized to inspect federally inspected frozen meat entering the state of florida and to charge a fee for such inspections.the circuit court entered summary judgment in favor of hygrade,and the board sought review.the board argued that becau
