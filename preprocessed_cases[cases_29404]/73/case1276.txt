the taxpayer appeals a decision of the tax court in favor of the government.we reverse.
procedural background 
in,taxpayer coggin automotive corporation coggin,a holding company,received two notices of deficiency from the commissioner of the internal revenue service commissioner alleging additional tax due the notices asserted that additional taxes were incurred during certain restructuring transactions when coggin,a c corporation,elected s status,thereby triggering a concomitant recapture pursuant to section d of the lifo inventory reserves held by partnerships in which coggin was a partner 
two theories were espoused by the commissioner.the first was that the coggin restructuring transactions were sham transactions,lacking business purpose.on this basis,the entire in lifo reserves owned by the partnerships would be recaptured by coggin over a period.section d.the alternative theory was that if the restructuring transactions were in fact bona fide transactions,only a pro rata share,or of the partnership lifo reserves would be recaptured and attributed to coggin 
in,coggin petitioned the tax court for a redetermination of the deficiencies.in,the tax court held that the restructuring transactions were undertaken for valid business purposes it concluded,however,that under the commissioner alternate theory,using an aggregate approach to partnerships viz.an entity approach to partnerships,coggin must include in income over a four year period,or its pro rata share of the partnerships lifo reserves recaptured pursuant to section d.
this appeal followed.
ii.factual background 
many of the facts were stipulated and are extensively set forth in the tax court opinion.see coggin automotive com r,wl.we recite only the pertinent ones here.
from to,coggin was a c corporation that operated in jacksonville,florida as a holding company.coggin owned varying majority interests in five c corporations the subsidiaries.the subsidiaries owned six automobile dealerships coggin,in its role as a holding company,did not own or operate any business.it owned stock in the subsidiary c corporations.the subsidiaries,in their role as the operating companies of the coggin holding company,ran the automobile dealerships.
the subsidiaries directly owned their inventories of automobiles and light trucks.these inventories were elected by the subsidiaries to be maintained under the lifo method of accounting coggin did not own any inventory.consequently coggin never made a lifo inventory election.
in,luther coggin,majority shareholder of coggin,and certain of the general managers of the dealerships,wanted to restructure operations in order to achieve certain tax independent business purposes to this end,coggin sought the advice of tax attorneys and accountants.
the shareholders of coggin created six new s corporations to act as general partners in six new limited partnerships each s corporation contributed cash in exchange for a general partnership interest in the limited partnerships.in turn,each subsidiary contributed the assets and liabilities of the automobile dealership,including its inventory,in exchange for a limited partnership interest 
thereafter the subsidiaries were liquidated into coggin.coggin became a limited partner in the limited partnerships.and finally,in the triggering event for purposes of this appeal,coggin elected subchapter s status in august,effective for its short taxable year beginning in june,and ending in december 
iii.standard of review 
the interpretation by the tax court of a statutory section of the internal revenue code is a question of law that we review de novo.see mclaulin com r,cir.
iv.discussion 
section of the internal revenue code,entitled effect of election on corporation,provides 
a general as otherwise provided in this subchapter,an s corporation shall not be subject to the taxes imposed by this chapter.
d recapture of lifo benefits.
a an s corporation was a c corporation for the last taxable year before the first taxable year for which the election under section a to become an s corporation was effective,and 
b the corporation inventoried goods under the lifo method for such last taxable year,
the lifo recapture amount shall be included in the gross income of the corporation for such last taxable year and appropriate adjustments to the basis of inventory shall be made to take into account the amount included in gross income under this paragraph.
the lifo recapture amount is defined in section d as the amount if any by which a the inventory amount of the inventory asset under the,method authorized by section,exceeds b the inventory amount of such assets under the lifo method.an inventory asset is defined in section d b as the stock in trade of the corporation,or other property of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the corporation if on hand at the close of the taxable year.
legislative history 
section d was added to the internal revenue code by congress in to supplement and strengthen the gains tax provisions of section as the conference committee explained 
thus,a c corporation using the,lifo method of accounting for its inventory which converts to s corporation status is not taxed under section on the gain attributable to lifo inventory to the extent it does not invade lifo layers during the period following the conversion.

tax court opinion 
there are two approaches to partnership treatment.the entity approach treats partnerships as separate entities in and of themselves,with separate interests being treated as owned by each of the partners.an aggregate approach treats partnerships as mere aggregates of their partners,each of whom directly owns an interest in the partnership assets and operations.as cited below,from time to time,the commissioner and the tax court utilize one and then the other in analyzing the tax consequences of partnership activity.
here,relying upon the legislative histories of sections and d,the tax court reasoned that the application of an aggregate approach better served congress intent to prevent corporations from avoiding a second level of taxation on gain assets by converting to s corporations.its rationale was that the line of cases applying the aggregate approach would prevent coggin from using the lifo method of accounting to permanently avoid gain recognition on appreciated assets see holiday village shopping ctr.united states,casel com r,wl unger com r.
the tax court recognized that subchapter k of the internal revenue code partners and partnerships blends both approaches outside of subchapter k,the tax court concluded it to be a tossup,whether the aggregate or the entity approach was to be applied appears to have depended upon which approach more appropriately served the code provision at issue.
without further analysis,the tax court concluded that both the legislative history and the statutory scheme of section d mandate the application of the aggregate approach,and deemed coggin to own a pro rata share of the dealerships inventories emphasis added.we disagree.
the tax court,while paying lip service to the statutory scheme of d,relies entirely upon the legislative history of section d and the line of cases using the aggregate approach,to provide an interpretation favorable to the commissioner in quantum leap fashion.it is unclear from the opinion exactly how the tax court concluded that congress intended this result.
most notably,no where in the opinion does the tax court address the plain meaning of the statute itself.therefore,that is where we must start.
the statutory scheme of section d 
under its plain language,section d will apply and recapture of lifo benefits will be triggered if two conditions are met a c corporation elects s corporation status under section a and the c corporation inventoried goods under the lifo method in the last taxable year before the first taxable year for which the election under section a was effective.
here it is clear that the first prong is met.however,it is apparent that,by definition,the second prong is not met.coggin never owned any inventories.accordingly it never made an election to use the lifo method.in fact
