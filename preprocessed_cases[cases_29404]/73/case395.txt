in response to a south carolina law banning video gaming machines from that state,north carolina amended its gambling statutes to prevent an influx of machines from south carolina.the revised statutes made the operation of certain machines illegal unless exempted by a grandfather clause under the statute.the statutes also authorized the immediate destruction of any unlawful machines.
plaintiff hicks helton owned and operated machines which became unlawful under the statute.helton filed a complaint challenging the constitutionality of the statutes.he argued that,which bans the operation of video gaming machines in north carolina unless the owner can establish that the machines were in lawful operation before june,and registered for ad valorem taxation by january,violates equal protection.helton further argued that,which authorizes all sheriffs and officers to immediately destroy any allegedly illegal machine by every means within their power,violates due process.we reverse the district court holding that violates equal protection,but uphold its decision that violates due process.
on july,south carolina enacted a law,effective july,banning all vending,slot,and video gaming machines.see ann.fearing that the ban would cause an influx of machines from south carolina,the north carolina general assembly amended portions of the north carolina criminal code to ban certain slot machines and other devices.see sess.laws.section a makes it unlawful to operate,allow to be operated,place into operation,or keep in possession for the purpose of operation any video gaming machine as defined in the section.a.
the statute does not ban all video gaming machines,however.section a contains a grandfather clause,exempting from the ban machines that were l awfully in operation,and available for play,within this state on or before june,and l isted in this state by january,for ad valorem taxation for the tax year.id.a.
the revised statute also makes it unlawful to warehouse any video gaming machine except in conjunction with the permitted assembly,manufacture,and transportation of such machines,and requires the owner of any video game machine regulated by the statute to register the machine with the sheriff in the county where the machine is located no later than october.id.i,m.finally,authorizes and directs all sheriffs and police officers to destroy any video gaming machine prohibited by the statutes by every means in their power and also authorizes them to call to their aid all the good citizens of the county,if necessary,to effect its destruction.id.
sometime in early,plaintiff hicks helton purchased new video gaming machines and put them into operation in rutherford county,north carolina.the machines were placed into operation before june,but not listed for ad valorem taxation by january.helton machines therefore did not fall under the grandfather clause of the statute and were in violation of a.
helton filed this action in the superior court for rutherford county,north carolina,on october,alleging that and violate the united states and north carolina constitutions.after the original complaint was dismissed as to certain individual defendants who were not proper parties to the action,helton filed an amended complaint naming rutherford county sheriff daniel good and rutherford county district attorney jeff hunt as defendants.the defendants removed the case to federal court in the western district of north carolina.
the defendants then moved for summary judgment.on july,the district court denied their motion and granted judgment in favor of helton.although the court acknowledged that north carolina objective of preventing an influx of machines from south carolina constituted a legitimate government objective,the court found that the two separate dates under the grandfather clause were not rationally related to that goal.the court also held that m was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to define the term warehousing.finally,the court struck down because it permits the seizure and destruction of unregistered machines without any benefit of notice or an opportunity to be heard.

helton argues that a violates equal protection by treating owners of machines brought into north carolina after january,differently than owners of machines brought into north carolina prior to that date.however unequal treatment alone does not constitute an equal protection violation.lawmaking by its nature requires that legislatures classify,and classifications by their nature advantage some and disadvantage others.helton correctly asserts that the classification in a treats owners of gambling machines differently based on the date on which the machines were present and operating in north carolina.where helton errs,however,is in the assumption that simply because such a classification seems unfair,it is also unconstitutional.defining the class of persons subject to a regulatory like classifying governmental beneficiaries inevitably requires that some persons who have an almost equally strong claim to favored treatment be placed on different sides of the line,and the fact that the line might have been drawn differently at some points is a matter for legislative,rather than judicial,consideration.fcc beach communications,d quoting united states retirement bd.fritz,d.
given the inherent difficulties in drawing lines and creating classifications,the supreme court has accorded legislative enactments a strong presumption of validity so long as they do not discriminate against any protected class or burden any fundamental right.id.at.a state enactment must be upheld so long as it bears a rational relation to some legitimate end.vacco quill,d citation omitted.in other words,where there are plausible reasons for the legislature action,our inquiry is at an end.beach communications,at.quoting fritz,at.
courts have further recognized that a state has a paramount interest in the health,welfare,safety,and morals of its citizens.johnson collins entm t,cir.and because t he regulation of lotteries,betting,poker,and other games of chance touch all of the above aspects of the quality of life of state citizens the regulation of gambling lies at the heart of the state police power.id.it is thus beyond question that north carolina has a legitimate government interest in the supervision of the video gaming industry.
we also find that a is rationally related to that interest.even if south carolina had not enacted a ban creating the potential for an influx of machines into north carolina,a would survive constitutional scrutiny.clearly,a state has the power to prohibit gambling altogether.posadas de puerto rico tourism of puerto rico,d.but there is no mandate that a state must address its problems wholesale.indeed,states are free to regulate by degree,one step at a time,addressing the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind.williamson lee optical of oklahoma.north carolina has a legitimate interest in restricting the number of new gaming machines in the state as a means of limiting the impact of gambling on the lives of its citizens or as a prelude to banning such a practice altogether.the establishment of two on which any such machine must have been in operation within the state and the other,earlier date upon which the machine must have been listed on the tax rolls rationally furthers that purpose.
helton takes particular aim at the requirement that his gambling machines be listed for ad valorem taxation by january,even though they need not have been in lawful operation until june.since helton did not purchase his machines until after january,the legislature enacted a provision with which he claims he could not possibly comply,despite his full compliance with the june requirement.none of this impugns,however,the rationality of the legislature scheme.as the state points out,machines entering north carolina in early but not registered on the tax rolls were highly likely to be migrating machines.moreover,those migrating machines,even if brought into north carolina early enough to satisfy the january requ
