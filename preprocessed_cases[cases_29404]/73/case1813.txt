in this case,we are asked to determine the constitutionality of public act the act,which imposed,for a period beginning on the effective date of the amendatory act,a surcharge on the four riverboat casinos in illinois that had adjusted gross receipts agr of over million in the calendar year.the remaining five riverboat casinos,all of which had agrs below million,were not subject to the surcharge.the act provided that the proceeds of the surcharge were to be distributed to the five horse racing tracks in illinois.for the reasons that follow,we hold that public act withstands the constitutional challenges raised,in the circuit court of will county,by the four casinos subject to the tax.
background 
the illinois legislature authorized riverboat casinos in under the riverboat gambling act ilcs et west.there are licenses available for riverboats in illinois nine are in use,the tenth is in litigation.the nine riverboat casinos are located in alton,aurora,east dubuque,east louis,elgin,joliet,metropolis,peoria,and rock island.four casinos have agrs over casino joliet,harrah casino cruises joliet,hollywood,and elgin riverboat casino.there are five horse racing tracks with live racing in illinois,located in arlington heights,crete,collinsville,and melrose park.
in may,the general assembly passed public act.the act requires those casinos with agrs over million to daily contribute of their agr into the horse racing equity trust fund.the act provides that the monies along with interest shall be distributed,within days of deposit into the fund,as follows to organization licensees to be distributed at their race meetings as purses and to racetracks to improve,maintain,market,and otherwise operate their racing facilities to conduct live racing,which shall include backstretch services and capital improvements related to live racing and the backstretch.distribution of the takes place as follows to fairmount park racetrack and to the other four tracks pro rata based on the aggregate proportion of total handle for calendar years and from wagering on live races conducted in illinois.
in enacting public act,the legislature made the following findings 
that riverboat gaming has had a negative impact on horse racing.from,the first full year of riverboat operations,through,illinois wagering has deceased by from million to million.
that this decrease in wagering has negatively impacted purses for illinois racing,which has hurt the state breeding industry.between and the number of foals registered with the department of agriculture has decreased by more th a n from to.
that the decline of the illinois horseracing and breeding program,a billion industry,would be reversed if this amendatory act of the general assembly was enacted.by requiring that riverboats agree to pay of their gross revenue into the horse racing equity trust fund,total purses in the state may increase by,helping illinois tracks to better compete with those in other states.illinois currently ranks thirteenth nationally in terms of its purse size the change would propel the state to second or third.
that illinois agriculture and other businesses that support and supply the horse racing industry,already a sector that employs over illinoisans,also stand to substantially benefit and would be much more likely to create additional jobs should illinois horse racing once again become competitive with other states.
that the of gross revenues this amendatory act of the general assembly will contribute to the horse racing industry will benefit that important industry for illinois farmers,breeders,and fans of horseracing and will begin to address the negative impact riverboat gaming has had on illinois horseracing.pub.act,eff.may.
plaintiffs,empress casino joliet corporation,des plaines development limited partnership harrah casino cruises joliet,hollywood,and elgin riverboat casino grand victoria casino,filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against defendants,alexi giannoulias as the treasurer of the state of illinois and the illinois racing board.
in count i,plaintiffs alleged that the act violates the takings clause article i,section and the due process clause article i,section of the illinois constitution,as well as the due process clause of the united states constitution,because the surcharge is used for a primarily private use.in count ii,plaintiffs alleged that the act violates article viii,section the public funds clause,of the illinois constitution because the surcharge was imposed for a private purpose only.in count iii,plaintiffs alleged that the act violates the uniformity clause article ix,section of the illinois constitution as well as the equal protection clauses of the illinois and federal constitutions.lastly,in count iv,plaintiffs alleged that the act violates the special legislation provision article iv,section of the illinois constitution because the surcharge confers a benefit on a particular private group without a reasonable basis,rather than promoting the general welfare of the state.plaintiffs sought a declaration that the act is unconstitutional and a permanent injunction against the imposition or collection of the surcharge.plaintiffs have paid the surcharge under protest pursuant to the state officers and employees money disposition act ilcs west.
balmoral park racing club,hawthorne race course,maywood park trotting association,the national jockey club,and the illinois harness horsemen association were granted leave to intervene on behalf of defendants.
the parties eventually filed for summary judgment.the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs,holding that the act is invalid because it violates the uniformity clause of the illinois constitution.the circuit court found there was no real and substantial difference between the four casinos taxed and the five casinos not taxed and that no reasonable relationship had been provided for the classification.in so finding,the circuit court rejected defendants contention that the classification for the taxed casinos was reasonable since those casinos making over million agr were better able to absorb the surcharge.the court found that the justification was insufficient.
because the circuit court invalidated an illinois statute,defendants and intervenors appeal directly to this court.see a.

we also review the constitutionality of a statute de novo.arangold,at.statutes bear a presumption of constitutionality,and broad latitude is afforded to legislative classifications for taxing purposes.allegro services,metropolitan pier exposition authority.the party challenging a nonproperty tax classification carries the burden of rebutting that presumption and clearly establishing the act unconstitutionality by showing that it is arbitrary or unreasonable.allegro services,at.we have a duty to uphold a statute as constitutional whenever reasonably possible.arangold,at.
uniformity challenge 
standards for a uniformity challenge 
article ix,section,of the illinois constitution provides 
in any law classifying the subjects or objects of taxes or fees,the classes shall be reasonable and the subjects and objects within each class shall be taxed uniformly.exemptions,deductions,credits,refunds and other allowances shall be reasonable.const,art.ix.
the standards for evaluating a challenge to a statute based on the uniformity clause are well established 
to survive scrutiny under the uniformity clause,a nonproperty tax classification must be based on a real and substantial difference between the people taxed and those not taxed,and bear some reasonable relationship to the object of the legislation or to public policy.arangold,at.
relying on language from this court decision in arangold,plaintiffs initially contend that,to satisfy the second prong of the uniformity test,the tax must be designed to remedy a special burden the class in question has imposed on the state or must confer a specific benefit on the class taxed.
in arangold,wholesale distributors of cigars and chewing tobacco challenged a tax on their products to fund care for skilled and intermediate nursing facilities,particularly for those unable to afford the cost of such care,as a violation of due process and the uniformity clause.we rejected both challenges.with respect to the uniformity challenge,we concluded that the plaintiffs failed to satisfy their burden to show that the asserted justification for the classification was unsupported by the facts.arangold,at.
plaintiffs maintain that,while the tax was found reasonable in arangold,we must reach an opposite result here.plaintiffs argue that the critical difference between the instant case and arangold is that the general assembly here could not rationally believe the responsibility to pay for subsidizing the horse racing industry rests with the state.moreover,plaintiffs contend that whatever harm the casinos have caused to the horse racing industry,it can not possibly be deemed a burden imposed by the casinos on the state since the state has no responsibility to support the horse racing industry.
plaintiffs contention that the tax levied against them must be designed to remedy a special burden the casinos imposed on the state in order for the classification to bear a reasonable relationship to the statute is incorrect.plaintiffs take comments this court made in arangold in connection with our due process discussion and attempt to interject them into the uniformity analysis.in arangold,when discussing the second prong of a due process challenge,whether the statute bears a reasonable relationship to the interest intended to be protected,we noted that the general assembly could have believed the responsibility to assist the poor with care rests with the state,that persons often need care due to their use of tobacco products,and thus,distributors of tobacco products should bear some measure of the costs through taxation.from this comment,plaintiffs attempt to engraft onto the second prong of the uniformity analysis a requirement that the tax must be designed to remedy some burden the taxed class has imposed on the state in order to satisfy that prong.we reject this argument.
when discussing the plaintiffs challenge under the uniformity clause in arangold,this court never held that,in order to bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the legislation,the tax must be designed to remedy some burden the taxed class imposed on the state.the language in arangold on which plaintiffs rely was never part of the standard for assessing a uniformity challenge.rather,it was one factor we considered when,in relation to the plaintiffs due process challenge,we determined whether the statute at issue in arangold bore a reasonable relationship to the interest sought to be protected.accordingly,we find no support for plaintiffs claims that a tax will violate the uniformity clause unless it is designed to remedy a special burden of the state.
plaintiffs alternative argument is that the tax at issue here may be upheld only if the casinos stand to benefit from the tax in some special way.because it is undisputed the casinos will not benefit from the subsidy,plaintiffs maintain the surcharge is not reasonably related to the purpose of the legislation.we are unpersuaded by this argument.
we have repeatedly held that a tax may be imposed upon a class even though the class enjoys no benefit from the tax.see,arangold,at,n othing is more familiar in taxation than the imposition of a tax upon a class or upon individuals who enjoy no direct benefit from its expenditure,and who are not responsible for the condition to be remedied,quoting carmichael southern coal coke.accordingly,we reject plaintiffs attempts to alter the standards for analyzing uniformity clause challenges.we reiterate to survive scrutiny under the uniformity clause,a nonproperty tax classification must be based on a real and substantial difference between the people taxed and those not taxed,and bear some reasonable relationship to the object of the legislation or to public policy.arangold,at.
in relation to the first a real and substantial difference exists between those taxed and those not has been recognized that t he party attacking a tax classification is not required to negate every conceivable basis that might support it.arangold,at.rather,once the plaintiff establishes a uniformity challenge,the taxing body must produce a justification for the classification.geja cafe metropolitan pier exposition authority.it then becomes the plaintiff burden to persuade the court that the justification is insufficient,either as a matter of law or as unsupported by the facts.geja cafe,at.if the plaintiff can not do so,then,as a matter of law,judgment is proper for the taxing body.geja cafe,at.
we further explained the nature of the uniformity clause in arangold 
the uniformity clause was intended to be a broader limitation on legislative power to classify for nonproperty tax purposes than the limitation of the equal protection clause searle pharmaceuticals,department of revenue,and was meant to insure that taxpayers would receive added protection in the state constitution based upon a standard of reasonableness that is more rigorous than that contained in the federal constitution milwaukee safeguard,at.despite the more stringent standard under the uniformity clause,the scope of a court inquiry is relatively narrow.allegro,at.i n a uniformity clause challenge the court is not required to have proof of perfect rationality as to each and every taxpayer.the uniformity clause was not designed as a straitjacket for the general assembly.rather,the uniformity clause was designed to enforce minimum standards of reasonableness and fairness as between groups of taxpayers.geja cafe,at.arangold,at.
when a plaintiff challenges a legislative classification,he has the burden of showing the classification is arbitrary or unreasonable.geja cafe,at.if a set of facts can be reasonably conceived that would sustain it,the classification must be upheld.geja cafe,at.
in the case at bar,the parties do not dispute that the act creates two classifications all casinos and casinos with an agr over million.the question before us is whether these two classifications are arbitrary or unreasonable.the circuit court found only that the agr classification violated the uniformity clause.however,plaintiffs argue to this court that the classification relating to the casinos as a whole is also invalid.we address this classification first,because if that classification fails,the agr classification would necessarily fail as well.
casinos classification 
plaintiffs contend that the act violates the uniformity clause because the general assembly stated reason for singling out casinos for taxation,repairing damage to the horse racing industry,fails the rational basis test applied under uniformity clause analysis.
defendants and intervenors,however,claim that the classification is reasonable and not arbitrary.they note that the object of the legislation at issue here was to reverse the decline in the horse racing industry.the legislature justification for the surcharge,as expressly set forth by the general assembly in the act,was that the casinos have had a negative impact on that industry.
since a justification has been produced,it is incumbent upon plaintiffs to establish that the justification is insufficient as a matter of law or that it is unsupported by the facts.in their attempt to do so,plaintiffs offer a report entitled a review of racing in illinois with a comparison to national trends in wagering,compiled by eugene christiansen of christiansen capital advisors,a company that performs studies of the economic,management,operation,taxation and regulation of leisure and entertainment businesses in the united states and abroad.the report purports to provide trends in illinois horse race wagering between and,together with comparison of trends in illinois horse racing with contemporary trends in horse racing in the united states as a whole in states with horse racing but no casinos and in states with horse racing and casinos.
christiansen concludes in this report 
these trends and comparisons do not support the statement that illinois riverboat casinos were the sole,or even the main,factor in the decrease of wagering at racetracks in illinois.the decline in wagering at illinois racetracks is principally due to betting,which shifted a large amount of wagers from racetracks to otb facilities,while increasing total wagering on horse races.
further,christiansen opines 
l icensed interactive betting services,unlicensed interactive betting services located in other countries,and interactive betting services licensed in other countries that accept bets from residents also contribute to the decline in live handle by shifting wagers from live and simulcast facilities to personal computers and interactive television.simulcasting,betting and internet and other interactive bettor services including telephone account wagering were developments internal to the horseracing industry.they were not consequences of casino gaming,in illinois or in the united states.
in the case at bar,the legislature has provided express findings regarding the necessity of the tax imposed on the casinos.the general rule regarding such findings has been explained 
courts are not empowered to adjudicate the accuracy of legislative findings.the legislative authority is broad and should be accorded great deference by the judiciary.therefore,to the extent the affidavits of record may have been offered to contest the wisdom of the legislative enactment,we reiterate that the legislature is not required to convince this court of the correctness of its judgment.see bernier,at,citing vance bradley,d,see also cutinello whitley.our task is limited to determining whether the challenged legislation is constitutional,and not whether it is wise.best taylor machine works.
while it is clear that christiansen holds a view different from that of the legislature as to the cause of the decline in the horse racing industry,that view does not render the legislative findings insufficient.simply because christiansen report suggests that casinos are not the sole reason for the decline of horse racing does not mean that plaintiffs have satisfied their burden of establishing that the justification for the classification is arbitrary or unreasonable.giving the legislative findings the deference they must be accorded see best,at,we conclude there is a reasonable relationship between the classification and object of the legislation.
agr classification 
as previously noted,the circuit court in the case at bar held there was no real and substantial difference between the four casinos taxed and the five that were not and,as a result,there was no reasonable relationship between the agr classification and the object of the act.before this court,plaintiffs ask us to uphold this finding.
defendants and intervenors,however,contend that the casinos with an agr over million can better absorb the surcharge and that this is a proper basis for distinguishing the casinos.defendants and intervenors maintain that the circuit court decision must be reversed because plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of demonstrating that this justification for the agr classification is insufficient as a matter of law or unsupported by the facts.
initially we note that one reason the circuit court ruled as it did was because it held that the general assembly did not set forth its justification for the agr classification within the act itself.defendants and intervenors contend that this was error on the circuit court part.we agree.
although none of the cases cited by the parties directly analyze this question,it is evident from case law that the legislature is not required to state its justification for a classification within an act.as this court has stated the reasons justifying the classification,moreover,need not appear on the face of the statute,and the classification must be upheld if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain it.department of revenue warren petroleum.we conclude,therefore,that the legislature is not required to provide its justification for a classification within the statute itself.the circuit court holding to the contrary was in error.
on a related issue,plaintiffs argue that the ability to absorb justification fails because it is at odds with the expressly stated purpose of the act,which is to address the harm created by casinos to horse track racing.plaintiffs maintain that,when the legislature states its purpose within an act,a classification can not later be upheld on other grounds.in support of this argument,plaintiffs rely on primeco personal communications,illinois commerce.
in primeco,a municipal infrastructure maintenance fee was imposed by certain municipalities on telecommunications retailers.the plaintiffs were wireless telecommunications retailers who argued that the fee violated the uniformity clause because the fee was intended as a means of compensating municipalities for the physical occupation of the public by telecommunication providers.because the plaintiffs,being wireless,did not physically occupy any public,they argued that they should not be subject to the fee.primeco,at.the defendants denied that the fee was a means of compensating municipalities for their occupation of the public and instead argued that the fee was a means of raising revenue.the circuit court found that the object of the fee was to compensate municipalities for use of the.because the wireless retailers did not use these,the court held the classification as applied to plaintiffs was unreasonable.primeco,at.we affirmed the circuit court and held there was no reasonable relationship between the classification and the object of the legislation.
plaintiffs maintain that primeco held that when the general assembly expressly sets forth the purpose of a tax,the taxing body can not defend against a uniformity challenge by offering a different rationale.however,this language appears nowhere in primeco,nor can it be implied from other language in the opinion.primeco simply does not so hold.
we find primeco distinguishable for another reason.the defendants in primeco were attempting to define the purpose of the act itself,not the justification for a classification.in the case at bar,defendants and intervenors do not assert,as plaintiffs maintain,that the purpose for imposing the surcharge was based on the ability to absorb.instead,they assert that the agr classification is based on the ability to absorb the costs.
defendants have produced a justification for the classification,the ability to absorb the surcharge,which the general assembly could reasonably have concluded was a rational justification.it is therefore incumbent upon plaintiffs to show that the justification is insufficient as a matter of law or unsupported by the facts.plaintiffs contend that the defendants justification fails because it is not supported by the facts.plaintiffs maintain that,if the general assembly was concerned about a casino ability to absorb the cost,it would have set the measuring point of the casinos financial condition at the time the surcharge was paid,rather than the agr.plaintiffs assert that this retrospective view suggests the million limit was arbitrarily selected to insulate the downstate casinos from the tax and was not a point at which a casino could afford to absorb the surcharge.plaintiffs further argue that the million agr was selected by the legislature because it allowed the downstate casinos to be exempt from the tax and that exempting the downstate casinos from the tax was the only way the legislature was able to get the act passed.
we are unpersuaded by plaintiffs arguments.first,plaintiffs have not shown that there is no real and substantial difference between the downstate casinos and the upstate casinos,which are the ones that have agrs over million.the fact is,however,that the downstate casinos average intake is between and million per month,while the upstate casinos,located in more populated areas,have an average intake of to million per month.this is a substantial difference.
moreover,plaintiffs suggestion that a different method for determining the financial condition of the casinos for deciding whether to impose the surcharge is impractical.it would be inconceivable to measure the financial condition of the casinos at the time they were required to pay the surcharge.the act requires the surcharge to be levied on a daily basis.it would be logistically impossible to measure the financial condition of each casino every single day.the legislature had to set some measuring point.since the bill was introduced in,the figures were the most recent financial figures and,thus,a logical choice to use as the measuring point.
further,plaintiffs suggestion that setting the measuring stick at million was the result of a legislative compromise is not a relevant consideration.the justification itself is the critical focus.if the justification is reasonable,any further inquiry into the motives of the legislature is improper.donovan holzman,court is not at liberty to inquire into the motives of the legislature.plaintiffs arguments fail to persuade us that the justification for the agr classification is not supported by the facts.
plaintiffs further argue that mere quantitative differences in agr between otherwise identical businesses should never be enough,alone,to justify an exemption from a fee.plaintiffs maintain that a qualitative difference must exist between the five casinos below the million threshold and the four above it,and that none exists here,because all casinos have the similar ability to incorporate the cost of the surcharge into the services they provide.
initially,we do not accept plaintiffs premise that all casinos are identical.while it may be true that all casinos might be able to incorporate a surcharge into their services and pass the charge along to customers,this does not mean the casinos are identical.
more fundamentally,however,we agree with defendants that the uniformity clause allows subclassifications and exclusions as long as they are reasonable.as such,quantitative differences in agr may be sufficient to justify a classification.we have previously held that there need not be proof of perfect rationality as to each and every taxpayer.arangold,at.
we conclude that plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of demonstrating there is no real and substantial difference between the two groups of casinos.plaintiffs have not shown the classification is arbitrary or unreasonable.accordingly,we conclude that the circuit court erred in holding that the act violates the uniformity clause of the illinois constitution.
ii.public use and public purpose 
in an alternative argument in support of the circuit court judgment,plaintiffs claim that the act is unconstitutional because the subsidy to the horse racing tracks primarily benefits private parties and not the public.in making this argument,plaintiffs rely on the takings clause of the federal constitution and article viii,section,of the illinois constitution.
the federal takings clause provides nor shall private property be taken for public use,without just compensation,amend.v.this provision is made applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment,amend.xiv.southwestern illinois development authority national city environmental.article i,section,of the illinois constitution,the illinois takings clause,provides private property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without just compensation as provided by law.const,art.i.
plaintiffs maintain that the surcharge should be deemed a taking because it is not characterized in the act as a tax,but a license fee,because it does not have the fundamental characteristic of a tax in that it does not support government or government programs and because it is imposed as a condition of the casinos continuation of a valuable property licenses.plaintiffs argue that a takings analysis should apply whenever the government takes property,whether real or monetary,from one party and gives it to another and that there is a need for heightened scrutiny to ensure a public purpose is being served.
we reject plaintiffs assertion that a takings analysis applies here.it is well settled that the takings clauses of the federal and state constitutions apply only to the state exercise of eminent domain and not to the state power of taxation.see county of mobile kimball,but neither is taxation for a public purpose,however great,the taking of private property for public use,in the sense of the constitution.the west virginia supreme court has aptly stated this rule 
courts universally have concluded that the takings clauses of the various state and federal constitutions do not apply in the context of taxing statutes,because the power to tax is a separate constitutional power from the power to take property by eminent domain.case law from the united states supreme court and federal and state courts throughout the country makes clear that the constitutional takings clause is not a limitation upon the taxing power conferred upon legislatures by their respective constitutions.see brushaber union pacific railroad,the due process clause of the fifth amendment is not a limitation upon the taxing power conferred upon congress by the constitution branch,e ven though taxes indisputably take money from individuals or businesses,assessments of that kind are not treated as per se takings magnano hamilton.taxing power of state or federal government not considered a taking under the fifth or fourteenth amendment.in re estate of lewis.
see also gilman city of sheboygan,black.see generally d state local taxation,at the takings clause is appl icable to the power of eminent domain,but not to the power of taxation.
the same principle applies to fees,whether for certain services or licensing.in mlade finley,d,the plaintiffs challenged certain circuit court filing fees as a violation of,inter alia,the takings clause.mlade,d at.the appellate court rejected the plaintiffs argument because the just compensation takings clause provisions.const,art.i,amends.v and xiv,apply only to exercises of the power of eminent domain,not to applications of the authority to raise revenue for public purposes.see zelney murphy.mlade,d at.see also alaska fish salting smith.numerous other cases have held the same.see,laredo road maverick county,texas,d corporation shiffrin,d san remo hotel city county of san francisco,cal th,d rinn bedford,city of thomson davis,bha investments,state,idaho,jordan city of evansville,bobbie preece facility commonwealth of kentucky,department of charitable gaming,board of trustees of falmouth watson,state ex rel.interstate.paul metropolitan airports comm n,rogers hennepin county,president riverboat,missouri gaming comm n,dunn mayor council of city of hoboken,kisslinger appeal,wl smith cortes,lamb whitaker.
ignoring this wealth of law,plaintiffs point to northern illinois home builders ass county of du page,where this court applied a takings analysis to a municipality imposition of transportation impact fees.in northern illinois home builders ass n,a fee was imposed in connection with land.specifically,a fee was imposed on persons constructing new housing developments to fund road improvements made necessary in light of the expected traffic growth from the development.northern illinois home builders ass n,at.the fee at issue in northern illinois home builders ass was inextricably tied to real property and,thus,a takings analysis was appropriate.
the same is not true here.the surcharge is in no way tied to real property.as such,northern illinois home builders ass does not support plaintiffs claim that a takings analysis is applicable here.
plaintiffs also cite to eastern enterprises apfel,d plurality op,to support their argument that a takings analysis may be applied to a monetary obligation.however,we find plaintiffs reliance on apfel misplaced.
in apfel,a plurality of justices chief justice rehnquist,and justices,scalia and thomas applied a takings analysis to a monetary obligation,but a majority of the justices rejected the theory that an obligation to pay money co
