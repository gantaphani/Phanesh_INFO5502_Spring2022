introduction 
plaintiffs,owners of a retail center and food court,sought a judicial declaration that they had acquired a prescriptive easement for parking and access by their tenants customers,employees,suppliers,and other invitees,over an alleyway behind the owners property.the alleyway is located on plaintiffs property and two adjoining properties.a railway easement ran along the same land as the alleyway property taxes were assessed on the railway easement,and the holder of the railway easement paid those taxes.
defendant owners of the two adjoining properties filed motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication.the trial court granted the motions and entered judgment,concluding that no prescriptive easement in favor of plaintiffs had arisen on defendants properties because plaintiffs did not pay property taxes on the separately assessed railway easement.plaintiffs appeal.
we reverse the order granting summary adjudication and hold that because the railway easement was not coextensive in use with plaintiffs claimed prescriptive easement,payment of taxes by plaintiffs on the separately assessed railway easement was not an element of their claim for a prescriptive easement.
the trial court also granted the summary judgment motion filed by one of the adjoining property owners.code of civil procedure section,subdivision g requires that an order granting summary judgment specify the reasons for the court determination and refer to the evidence showing no triable issue of material fact exists.neither the court minute order,nor the formal order prepared by the prevailing party,complies with these requirements.the two issues raised by the summary judgment motion were never addressed by the trial court at the hearing on the motion.the appellate record does not provide sufficient information to permit meaningful appellate review of these issues.accordingly,we also reverse the order granting summary judgment.
statement of facts and procedural history 
the parties and their properties 
the main street plaza,a partnership,the kenneth bourguignon and dorothy bourguignon family trust dated october,and the bourguignon family limited partnership collectively referred to herein as main street plaza are the owners of a parcel of real property located at main street in irvine,california the main street parcel.the property has been developed as a retail center and food court.the main street parcel is bordered on the north by main street,from which the parcel has vehicular access to the parking lot.
cartwright main,llc,owns a parcel of real property located at main street,adjacent to the main street parcel,which is bordered by main street on the north,cartwright road on the west,and the main street parcel on the east the c m parcel.the c m parcel is improved with an industrial building.
cartwright real estate holdings,llc creh,owns the property located at cartwright road the creh parcel,which is bordered on the west by cartwright road,and on the north by both the main street parcel and the c m parcel.the creh parcel is improved with an industrial building and a parking lot.
a foot wide alleyway runs along the boundary line between the main street parcel and the c m parcel,and the creh parcel the alleyway at the eastern boundary of the main street parcel and the creh parcel.a conditional easement for railway purposes was originally granted to the atchison,topeka and santa fe railway company,predecessor in interest to bnsf railway company bnsf,to run over what is now the alleyway.the railway easement burdened a and one half foot wide strip of land along the southern border of the main street parcel and the c m parcel,and along the northern border of the creh parcel.bnsf railway easement rights were assessed property taxes separate from the taxes assessed against the fee interest for each of the three affected parcels.bnsf paid the taxes assessed against its property interests in california,including taxes assessed against its railway easement main street plaza never paid any of the taxes assessed against bnsf railway easement.
main street plaza claimed that,beginning in and continuing uninterrupted until september,its tenants and their employees and invitees have used the alleyway for parking,making deliveries,and turning their vehicles around.main street plaza therefore claimed a prescriptive easement for such uses over that portion of the alleyway that covers the c m parcel and the creh parcel 
the complaint 
in august,main street plaza sued cartwright main and creh for a declaration to quiet title to its prescriptive easement in the alleyway fourth and fifth causes of action,and for declaratory relief sixth and seventh causes of action.a verified first amended complaint,which is the operative complaint,was filed on september.klein investments family limited partnership klein,the owner of the creh parcel,was later added as a doe defendant.in this opinion,the term creh will also include klein.
main street plaza complaint also alleged causes of action against bnsf for breach of contract,rescission,declaratory relief,and to quiet title to a prescriptive easement.after the lawsuit was filed,cartwright main and creh bought bnsf railway easement rights encumbering their respective properties.bnsf thereafter disclaimed any interest in the property,and did not participate further in the case.
cartwright main and creh each filed its own against main street plaza and others,seeking to quiet title,and for declaratory relief and damages due to trespass.
the motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication 
cartwright main moved for summary adjudication of main street plaza causes of action against cartwright main for declaratory relief and to quiet title,arguing main street plaza could not prove a required element for a prescriptive easement that main street plaza had paid the taxes due on the separately assessed railway easement.creh moved for summary judgment of main street plaza causes of action against creh,arguing main street plaza could not obtain a prescriptive easement against creh because creh had leased the creh parcel to a tenant during a portion of the period in which the alleged easement arose,and the alleged easement would be incompatible with the main street parcel conditional use permit and local ordinances and regulations.creh also filed a joinder in the arguments and evidence offered by cartwright main in support of its motion for summary adjudication.cartwright main similarly filed a joinder in creh motion for summary judgment.
following briefing and a hearing,the trial court granted both motions.the trial court minute order reads the motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication are granted.moving parties have met their burden to establish that the railroad easement was separately assessed.glatts henson cal d.in the statement of undisputed facts,main street plaza did not dispute that the easement was separately assessed.therefore,plaintiffs can not establish a required element for a prescriptive easement.gilardi hallam cal d.plaintiffs failed to establish that there was a triable issue of material fact.italics added.
the orders granting the motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication 
on october,the trial court entered an order prepared by creh counsel granting creh motion for summary judgment that order did not specify the reasons for the court determination.
on december,the trial court entered a detailed order granting cartwright main motion for summary adjudication.in relevant part,the order reads as follows 
cartwright main is entitled to summary adjudication of plaintiffs fourth cause of action to quiet title in plaintiffs favor to the alleged prescriptive easement burdening cartwright main parcel because plaintiffs can not,as a matter of law,establish a required element for a prescriptive easement burdening cartwright main parcel.in addition,creh is entitled to summary adjudication of plaintiffs fifth cause of action to quiet title in plaintiffs favor to the alleged prescriptive easement burdening creh parcel because plaintiffs can not,as a matter of law,establish a required element for a prescriptive easement burdening creh parcel.
plaintiffs allege a prescriptive easement burdening the portions of the parcels owned by cartwright main and creh that were each burdened by a foot wide railroad easement for a total width of feet in favor of bnsf railway company plaintiffs also alleged that at no time after did bnsf railway or its predecessor entity pay any separately assessed taxes on the easement property 
cartwright main and creh,however,have met their burden to establish that the bnsf railway railroad easement that burdened their respective parcels was separately assessed.citations.plaintiffs did not dispute that the railroad easement was separately assessed it was also undisputed that plaintiffs did not pay the taxes that were separately assessed on the railroad easement therefore,plaintiffs can not establish a required element for a prescriptive easement,namely,that they paid the taxes that were separately assessed against the railroad easement that burdened the same foot wide portions of the cartwright main and creh parcels over which plaintiffs asserted a prescriptive easement.citations.plaintiffs also failed to establish that there was a triable issue of material fact as to this element of their prescriptive easement claim.
cartwright main is also entitled to summary adjudication on plaintiffs sixth cause of action for a declaration of rights declaring that plaintiffs have established a prescriptive easement burdening cartwright main parcel because plaintiffs can not,as a matter of law,establish a required element for a prescriptive easement,for the same reasons as set forth above as to plaintiffs fourth cause of action against cartwright main.and creh is entitled to summary adjudication on plaintiffs seventh cause of action for a declaration of rights declaring that plaintiffs have established a prescriptive easement burdening creh parcel because plaintiffs can not,as a matter of law,establish a required element for a prescriptive easement,for the same reasons as set forth above as to plaintiffs fifth cause of action against creh.
the additional allegations in plaintiffs sixth and seventh causes of action concerning bnsf railway do not preclude summary adjudication of those causes of action as to cartwright main and creh regardless,the other allegations in plaintiffs sixth and seventh causes of action have been made moot by events subsequent to plaintiffs filing their first amended complaint on september,specifically,in both their sixth and seventh causes of action,plaintiffs seek a declaration of rights as to the portion of bnsf railway easement that burdened the parcel owned by plaintiffs bnsf railway,however,filed a disclaimer of interest in this action on october,disclaiming any rights it had as to the portion of the railway easement burdening plaintiffs parcel 
plaintiffs sixth and seventh causes of action also seek a declaration concerning the scope of bnsf railway easement as to the parcels owned by plaintiffs,cartwright main,and creh,respectively,that use of the paved alleyway for access and for parking does not interfere with or endanger use by bnsf railway of the stub line easement.this issue is irrelevant because plaintiffs can not establish a necessary element of a prescriptive easement burdening cartwright main and creh parcels.it has also been made moot by events since the time plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint on september.specifically,the undisputed evidence shows that bnsf railway conveyed its easement rights burdening cartwright main parcel and creh parcel to cartwright main and creh,respectively,by quitclaim deeds recorded on october,
the legal conclusion to be drawn from this undisputed evidence is that,because the bnsf railway easement burdening cartwright main parcel,creh parcel and plaintiffs parcel ceased to exist,at the latest,as of the date of the quitclaim deeds and bnsf railway disclaimer of interest,any issues concerning interference with the railway easement are moot as to plaintiffs sixth and seventh causes of action against cartwright main and creh.
the judgment 
pursuant to the parties stipulation,the trial court entered judgment,in relevant part,as follows 
it is hereby ordered and adjudged as follows 
that judgment is entered in favor of creh and against plaintiffs on creh first amended cross complaint solely on the same grounds as the october,order granting creh motion for summary judgment and the december,order granting cartwright main motion for summary adjudication

that judgment is entered in favor of cartwright main and against plaintiffs as to plaintiffs first amended complaint,and in favor of cartwright main and against plaintiffs on cartwright main first amended cross complaint,solely on the same grounds as the december,order granting cartwright main motion for summary adjudication 
that,because of bnsf railway october,disclaimer of interest it is hereby adjudged that the main street plaza property is not encumbered by any easement in favor of bnsf railway or in favor of any predecessor of bnsf railway,and that the original grant of easement to bnsf railway or its predecessor in interest burdening the main street property is of no further force or effect as to the main street property 
that,based on paragraph of this judgment that the main street property is not encumbered by any easement in favor of bnsf railway or any predecessor of bnsf railway because of the disclaimer of interest,plaintiffs first,second,and third causes of action in their first amended complaint against bnsf railway are dismissed without prejudice as moot.
main street plaza timely appealed.
the judgment did not resolve main street plaza first amended complaint against creh.in supplemental briefing and a stipulation,the affected parties agreed that the judgment was intended to resolve all causes of action in all operative pleadings,and the failure of the judgment to resolve main street plaza causes of action against creh was a scrivener error.the issues related to the causes of action against creh in the first amended complaint have been fully briefed by the parties on appeal.the parties also agree that this court has the authority to order amendment of an judgment to make it constitute a final appealable judgment.molien kaiser foundation hospitals cal d,tenhet boswell cal d,swain california casualty ins.th.
