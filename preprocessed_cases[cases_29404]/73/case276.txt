opinion of the court 
neal crispin appeals the decision of the united states tax court that he was not entitled to an ordinary loss deduction for his participation in a custom adjustable rate debt structure cards transaction and that he is liable for an penalty under of the internal revenue code the tax court disallowed the claimed loss on the grounds that crispin cards transaction lacked economic substance and held that he could not avoid the penalty because he had not relied reasonably or in good faith on the advice of an independent and qualified tax professional.for the following reasons,we will affirm.
background 
crispin is a businessman who has engaged in various enterprises over the years,some through his,murus equities,murus.among other things,he has been involved in leasing,structured finance,aircraft acquisition,and securities investing.he practiced as a certified public accountant and served as chief financial officer of an energy company,before pursuing opportunities in structured finance and aircraft leasing.crispin has had long and varied experience with tax matters,including tax shelters.
since,crispin has been in the business of purchasing and leasing commercial turboprop aircraft through investment syndicates.according to crispin,his aircraft leasing business purchases used aircraft costing between million and million and leases them for approximately ten years before reselling them.prior to his participation in the cards transaction that is the subject of this appeal,crispin had identified three aircraft the aircraft that he expected would be available for purchase in and that he says he planned to have murus purchase 
a cards transaction is a scheme that was widely marketed to wealthy individuals during the and early.it purports to generate,through a series of steps,large paper losses deductible from ordinary income.first,a party,such as a foreign entity not subject to united states taxation,borrows foreign currency from a foreign bank a cards loan.then,a united states taxpayer purchases a small amount,such as percent,of the borrowed foreign currency by assuming liability for a an equal amount of the cards loan.the taxpayer also agrees to be jointly liable with the foreign borrower for the remainder of the cards loan and so the taxpayer purports to establish a basis equal to the entire borrowed amount finally,the taxpayer exchanges the foreign currency he purchased for united states dollars.that exchange is a taxable event,and the taxpayer claims a loss equal to the full amount of his supposed basis in the cards loan,less the proceeds of the relatively small amount of currency actually exchanged.the taxpayer uses that loss to shelter unrelated income 
cards marketing materials describe the transaction as providing financing to the taxpayer.however,there is no net cash available to the taxpayer,because the foreign bank requires that all of the currency purchased with the proceeds of the cards loan including the portion purchased by the taxpayer remain at the bank as collateral for the cards loan.the taxpayer only has access to the proceeds of the cards loan if he delivers to the bank an equal amount of cash,cash equivalents,or other collateral acceptable to the bank.
in,prior to the events involved in this case,the internal revenue service irs warned taxpayers about taking tax deductions based on artificial losses generated by inflated bases in certain assets.see notice,tax avoidance using artificially high basis.the notice containing that warning said that the irs would not recognize transactions that created an artificially high basis if they lacked economic substance or a valid business purpose.after the irs discovered the widespread use of cards,and before crispin had filed the tax return at issue in this case,the irs issued another notice specifically addressed to cards transactions and explaining their technical flaws.see notice,tax avoidance using inflated basis.the irs also imposed disclosure obligations on cards promoters and users.eventually,the irs announced a settlement initiative that allowed cards users to avoid penalties for gross valuation misstatements applicable under,provided that they conceded their tax benefits and agreed to pay a reduced penalty.see announcement.some taxpayers elected to settle,paying roughly billion in back taxes.
the cards transaction at issue in this case was used by crispin to shelter more than million of income for the tax year.he learned of the cards opportunity from roy hahn,the founder of chenery associates,chenery,which promoted cards and other tax shelter transactions.crispin claims that hahn approached him at a time when he crispin planned to have murus acquire the aircraft but had not yet arranged financing for that purchase.hahn proposed to crispin that he enter into a cards transaction that chenery had designed for another client who had decided not to proceed.in that transaction,a foreign entity would enter into a year cards loan denominated in a swiss francs the loan proceeds would be retained by the lender crispin would purchase percent of the foreign currency obtained through the cards loan,and he would agree to be jointly and severally liable for the entire cards loan he would agree to repay the principal at the maturity date and he would exchange the foreign currency he purchased for united states dollars,claiming as his basis the full amount of the cards loan and garnering a tax loss equal to percent of the total loan value.hahn also provided crispin with a sample tax opinion blessing the transaction 
crispin decided to proceed with the transaction.he also informed his partner in the mortgage securities business about the cards transaction,and the partner agreed to participate as well,with murus taking a share equal to crispin share in that business,and the partner taking the remaining.crispin advised chenery that murus would realize million in income in from the mortgage securities business,and the transaction that chenery designed generated losses that were almost exactly equal to both partners income from that business 
chenery arranged the cards transaction with croxley financial trading llc croxley serving as the foreign and zurich bank and its affiliates collectively zurich as the lender.in early december,zurich loaned million swiss francs to croxley for a stated year term but callable and repayable at any time after the first year.the proceeds of the cards loan were transferred to croxley account at zurich and pledged to zurich as collateral for the loan.in late december,croxley sold crispin million swiss francs the loan assumption proceeds in exchange for crispin agreement to be jointly and severally liable for a share of croxley loan obligations to zurich with a value of million crispin immediately transferred the loan assumption proceeds to the zurich account of murus,which in turn guaranteed crispin loan obligations,and which pledged the swiss francs to zurich as collateral for the loan.on the same day,murus exchanged million swiss francs for united states dollars.murus received million,which it used to purchase a zurich promissory note that matured at the end of one year and that was held by zurich as collateral for murus guaranty of crispin obligations on the cards loan 
in august,zurich notified croxley and crispin that it was exercising its right to terminate the cards loan.the collateral securing murus guarantee was transferred to croxley,which used it,together with the remainder of the loan proceeds held by zurich,to repay the loan.the croxley loan ended up lasting approximately one year,which was typical of the cards loans that zurich provided to chenery clients 
in april,prior to filing his and murus tax returns,crispin engaged pullman comley,llc pullman,a law firm that provided opinion letters for other chenery clients,to provide a tax opinion regarding the cards transaction the pullman opinion.the pullman opinion noted that the irs had expressed negative views of the economic substance and other aspects of cards transactions.however,pullman opined that crispin transaction should have sufficient business purpose to be respected by the irs because t he business purpose for his entering into the t ransactions is clear and t he financing available to him through the t ransactions has reduced his costs and has afforded him the ability to have access to large amounts of capital on a basis to operate the business of murus.supplemental app.at.
murus listed a loss of million on its tax return,the difference between its claimed basis equal to crispin million assumed share of the cards loan,guaranteed by murus and the million of proceeds it received from the currency exchange that loss offset virtually all of murus income for.as a result,crispin reported only of income from murus on his personal income tax return for 
procedural history 
after the irs discovered crispin cards transaction,the commissioner disallowed the million ordinary loss deduction that murus had taken.in july,the commissioner sent crispin a notice of deficiency for the tax year that required payment of an additional million of taxes and a million penalty.crispin filed a timely appeal with the tax court for a redetermination of his taxes.
in march,the tax court issued a memorandum opinion affirming the commissioner determination that crispin was not entitled to an ordinary loss deduction from his participation in the cards transaction and that he was liable for the penalty under.the court found that the cards transaction lacked economic substance because crispin had no valid business purpose and had as his primary motivation it further held that crispin was liable for a percent penalty for underpayment that results from a gross valuation misstatement,pursuant to h,and that crispin was not entitled to relief from the penalty under the exception applicable to taxpayers who rely on expert tax advice reasonably and in good faith,pursuant to c.
this timely appeal followed.
while we conduct plenary review of the tax court legal conclusions,we review its factual findings,including its ultimate finding as to the economic substance of a transaction,for clear error.acm comm r,cir.t he commissioner deficiency determination is entitled to a presumption of correctness and the burden of production as well as the ultimate burden of persuasion is placed on the taxpayer.anastasato comm r,cir.
crispin argues that the tax court erred when it disallowed the deduction that murus claimed based on the cards transaction and thus held him liable for a deficiency for the tax year.he also contends that,even if he is liable for the deficiency,the tax court erred when it upheld the commissioner imposition of the accuracy related penalty under.we address each of those contentions in turn.
a.the liability decision 
crispin argues that the tax court erred in determining that his cards transaction lacked economic substance because the court misapplied the pertinent analytical test and failed to credit testimony that crispin had a valid business purpose in using the cards loan.in particular,crispin alleges that the business purpose of the cards loan was to provide financing for the purchase of aircraft to be used in murus leasing business.
section of the internal revenue code provides that t here shall be allowed as a deduction any loss sustained during the taxable year and not compensated for by insurance or otherwise.i.a.however,o nly a bona fide loss is allowable.substance and not mere form shall govern in determining a deductible loss.reg.b.for a loss to be bona fide,it must therefore satisfy the economic substance doctrine,among other requirements the economic substance doctrine applies where the economic or business purpose of a transaction is relatively insignificant in relation to the comparatively large tax benefits that accrue that is,a transaction which exploit s a feature of the tax code without any attendant economic risk neonatology,comm r,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.i n that situation,where the transaction was an attempted tax shelter devoid of legitimate economic substance,the doctrine governs to deny those benefits.id.
the inquiry into whether the taxpayer transactions had sufficient economic substance to be respected for tax purposes turns on both the objective economic substance of the transactions and the subjective business motivation behind them.acm comm r,cir internal quotation marks omitted.indicia of objective economic substance include whether the loss claimed was real or artificial,stobie creek,llc united states,whether the transaction was part of a prepackaged strategy marketed to shelter taxable gain,id.at,and whether the transaction has any practicable economic effects other than the creation of income tax losses,jacobson comm r,cir.the subjective intent inquiry focuses on whether the taxpayer entered into the transaction intended to serve a useful business purpose,see acm,at lerman comm r,cir,and on the correlation of losses to tax needs coupled with a general indifference to,or absence of,economic profits,keeler comm r,cir.
the tax court found that crispin cards transaction failed both the objective and subjective tests for economic substance.the court noted that crispin experienced only a paper loss of million and that,after the cards loan was repaid,crispin experienced no consequences other than receiving the tax deduction.as a result,the court concluded that t he ordinary loss claimed from the cards transaction was fictional app.at,which it noted was the hallmark of a transaction lacking economic substance.id.at.
as to crispin stated business purpose,the tax court determined that both the structure of the cards transaction and the record belie crispin contention that he engaged in the transaction to obtain financing for use in his aircraft leasing business.although the zurich loan had a stated year maturity,the proceeds remained in zurich complete possession and control as collateral for the loan,and zurich had the ability to call the loan at any time after the first year,which it in fact did.also,crispin never took any action to obtain and use the proceeds of the loan,knowing that he would have to post an offsetting amount of cash collateral.nor did he ever take any steps to secure zurich approval to substitute aircraft for cash as collateral for the loan.finally,there was no potential for profit,because the interest rate charged on the cards loan was greater than the interest paid on the proceeds deposited as collateral at zurich.based on the foregoing,all of which is by the record,we see no error,let alone clear error,in the tax court ultimate finding that crispin cards transaction lacked economic substance.
crispin objects to the tax court conclusion that much of his testimony on the business purpose of his cards transaction was not credible.in particular,the court discounted his testimony that he had approached zurich about substituting aircraft for cash as collateral for the cards loan,and that he had received assurances from zurich that it would consider such a change.evidently that testimony as well as expert testimony regarding the potential profit that could be generated by using the cards loan proceeds to purchase aircraft were unimpressive,because the court found that crispin did not actually plan to pursue the substitution of collateral.crispin protestations of unfairness in that finding ring hollow.assessing whether taxpayers fact witnesses testified incredibly with regard to material aspects of th e case,and that their testimony was,vague,elusive,uncorroborated,inconsistent with documentary and other reliable evidence constitutes the kind of credibility determinations ensconced firmly within the province of a trial court,afforded broad deference on appeal.neonatology,at internal quotation marks omitted.in this case,there was ample documentary and testimonial evidence that contradicted crispin account of the business purpose of his cards transaction,and the tax court did not abuse its discretion in deciding not to credit crispin evidence.
b.the penalty decision 
crispin argues that,even if we affirm the commissioner disallowance of the deduction that he took based on his cards transaction loss,he ought not be liable for the gross valuation misstatement penalty.he contends that t he overvaluation penalty should only be applicable where there is an underpayment attributable to an inflated value of an asset within the meaning of the penalty,and that the tax court failed to make the requisite finding as to how he had improperly inflated,overstated,the value of the asset claimed in his tax return.appellant opening br.at citing todd comm r,cir,and gainer comm r,cir reply at.crispin also contends that,even if the valuation misstatement penalty would normally apply,he is entitled to relief because he relied in good faith on the pullman opinion.both of those arguments fail.
applicability of the valuation misstatement penalty 
section of the internal revenue code imposes a percent penalty with respect to underpayment that results from a substantial valuation misstatement,which includes a misstatement of basis if the adjusted basis of any property claimed on any return of tax imposed by chapter is percent or more of the amount determined to be the correct amount of such adjusted basis.b,e a.that section goes on to increase the penalty to percent if the taxpayer claims an adjusted basis in the property that is percent or more of the correct amount this is known as a gross valuation misstatement.id.h.we have held that,where a claimed tax benefit is disallowed because it is an integral part of a transaction lacking economic substance,the imposition of the valuation overstatement penalty is properly imposed merino comm r,cir 
in this case,it is not entirely clear how the tax court determined the correct basis of the asset at issue,namely the loan assumption proceeds app.at,even though it did conclude that crispin made a gross valuation misstatement when he claimed million in adjusted basis for that asset on his tax return.there are two ways one might think about a basis determination and the consequent amount of a valuation overstatement in a cards transaction,both of which provide grounds for affirmance.acm,at noting that a court of appeals may affirm a decision of the tax court on any grounds supported by the record,regardless of the tax court rationale.
one way is to take the entire cards loan for which the taxpayer agreed to be jointly and severally liable million in crispin case and ask what it cost the taxpayer to enter into that loan.that cost,which may be viewed as representing the taxpayer basis,see supra note,can rightly be seen in the cards context as limited to the value of the foreign currency actually purchased by the taxpayer and exchanged for dollars million here the amount of the valuation misstatement is thus the difference between the basis that murus claimed on its tax return and that cost.the difference is the million deduction claimed by murus and disallowed by the commissioner,resulting in an equivalent upward adjustment in crispin taxable income.merino,at noting that the parties had stipulated that the fair market value of the asset which the court appears to have used as a proxy for cost basis was less than.
another way to consider a cards loan is not as one transaction but as two closely related transactions first,the purchase and exchange of the foreign currency for which the taxpayer actually assumed liability,see supra note and second,the agreement to be jointly and severally liable for the amount of the cards loan in excess of that purchase.focusing only on the second transaction,the basis is zero because that part of the transaction plainly lacks economic substance.therefore,the overstatement is the full amount of the basis attributable to that second transaction again,in this case,the million deduction disallowed by the commissioner.gustashaw,at noting that a basis of zero is the correct amount when a transaction lacks economic substance.
the amount of the valuation misstatement and of the deduction disallowed in this case are the same under either approach,and the explanation of the tax deficiency that the commissioner sent to murus alludes to both approaches.see supplemental app.at disallowing the million deduction because the transaction as a whole lacks economic substance id.at concluding that the taxpayer basis should be limited to the fair market value of the assets received rather than the full loan amount.but the calculation of the percentage overstatement is not the same million divided by million under the first approach,and million divided by under the second.the latter calculation,of course,results in an undefined percentage overstatement which the commissioner treats as meeting the percent threshold.see reg.g providing that the adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with a correct adjusted basis of zero is considered to be percent or more of the correct amount and the applicable penalty rate is percent.for purposes of this case,then,either calculation yields an overstatement of more than percent,so that the percent penalty under applies.consequently,we need not,and do not,decide which is the correct or better approach,though we urge the commissioner to clarify his interpretation of the law on this point.
in either case,because the underpayment in crispin taxes is directly traceable to the inflated basis in the loan assumption proceeds,that underpayment is attributable to a valuation misstatement of over percent,and the percent penalty is applicable to crispin underpayment of his taxes.
reasonable reliance on the pullman opinion 
c provides relief from the underpayment penalties in the form of a reasonable cause exception pursuant to which n o penalty shall be imposed under section with respect to any portion of an underpayment if it is shown that there was a reasonable cause for such portion and that the taxpayer acted in good faith with respect to such portion.c.the determination of whether a taxpayer acted with reasonable cause and in good faith is made on a basis,taking into account all pertinent facts and circumstances.reg.b.circumstances that may indicate reasonable cause and good faith include an honest misunderstanding of fact or law that is reasonable in light of all of the facts and circumstances,including the experience,knowledge,and education of the taxpayer.id.
the facts and circumstances of this case demonstrate that there was nothing reasonable about crispin reliance on the pullman opinion to immunize him from the underpayment penalty.prior to crispin filing his tax return,the irs,in its notice,told taxpayers that losses on cards transactions could not be deducted from ordinary income.the pullman opinion specifically referred to notice and advised crispin that the irs had concluded that no loss was allowable in the circumstances described therein supplemental app.at see also id.at advising crispin that notice designated cards as listed transactions on which the service may impose various penalties.crispin experience,knowledge,and education,see reg.b,as a former cpa and chief financial officer also strongly suggest enough familiarity with tax matters that he should be expected to have understood the warnings that pullman included in the opinion 
furthermore,w hile it is true that actual reliance on the tax advice of an independent,competent professional may negate a finding of negligence for purposes of,the reliance itself must be objectively reasonable in the sense that the taxpayer supplied the professional with all the necessary information to assess the tax matter neonatology,at.in particular,the advice on which the taxpayer claims reasonable reliance must not be based on an inaccurate representation or assumption as to the taxpayer purposes for entering into a transaction or for structuring a transaction in a particular manner.reg.c ii.that standard is not met here because,as the pullman opinion itself makes clear,pullman based its opinion on a series of misrepresentations by crispin.
for example,crispin represented to pullman that the business purpose of the transaction was to reduce borrowing costs and to afford crispin the ability to have access to large amounts of capital on a basis to operate the business of murus.supplemental app.at.however,crispin knew or should have known that that representation was false,given that aircraft were not appro
