baccei initiated this action in district court,seeking a refund of the penalty and interest imposed by the irs for late payment of the federal estate tax.in his complaint,baccei alleged a payment extension request had been filed the late payment penalty should be abated on grounds of reasonable cause and the irs refusal to refund the penalty was unconscionable,contrary to the meaning of the united states tax code,and an abuse of discretion.
the united states moved for summary judgment,contending that baccei did not properly request an extension of time to pay the taxes owed and that baccei had not established reasonable cause excusing his failure to timely pay the estate tax.baccei for summary judgment,claiming he made a valid late payment request.in the alternative,baccei argued that reasonable cause existed excusing his failure to timely pay the estate taxes,as he reasonably relied upon his accountant to obtain the payment extension.the parties stipulated to the material facts for purposes of the for summary judgment.
after supplemental briefing,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the united states.it held that the irs properly assessed a penalty for late payment of taxes because baccei had not complied with the regulations governing payment extension requests and did not timely pay the estate taxes owed.additionally,the district court rejected baccei argument that he substantially complied with the regulations,holding that the substantial compliance doctrine was inapplicable since the regulatory requirements were substantive and not procedural.the court observed that baccei extension request was deficient in several respects and concluded that application of the substantial compliance doctrine would permit baccei to evade the substantive requirements that the irs has established to govern its determinations regarding extensions of time to pay.
lastly,the district court found that the late payment penalty should not be abated on the grounds of reasonable cause.the court rejected baccei argument that he exercised ordinary business care and prudence in relying on a and knowledgeable cpa to request and obtain a payment extension.in so doing,the district court held that a n individual duty to file tax returns or pay tax returns or pay taxes under a can not be delegated,and reliance on a third party,even a cpa,is not reasonable cause for late filing.as executor of the estate,it was baccei responsibility to ascertain the payment due date,and to make certain that a proper request for late payment had been made,and that permission to file late had been granted.
accordingly,the district court found that the late payment penalty and interest should not be refunded.the court also denied baccei for summary judgment.however,the court concluded that neither party had adequately addressed whether baccei failure to timely pay the estate taxes resulted from willful neglect.at the court request,the parties submitted a joint statement addressing the issue.upon reviewing the parties statement,the district court granted the united states summary judgment motion in its entirety.baccei filed a timely appeal,which we have jurisdiction to review pursuant to.
