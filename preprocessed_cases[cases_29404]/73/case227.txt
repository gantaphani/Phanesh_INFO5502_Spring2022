merrill lynch transactions 
before any of the transactions at issue in this appeal took place,merrill lynch,merrill served as a parent corporation to a number of subsidiaries,including merrill lynch capital resources resources,merrill lynch realty realty,merrill lynch asset management management and merrill,lynch,pierce,fenner smith,mlpfs.although a number of these subsidiaries held subsidiaries of their own,only those held by resources are relevant to this appeal.due to the relationships that existed among all of these companies,merrill group filed a consolidated tax return under the designation merrill lynch,subsidiaries for each of the tax years at issue in this appeal.
resources,the subsidiary at the center of this dispute,was a leasing business created by merrill to facilitate the expansion of merrill business into the and small business sectors.in early,merrill management decided that resources had served its purpose and that it was time to sell its dollar leasing portfolio,given that leasing was outside of merrill core competency and that the portfolio of leases had begun to generate taxable income.because resources held a large number of relatively small leases,merrill decided that in order to divest itself of resources leasing assets it made practical sense to sell its stock in resources instead of trying to sell each of the leases individually.however,resources did hold some assets that merrill wanted to keep,and by february,a draft memorandum identified the assets that resources would continue to hold at the time it was sold.
on march,merrill created a project team to handle the resources divestiture and named theodore sands chief negotiator.the apparent focus of this team was to maximize merrill return on this transaction,taking into account everything from the received to the tax benefits it would generate.during the month of march,the team took the first step of organizing the creation of a offering memorandum for prospective purchasers the march memorandum.
on march,resources sold its stock in five of its subsidiaries to realty for and the stock in another of its subsidiaries to management for.on april,resources sold all of its stock in a final subsidiary to mlpfs for as the tax court did,we refer to the subsidiaries resources sold as the issuing corporations and to the three transactions as the sales.upon completing the sales,resources had transferred all of the assets merrill wished to keep to its sibling subsidiaries.resources was now ready to be sold.
meanwhile,by march,merrill had identified potential buyers for resources and was gauging their interest in the transaction.neither gatx leasing corporation gatx nor bce development,bce,the companies that eventually purchased resources,were referred to by name at that time.however,on march,a copy of the march memorandum was sent to gatx but not bce along with a confidentiality agreement.nevertheless,no negotiations took place between merrill and gatx until the confidentiality agreement was executed and returned,which had not yet happened as of april,several days after the first of the sales had been conducted and one day before they were to be completed.eventually,five or six companies,including gatx with bce as a partner,were interested enough in resources to submit bids,which were received on april.
on april,merrill management presented the potential sale of resources and its probable tax consequences to the merrill board.while the definitive buyer had not been established,merrill cfo identified as the likely purchaser,based on the initial bids.this presentation described the sales as a step taken in anticipation of the future sale of resources in order to maximize merrill tax benefits.after the board meeting,merrill conducted another round of bidding and was left as the only potential purchaser.for an additional two months,merrill negotiated exclusively with,during which time due diligence was conducted.eventually,on june,the parties executed a purchase agreement,whereby agreed to buy resources for down from their million final bid due to concerns raised by the results of the due diligence.
b.the tax treatment of the transactions 
in calculating its tax liability,merrill took advantage of the consolidated return regulations that were in place at the time to claim a capital loss from the sale of resources.its ability to take this loss was governed by the rule set forth in woods investment commissioner,wl,acq,in which the tax court concluded that basis adjustments in subsidiaries are to be made in accordance with changes in earnings and profits,rather than taxable income or loss.at.the commissioner did not challenge merrill position on this rule.however,merrill went on to conclude that the sales increased its basis in resources pursuant to reg.c,a,b i.this increase in basis is the crux of the dispute between the parties because it allowed merrill to increase its tax loss on the sale and use that loss to offset capital gains that were otherwise taxable.
merrill determined that it could increase its basis in resources by classifying the sales as dividends,based on an interpretation of the interaction between,and.dividend treatment for the sales is important because it allows the sums received from the purchasing subsidiaries to be treated as earnings,thus triggering an increase in merrill basis in resources.section provides that sales of stock between companies that are owned by the same individual or in this case merrill are to be treated for tax purposes as a distribution in redemption of the stock of the corporation acquiring the stock.a.in other words,the way the transaction actually took place is ignored and the transaction is instead viewed as a stock swap between the buying and selling companies,where the stock of the buying company is hypothetically redeemed to take into account the fact that it was never actually transferred in the first place.section,through an internal reference to,sets forth the default tax rule that distributions of property including distributions of stock are to be treated as dividends and explains how such dividends are to be accounted for.see c.section sets forth an exception to this default rule that only applies to certain distributions in redemption of stock.a.if a distribution in redemption falls within the ambit of any one of four scenarios,the redemption is treated as an exchange and thus does not receive dividend treatment.b.the scenario that could apply to merrill group transactions is a complete redemption of all of the stock of the corporation owned by the shareholders,which is essentially a test for whether the selling company has completely terminated its interest in the stock of the company being sold.b.resources sale of the issuing corporations might fall under this provision due to the operation of section,which sets forth the constructive ownership of stock provision that applies to this subchapter of the internal revenue code.a.this rule of constructive ownership operates so that stock owned by one of the subsidiaries of a parent company may also be interpreted as being owned by the other subsidiaries of that same parent company see id.this suggests that when resources sold the issuing corporations it retained an interest in them through its relationship with merrill and its subsidiaries.therefore,the complete redemption scenario of section b would only be fulfilled if the sales and the sale of the resources were considered together integrated so that only the combined transaction would be scrutinized under section b,because only merrill sale of resources terminated resources interest in the issuing corporations.
merrill view was that the sales did not meet the requirements of section b because resources interest in the issuing corporations was not completely terminated by the sales.merrill reached this result by analyzing the transaction at the time of the sales and concluding that at that time,resources was still a of the purchasers of the issuing corporations and thus still retained a constructive interest in the issuing corporations via section constructive ownership provisions.therefore,merrill concluded that the default rule set forth in section applied,allowing it to classify the sales as dividends and the purchase prices received as earnings and profits of resources.see reg.c.this increase in undistributed profits allowed merrill to increase its basis in resources.see reg.a,b i.by increasing its basis in resources,merrill turned the sale of the subsidiary into a large capital loss that was then used to offset capital gains during two tax years.
the commissioner rejected merrill basis adjustments and entered deficiencies for and.the commissioner took a different view of how,and applied to the transactions into which merrill group entered.while merrill group had determined that section provision that prevents dividend not apply to the sales,the commissioner concluded that it did apply.the commissioner reached this result because instead of looking to whether resources had terminated its interest in the issuing corporations at the time the sales were conducted,he instead performed this analysis looking at the time resources was sold after deciding that it was proper to integrate the sales with the sale of resources.the commissioner therefore concluded that section did apply to the sales and thus that merrill group could not treat the sales as dividends and thereby increase its basis in resources.this led the commissioner to conclude that merrill had improperly avoided more than million in taxes in and.
merrill group challenged this determination before the united states tax court.the tax court sided with the commissioner after a review of its prior cases,in particular niedermeyer commissioner,wl,aff,cir,led it to decide that a series of transactions should be integrated for section b purposes where there was a firm and fixed plan to perform the second transaction at the time the first transaction was executed.merrill lynch comm r,wl.the tax court went on to conclude that the sales and the later sale of resources were part and parcel in a firm and fixed plan.id.at.in its decision,the tax court reduced the deficiency assessed by the commissioner for and to.merrill group now appeals.

review of the tax court integration analysis 
while the statutory backdrop to this case is daunting,it did not form the heart of the dispute before the tax court.rather,the parties were in agreement that if the sales could be integrated with the sale of resources for the purpose of conducting the section b test,the commissioner deficiency ruling was accurate and that if they could not be integrated,the deficiency ruling was invalid.
our court has yet to adopt a test for the integration of transactions in the section b context.as a result,the tax court looked to its own cases and to those of other circuits for an appropriate test.see merrill lynch,at.these cases uniformly relied on the firm and fixed plan test,without providing useful analysis explaining how it was to be applied under circumstances similar to those presented in this case.see id.while the parties are at odds over how the firm and fixed plan test is to be applied,neither suggests that we should craft or adopt a different test.
there is no question that any test we adopt must allow certain transactions to be integrated for the purposes of b.otherwise,that provision would be effectively read out of the tax code,as taxpayers could avoid it simply by conducting transactions in multiple steps,designed to delay a total termination of interest in a company.nevertheless,we believe that a test targeted strictly at the intent of the taxpayer would be overly subjective and unmanageable.the initial appeal of the firm and fixed plan test is that it allows for the integration of the majority of transactions that are structured to avoid section b,while providing the court with a relatively objective measure to consider in reaching its decision.in addition,this test has enjoyed a long history in the tax court,allowing us to observe how it has evolved over time and giving us a better understanding of its scope.finally,we find it significant that neither party proposes an alternative test for our consideration.for these reasons,we adopt the firm and fixed plan test for the purpose of determining whether two transactions should be integrated when they are considered in the section b context.
while the parties both adopt the firm and fixed plan test as the framework for their respective arguments,they disagree over how the test is to be applied in this case.not surprisingly,there is little relevant precedent applying the firm and fixed plan test.merrill group contends that the court must evaluate the plan to sell resources at the time the sales were executed.it argues that merrill plan to sell resources was not firm and fixed because it had not yet settled on a final buyer for resources at the time of the sales.thus,merrill group challenges the result reached by the tax court,suggesting that the court misapplied the firm and fixed plan test by resting its ruling on intent alone.the commissioner does not challenge merrill group assertion that the plan status must be evaluated at the time of the sales.however,he argues that merrill failure to identify a final buyer for resources at that time does not prevent the plan from being firm and fixed.the commissioner suggests that the tax court properly looked for objective evidence of an overall plan by merrill to terminate its interest in resources,and that this evidence sufficiently supported a finding that the sales were an integrated step in merrill overall plan to sell resources.therefore,he concludes that the tax court properly found that a firm and fixed plan existed,even though all of its details were not finalized at the time of the sales.
in approaching this problem,we take some measure of guidance from the decisions of other courts that have had the opportunity to address it.see zenz quinlivan,cir holding that a taxpayer has the legal right to decrease the amount of what otherwise would be his taxes or altogether avoid them,by means which the law permits and applying a test that did not focus on intent,to determine whether the commissioner properly assessed a deficiency monson comm r,wl holding that a firm and fixed plan existed to conduct a series of transactions that resulted in the taxpayer interest in a company being fully terminated where the minutes of a board of directors meeting described the redemption and the subsequent sale of taxpayer remaining stock to a third party as steps in the sale roebling comm r,wl holding that a gradual redemption of the taxpayer shares in a company could be integrated as a series of steps in a firm and fixed plan even though there was no binding agreement between the taxpayer and the bank that was redeeming the shares bleily collishaw,comm r,wl,aff,cir paparo comm r,wl benjamin comm r,wl,aff cir holding that a plan of redemption that was alleged to terminate the ta
