this case involves the question of whether individual taxpayers were at risk,as defined in b,with regard to a transaction between a parent company and two of its subsidiaries and could therefore deduct losses from an investment in a trust formed by one of the subsidiaries.in the tax years ending in,and,stephen pledger and marcia pledger pledger collectively referred to as the pledgers,claimed losses deriving from pledger investment in a trust under.the internal revenue service irs,however,disallowed the pledgers loss deductions and instead assessed an amount totaling approximately in taxes,penalties,and interest against the pledgers.the pledgers paid the assessed amount and then filed claims for refunds and amended individual income tax returns for each of the aforementioned tax years,but the irs denied their claims.
the pledgers then filed this lawsuit against the irs in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio,which was transferred to a united states magistrate judge.after holding a bench trial pursuant to the parties consent,the magistrate judge issued an opinion which held that the pledgers were not at risk under and entered judgment in favor of the irs.
the pledgers now appeal the magistrate judge decision,claiming that the magistrate judge erred in determining that they were not at risk under and that the magistrate judge decision from the bench trial was inconsistent with his previous rulings on the irs motions for summary judgment.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
in august of,american broadcasting companies,abc acquired two satellite transponders from rca american communications.transponders are electronic devices that receive,select,amplify,and voice,data,and video signals.in may of,abc assigned all of its rights,benefits,responsibilities,and liabilities with respect to the two transponders to its wholly owned subsidiary,abc video enterprises,abc video.
on october and,integrated equipment leasing corporation ielc,a wholly owned subsidiary of integrated resources,integrated,acquired the two transponders from abc video for a purchase price of each.then,on october,the very same day that ielc had completed its purchase of the transponders,ielc entered into two identical lease agreements with abc video.
on december,ielc sold the two transponders to investors credit corporation icc,another wholly owned subsidiary of integrated.icc paid the purchase price for the transponders with a cash and a promissory note payable to ielc.also,on december,icc agreed to lease the transponders back to ielc this agreement required ielc to pay icc fixed rent that approximately equaled,in both time and amount,the payments that icc owed to ielc.as an incentive for icc to enter into this master lease agreement with ielc,integrated agreed to guarantee unconditionally ielc rental payments under the master lease agreement.
on the very same day in which it had both bought and leased the two transponders,icc formed satellite equipment trust a the trust as a grantor trust,transferred the transponders to the trust,and assigned all of its rights and liabilities with respect to the transponders to the trust.prior to the formation of the trust,a confidential memorandum offering forty units of beneficial interest in the trust for sale to private investors was released.according to the trust documents,new york law governed the interpretation of the agreement.
following the release of the confidential memorandum,pledger acquired one unit of beneficial interest in the trust by paying in cash to icc and issuing promissory notes in the amounts of and to another wholly owned subsidiary of integrated and to icc,respectively.the payments that pledger was obligated to make to icc equaled his share of the payments that ielc was obligated to pay the trust under the master lease agreement with icc.the fixed rental payments that the trust received from ielc were applied to satisfy the payments pledger was required to pay icc.
when the pledgers filed their joint tax returns for the taxable years ending in,and,they claimed loss deductions with respect to pledger investment in the trust for that part of the investment attributable to his promissory note to icc.the irs,however,determined that the pledgers were not at risk under with respect to the note to icc and assessed additional taxes,penalties,and interest against the pledgers.the pledgers then fully paid these amounts and filed claims for refunds,but their claims were denied.
the pledgers then filed this lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio.on june,the irs filed a motion for summary judgment,asserting that the pledgers were not at risk under because icc,to which pledger was required to make payments,was merely an instrumentality of integrated and therefore integrated was both the payee and guarantor in the arrangement.the magistrate judge denied the irs motion for summary judgment on the ground that there were genuine issues of material fact regarding the relationship between integrated and icc.
the irs then deposed benjamin jung,who formerly was the general counsel of integrated equipment leasing division and a senior vice president of integrated.in his deposition,jung testified that bill adair,who formerly was the head of integrated equipment leasing group,decided to create the trust to provide financing to investors.jung also testified that integrated marketing staff developed the underlying equipment leasing transaction for the trust that integrated equipment leasing group originated the transaction involving the trust and that integrated equity marketing group analyzed the proposed transaction to determine how it could be structured into one of the company products.additionally,jung testified that integrated equipment leasing group and equity sales group were involved in negotiating the terms of the investors promissory notes to icc and that the promissory notes issued by the investors to icc were based upon standard form notes created by employees of integrated.jung further testified that he was involved in the process of drafting the confidential memorandum that offered forty units of beneficial interest in the trust to private investors and that he,a s counsel would review and supervise the drafting of that memorandum which was drafted by outside counsel,and had input on a lot of factual matters and just reviewing the development of the document.joint appendix at jung dep.at.
with regard to the operation of icc,jung testified that icc operations consisted of billing,collecting,and accounting for transactions between investors and icc but that integrated accounting department handled the recording and reporting functions for icc.jung further explained that icc offices were located at the offices of integrated,and while he testified that icc officers and directors controlled the operations of icc,he did not identify the daily tasks they performed for icc.jung also stated that,with one exception,all of the officers and directors of icc were also officers of integrated.jung further stated that he was fairly certain that all monies that were remitted from investors to icc went to integrated.at jung dep.at.with all this said,though,in response to a question by the pledgers counsel regarding whether jung believed that icc was a separate entity in the legal sense,jung asserted i do.at jung dep.at emphasis added.
using the testimony from jung deposition as its support,the irs then filed a renewed motion for summary judgment.again,the magistrate judge denied this motion due to the existence of genuine issues of material fact.after holding a bench trial on the merits of the case,the magistrate judge issued an opinion,finding that the pledgers were not at risk under because icc was a mere instrumentality of integrated.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,the pledgers argue that the magistrate judge erred in finding that icc was a mere instrumentality of integrated and therefore erred in holding that they were not at risk as defined in b.we hold that the magistrate judge did not err in determining that the pledgers were not at risk under because icc was a mere instrumentality of integrated.the record supports the magistrate judge conclusion that integrated exercised such control and dominion over icc that icc was a dummy corporation for integrated,thereby making integrated both the guarantor and payee in the transaction at issue.in sum,we believe that the magistrate judge was correct in concluding that the pledgers were not at risk of incurring any losses from the investment in the trust even if it proved to be unprofitable,because any debts that they owed to icc through the trust would be canceled out by integrated guaranty of ielc obligations to the trust.
sixth circuit interpretation of 
section a of the internal revenue code provides that a taxpayer who is engaged in certain designated activities may deduct losses occurring from these activities only to the extent that the taxpayer is at risk for such activities at the close of a taxable year.a.equipment leasing,which is the type of activity involved in this case,comes within the terms of.c c.
under b,a taxpayer is at risk for amounts of money and the adjusted basis of other property contributed by the taxpayer to the designated activity.b a.a taxpayer is also at risk for amounts of money borrowed for use in the activity to the extent that he is personally liable for the repayment of such amounts or to the extent that he has pledged property,other than the property used in the activity,as security for such borrowed amounts.b.a taxpayer,however,is not at risk with respect to amounts protected against loss through nonrecourse financing,guarantees,stop loss agreements,or other similar arrangements.b.
the sixth circuit has analyzed the provisions in with respect to a transaction in only two published opinions.see martuccio commissioner,cir emershaw commissioner,cir.in these cases,the sixth circuit rejected the reasoning of every other circuit addressing this issue which held that the circular offsetting structure of payments in a transaction is sufficient to trigger the b exception from at risk treatment for notes that will be paid through a circle of payments.see,waters commissioner,cir,cert.denied,d young commissioner,cir moser commissioner,cir american principals leasing united states,cir.unlike these courts,which use an economic reality test to determine whether a transaction is structured such that it removes any realistic possibility that the taxpayer will suffer an economic loss if the transaction turns out to be unprofitable,the sixth circuit applies the payor of last resort test and asks whether,in a worst case scenario,the individual taxpayer will suffer any personal,expenses.see emershaw,at.this analysis regarding whether a taxpayer is at risk within the meaning of b was first adopted by the sixth circuit in emershaw and was later followed by this court in martuccio.
in emershaw,cis leasing corporation cis purchased computers and computer peripherals from the ibm corporation ibm for.to finance these purchases,cis took out a number of nonrecourse bank loans.after leasing the equipment to,cis then sold the equipment for to program leasing corporation program,which paid in cash as a and paid the balance of the purchase price with an installment note.emershaw,at.program then sold the equipment for to lea,in which the emershaws were partners.for its purchase,lea paid a small cash and gave program a partial recourse installment note equal to the installment note program had given cis.emershaw,at.
lea then leased the equipment back to cis for monthly rental payments equal to the monthly payments lea owed on its note to program.additionally,cis rental payments to lea were guaranteed by cis parent,continental information systems continental.all payments on the lease and various notes were made by offsetting bookkeeping entries pursuant to letter agreements between the parties so that no actual exchange of money occurred.emershaw,at.
in emershaw,the sixth circuit affirmed the decision of the tax court,which found that the emershaws were at risk under for their pro rata share of lea partial recourse note because they were the payors of last resort.the panel explained that,in the worst case scenario where cis went bankrupt,renounced its lease,and stopped making rental payments to lea,lea partners,such as the emershaws,would still be required to pay program the balance of the partial recourse note issued to program.as a result,the panel concluded that the emershaws were at risk within the meaning of.the panel further held that there did not exist a arrangement within the meaning of b through a collateral agreement protecting a taxpayer from loss after the losses have occurred,either by excusing him from his obligation to make good on losses or by compensating him for losses he has sustained.emershaw,at.
in reviewing the pledgers claim in this case,we believe,and the parties agree,that if icc were a mere instrumentality of integrated,as is argued by the irs,then this case is distinguishable from emershaw in one important respect.in emershaw,if cis,who owed payments to lea and thus the emershaws,became insolvent and the guarantor continental also went bankrupt or refused to honor its guaranty,lea would still have to make its payments to program under the installment note,thereby making the emershaws,partners of lea,personally liable to program for the payments lea owed to program.
in the pledgers case,however,if icc were a mere instrumentality of its parent,integrated,then integrated,which guaranteed the payments that ielc was required to make to the trust of which pledger was an investor,would also be the payee of pledger note,under which pledger was required to make payments to icc,which had an obligation to ielc.in other words,if ielc failed to meet its rental obligations to the trust and integrated went bankrupt or failed to honor its obligation as guarantor of ielc payments to the trust which received its rights to the transponders from icc,pledger obligations to icc would be set off by integrated guaranty of ielc payments to the trust where icc,the payee of pledger payments,was a mere instrumentality of integrated.therefore,pledger,unlike the emershaws,could never be the payor of last resort.
in sum,even if ielc became insolvent,the pledgers would never suffer any financial losses as a result of debts owed to icc because integrated had guaranteed ielc obligations.as icc was essentially the same company as integrated,any debts that pledger owed to icc would be canceled out by integrated promise to cover the payments ielc owed to pledger through the trust.consequently,the outcome of this case turns upon our review of the magistrate judge decision regarding whether icc was merely an instrumentality of integrated.
relationship between parent and subsidiary 
we review a lower court factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.anderson city of bessemer city,d.as a general matter,we do not find the factual determinations of a lower court to be clearly erroneous unless we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.anderson,at.quotation omitted.when reviewing for clear error,we can not substitute our judgment for that of the lower court but rather must uphold the lower court account of the evidence if it is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.anderson,at.indeed,w here there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.anderson,at.
in this case,the trust documents require that we look to new york law in determining the relationship between icc and integrated.under new york law,a subsidiary company is not deemed an instrumentality or agent of a parent corporation solely because the parent company owns the subsidiary stock.fiur ataka.to pierce the corporate veil and hold a parent company liable for the acts of its subsidiary,we must conclude that the parent company essentially exercised control over the operations of its subsidiary such that the subsidiary had become a mere instrumentality of the parent.sterling interlake indus,citing billy consol.mach.tool,see also pritchard services first winthrop.although mere ownership do
