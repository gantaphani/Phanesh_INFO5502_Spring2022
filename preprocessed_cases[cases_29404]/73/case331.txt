introduction 
this matter comes on before this court on appeal from decisions of the united states tax court entered april,in accordance with its opinion filed july,upholding the determination of the commissioner of internal revenue that contributions made by appellants,two professional medical corporations,neonatology associates,and lakewood radiology,into voluntary employees beneficiary program veba plans in excess of the cost of term life insurance were taxable constructive dividends to the physicians owning the corporations and their spouses rather than employer deductible expenses.see neonatology,comm r,wl.we refer to the corporations and individuals collectively as taxpayers.the consequences of the decisions were substantial for the taxpayers inasmuch as the professional medical corporations were denied deductions they had taken for the contributions and the individuals were charged with significant additional taxable dividend income.the court held further that the individual taxpayers were liable for negligence penalties under a.
our examination of the record convinces us that the contributions at the heart of this dispute were so far in excess of the cost of annual life insurance protection that they could not plausibly qualify as ordinary and necessary business expenses in accordance with.in essence,the physicians adopted a specially crafted framework to circumvent the intent and provisions of the internal revenue code by having their corporations pay inflated life insurance premiums so that the excess contributions would be available for redistribution to the individual shareholders free of income taxes.as correctly recognized by the tax court,these contributions were taxable disguised dividends and not deductible expenses.moreover,as the individual taxpayers could not in good faith avail themselves of the defense,the tax court duly held them liable for the negligence penalties.accordingly,for the reasons we elaborate in more detail below,we will affirm the decisions of the tax court.
ii.background 
the evidence at the trial disclosed the following facts.neonatology is a new jersey professional corporation owned by ophelia mall.lakewood is a new jersey professional corporation owned equally at the times material here by arthur hirshkowitz,akhilesh desai,kevin mcmanus,and steven sobo until his death on september.subsequently vijay sankhla,who is not a party to this action,purchased sobo interest.the spouses of the doctors,john mall,lois hirshkowitz,dipti desai,cheryl macmanus,and bonnie sobo,are parties to this action as the doctors and their spouses filed joint income tax returns.in addition,bonnie sobo is a party as executrix of her husband estate.
following the enactment of the tax reform act of tra,stat,insurance salesmen stephen ross and donald murphy formed pacific executive services pes,a california partnership designed to provides services to retirement plan administrators and employee benefit advisors unfamiliar with the impact of the tra.see app.at.specifically,ross and murphy devised a program to allow closely held corporations to create a tax deduction for contributions to an employee welfare benefit plan going in and a permanent tax deferral coming out.app.at.
to achieve this end,pes created two voluntary employees beneficiary associations,the southern california medical profession association veba sc veba and the new jersey medical profession association veba nj veba a veba,as defined in c,is a program providing members,their dependents,or designated beneficiaries with life,sick,accident,or other benefits if no part of the net earnings of such association inures other than through such payments to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.
under the pes veba programs,each participating employer adopts its own plan,maintaining a trust account and designating a trust administrator with exclusive control over all assets.the plan adoption agreement obligates employers to make,whether in the form of group insurance policies or group annuities,contributions towards the life insurance benefits of employees and their beneficiaries,based on a multiple of each employee annual compensation.benefits payable under any plan are paid solely from that plan allocable share of the trust fund,and the participating employer,administrator,and trustee are not liable for any shortfall in the funds required to be paid.upon termination of a plan,all its remaining assets are distributed to the employer covered employees in proportion to their compensation.pes enlisted the services of barry cohen,a longtime insurance salesman with the kirwan companies,to market the veba programs to medical professionals.
the sc veba plans at issue in this case,the neonatology employee welfare plan and the lakewood employee welfare plan,shared a common feature both purchased continuous group term policy certificates from the insurance of illinois,commonwealth life insurance,and peoples security life insurance.the product provided routine group term life insurance with an added component,a special conversion policy through which a covered employee,under certain circumstances could opt to convert his or her policy to an individual policy,the conversion universalife ul policy.by converting from a to an individual ul policy,the employee could access funds paid by the employer to the group policy that exceeded the applicable mortality charge,the cost of insurance.the excess funds,depending on the year in which the conversion takes place are paid out with interest as conversion credits.
in addition to being able to access surplus amounts,a policyholder upon conversion to the ul policy may borrow any amounts against his or her policies not required to keep the policies in force when the policyholder dies,the loans are to be repaid from the policy death benefits,which ordinarily are not subject to income tax.see.of course,by borrowing the money the taxpayer effectively would be withdrawing money the medical corporations paid for the conversion privilege on a tax free basis.thus,as if by magic,cash derived from the corporations would be withdrawn without tax.each of the physician taxpayers,other than sobo,in fact converted at least one term certificate to a special policy providing conversion credits.see app.at.
neonatology,on the basis of conversations between its principal,mall,and cohen,established the neonatology plan under the sc veba on january,effective january.under the plan,each covered employee was to receive a life insurance benefit equal to times the employee compensation of the prior year.see app.at.john mall,mall husband,was not a paid employee of neonatology and thus was not eligible to join the plan.nevertheless,mall and pes,the plan administrator,allowed mall to join the plan,making him eligible to receive a death amount commensurate to that payable under life insurance that he had owned outside the plan.see.at.the neonatology plan purchased three life insurance policies,two on mall life and one on mall life.see app.at.neonatology contributed to the neonatology plan during each year from through and,for each subject year,claimed a tax deduction for those contributions and other related amounts.
lakewood,on the basis of conversations between its principals and cohen,established the lakewood plan under the sc veba on december,effective january.under the plan,each covered employee was to receive a life insurance benefit equal to times his or her compensation.see app.at.lakewood amended its plan as of january,to increase the compensation multiple to.the lakewood plan purchased life insurance policies on the lives of hirshkowitz,desai,sobo,mcmanus,and sankhla and three group annuities toward future premiums on the policies.see app.at.lakewood also purchased three policies outside of the lakewood plan.the individual owners on their own behalf determined the amounts contributed by lakewood to the sc veba.see app.at.for each subject year,lakewood claimed a tax deduction for those contributions and other related amounts.
the irs audited neonatology tax returns for calendar years and and lakewood tax returns for fiscal year ending october,and calendar years and.as a consequence of the audits,the commissioner made the following determinations.first,with respect to the deductions claimed by neonatology for amounts paid to the sc veba and by lakewood for amounts paid to the sc veba and to the three policies,he allowed only the cost of annual term life insurance protection and disallowed the excess amounts of and for neonatology and lakewood respectively.see app.at.the commissioner based his disallowance on alternative bases the excess contributions were not ordinary and necessary business expenses under a even if the amounts constituted ordinary and necessary business expenses,they nevertheless were not deductible under a and a,which limit the deductibility of contributions paid to deferred compensation plans and welfare benefit plans.see app.at,
second,the commissioner determined with respect to the individual owners that amounts paid to the sc veba program increased personal incomes by for mall and her husband,for desai,for mcmanus,for hirshkowitz,and for sobo his estate.see app.at.the commissioner included the excess contributions as income to the individual taxpayers on alternative bases the amounts were deposited in the plans for the economic benefit of the individual taxpayers and as such constituted constructive dividends under a and assuming that the neonatology and lakewood plans constituted deferred compensation plans,the excess contributions were includible under section b.see app.at.lastly,the commissioner determined that by reason of the underpayment of taxes the individual taxpayers were subject to penalties under a.
neonatology,lakewood,and the individual owners petitioned the tax court challenging the irs determinations.after a bench trial,the court sustained the commissioner on the ground that 
the neonatology plan and the lakewood plan are primarily vehicles which were designed and serve in operation to distribute surplus cash surreptitiously in the form of excess contributions from the corporations for the ultimate use and benefit the premiums paid for the term policy exceeded by a wide margin the cost of term life insurance what is critical to our conclusion is that the excess contributions made by neonatology and lakewood conferred an economic benefit on their for the primary if not sole benefit of those,that the excess contributions constituted a distribution of cash rather than a payment of an ordinary and necessary business expense,and that neither neonatology nor lakewood expected any repayment of the cash underlying the conferred benefit.
neonatology,at.
without addressing the alternative grounds for the commissioner conclusions,the court rejected taxpayers arguments that the possibility of forfeiture in certain situations like policy lapse or death rendered all excess payments into de facto contributions to life insurance protection.id.at the mere fact that a term policyholder may forfeit the conversion credit balance does not mean,as petitioners would have it,that the balance was charged or paid as the cost of term life insurance.the court also rejected the idea that contributions which in fact did not fund term life insurance were paid as compensation for services,rather than dividends,because as a factual matter neither neonatology nor lakewood had the requisite compensatory intent when the contributions were made.id.at.lastly,the court agreed with the commissioner that the individual taxpayers were in fact negligent and could not circumvent the penalties by asserting a good faith,defense nor could they do so by claiming that the case involved tax matters of first impression.
the tax court entered its decisions on april.taxpayers timely appealed on july.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to,and the tax court had jurisdiction over the petitions pursuant to a and.
iii.discussion 
there are three principal issues before us on appeal whether the tax court correctly determined that the amounts contributed in excess of the cost of per annum term life insurance were not ordinary and necessary business expenses and therefore not deductible if yes,whether those amounts constituted dividends,includible as taxable individual income,or compensation to the individual taxpayers and,whether the individual taxpayers were negligent.our review of the tax court legal conclusions is plenary and is based on the clearly erroneous standard for its findings of fact.see acm comm r,cir pleasant summit land comm r,cir.moreover,taxpayers bear the burden of refuting the irs determinations.see welch helvering.
a.the deficiencies 
section a of the internal revenue code allows for the deduction of all ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in carrying on a trade or business providing five requirements are met the item claimed as deductible was paid or incurred during the taxable year was for carrying on a trade or business was an expense was a necessary expense and was an ordinary expense.see comm r lincoln sav.loan ass n,d.beyond peradventure,employee benefits like life insurance are a form of compensation deductible by the employer see reg.a see also joel schneider,comm r,memo.to the extent,however,that neonatology and lakewood expenditures did not fund term life insurance,the tax court found that they did not meet the five requirements delineated above and therefore were not deductible.this factual finding was not clearly erroneous.see comm r heininger.
the record amply supports the conclusion that taxpayers paid artificially inflated premiums in a creative bookkeeping ploy conceived by their insurance specialists to exploit what they thought were loopholes in the tax laws.indeed,we do not see how a court examining this case could conclude otherwise.charles deweese,the commissioner expert,testified that amounts paid into the policies exceeded conventional life insurance premiums by nearly.see app.at,evidence at trial demonstrated that mall knew that term life insurance was substantially more expensive to buy through the sc veba than through other plans offered to her under the auspices of the american medical association and the american academy of pediatrics.she nevertheless opted to form the neonatology plan because she believed that it offered her the best tax benefits.see app.at.hirshkowitz testified that lakewood intentionally paid more expensive premiums on the policies than it would have for conventional life insurance protection.see app.at.desai,another lakewood owner,testified that his independent personal life insurance cost him substantially less than the policies issued pursuant to the sc veba.see app.at.like mall,the lakewood owners nevertheless invested in the sc veba program because of cohen representation of tax benefits and cash returns that they could anticipate receiving.see app.at.
the record also reveals that excess premium amounts did not pay for actual current year life insurance protection but rather paid for conversion credits.the compliance manager of the providian corporation,the parent of the commonwealth life insurance company which issued policies involved here,stated in a letter to the irs that the premiums paid for the term policy are higher than the traditional term policy because of the conversion privilege and the costs of conversion credits.app.at.deweese,belying taxpayers claim that premiums were higher than those under ordinary term life policies because they were calibrated to the higher risks of longer term employees in small markets testified that the bulk of the gross premiums went to accumulate assets for distribution to the individual participants upon conversion.see app.at.in addition,the record supports the conclusion that payments made to the lakewood plan for annuities were made not to fund current life insurance protection for employees but rather were made as an investment for the trustee to pay premiums on future premiums.see app.at.
in sum,the evidence fully supports,indeed compels,the finding that the contributions in excess of the amounts necessary to pay for annual term life insurance protection were distributions of surplus cash and not ordinary and necessary business expenses.considering the sound reasoning of the tax court and our own intensive review of the facts here,we conclude that it is implausible that the owners of neonatology and lakewood,educated and highly trained medical professionals,knowingly would have overpaid substantially for term life insurance unless they contemplated receiving an added boon such as a return of the excess contributions.
taxpayers advance two arguments to the effect that the court erred by not limiting its consideration to the written plan documents and life insurance contracts rather than relying on extraneous evidence like the plan marketing materials which discuss the availability of conversion credits.first,they maintain that the neonatology and lakewood sc veba programs were employee benefit plans under the employee retirement income security act,et,erisa.thus,they contend that representations made outside of the plan documents can not be used to consider rights and obligations arising out of the plans.see br.of appellants at.second,they argue that under governing state insurance law,the tax implications of a group term life insurance policy are determined only on the basis of the policy language itself.as the literal provisions of the plans discuss only insurance is,a death benefit and an option to convert to an individual policy upon termination of say nothing about excess contributions returning as conversion credits,taxpayers claim that the tax court was compelled to conclude from the strict form of their plans that all contributions in fact went to providing insurance benefits.
inasmuch as taxpayers did not raise the erisa issue before the tax court,we need not consider it on this appeal.see visco comm r,cir.while we recognize that in some exceptional circumstances an appellate court may review a defaulted argument,in this case there are compelling reasons militating against our overlooking procedural norms to consider whether erisa governed the sc veba programs as our determination may prejudice persons not parties to this case 
in any event,even assuming for purposes of argument that the plans were employee benefit plans under erisa,the fact remains that under tax principles a court is not limited to plan documents in determining the tax consequences of a transaction.see,comm r court holding.the incidence of taxation depends upon the substance of a transaction.acm,at we must look beyond the form of the transaction to determine whether it has the economic substance that its form represents citations omitted lerman comm r,cir commissioner and courts have the power and duty to look beyond the mere forms of transactions to their economic substance and to apply the tax laws accordingly.the cases cited by taxpayers on the other hand,involve only disputes over erisa benefits between private parties,not disputes over tax liabilities between private parties and the commissioner.while the cases lay out certain principles for determining rights and obligations under an erisa plan,including the standard contract theory that the literal terms of a plan document must guide all analysis,the cases say nothing about the proper evidentiary protocol for evaluating the tax ramifications of an employee benefit plan.in sum,we have no intention of importing erisa principles into this tax dispute.
moreover,we reject taxpayers contention that the tax court erred by not limiting its evaluation to the plan documents in light of state insurance law.the court did not construe or interpret the terms of the individual taxpayers life insurance policies,but rather characterized the contributions made towards those policies for purposes of determining tax liabilities.while the former endeavor indeed would implicate state law the latter is singularly a question of federal law.see,thomas flexible coupling comm r,cir.
in view of our conclusion that the contributions in dispute were not ordinary and necessary business expenses under a,we next consider whether the district court erred in determining that the contributions constituted dividends rather than compensation to the individual taxpayers and thus deductible to the corporations on that basis under a,a dividend is a distribution of property made by a corporation to its shareholders out of its earnings and profits.see comm r makransky,cir.dividends are taxed as a component of gross income.see a.a shareholder,even if the corporation has dispensed with the formalities of declaration,may be charged with a disguised or constructive dividend if the corporation confers a direct benefit on him from available earnings and profits without expectation of repayment.see,crosby united states,cir noble comm r,cir see also magnon comm r,wl where a corporation confers an economic benefit on a shareholder without the expectation of repayment,that benefit becomes a constructive dividend,taxable to the shareholder,even though neither the corporation nor the shareholder intended a dividend.
in this case,the record fully supports the conclusion of the tax court that the individual taxpayers were chargeable with constructive dividends.indeed,neonatology and lakewood,by design surrendering any expectation of remuneration,purchased products that generated a considerable economic bounty for their shareholders in the form of conversion credits.furthermore,nothing in the record illustrates that taxpayers diverted these corporate assets with the requisite compensatory intent.see king.mobile home park,comm r,wl business expense may be deducted as compensation only if the payor intends at the time that the payment is made to compensate the recipient for services performed moreover,support for a conclusion,though certainly not dispositive,that the excess contributions were not paid as compensation for services rendered is supplied by the fact that the neonatology and lakewood plans were made available only to those individuals who owned the corporations and not to their employees.furthermore,mall directed neonatology to purchase the product on her husband,a who did not perform any services for the corporation in the circumstances,it is therefore not surprising that desai at trial made the statement that the money contributed by lakewood to fund insurance premiums and conversion credits is our money.it not lakewood.app.at.
taxpayers again rely on erisa jurisprudence for the exaggerated proposition that payments made pursuant to an employee benefit plan are necessarily compensatory however,the plain language of a explicitly contemplates situations where contributions paid or accrued by an employer to a welfare benefit fund are not deductible deductions allowed only if they would otherwise be deductible see also reg.a contributions to employee benefit plans deductible only if they are ordinary and necessary business expenses.to read otherwise inexplicably creates a shelter loophole by allowing taxpayers to transform disbursements into deductible business expenses merely by funneling them through an erisa plan.
we recognize that it is axiomatic that taxpayers lawfully may arrange their affairs to keep taxes as low as possible nevertheless,at the same time the law imposes certain threshold duties which a taxpayer may not shirk simply by manipulating figures or maneuvering assets to conceal their real character.see court holding,at.at t o permit the true nature of a transaction to be disguised by mere formalisms would seriously impair the effective administration of the tax policies of congress.see also saviano comm r,cir the freedom to arrange one affairs to minimize taxes does not include the right to engage in financial fantasies with the expectation that the internal revenue service will play along.thus,we conclude that the tax court correctly held that the inflated premiums were not allowable corporate business expenses but rather allocations in the nature of dividends and thusly taxable.
b.the penalties 
finally,we must consider the aptness of the penalties assessed by the commissioner and upheld by the tax court.the internal revenue code imposes a tax on the portion of an underpayment attributable,among other things,to negligence or the disregard of rules and regulations.a and b.negligence can include any fail
