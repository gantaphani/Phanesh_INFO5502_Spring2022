the city of vacaville the city imposes a duty on hotel owners to collect and remit to the city a transient occupancy tax as authorized by revenue and taxation code section vacaville vmc.ron pitamber,operator of the best western heritage inn best western,refused to comply with the city audit request for records used to compute the tax.the superior court ordered compliance and pitamber and best western appealed we agree with the reasoning and holding in patel city of gilroy th,d gilroy and affirm.
background 
the city had conducted regular compliance reviews of best western in and without incident.in march of,the city auditor notified best western of its intent to conduct another periodic audit of the records of best western.
this time,pitamber counsel notified the city that under the authority of city of san bernardino city of san bernardino th,d san bernardino,best western was not obligated to disclose its books and records to the city.on april,the city finance manager notified pitamber that the city intended to issue a subpoena for inspection of best western records.
on april,the city council authorized the mayor to issue a subpoena pursuant to government code sections,directing best western custodian of records to appear before the city council and produce the relevant books and records best western counsel responded with a letter asserting legal challenges to the subpoena and the transient occupancy tax ordinance itself.when best western did not comply with the subpoena,the mayor of vacaville,pursuant to section,notified the superior court of best western failure to appear.
on june,the superior court issued an order directing pitamber to show cause why he should not comply with the subpoena.pitamber responded with a brief arguing that the ordinance was unconstitutional and that the subpoena was unauthorized.the city filed a response and pitamber filed a supplementary response challenging the superior court jurisdiction 
following a hearing,the court issued its decision ordering best western and pitamber to comply with the subpoena.the court determined that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague,the subpoena was not overbroad,and the city council had the authority to issue the subpoena,citing gilroy,supra,th,d.best western and pitamber appeal,contending that the subpoena and the ordinance are invalid.
discussion 
pitamber contends that the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied in this case.he also contends that the ordinance violates due process and that the city council was not authorized to issue the subpoena.we find the vacaville ordinance to be almost identical to the ordinance considered in gilroy,supra,th,d and will affirm the superior court decision.
standard for facial challenges to unconstitutional statutes 
the majority opinion in united states salerno,d salerno explained the standard for reviewing facial constitutional challenges to statutes as follows.a facial challenge to a legislative act is,of course,the most difficult challenge to mount successfully,since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the act would be valid.the fact that a statute might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid,since we have not recognized an overbreadth doctrine outside the limited context of the first amendment.italics added.
pitamber contends that salerno is not applicable and that the plurality opinion in chicago morales,d morales provides the correct standard.morales determined that a gang loitering ordinance that reached a substantial amount of innocent conduct,was unconstitutional on its face without deciding if the ordinance was vague in every application.id.at.
pitamber argument was rejected in hotel motel ass of oakland city of oakland,where the court stated until a majority of the supreme court directs otherwise,a party challenging the facial validity of an ordinance on vagueness grounds outside the domain of the first amendment must demonstrate that the enactment is impermissibly vague in all of its applications.id.at.similarly,the california supreme court has repeatedly employed the salerno standard.see,people ex rel.gallo acuna cal th,d,a claim that a law is unconstitutionally vague can succeed only where the litigant demonstrates that the law is vague as to her or impermissibly vague in all of its applications accord,east bay asian local development state of california cal th,d,statute will not be deemed facially invalid unless unconstitutional in all of its applications.salerno provides the correct analysis of pitambers facial challenge to the ordinance.
the vacaville ordinance is not facially unconstitutional 
scienter is not a required element 
pitamber argues that the lack of a scienter requirement in the ordinance renders it unconstitutionally vague in that it fails to provide fair warning of what is prohibited and impermissibly delegates policy matters to law enforcement agencies 
none of the cases pitamber cites support his argument.pitamber argues that united states bishop,d bishop,requires willfulness as an element of the federal tax laws.in fact,bishop only concerned the meaning of willfully where it was contained in specific felony and misdemeanor tax evasion statutes.id.at.united states ragen,cited for the proposition that a statute without a scienter requirement is a trap for those who act in good faith,was a prosecution for willfully attempting to evade federal income tax provisions.the courts actual quote was on no construction can the statutory provisions here involved become a trap for those who act in good faith.grayned city of rockford,d,concerned an antinoise ordinance that was not held to be vague,and an ordinance prohibiting picketing that violated the equal protection clause.the court stated generally that vague laws fail to give notice of what conduct is prohibited.
no rule requires scienter as a necessary element of every law imposing criminal penalties.it is an established principle that every true crime as distinguished from regulatory or public welfare offenses ordinarily requires a general criminal intent or mens rea.witkin epstein,law ed.elements.statutes imposing taxes are regulatory statutes.i n the collection of taxes,the importance to the public of their collection leads the l egislature to impose on the taxpayer the burden of finding out the facts upon which his liability to pay depends,and meeting it at the peril of punishment.people allen th,d quoting from united states balint.where an affirmative act is involved,imposition of liability without proof of guilty intent or knowledge is constitutionally proper.witkin epstein,cal.criminal law,supra,elements.
the definitions are sufficiently clear 
pitamber argues that the vmc definitional structure is patently circular.he refers to the flaws in the ordinance in san bernardino,supra,th,d.the ordinance in this case does not suffer from the same problems.he argues that hotel is defined as a structure that furnishes lodging to a transient,that transient is defined as someone who obtains occupancy in a hotel and occupancy is defined as obtaining possession for dwelling or lodging purposes.
the vacaville ordinance contains the following definitions.the definition of hotel is any structure or any portion of any structure that is occupied or intended or designated for occupancy by transients for dwelling,lodging or sleeping purposes,including any hotel,inn,tourist home or house,motel,studio hotel,bachelor hotel,lodging house,rooming house,apartment house,dormitory,public or private club,mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location or other similar structure or portion thereof.vmc 
transient means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession,permit,right of access,license or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer
