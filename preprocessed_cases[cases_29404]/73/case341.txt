after taxpayers donated a conservation easement to a land trust,they claimed a charitable deduction for the asserted value of the easement.the tax court held that the easement did not qualify as a charitable contribution and so the taxpayers were not entitled to the deduction.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
the parties stipulated to the following facts before the tax court.
between and,and harriet belk accumulated roughly acres of land straddling union and mecklenburg counties outside of charlotte,north carolina.in february,the belks formed a limited liability company,olde sycamore,llc,and transferred to it their newly acquired parcel of land.olde sycamore developed the land,building a golf course and surrounding it with residential lots,which were later sold to builders.homes now occupy those lots,and olde sycamore continues to own the golf course.old sycamore remains wholly owned by the percent by,and one percent by his wife,harriet.
in,olde sycamore executed a conservation easement the easement covering roughly acres of the land on which the golf course now sits.the easement was then transferred to smoky mountain national land trust,the trust and recorded in both union and mecklenburg counties.the easement imposes on the acre parcel a number of enforceable use restrictions,including a prohibition on further development and a requirement that the parcel be used for outdoor recreation.olde sycamore granted the easement in perpetuity,subject to certain reserved rights.
one such reserved right,central to this appeal,permits olde sycamore to substitute an area of land owned by it which is contiguous to the conservation area for an equal or lesser area of land comprising a portion of the conservation area.olde sycamore substitution right is conditioned upon the trust agreement that the substitute property is of the same or better ecological stability,that the substitution shall have no adverse effect on the conservation purposes,and that the fair market value of the substituted property is at least equal to that of the property originally subject to the easement.the substitution provision thus permits olde sycamore,if the trust agrees and it can not unreasonably withhold agreement,to swap land in and out of the easement.in doing so,olde sycamore can shift the use restriction from one parcel to another,provided the easement continues to cover at least acres and to advance its stated conservation purpose.such a substitution becomes final when reflected in a formal amendment to the easement recorded in the relevant county or counties.
the easement contains a savings clause,also of relevance here,which circumscribes the trust ability to agree to such amendments.this clause provides that the trust shall have no right or power to agree to any amendments that would result in this conservation easement failing to qualify as a qualified conservation contribution under section h of the internal revenue code and applicable regulations.section h details the circumstances under which the grant of a conservation easement may be claimed as a charitable contribution deduction.see u.h.
on its income tax return,olde sycamore claimed a deduction of for the donation of the easement to the trust.the deduction passed through to the belks as the sole owners of olde sycamore,see a,and the belks claimed the deduction on their,and income tax returns.
in,the commissioner of internal revenue sent the belks a notice of deficiency,informing them that they owed substantial amounts in back taxes for tax years,and.the commissioner reasoned that the belks had not established that all the requirements of irc and the corresponding treasury regulations ha d been satisfied to enable them to deduct the noncash charitable contribution of a qualified conservation contribution.
the belks filed a petition for redetermination with the tax court.the tax court upheld the commissioner determination in a published opinion,and upon motion for reconsideration by the belks,issued a supplementary opinion reaching the same conclusion.the belks timely appealed to this court,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
the internal revenue code permits taxpayers to deduct from their taxable income the value of a qualifying charitable contribution.a.the code generally restricts a taxpayer ability to claim a charitable deduction for the donation of an interest in property which consists of less than the taxpayer entire interest in such property.id.f a.but it provides an exception to the general rule for a qualified conservation contribution.id.f b iii.
the code defines a qualified conservation contribution as a contribution a of a qualified real property interest,b to a qualified organization,c exclusively for conservation purposes.id.h.it is the first requirement that the donation be of a qualified real property interest that the tax court concluded the belks had not satisfied here,and which is now the focus of this appeal 
a qualified real property interest includes a restriction granted in perpetuity on the use which may be made of the real property.id.h c.because an easement is,by definition,a restriction on the use which may be made of real property,the donation of a conservation easement can properly provide the basis of a deduction under the code if the restriction is granted in perpetuity.
the treasury regulations offer a single and exceedingly narrow exception to the requirement that a conservation easement impose a perpetual use restriction.the regulations provide that in the event that a 
subsequent unexpected change in the conditions surrounding the property make s impossible or impractical the continued use of the property for conservation purposes,the conservation purpose can nonetheless be treated as protected in perpetuity if the restrictions are extinguished by judicial proceeding and all of the donee proceeds from a subsequent sale or exchange of the property are used by the donee organization in a manner consistent with the conservation purposes of the original contribution.
reg.a g i emphasis added.thus,absent these unexpected and extraordinary circumstances,real property placed under easement must remain there in perpetuity in order for the donor of the easement to claim a charitable deduction.
where,as here,the parties have proceeded on stipulated facts before the tax court,we review the tax court legal decisions de novo.pfister commissioner,cir.in doing so,we keep in mind that deductions are a matter of legislative grace and the taxpayers bear the burden of proving their entitlement to a claimed deduction.see indopco,commissioner,d new colonial ice helvering.
the tax court concluded that the belks were not entitled to claim a deduction for the donation of the easement because olde sycamore had not donated a qualified real property interest.h.the tax court reasoned that because the conservation easement agreement permits the belks to change what property is subject to the conservation easement,the use restriction was not granted in perpetuity,as required by h c.the belks maintain that the code requires only a restriction in perpetuity on some real property,rather than the real property governed by the original easement.appellants br.the easement here satisfies this requirement,they argue,because any property removed from the easement must be replaced with property of equal value that is then subject to the same use restrictions.
the plain language of the code belies this contention.for the code expressly provides that a qualified property interest includes a restriction granted in perpetuity on the use which may be made of the real property.h c emphasis added.the placement of the article the before real property makes clear that a perpetual use restriction must attach to a defined parcel of real property rather than simply some or any or interchangeable parcels of real property.for the is a definite article,which lends to the noun that follows it a specific rather than general identity.see american bus ass slater,see also webster third new international dictionary providing the primary definition of the as a function word used to indicate that a following noun refers to someone or something previously mentioned or clearly understood from the context or the situation.
reading h and together further makes clear that the defined parcel of land identified by the phrase the real property is the real property to which the donated conservation easement initially attached.these provisions of the code provide 
h qualified conservation contribution.
in general.for purposes of subsection f b iii,the term qualified conservation contribution means a contribution a of a qualified real property interest,b to a qualified organization,c exclusively for conservation purposes.
qualified real property interest.for purposes of this subsection,the term qualified real property interest means any of the following interests in real property a the entire interest of the donor other than a qualified mineral interest,b a remainder interest,and c a restriction granted in perpetuity on the use which may be made of the real property.
h.section h defines the term qualified real property interest as used in h a,providing that the term qualified real property interest means a restriction granted in perpetuity on the use of the real property.thus,in order to qualify as a qualified conservation contribution,the parcel in which use must be restricted in perpetuity is the parcel that must be contributed to a qualified organization exclusively for conservation purposes.
the easement at issue here fails to meet this requirement because the real property contributed to the trust is not subject to a use restriction in perpetuity.the easement purports to restrict development rights in perpetuity for a defined parcel of land,but upon satisfying the conditions in the substitution provision,the taxpayers may remove land from that defined parcel and substitute other land.thus,while the restriction may be perpetual,the restriction on the real property is not.for this reason,the easement does not constitute a qualified conservation contribution under h and the belks were not entitled to claim a deduction for the contribution.
moreover,permitting the belks to claim a deduction for the easement would enable them to bypass several requirements critical to the statutory and regulatory schemes governing deductions for charitable contributions.for instance,f d requires that i n the case of contributions of property for which a deduction of more than is claimed a qualified appraisal of such property must accompany the tax return.permitting the belks to change the boundaries of the easement renders the appraisal meaningless it is no longer an accurate reflection of the value of the donation,for parts of the donation may be clawed back.it matters not that the easement requires that the removed property be replaced with property of equal or greater value,because the purpose of the appraisal requirement is to enable the commissioner,not the donee or donor,to verify the value of a donation.the easement substitution provision places the belks beyond the reach of the commissioner in this regard.
the requirement in the treasury regulations that a donor of a conservation easement make available to the donee documentation sufficient to establish the condition of the property would also be skirted if the borders of an easement could shift.reg.a g i see also id.a g i a d listing maps and photographs of the property as potential sources of this documentation.not only does this regulation confirm that a conservation easement must govern a defined and static parcel,it also makes clear that holding otherwise would deprive donees of the ability to ensure protection of conservation interests by,for instance,examination of maps and photographs of the protected property.id.
the regulations do provide that the use restrictions on a donated easement can be extinguished without sacrificing the donor tax benefit in one limited instance.that is,when a subsequent unexpected change in the conditions surrounding the property that is the subject of a donation make impossible or impractical the continued use of the property for conservation purposes and the restrictions are extinguished by judicial proceeding.id.g.the belks maintain that this limited exception to the perpetuity requirement would be invalid if the tax court reasoning is upheld.reply br.that argument fails.this regulation permits a donor to retain a tax benefit when a conservation easement,though granted in perpetuity,subsequently can not further its conservation purpose and is extinguished by court order.the regulation does nothing to undercut the correctness of the tax court holding here that the code requires a donor to grant an easement to a single,immutable parcel at the outset to qualify for a charitable deduction 
in short,the code and treasury regulations together make clear that h c means what it says a charitable deduction may be claimed for the donation of a conservation easement only when that easement restricts the use of the donated property in perpetuity.because the easement here fails to meet this requirement,it is ineligible to form the basis for a charitable deduction under h c.
the belks offer two reasons why we should reject this straightforward application of statutory text.
first,they maintain that cases support the notion that h c does not require that restrictions attach to a single,defined parcel.see appellants br.citing kaufman shulman,cir commissioner simmons.in those cases,the courts found that preservation easements covering the facades of historic buildings,which reserved to the donee the right to abandon the easement,did not violate h a given the negligible possibility that the donee would actually abandon its rights under the easement.
according to the belks,simmons and kaufman demonstrate that courts have approved deductions for easements that put the perpetuity of the conservation easement at far greater risk than the clause at issue in this case.appellants br.but this argument misses the critical distinction between those cases and this one.the simmons and kaufman courts considered whether the easements before them satisfied the requirement in h a that the conservation purpose be protected in perpetuity.see simmons,at kaufman,at.here,the question is whether the easement satisfies the requirement in h c that the use restrictions on the parcel be granted in perpetuity.though both requirements speak in terms of perpetuity,they are not one and the same.the provision at issue here,h c,governs the grant of the easement itself,while the provision at issue in simmons and kaufman,h a,governs its subsequent enforcement.thus,simmons and kaufman plausibly stand only for the proposition that a donation will not be rendered ineligible simply because the donee reserves its right not to enforce the easement.they do not support the belks view that the grant of a conservation easement qualifies for a charitable deduction even if the easement may be relocated.indeed,as we have explained,such a holding would violate the plain meaning of h c.
the second reason the belks offer for ignoring the clear statutory language of h c is equally unpersuasive.they contend that because north carolina law permits parties to amend an easement,the tax court logic would render all conservation easements in north carolina ineligible under h.see appellants br.but whether state property and contract law permits a substitution in an easement is irrelevant to the question of whether federal tax law permits a charitable deduction for the donation of such an easement.contrary to the belks suggestion,accepting this fact does not require a conclusion that no conservation easement could qualify for a deduction unless the applicable state law prohibited amendments to make a substitution of property.id.at.rather,h c requires that the gift of a conservation easement on a specific parcel of land be granted in perpetuity to qualify for a federal charitable deduction,notwithstanding the fact that state law may permit an easement to govern for some shorter period of time.thus,an easement that,like the one at hand,grants a restriction for less than a perpetual term,may be a valid conveyance under state law,but is still ineligible for a charita
