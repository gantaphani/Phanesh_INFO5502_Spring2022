this appeal from a decision of the united states tax court the tax court involves the federal income tax treatment of shares of stock issued to an executive employee of dominion technology resources,dtri,around the time of dtri founding.the company successor in interest,qinetiq holdings,subsidiaries qinetiq,contends that the stock was issued in connection with the executive employment and was subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture until.on this basis,qinetiq argues that it is entitled to a tax deduction for the value of the stock as a trade or business expense in the tax year ending march.
after reviewing qinetiq tax return,the internal revenue service irs issued a notice of deficiency concluding that qinetiq had not shown its entitlement to the claimed deduction.qinetiq later filed suit in the tax court,raising both a procedural and a substantive argument.qinetiq argued that the irs failed to give a reasoned explanation in the notice of deficiency for denying the tax deduction.qinetiq also argued that the stock qualified as a deductible trade or business expense in tax year,because the stock was issued in connection with services and was subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture until that year.the tax court rejected the procedural argument,holding that the notice of deficiency provided sufficient explanation.the tax court also held that qinetiq failed to show that the stock was issued in connection with services and was subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.accordingly,the tax court entered judgment in favor of the irs.
upon our review,we conclude that the irs complied with all applicable procedural requirements in issuing the notice of deficiency to qinetiq.we further hold that the tax court did not err in concluding that the stock failed to qualify as a deductible expense for the tax year ending march,because the stock was not issued subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.we therefore affirm the tax court judgment.
in march,thomas hume hume formed thomas hume,as a corporation organized under the laws of virginia.hume was the sole shareholder,and served with his wife,karyn hume,as the initial directors of the corporation.hume filed federal tax forms electing for the corporation to be treated as an s corporation,in order to permit the corporation profits and losses to be passed through to him individually.see b.thomas hume,appears not to have engaged in any business before november.
in november,hume and julian chin took certain actions to facilitate chin joining the business enterprise.on december,hume and karyn hume,as directors,filed articles of amendment with the commonwealth of virginia changing the name of the corporation to dominion technology resources,and creating two classes of shares,class a voting stock and class b nonvoting stock.the next day,karyn hume resigned from dtri board of directors,leaving hume as the sole director.on december,hume paid a par value of in exchange for shares of dtri class a voting stock,and chin paid the same par value in exchange for shares of dtri class a voting stock and shares of dtri class b nonvoting stock.
on december,hume executed a consent in lieu of the organizational meeting of the board of directors of dtri december consent,which offered for sale and issuance shares of class a stock to hume,and shares of class a and shares of class b stock to chin.attached to the december consent were letters signed by hume and chin acknowledging their intent to subscribe to the stated stock shares.also included in the december consent was authorization for dtri to enter into a shareholders agreement and employment agreements with hume and chin.in a separate paragraph,the december consent further authorized dtri to enter into individual employment agreements and restrictive stock agreements with other employees.
the shareholders agreement entered into by dtri,hume,and chin stated that the parties 
believe that it is in their mutual best interest to make provisions for the future disposition of all of the shares of common stock of the corporation to the end that continuity of harmonious management is assured,and a fair process is established by which said shares of common stock may be transferred,conveyed,assigned or sold.
to that end,the shareholders agreement prescribed provisions for restricting the sale or transfer of stock and for returning stock to the corporation in the event of either hume or chin death,disability,or termination of employment with dtri.
the shareholders agreement contained provisions for calculating the agreement value of the shares upon the occurrence of any of these events,and gave the corporation the option of repurchasing hume or chin shares at the calculated value in the event of such death,disability,or termination without cause.additionally,in the event of voluntary resignation by the employee,the shareholders agreement provided dtri the option of purchasing the shares at of the agreement value for every year of the departing employee employment,up to a maximum of after twenty years.however,in the event that the employee voluntarily resigned and engaged in competition with dtri,or that dtri terminated the employee for cause,the corporation would have the option to purchase the shares at of the agreement value for every year of employment,up to a maximum of of the agreement value.
also in december,dtri entered into stock agreements with other employees that were far more restrictive than the terms of the shareholders agreement executed by hume and chin.the stock agreements with the other employees contained greater limitations on the transfer of stock and a less generous method for calculating stock value for purposes of dtri repurchase of a departing employee stock.also,unlike hume and chin,the other employees did not receive any voting rights in the stock they received.
dtri entered into employment agreements with hume,chin,and other employees in december.the employment agreements with hume and chin bore no reference to stock issued as compensation.in contrast,the employment agreements for the other employees who received stock in december explicitly referenced,under a contract section labeled compensation,nonvoting stock that was issued subject to restrictions.
dtri,hume,and chin filed yearly tax documents treating dtri as a entity between tax years and,with hume and chin identified as the shareholders.in dtri tax filings from to,dtri allocated its net income or loss to hume and chin,based on their respective percentage of stock ownership in dtri in each taxable year.in december,dtri revoked its s corporation election,effective january.from through,dtri did not report the stock issued in to hume and chin as employment compensation,and therefore did not withhold federal payroll taxes on the issued stock.in contrast,dtri,hume,and chin reported as employment compensation shares later granted to hume and chin.
in,qinetiq entered into negotiations to purchase dtri.on august,qinetiq,project black acquisition,dtri,hume,and chin entered into a final agreement and plan of merger,with qinetiq paying million in exchange for all outstanding stock in dtri.immediately before the transaction closed,hume and chin executed consent agreements waiving dtri rights with respect to stock transfer restrictions or partially vested stock.the merger transaction closed in october.
for the tax year ending on march,qinetiq withheld payroll taxes in accordance with the value of the stock received by hume and chin in,and claimed deductions under h,as wages paid to hume and chin for the fair market value of the shares originally issued to them in december.hume and chin filed personal income tax returns for tax year claiming as wage income the value of their respective shares issued in december.
the irs transmitted to qinetiq a notice of deficiency stating that the irs had determined that qinetiq ha d not established that it was entitled to a deduction under the provisions of,and that qinetiq taxable income for the year thereby was increased by.the irs did not give a further explanation of its decision in its notice of deficiency.
qinetiq filed a petition in the tax court challenging the sufficiency of the notice of deficiency,as well as the irs substantive determination with respect to chin shares the tax court ruled that qinetiq had not demonstrated entitlement to the deduction on two independent bases,namely,that the stock was not property transferred in connection with the performance of services and was not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture at the time chin acquired the shares.qinetiq appeals from the tax court judgment.
we first address qinetiq argument that the notice of deficiency is invalid because it failed to provide a reasoned explanation for the agency final decision,as required by the administrative procedure act apa.this issue presents a question of law that we consider de novo.starnes comm r,cir.
the apa authorizes district courts to review agency actions with a focal point on the administrative record already in existence.camp pitts,per curiam.the supreme court has held that a required component of this administrative record is a reasoned explanation for the agency action.fcc fox television stations.qinetiq anchors its argument on this principle,maintaining that this requirement of a reasoned explanation necessarily applies to a notice of deficiency,because that notice is a final agency action within the meaning of the apa.thus,according to qinetiq,failure by the irs to comply with this apa requirement rendered the notice of deficiency invalid.
we disagree with qinetiq argument,which fails to consider the unique system of judicial review provided by the internal revenue code for adjudication of the merits of a notice of deficiency.it is that specific body of law,rather than the more general provisions for judicial review authorized by the apa,that governs the content requirements of a notice of deficiency.
under the apa,the task of the reviewing court is to apply the appropriate apa standard of review to the agency decision based on the record the agency presents to the reviewing court.power light lorion,internal citation omitted.the reviewing court in such a case generally is not authorized to conduct a de novo evaluation of the record or to reach its own conclusions regarding the subject matter before the agency.id.at.
some statutes,however,provide materially different procedures for judicial review that predate the apa enactment.one such example is the internal revenue code the code,which authorizes de novo review in the tax court of a notice of deficiency.see eren comm r,cir.we discussed this unique system of judicial review in our decision in commissioner,cir.we explained that because the code provisions for de novo review in the tax court permit consideration of new evidence and new issues not presented at the agency level,those provisions are incompatible with the limited judicial review of final agency actions allowed under the apa id.at see also a.
additionally,we observe that for an agency action to be deemed final within the meaning of the apa and,thus,subject to the apa requirement of a reasoned explanation,the agency action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined,or from which legal consequences will flow.bennett spear,internal citation and quotation marks omitted.l egal consequences include agency determinations that restrict the government power to take contrary litigation positions in subsequent proceedings.see army corps of eng rs.hawkes,holding that agency determinations effectively giving a safe harbor from government suits create legal consequences within the meaning of the bennett test.
after issuing a notice of deficiency,however,the irs may later assert in the tax court new legal theories and allege additional deficiencies.see a tax.a.likewise,a taxpayer may raise new matters before the tax court not previously considered during the administrative process.a.in contrast to these fluid procedures,the apa arbitrary and capricious standard requires that judicial review of an agency action be confined to the static administrative record with deference accorded to the agency decision,and that the agency action be final in all respects before judicial review commences.see,a pitts,at.
given these significant variations in the scope of judicial review under the two statutory schemes,we conclude that the apa general procedures for judicial review,including the requirement of a reasoned explanation in a final agency decision,were not intended by congress to be superimposed on the internal revenue code specific procedures for de novo judicial review of the merits of a notice of deficiency.as the supreme court has emphasized,congress did not intend for the apa to duplicate the previously established special statutory procedures relating to specific agencies.bowen massachusetts,see also hinck united states,i n most contexts,a precisely drawn,detailed statute more general remedies.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.accordingly,we hold that the apa requirement of a reasoned explanation in support of a final agency action does not apply to a notice of deficiency issued by the irs and that,therefore,the notice of deficiency issued to qinetiq in this case was not subject to that apa requirement 
we next consider whether the notice of deficiency in this case was insufficient to satisfy the requirement of section a of the code that the irs describe in the notice the basis for,and identify the amounts if any of,the tax due,interest,additional amounts,additions to the tax,and assessable penalties.a.the statute further provides that an inadequate description under the preceding sentence shall not invalidate such notice.id.however,the statute is silent regarding the circumstances,if any,that will cause a notice of deficiency to be invalidated.id.
some federal courts of appeal have held that a notice of deficiency may be invalidated for the failure to include certain information.for example,before the enactment of section we held that a notice of deficiency must contain a statement that the irs has examined a return and has determined a deficiency in an exact amount.abrams comm r,cir.and,after the enactment of section,the ninth circuit implicitly has endorsed application of a rule that major errors in a notice of deficiency causing prejudice to a taxpayer will render that determination invalid.see elings comm r,cir.also,the tenth circuit has held that a notice of deficiency may not be used to implicitly deny without explanation a taxpayer request for discretionary relief see fisher comm r,cir.in contrast,some of our sister circuits have held that minor,nonprejudicial flaws in a notice of deficiency will not cause such notice to be invalidated.elings,at smith comm r,cir.
upon consideration of this authority,we hold that the notice of deficiency issued to qinetiq satisfied the basic requirements of the internal revenue code.the notice of deficiency informed qinetiq that the irs had determined a deficiency in an exact amount for a particular tax year,and incorporated by reference an enclosed statement that the deduction you claimed for salaries and wages in the amount of under the provisions of code is disallowed in full as you have not established that you are entitled to such a deduction.the notice of deficiency further informed qinetiq that it had the right to contest this deficiency determination in the tax court.in light of the taxpayer burden to show entitlement to a particular deduction,indopco,comm r,we discern no prejudice to qinetiq due to the absence of additional information in the notice of deficiency.accordingly,we hold that its content was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the internal revenue code.
finally,we turn to the merits of qinetiq claim that qinetiq was entitled to a tax deduction in tax year for the stock chin acquired from dtri in.in addressing this issue,we apply an established standard of review.decisions of the tax court are subject on appeal to the same standard we apply to civil bench trials on appeal from the district courts.estate of waters comm r,cir.under this standard,we review factual findings for clear error,legal questions de novo,and mixed questions of law and fact de novo.waterman comm r,cir.waters,at.
