discussion 
section states in addition to the deduction provided in article commencing with section,there shall be allowed as deductions in computing taxable income the items specified in this article.
this appeal concerns the first such deduction in section,which states,in relevant part a a portion of the dividends received during the taxable year declared from income which has been included in the measure of the taxes imposed under chapter commencing with section,chapter commencing with section,or chapter commencing with section upon the taxpayer declaring the dividends.

the term percent owned corporation means any corporation if percent or more of the stock of that corporation by vote and value is owned by the taxpayer.for purposes of the preceding sentence,stock described in section a of the internal revenue code shall not be taken into account.
the remainder of the statute concerns exceptions to the section deduction which do not apply in this appeal.
the farmer.decision 
farmer held that section unconstitutionally violated the commerce clause of the united states constitution.
in farmer,the taxpayer farmer,a california corporation that manufactured and sold coffee and products,filed corporate income or franchise tax returns with the ftb.the returns reported a dividends received deduction under section,reflecting a portion of the dividends farmer received during the year.farmer owned less than percent of stock in corporations that paid it dividends.in this circumstance section allowed a maximum deduction of percent of the dividend amount.farmer,supra,th at,d.the ftb promulgated a schedule listing the corporations and the percentage of dividends deductible under section,based on a formula that entitled the taxpayer to a greater deduction the more the payer corporation income was subject to california corporate taxes.taxpayer farmer filed amended tax returns claiming a dividends received deduction for all dividends received for the years at issue and requested more than in refunds on the ground that section violated the commerce clause.after the ftb denied the refund claims and the state board of equalization sustained that denial,taxpayer farmer filed an action for refund of corporate franchise or income tax based on its assertion that section was unconstitutional under the commerce clause.farmer argued that on its face,section discriminated against interstate commerce by improperly taxing income not attributable to business transacted in california,and that the deduction could not be justified as a lawful compensatory tax.farmer,at,d.the trial court found that section facially placed an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce,found that farmer was entitled to recover in refunds of corporate income and franchise taxes for seven tax years,and entered judgment for farmer.ftb appealed.farmer,at,d.
the farmer opinion quoted the commerce clause of the united states constitution,which states congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations,and among the several states,and with the indian tribes.const.art.i,cl.although it grants regulatory power to congress,the clause has a negative aspect that denies states the power to discriminate unjustifiably against or burden the interstate flow of articles of commerce.the negative or dormant commerce clause prohibits economic protectionism in the form of regulation which benefits economic interests by burdening economic competitors from outside the state.farmer,supra,th at,d.to determine whether a state regulation violates the dormant commerce clause,the first step is to determine whether it regulates evenhandedly,with only incidental effects on interstate commerce,or discriminates against interstate commerce.citation.with respect to state taxation,a state law is treated as discriminatory if it taxes a transaction or incident more heavily when it crosses state lines than when it occurs entirely within the state a law that is discriminatory on its face must be invalidated unless the state can show that it advances a legitimate local purpose that can not be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.id.at,d.even if it has no discriminatory goal or intent,a tax may violate the commerce clause if it is facially discriminatory or has the effect of unduly burdening interstate commerce.a state justifications for discriminatory restrictions on commerce must pass the strictest scrutiny.under this heavy burden of justification,facial discrimination by itself may be a fatal defect.ibid.
farmer held section to be discriminatory on its face because it affords to taxpayers a deduction for dividends received from corporations subject to tax in california,while no deduction is afforded for dividends received from corporations not subject to tax in california.farmer,supra,th at,d.the section dividends received deduction favored corporations doing business and paying taxes in california over corporations which did not do business or pay taxes in california.farmer,at,d.the dividends received deduction of section favored intrastate commerce by giving a greater tax benefit to taxpayers investing in california corporations.by denying the dividends received deduction to taxpayers investing in corporations,section discriminated against corporations engaged in business outside california.thus it discriminated against interstate commerce in violation of the commerce clause.farmer,at,d.
farmer.found section to be unconstitutional in its entirety 
abbott claims that the trial court erroneously ruled that farmer found section to be unconstitutional in its entirety.
abbott focuses on subdivision a of section,which defines dividends subject to the deduction in computing taxable income.the deduction is allowed for a portion of the dividends declared from income which has been included in the measure of the taxes imposed under chapter commencing with section,chapter commencing with section,or chapter commencing with section upon the taxpayer declaring the dividends.chapters,and concern taxation of corporations doing business in california or deriving income from sources within california.thus if a taxpayer owns part or all of a corporation which declares a dividend from income taxed under chapters,or,section,subdivision a would entitle the taxpayer to deduct a portion of those dividends from taxable income.
abbott argues that the farmer holding applies only to section,subdivision a,which discriminated against interstate commerce by allowing a deduction for dividends received from corporations subject to tax in california but not allowing this deduction for dividends received from corporations not subject to tax in california.specifically,abbott claims that only subdivision a of section was at issue in the farmer case,and that the farmer decision did not address the constitutional validity of subdivision b.
we disagree.having declared section,subdivision a unconstitutional,farmer eliminated the statutory deduction for dividends paid by corporations subject to tax in california.subdivision b of section establishes the portions of dividends which may be deducted.the invalidation of the deduction as unconstitutional meant that the percentages used to calculate t he portion of dividends which may be deducted under this section could not be applied.ibid.thus it was unnecessary for farmer to address whether section,subdivision b was constitutional.
it would be inappropriate for this court to rewrite or reform section,subdivision a 
abbott claims that the trial court erroneously failed to sever the unconstitutional provision in subdivision a from the remaining,valid provisions of section.
farmer held that allowing a deduction for dividends paid by corporations subject to tax in california favored those corporations,and allowing no deduction for dividends paid by corporations not subject to tax in california unconstitutionally discriminated against such corporations.there are two ways to eliminate this differing,discriminatory treatment.the deduction for dividends of corporations subject to tax in california can be eliminated,so that no dividends paid by any corporation would receive a deduction.alternatively,the section dividends received deduction could be extended to dividends paid by all corporations,whether or not they were subject to tax in california.
abbott argues in favor of this latter alternative,and claims this court should sever unconstitutional portions of section from the valid portion and declare the remaining statute constitutional.abbott relies on the severability clause in section,which states that if any chapter,article,section,subsection,clause,sentence or phrase of this part which is reasonably separable from the remaining portions of this part,or the application thereof to any person,taxpayer or circumstance,is for any reason determined unconstitutional,such determination shall not affect the remainder of this part,nor,will the application of any such provision to other persons,taxpayers or circumstances,be affec
