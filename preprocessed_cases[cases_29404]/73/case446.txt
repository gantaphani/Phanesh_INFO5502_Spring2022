a jury found stephen miller guilty of tax evasion in violation of.miller challenges the sufficiency of the evidence,as well as a number of the district court evidentiary rulings.he also contends that the indictment was duplicitous.finally,miller raises a claim of brady error.we affirm.
the jury could have concluded from the evidence the following.during the,stephen miller accumulated large tax deficiencies.according to the government,miller had tax deficiencies,penalties,and more than million.miller was associated with charles matich,a financial planner.matich helped wealthy individuals like miller decrease their tax exposure by moving their funds overseas.matich business came to an end when the government seized his records in and then charged him with conspiracy to impede income tax collection and personal tax evasion.matich pled guilty.
miller had over million in an individual retirement account ira.rather than satisfy his tax obligations,and fearful that the irs might seize the funds,miller and matich concocted a scheme to protect the funds.in january,miller began transferring money from his ira overseas to a shell company called euromex leasing limited,which miller had previously formed and matich then controlled.miller transferred approximately under the guise of repaying a loan to euromex.matich arranged to have euromex send miller a demand payment letter.after miller had repaid the loan,euromex sent miller a letter saying his debt was satisfied.after miller had repaid the loan,he continued transferring money from his ira overseas to accounts controlled by matich.he transferred more than million from his ira in,and he did report the ira withdrawals on his tax return.unbeknownst to miller until later,however,the money he transferred disappeared.
on march,the irs received a form offer in compromise from miller,in which he proposed settling his tax liabilities for.on the offer form,miller checked the box for doubt as to collectibility i have insufficient assets and income to pay the full amount.miller offered the following explanation at my age and unavailability of assets,i do not feel that i,nor my spouse,will live long enough to ever be able to pay the liabilities and additional taxes assessed on our account.the irs requested more information.miller submitted a form,which stated that he had a checking account worth and an ira with a balance of miller did not list any foreign accounts.the irs again requested more information,and specifically asked about the money withdrawn from his ira.miller responded that he used the funds to repay the euromex loan,and further explained,i have no idea what happened to the proceeds.i assume the funds were repaid to the lenders of the funds.miller repeated the story again in a subsequent correspondence with the irs 
i repaid those loans back to a euromex leasing corporation formed in the isle of mann which had invested in some disastrous investments in mexico in which i lost and was personally responsible for these funds represented return of principal and interest on funds borrowed.i have absolutely no idea what the present officers of that corporation have done with those proceeds.i do not have these funds nor do i have access to them.
subsequent to the submission of the offer,matich,who was working with the government,called miller.investigators recorded the conversation.a fair interpretation of the call is that miller transferred the money to shield it from the irs,believed the money was still his,and wanted it back.the call indicated that miller was only then learning that his money was gone.miller and matich also discussed how they could characterize their various transactions if questioned.
miller was charged with one count of tax evasion in violation of.the government theory was that miller offer in compromise constituted an attempt to evade his income taxes in that he lied by stating that because of unavailability of assets he could only pay to satisfy his tax liabilities.this was a lie because miller believed that he had over million overseas,which he did not reveal to the irs.the case went to trial,and matich testified as a government witness.the jury found miller guilty,and the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment and three years supervised release,and ordered him to pay in restitution.miller appealed.
after miller filed his opening brief,the assistant attorney notified him that she had become aware of a criminal referral involving matich by the trustee in montana.the referral referenced the government possession of matich business records.we abated miller appeal so he could file a motion for a new trial in the district court.miller did so,arguing that the government violated brady by failing to disclose the criminal referral and turn over all of matich business records.the district court denied miller motion,and he filed a supplemental brief in this court raising the brady issue.
miller challenges the sufficiency of the evidence.we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,drawing all reasonable inferences and credibility determinations in favor of the jury verdict if any rational trier of fact could have found proof of the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,the verdict will stand.
provides that a ny person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this title or the payment thereof shall be guilty of a felony.the crime of tax evasion as defined in has three essential elements the existence of a tax deficiency willfulness and an affirmative act constituting evasion or attempted evasion of the tax.w illfulness is a voluntary,intentional violation of a known legal duty.evidence is usually circumstantial as direct proof is rarely available.many kinds of conduct can constitute a willful attempt to evade taxation 
keeping a double set of books,making false entries or alterations,creating false invoices or documents,destroying books or records,concealing assets or covering up sources of income,handling one affairs to avoid making the records normally accompanying transactions of a particular kind,any conduct likely to mislead or conceal,holding assets in others names,providing false explanations,giving inconsistent statements to government agents,failing to report a substantial amount of income,a consistent pattern of underreporting large amounts of income,or spending large amounts of cash that can not be reconciled with the amount of reported income 
there is no question that miller had a tax deficiency.miller argument is a hybrid of the second and third elements he claims that the government failed to prove that he had access to,or control of,the money he transferred out of his ira and,therefore,his offer in compromise,which was based on his claim of unavailability of assets,was not fraudulent.put differently,the government failed to prove that the funds he transferred were available to him.this proof,his argument goes,is necessary for conviction.we are not persuaded.
where miller money was located,and who had access to and control of it,matters,on the facts here,only to the extent that it bears on miller knowledge and belief as to the state of his financial affairs when he submitted his offer that is,what miller intent was in submitting his offer.
the evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that when miller submitted his offer,he believed that he had million squirreled away overseas.the recorded phone call with matich,which occurred after submission of the offer,makes clear that miller continued to believe that the money he transferred was his.the call further reveals that,while miller had an inkling that there was a problem with his money,he did not know his money was in fact gone.moreover,miller responses to the irs requests for further information after he submitted his offer are compelling evidence that he was trying to hide his assets from the irs.miller did not say that the money transferred from his ira had disappeared or that he could not retrieve it rather he twice told the irs that he used the money to satisfy the fictitious euromex loan obligation,which miller knew did not exist and,in fact,had helped to concoct.
the irony in miller argument is that he transferred his money to matich precisely because he believed this would shield it from the irs.despite his understanding that he had million overseas,miller stated in his offer that he could only afford to pay in satisfaction of his tax liabilities.one can understand his submission of the offer as,inter alia,concealing assets,conduct likely to mislead or conceal,providing false explanations,or some combination thereof.the government proved the required affirmative act.
the government also introduced sufficient evidence to support a finding of willfulness,including admissions made by miller during the recorded phone call miller statements to the irs,both written and oral,including his telling the irs that he used the ira funds to pay off the fictitious euromex debt and,other documentary evidence,such as miller and matich various letters,emails,and faxes.
there is sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict.
miller challenges some of the district court evidentiary rulings.we review the district court evidentiary ruling for abuse of discretion if this court finds an abuse of discretion in admitting or excluding evidence,this court will review the error under the harmless error doctrine,affirming the judgment,unless the ruling affected substantial rights of the complaining party.
miller argues that the district court erred by limiting the testimony of his witness,donald williams,a former irs employee.the district court ruled that it would exclude three areas of williams testimony because miller offer was incomplete,the irs ran afoul of its internal policies by assigning it to an offer specialist the offer specialist assigned to miller offer was unusually knowledgeable and,williams opinion regarding whether miller had access to the funds that were transferred to euromex when miller submitted his offer.
the first and second areas of testimony are plainly irrelevant.rule provides that e vidence which is not relevant is not admissible.rule defines relevant evidence as evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.neither the irs adherence to its internal procedures nor the offer specialist knowledge bears upon what miller did,knew,or intended.the testimony is not probative of any fact of consequence and was properly excluded.
assuming williams opinion about miller access to the money is relevant,the exclusion was harmless.the excluded evidence does not bear on the contested issue at trial miller intent in submitting his offer.williams would have testified only that he believed miller did not have access to the money when he submitted his offer because the documents williams reviewed did not show where the money was or even if it still existed.williams would not have testified about what miller knew.
moreover,matich testified that the money disappeared shortly after miller transferred it,which of course means that miller could not access it.the evidence further demonstrated that matich had control of the overseas bank accounts into which the money was transferred.finally,the evidence of miller guilt was substantial.the exclusion was harmless because it could not have affected the jury determination on any of the charged counts.
miller next urges that the district court erred by admitting evidence of a past act of his under rule b.our review of the admission of rule b evidence is heightened.the rule provides that 
e vidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.it may,however,be admissible for other purposes,such as proof of motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident 
our decision in united states beechum creates a inquiry for analyzing the admissibility of rule b evidence.first,it must be determined that the extrinsic offense evidence is relevant to an issue other than the defendant character.second,the evidence must possess probative value that is not substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice and must meet the other requirements of r ule.
the district court admitted evidence that in miller opened a bank account under a false name and with fraudulent identification for the purpose of,as miller euphemistically told investigators,financial privacy.miller had attempted to deposit in cash in the account.the evidence was admitted as intent evidence.
a large part of miller defense turned on his mental state,that he lacked an unlawful intent in submitting his offer.miller also based his defense on a claim that he was innocently following matich orders.yet,in,miller was caught attempting to hide money under false pretenses,and he did so,according to matich testimony,even though matich told him not to.miller acts in,therefore,are probative of his intent.
miller argues that the past act is too remote in time to be admissible.while the length of time is relevant to our analysis,the past acts occurred shortly before miller began transferring money from his ira and his involvement in developing the sham euromex loan,the course of conduct that culminated in miller submission of his offer.and,there were common actors,miller and matich,involved in both schemes.the time lapse on these facts does not render the past acts inadmissible nor was the other evidence of miller intent so substantial that it was error to admit the past acts.thus,the evidence was relevant to an issue other than miller character,and its probative value was not substantially outweighed by undue prejudice.
finally,the district court instructed the after the jury heard the evidence and in its written the evidence could be used only for the limited purpose of evaluating miller intent,which minimizes any prejudicial effect accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion.
miller contends that the indictment is duplicitous because it describes both the transfer of money from his ira and the submission of his offer,which created the danger of a nonunanimous verdict.miller argument runs thus.the government,under its theory of the case,had to prove that miller submission of his offer was the affirmative act of evasion.but,because of the wording of the indictment,some jurors might have viewed miller transfer of money as the affirmative act while others viewed his submission of his offer as the affirmative act.thus,there is a danger of a nonunanimous verdict.
we review de novo a claim that an indictment is duplicitous duplicity occurs when a single count in an indictment contains two or more distinct offenses even if an indictment is duplicitous,a defendant must be prejudiced to receive relief the risk of a nonunanimous verdict is one recognized source of prejudice and it is the only prejudice miller alleges.assuming that the indictment is duplicitous,an assumption that is not without problems,there was no danger of a nonunanimous verdict.
the danger of a nonunanimous jury verdict may be avoided by proper jury instructions.the district court instructed the jury that 
t he phrase attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax involves two things first,the formation of an intent to evade or defeat a tax and,second,willfully performing some act to accomplish the intent to evade or defeat that tax.
the phrase attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax contemplates and charges that the defendant knew and understood that during the calendar years,and,he owed a substantial additional federal income tax and then tried in some way to avoid that additional tax.
in order to show attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax,therefore,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant miller intended to evade or defeat the tax due,and that the defendant miller also willfully submitted the offer in compromise in order to accomplish this intent to evade or defeat that tax.emphasis added 
the court did not simply charge the jury that it had to find that miller committed an act to accomplish his unl
