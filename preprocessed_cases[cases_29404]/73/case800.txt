norwood appeared before an irs agent in response to the summons on january,but refused to produce the information requested by the summons.norwood invoked his fifth amendment privilege against in response to the portions of the summons in question.
on january,the irs announced the offshore voluntary compliance initiative ovci.the program was designed to bring taxpayers who had used offshore accounts to hide income into compliance with federal tax law while gathering information about the promoters of such offshore schemes.taxpayers who voluntarily disclosed their use of offshore accounts prior to april,would be exempted from civil fraud and information return penalties,but would still be required to pay back taxes,interest,and certain accuracy and delinquency penalties.taxpayers already under audit when ovci began were ineligible for participation in the program.id.a.
on march,the government petitioned the district court for enforcement of its summons to norwood and an order instructing him to execute a consent directive authorizing any financial institution at which norwood had an account to release information relating to the account.the government petition was accompanied by two affidavits,one from revenue agent mark ensrud and one from revenue agent joseph west.agent ensrud declared that his investigation of norwood tax returns was prompted by information garnered through ovci.he stated that the ovci information revealed that norwood had two mastercard payment cards issued by leadenhall bank trust company leadenhall,located in nassau,the bahamas.ensrud disclosed the account numbers corresponding to the cards,and claimed that norwood had checked no in response to the question whether he had an interest in or a signature or other authority over a financial account in a foreign country on his and federal income tax returns.ensrud also declared that he had obtained receipts and information from a furniture company in fargo,north dakota,indicating that norwood had used his leadenhall cards there in to purchase furniture that was delivered to his home address.
agent west declaration described how the irs obtained account information on the leadenhall payment cards by means of a john doe summons served on mastercard international and american express travel related services company.west described a typical offshore scheme and concluded that taxpayers having signature authority over offshore credit cards such as those issued by leadenhall may be evading the payment of federal taxes by concealing unreported taxable income or claiming improper deductions as a result of maintaining diverted funds in offshore accounts.
after a hearing on an order to show cause on may,the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order on march,which it amended in an order issued august.the district court ruled that the irs had made a prima facie case for enforcement of the summons,and that norwood had not shown that the summons was issued for an improper purpose.the court also determined that the summons did not violate norwood fourth or fifth amendment rights,and denied norwood request for discovery.the court ordered norwood to comply with paragraphs,and the final paragraph of the summons.the court also ordered norwood to execute a consent directive for the years and.
norwood challenges two aspects of the district court decision.first,he contends that the district court erred in enforcing the summons.he asserts this was error because the irs had no legitimate purpose in seeking the information requested by the summons,enforcement of the summons would violate his fifth amendment right against,and the summons was unreasonably broad in violation of the fourth amendment.second,he contends that the district court should have granted him discovery regarding the irs institutional posture in the investigation,that is,whether the irs issued the summons for the purpose of developing criminal charges against norwood.
the district court finding that the irs had a legitimate purpose for summoning norwood is not clearly erroneous.see united states kaiser,cir standard of review.section of title authorizes the irs to summon certain persons and data f or the purpose of determining the liability of any person for any internal revenue tax.federal district courts have jurisdiction to enforce such a summons pursuant to.enforcement of a summons under is appropriate where the record shows that the investigation will be conducted pursuant to a legitimate purpose,that the inquiry may be relevant to the purpose,that the information sought is not already within the commissioner possession,and that the administrative steps required by the code have been followed.united states powell,d.the commissioner may establish a prima facie case for enforcement of a summons by a minimal showing of good faith compliance with summons requirements.united states moon,cir.such good faith can be demonstrated by the affidavit of an irs agent.id.
here,agent ensrud declaration stated that the materials requested in the summons were necessary to properly investigate norwood federal tax liabilities for the and tax years,ensrud decl,and that the irs is seeking to determine the correctness of norwood tax returns from those years.id.the declaration also noted norwood maintenance of two payment cards,id,and stated that n o department of justice referral,as defined in code section d,is in effect to norwood for the years under investigation.id.agent west declaration asserted that taxpayers having signature authority over offshore credit cards such as those issued by leadenhall may be evading the payment of federal taxes by concealing unreported taxable income or claiming improper deductions as a result of maintaining diverted funds in offshore accounts.id.in light of these affidavits,we agree with the district court that the government established a proper purpose for the summons under the powell standard.
the taxpayer can rebut a prima facie case for enforcement under powell by demonstrating that the powell requirements have not been satisfied,or by showing that enforcement of the summons would represent an abuse of the court enforcement powers.moon,at.the burden of proof on the taxpayer necessary to overcome a prima facie showing of proper purpose is a heavy one,kaiser,at,because only substantial countervailing policies or express statutory prohibition should stand in the way of effective performance of congressionally imposed responsibilities to enforce the tax code.united states euge,d accord robert united states,cir.norwood points to the irs policy of criminally prosecuting taxpayers who have used offshore accounts to conceal income,and suggests that the summons was issued in an attempt to gather information for a criminal prosecution.such a purpose for issuing the summons,norwood argues,would be an improper purpose under powell.
in contending that the policy of the irs is relevant in determining the propriety of the agency purpose in issuing a summons,norwood relies on united states lasalle national bank,d.lasalle announced a rule that bad faith under was shown when the irs purpose in issuing a summons was solely to investigate criminal activity.id.at.five years after lasalle was decided,congress amended by adding two new provisions.the first ame
