in state department of management services cason,so d dca,the first district court of appeal certified the following as a question of great public importance 
do the jurisdictional provisions of section,florida statutes,apply to bar a claim of the state that asserts an assessment is void because it was made on property immune from ad valorem taxation 
id.at.in ruling on and certifying this question,the first district vested us with jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.we agree with the first district that because of its sovereign immunity from ad valorem taxation,the state is not a taxpayer subject to the jurisdictional nonclaim provisions of section.we therefore approve the first district decision in this case.
facts and procedural history 
this case concerns property in columbia county,florida,which,according to the complaint filed in july,is owned by the state and used to operate a youthful offender prison,the lake city correctional facility.as a result of nonpayment of ad valorem taxes on the property for the and tax years,the tax collector for columbia county sold two tax certificates for the taxes due the latter of these certificates,which had a face value of,was issued to charlie ottinger,betty ottinger,gina ottinger,and valerie ottinger collectively referred to as the ottingers.
the ottingers applied for a tax deed on the property after learning of the tax deed application,the florida department of management services dms filed a complaint in circuit court seeking to enjoin the sale of the property at public auction.the complaint alleged that the state owned the property and was using it for a governmental purpose,rendering the and tax year assessments void based on the state sovereign immunity from taxation according to the complaint,the sale of the property through a tax deed would cause irreparable harm to the guards and employees of the facility,the youthful offenders housed there,and the juvenile justice system.
the ottingers moved for summary judgment,asserting that the failure to challenge the tax assessments within sixty days after the assessments were certified for collection as required by section,florida statutes,created a jurisdictional bar to the action to enjoin the tax deed sale.dms argued that section was inapplicable because the state immunity from taxation rendered any ad valorem tax assessment on the property void.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the ottingers.the court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the suit to enjoin the tax deed sale because the complaint was untimely under section.the trial court did not decide whether the property is immune from ad valorem taxation.
on appeal,the first district reversed and held that the jurisdictional bar in section does not apply to a claim by the state contesting a tax assessment based on an assertion of sovereign immunity.see cason,so d at.in reaching this conclusion,the first district determined that decisions by this court broadly applying section to actions by private property owners contesting assessments should not be extended to property owned by the state and federal governments that is immune from taxation.id.at.the first district also presumed that the legislature was aware of court decisions recognizing the state immunity from taxation when it enacted section,and found no language in the statute reflecting an intent to waive that immunity and classify the state as a taxpayer subject to the same jurisdictional requirements as private property owners.id.at.however,because of uncertainty caused by language in this court opinions construing the statute,the first district certified the issue to this court as a question of great public importance.id.
the certified question asks whether the provisions of section apply when the state is the owner of property that is immune from taxation.our review of the first district decision addressing this issue of statutory interpretation is de novo.see dep t of children families,so d.because the certified question calls upon us to construe the statute in light of the state immunity from ad valorem taxation,we first turn to the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of property taxation.
sovereign immunity from taxation 
it is well settled that the state is immune from taxation.see.dep t of revenue city of gainesville,so d,dickinson city of tallahassee,so d,we have explained that p recedent and logic both dictate that the sovereign general freedom from taxation derives from an immunity,not from an exemption.dickinson,so d at.further,we have observed that the immunity of lands from taxation is not dependent upon statutory or constitutional provisions but rests upon broad grounds of fundamentals in government.state ex rel.charlotte county alford,so d.thus,in dickinson we cited with approval orlando utilities commission milligan,so d dca,in which the fourth district court of appeal clarified the distinction between an exemption and immunity 
exemption presupposes the existence of a power to tax whereas immunity connotes the absence of that power.the state and its political subdivisions,like a county,are immune from taxation since there is no power to tax them.
so d at quoting milligan,so d at see also city of gainesville,so d at.
despite the state immunity,within constitutional limits,the legislature may provide for the taxation of lands or other property of the state.alford,so d at.however,the authority to tax the state can not be inferred.such authority must be manifested by clear and direct expression of the state intention to subject itself to the tax.dickinson,so d at.
ii.section,florida statutes 
we next examine the statute at issue in this case,which governs challenges to tax assessments.section is part of a comprehensive statutory scheme for counties to assess and collect taxes simultaneously with procedures for taxpayer challenges to tax assessments.ward brown,so d.
section provides 
the circuit courts have original jurisdiction at law of all matters relating to property taxation.venue is in the county where the property is located,except that venue shall be in leon county when the property is assessed pursuant to.
no action shall be brought to contest a tax assessment after days from the date the assessment being contested is certified for collection under,or after days from the date a decision is rendered concerning such assessment by the value adjustment board if a petition contesting the assessment had not received final action by the value adjustment board prior to extension of the roll under.
before an action to contest a tax assessment may be brought,the taxpayer shall pay to the collector not less than the amount of the tax which the taxpayer admits in good faith to be owing.the collector shall issue a receipt for the payment,and the receipt shall be filed with the complaint.notwithstanding the provisions of chapter,payment of the taxes the taxpayer admits to be due and owing and the timely filing of an action pursuant to this section shall suspend all procedures for the collection of taxes prior to final disposition of the action.
payment of a tax shall not be deemed an admission that the tax was due and shall not prejudice the right to bring a timely action as provided in subsection to challenge such tax and seek a refund.
no action to contest a tax assessment may be maintained,and any such action shall be dismissed,unless all taxes on the property assessed in years after the action is brought,which the taxpayer in good faith admits to be owing,are paid before they become delinquent.
the requirements of subsections,and are jurisdictional.no court shall have jurisdiction in such cases until after the requirements of both subsections and have been met.a court shall lose jurisdiction of a case when the taxpayer has failed to comply with the requirements of subsection.
we have classified this as a jurisdictional statute of nonclaim,which means that failure to meet its requirements deprives the circuit court of jurisdiction to hear the case.see markham neptune hollywood beach club,so d.in markham,we concluded that section applied to an action by condominium associations and developers challenging,on due process and equal protection grounds,the constitutionality of a statute governing ad valorem taxation of fee property.so d at in addition to categorizing section as a jurisdictional statute of nonclaim rather than a statute of limitations,we rejected the argument that the statute applies only to voidable assessments and not also to those that are being challenged as void.id.at 
more recently,in ward,we rejected an assertion by leaseholders of county property that because they were contesting the classification of the property rather than the tax assessment,their lawsuit opposing ad valorem taxation was governed by the general civil statute of limitations rather than section.so d at.it was in this context,an action by lessees of governmental property,that we stated that section applies regardless of the legal basis of the challenge.id.at.we explained that strict compliance with the jurisdictional nonclaim provision is necessary to ensure that the counties continue to receive revenue during taxpayer disputes 
the law in florida provides for a system for tax assessment challenges so that counties can perpetuate revenue even though taxpayers may dispute their obligations.importantly,this scheme provides counties with the ability to collect revenue during the pendency of taxpayer challenges.the first district correctly summarized the public policy considerations with respect to the filing period for tax assessment challenges when it stated w e are cognizant of the legislative intent and public policy behind the adoption of the nonclaim provision contained in section and,florida statutes,which is to ensure prompt payment of taxes due and making available revenues that are not disputed.chihocky crapo,so d,dca.in section,the legislature required taxpayers to pay not less than the amount of the tax which the taxpayer admits in good faith to be owing but provided that challenges will be dismissed in cases wherein the taxpayer fails to pay the undisputed amount of taxes before they become delinquent.stat.
as the first district noted,in both markham and ward the parties contesting the assessments were private holders of the property in dispute.cason,so d at.thus,subject to their challenges to the assessments,the condominium associations and developers in markham and the lessees in ward were clearly taxable entities.the first district concluded that this court would not have intended to apply the holdings in markham and ward to actions by the state contesting an ad valorem assessment.id.
if the procedural requirements of section are construed to apply to an action brought by the state to challenge an assessment on grounds that property it owns is immune from ad valorem taxation,the immunity would be nullified by the state failure to challenge the assessment within sixty days after it is certified for collection.under those circumstances,the state would have no choice but to pay the amount of ad valorem taxes determined to be due by april of the year following the assessment purchase or redeem any tax certificates that are issued for the delinquent taxes or risk losing its property at a tax deed sale indeed,as judge ervin observed in the majority opinion below,if section applies to all actions challenging tax assessments without exception,even the government of the united states would be barred from contesting a patently illegal and void assessment on property owned by it and situated in this state by reason of its failure to challenge an assessment within the required days.cason,so d at.
iii.applicability of to challenges by the state 
we now consider the effect of sovereign immunity on the application of section to actions filed by the state.the crucial inquiry is whether the language of section clearly and unambiguously demonstrates legislative intent to apply this section to challenges by the state on property.although legislative intent is the polestar of statutory interpretation,such intent is derived primarily from the language of the statute.see state,so d.we conclude that no such clear and direct expression is manifested from the language of this statute.dickinson,so d at.
section provides that n o action shall be brought beyond the period.it does not identify specific entities or persons to whom this requirement applies.thus,we look to the other provisions of section to determine whether the state is subject to the requirements of subsection.see golf channel jenkins,so d,r elated statutory provisions should be read together to determine legislative intent forsythe longboat key beach erosion control,so d,it is axiomatic that all parts of a statute must be read together in order to achieve a consistent whole.
section,which provides that all the requirements of subsections,and are jurisdictional,refers to the taxpayer.both subsections and also refer to actions the taxpayer must take to contest an assessment.subsection requires the taxpayer to pay to the tax collector the amount that he or she admits in good faith to be owing for the tax year in which the assessment is levied,while subsection provides that the taxpayer can not maintain a legal challenge to an assessment unless her or she pays taxes admittedly owed for subsequent tax years.we conclude that the legislature intended subsection,like subsections,and,to apply to taxpayers.ward,so d at stating that the time requirement in section applies broadly to taxpayers actions challenging the assessment of taxes against their property regardless of the legal basis of the challenge emphasis supplied.
taxpayer is not defined in section or elsewhere in chapter.we therefore turn to a standard dictionary and to a related statute to derive the common,ordinary meaning of the term.see nehme smithkline beecham clinical,so d,stating that where the legislature has not defined a term,its plain and ordinary meaning can be taken from a dictionary state mitro,so d,in the absence of a statutory definition,resort may be had to case law or related statutory provisions which define the term,and where a statute does not specifically define words of common usage,such words are construed in their plain and ordinary sense.chapter supplies a definition of taxpayer for purposes of ad valorem taxation that could encompass the state as a property owner,because taxpayer status is tied to assessments and all property,including state property,must be assessed.see.stat.taxpayer means the person or other legal entity in whose name property is assessed,a b.stat.requiring all florida property,including property owned by the state,to be assessed.the dictionary defines taxpayer as one that pays or is liable for a tax.collegiate dictionary ed.although useful,neither of these definitions is controlling,because in construing statutory language we must give consideration not only to the literal and usual meaning of the words,but also to their meaning and effect on the objectives and purpose of the statute enactment.florida neurological injury compensation ass florida div.of administrative hearings,so d.
thus,the term taxpayer as used in section should be construed in a manner consistent with the statute purpose,which is to ensure a reliable and predictable method for counties to collect revenue while also providing for taxpayer challenges to tax assessments.see ward,so d at.subsection of the statute serves this purpose by creating a relatively brief window in which legal challenges may be brought.subsections and serve the statute purpose by ensuring that the disputed assessment does not disrupt the flow of taxes that are not in dispute.see id.under these provisions,a taxpayer is not merely the entity in whose name the property is assessed,but one whom the county has the power to tax subject to disputes about individual assessments.in short,a taxpayer under section is a taxable entity.this definition excludes the state and its political subdivisions,which are immune from taxation since there is no power to tax them.dickinson,so d at.accordingly,where the state files suit challenging ad valorem taxation on grounds of sovereign immunity,the state assertion that it is not a taxable entity takes it outside the category o
