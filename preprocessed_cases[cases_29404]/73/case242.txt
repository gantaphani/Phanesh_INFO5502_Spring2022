defendants glenn ripa and benedetto romano appeal from a decision of the united states district court for the western district of new york john curtin,judge granting summary judgment to the united states in an interpleader action brought by the united states to determine rights among the parties to a fund in the amount of.the fund comprises in united states currency that the united states customs service seized from romano on november,when romano attempted to carry it across the border into canada without completing the required currency reporting form,plus interest since paid by the government thereon.pursuant to the currency reporting statute,the united states sought civil forfeiture of the sum.the suit was suspended while the government brought an unsuccessful criminal prosecution against romano for tax evasion.finally,in,some fifteen years after the seizure,romano prevailed against the government in the civil forfeiture suit.because of several tax liens against romano totaling over million,including a lien on the taxes assessed on the currency seized in,the district court ordered the plus interest deposited with the clerk of the district court.the court permitted the government to bring a suit in the nature of an interpleader to effect the proper distribution of the fund.
the basic principle governing cases assessing the priority of federal tax liens is first in time,first in right.the government,which created a lien on the sum on the same day it was seized in,therefore asserts a right to first priority in the distribution of the money.because the interest and penalties on the taxes owed to the government by romano now exceed the total amount in the fund,the government asserts a claim to the entire fund.ripa,romano attorney,asserts a contrary claim to approximately of the fund,as a payment for his representation of romano in the forfeiture proceeding.ripa contends that his attorney lien has superpriority over the government tax lien under a provision of the internal revenue code the code or tax code that allows certain attorneys liens to take priority over prior government liens.see b.in response,the government argues that section b does not apply here because the provision contains an exception to attorney lien superpriority in cases involving a judgment of a claim or of a cause of action against the united states.id.because we agree with the government that that exception applies here,we conclude that section b is inapplicable.ripa therefore has no basis for asserting priority over the prior government tax lien.
because the government claim far exceeds the amount deposited by the government in the interpleader action,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the government and order disbursement of the fund to the government pursuant thereto.romano argues that we should employ equitable principles to deny the government interest and penalties on the taxes assessed against him in.the code provides avenues for the abatement of interest and penalties,some of which may remain open to romano.but if there is a road to relief for romano,it lies through the internal revenue service irs and the tax court in the first instance,not through article iii courts such as the district court and this court of appeals.
the defendants characterize their travails as kafkaesque.appellants br.at.our rehearsal of the facts in some detail below tends to support that view.the united states customs service wrongfully seized a large sum of money from romano,which he alleges made it impossible for him to pay taxes he owed the irs on those funds.although the government paid interest on the seized money,it did so at a rate so low in comparison to the penalties and interest the irs was charging him on the unpaid taxes that,ultimately,the amount romano owed the government in taxes and interest on the fund far exceeded the amount in the fund.meanwhile,the civil proceedings over title to the seized funds were delayed by related criminal prosecutions,which also eventually proved meritless.when romano finally prevailed in the civil suit over the seized currency,his money had been eaten up by taxes and penalties on it that,he says,he could not have paid because the government had wrongfully seized his money.we conclude,nonetheless,that romano has not presented us,as an article iii court,with a legal basis upon which to deliver him from these circumstances.we are no more able to relieve romano of the absurdity of his situation than we are able to relieve kafka joseph k of the absurdity of his.see franz kafka,the trial willa edwin muir,alfred knopf,ed.
background 
the parties have stipulated to the facts as set forth in two prior district court opinions,united states in united states currency.i,and united states in united states currency,d ii,for the purposes of this appeal.
the seizure 
united states law does not prohibit the transportation of united states funds abroad.it does require that transportation of funds above a threshold amount be reported to the government for informational purposes.
on november,benedetto romano drove from buffalo,new york,across the peace bridge into ontario,canada.the trunk of his car contained,the proceeds of wildly successful,albeit illegal,gambling activities.ii,d at,romano was questioned by a canadian customs official at the primary customs inspection site.then,for reasons that were not established at trial,romano was referred to a secondary inspection site.i.at.the second canadian customs official asked romano to open his trunk,which romano did.the official found bags containing thousands of dollars in united states currency.ii,d at.the official asked romano if he had declared this money before leaving the united states,and romano acknowledged that he had not.id.at.the official then called united states customs officials to inform them of the situation and ordered romano to return to the united states.id.at.
after recrossing the bridge,romano was stopped and questioned by a united states customs official.id.romano initially said he was carrying to,but eventually admitted to having over in cash.id.he then completed a currency reporting form,form,and a baggage declaration form,form,printed in italian,on which he acknowledged carrying more than minimum amount he was required to report.id.a records check indicated that romano had not completed a currency reporting form prior to leaving the united states,as required by a.ii,d at customs agents therefore seized romano in currency pursuant to b,which authorized the forfeiture of any monetary instrument transported without the filing of a currency report 
the tax lien on the seized currency 
later that day,the irs made a termination assessment against romano for in income tax,based upon the in cash that he had been carrying.see united states romano,cir.
a termination assessment under informs the person notified that his or her tax year is terminated as of a certain date and calculates the income tax due.the resulting tax liability becomes due immediately,and the irs files a tax lien to secure payment of the tax debt.the irs uses a termination assessment when it discovers that a person possesses an inappropriate amount of cash presumed to be taxable income from a previously undisclosed source and it fears that the collection of taxes may be thwarted if the person puts the cash or herself beyond the government reach.the filing of a termination assessment does not relieve the taxpayer of her obligation to prepare,sign,and file a true and correct income tax return for that year.
id.at because the tax liability determined in a termination assessment is due immediately,a,the irs promptly sent a notice of levy to the customs service and filed a notice of a federal tax lien with the erie county clerk in buffalo.romano never filed a federal tax return for.see united states new york state dep t of taxation and finance,d,nysdtf.
in november,the united states filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york seeking to reduce the termination assessment to judgment.on december,the district court granted summary judgment to the united states in the amount of plus statutory interest.united states romano,no.we affirmed,united states romano,cir table,and the supreme court denied certiorari,romano united states,d.
the civil forfeiture action 
meanwhile,in,the united states brought a civil action against romano in the united states district court for the western district of new scene of the seizure and the tax forfeiture of the seized currency pursuant to a and b.on september,the district court denied the government petition for forfeiture,holding that civil forfeiture under section requires a defendant to have actual knowledge of the currency reporting requirements,and that insufficient evidence supported the conclusion that romano had such knowledge.i.at.on appeal,we disagreed,holding that actual knowledge of the reporting requirements is not a necessary condition for civil forfeiture,but that the due process clause of the fifth amendment requires that a claimant have at least constructive knowledge of the requirements.united states in united states currency,cir.we remanded the case for a determination of whether romano had such constructive knowledge.id.at.
before the district court could rule on the remand,the proceedings were interrupted by a criminal action brought by the government against romano for tax evasion.during the extended pendency of the criminal prosecution,in which romano was convicted but the conviction was overturned on appeal,romano,at,the district court granted a stay of the civil proceedings because romano refused to answer pertinent questions during his deposition,citing his fifth amendment right to avoid,ii,d at.
on may,after the criminal proceedings had concluded,the district court held a bench trial on the issue that we had remanded some ten years previously whether romano had constructive knowledge of the currency reporting requirements back in,when he transported the currency across the border.id.at.after further briefing,the court concluded that romano had no such knowledge.id.at the district court therefore ordered judgment in favor of romano.
the interpleader action 
in the civil forfeiture action,the district court granted judgment in favor of romano,but did not award the disputed money to him.instead,on january,the court issued an order allowing an interpleader action so that the interested parties could litigate their rights to the amount of the seized currency plus interest paid on it by the.nysdtf,d at.the court directed that the money be deposited with the clerk of court of the united states district court for the western district of new york.id.at.
the irs,the new york state department of taxation and glenn ripa,romano attorney,all asserted claims to the fund.the irs asserted a claim to the fund based on its tax lien,originally for in taxes,and valued in at over because of interest and penalties.id.at.ripa appeared pro se before the district court in the interpleader action to assert a right to payment for his legal services id.ripa alleged that he has a statutory attorney lien with superpriority status over the federal tax lien pursuant to b.ripa contention is that,based on his fee arrangement with romano,he is entitled to of the.ripa thus claims of the of the fund less,the amount of a retainer already paid by romano.before the district court,ripa and romano,and the irs,filed for summary judgment.nysdtf,d at.the state did not oppose ripa and romano motion,acknowledging that the state claim is subordinate to the federal claim.id.
the district court granted the united states motion for summary judgment on the basis of the priority of its tax lien.id.at.it rejected ripa claim under b,which provides for superpriority for attorneys liens except in cases involving a judgment of a claim or of a cause of action against the united states.the court reasoned that the judgment for romano in the forfeiture action was a judgment of a claim against the government within the meaning of b,and thus that ripa claim was not entitled to superpriority status.nysdtf,d at.the district court also rejected romano equitable arguments for abatement of interest and penalties on his unpaid taxes.id.at.
romano and ripa appeal the state of new york does not.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.marvel characters,simon,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c feifer prudential ins.of,cir.
ii.the priority of the liens 
federal law determines the relative priority of a federal tax lien.united states equitable life assurance soc y of the united states,d united states mccombs,cir.federal law follows the common law rule that a lien first in time is the first in right.united states city of new britain.internal quotation marks omitted see also mccombs,at.it is undisputed that the irs notice of federal tax lien,filed november,was the first lien filed with respect to the fund at issue in this litigation.the irs lien therefore has priority under the rule.unless the defendants can identify an applicable exception or overriding principle,then,the fund must be released to the government.
ripa asserts that his attorney lien has priority over the federal tax lien under a statutory exception to the rule the code provision for superpriority of some attorneys liens,b section b was established by the federal tax lien act of,the first comprehensive revision and modernization of the provisions of the internal revenue laws concerned with the relationship of federal tax liens to the interests of other creditors,at.the act amendments to the code created superpriority for various creditors,such as mechanics,on the theory that the work of these creditors was likely to add to the value of the property to the ultimate benefit of the government.id.at.similarly,the act added a provision establishing superpriority for attorneys liens under certain circumstances.b.specifically,section b provides that an existing federal tax lien will not be valid 
w ith respect to a judgment or other amount in settlement of a claim or of a cause of action,as against an attorney who,under local law,holds a lien upon or a contract enforceable against such judgment or amount,to the extent of his reasonable compensation for obtaining such judgment or procuring such settlement 
id.ripa argues that under this provision he is entitled to superpriority for his reasonable fees accrued during his successful defense of romano in the forfeiture action.
but section b contains an exception to the superpriority of attorneys liens 
t his paragraph shall not apply to any judgment or amount in settlement of a claim or of a cause of action against the united states to the extent that the united states offsets such judgment or amount against any liability of the taxpayer to the united states.
id.the question,then,is whether the forfeiture suit resulted in a judgment of a claim or of a cause of action against the united states within the meaning of section b.ripa argues that,because a federal district court has determined that the money was wrongfully seized from romano,and the money was at all times romano,never belonged to the united states,and the judgment was therefore not against the united states.
ripa argument finds support in a decision by the united states district court for the district of massachusetts,united states murray.the murray court reasoned that a successful defense against a currency forfeiture action by the united states does not result in a judgment against the united states within the meaning of section b because t he money belonged to the defendant all along.id.at.the return of the money thus does not require the united states to remove any money from its coffers.id.two other district courts in addition to the district court in this action,however,have considered the question and held otherwise.see united states in united states currency,brooks united states.
statutory analysis begins with the plain meaning of the statute.natural resources defense council,muszynski,cir.if the text of a statute is ambiguous,then we must construct an interpretation consistent with the primary purpose of the statute as a whole.connecticut ex rel.blumenthal dep t of interior,cir,cert.denied,d.
the plain language of section b does not supply a clear answer to the question before us.as noted above,we understand the question to be whether a judgment for the defendant in a forfeiture suit brought by the government is a judgment of a claim or of a cause of action against the united states.this language contains several ambiguities.the phrase against the united states could modify judgment,claim,cause of action,or some combination of the three,while each of the terms has more than one possible meaning.the district court interpreted against the united states to modify judgment asking whether the return of the seized funds constitute s a judgment against the united states,nysdtf,d at answered the question in the affirmative.though we disagree with the district court construction of the statutory language,we are unable to resolve the ambiguity in the language,and we therefore interpret the statute in accordance with its purpose.we conclude that the statute does not give superpriority to the attorney lien ripa asserts.
as noted,the district court formulation of section b implies that the prepositional phrase against the united states modifies judgment.nysdtf,d at.but the phrase against the united states must modify claim or cause of action because the words judgment and amount are established as equivalents in the later phrase offsets such judgment or amount.thus,judgment is opposed to amount in settlement,and the entire phrase might be aptly punctuated as follows this paragraph shall not apply to any judgment or amount in settlement of a claim or of a cause of action against the united states.the key question here is therefore properly framed as whether the suit is one involving an award resulting from a claim or cause of action against the united states.
even under our reframing of the provision,the plain language remains ambiguous.on the one hand,a judgment of a claim or of a cause of action against the united states could encompass the result in a forfeiture suit,such as romano,in which the taxpayer and the government were hostile parties in a lawsuit styled as a proceeding against the money itself.on the other hand,the scope of a judgment of a claim or of a cause of action against the united states might be limited to those suits in which a taxpayer brings an action against the united states as the defendant to assert a claim to property owned by the united states.these two perhaps possible because the terms claim,cause of action,and against all have multiple meanings.for example,claim and cause of action have overlapping meanings,including a right to something and a demand or suit filed in pursuit of something moreover,if we read against as merely hostile or adverse,then the phrase against the united states encompasses any action in which the united states is an adverse party but we could also read against the united states to connote an active challenge to governmental action or property rather than an attempt,as here,simply to reacquire one own property,by defending against a claim to that property asserted by the government.because the plain language of the provision is thus ambiguous,we turn to its purpose to try to give the appropriate meaning to its words.
in contrast to its plain language,the purpose of section b seems clear.as the district court cogently observed 
t he primary purpose of the statute was to collect taxes,not bestow benefits on attorneys.montavon united states,quoting hill,christopher,phillips,united states postal service.congress intended b to encourage attorneys to bring suits and obtain judgments that would put their clients in a position to be better able to pay their tax liabilities.in re mcgaughey,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.consequently,the attorney receives no protective consideration for his efforts on behalf of a client with a tax liability if the funds to satisfy that liability are going to come from a judgment against the government.hill,christopher.at.
nysdtf,d at.when a lawyer represents a taxpayer against a party other than the government,the lawyer is working to reach a result that will,if successful,enlarge the amount of funds available to the government to satisfy its tax claim.the lawyer is then probably acting in the government best interests.if the lawyer can not be paid out of the amount collected,however,he or she is unlikely to pursue the claim in the first place and the government is,potentially,that much the poorer.if the lawyer represents a taxpayer whose interests are adverse to the government,however,the funds available to the government will not be enhanced by the lawyer services.
in light of the purpose of section b,then,we see no reason to read a judgment of a claim or of a cause of action against the united states to exclude the monetary award in the forfeiture suit,in which romano and the united states had adverse claims to the disputed fund.thus,the exception to superpriority of attorneys liens in judgments of claims against the united states applies to ripa lien for his fees incurred when defending romano claim to his money in the forfeiture action 
ripa also argues that the exception to section b does not apply here because the government has no right to offset in this case.as the supreme court has explained,the right to offset,or,is the right to strike a balance between the debts and credits of the government.united states munsey trust.ripa argues that the government can not offset in this case because the common law of offset requires mutuality between the countervailing claims,citing lines bank of america national trust savings association,for the proposition that m utuality is not present when the creditor has no debt to against the debtor except the liability for the wrongful conversion,id.at.ripa contends that,because the government seizure of his money was wrongful,the government has no right to offset,and section b does not apply.but ripa has cited no cases that apply the idea of mutuality to offsets between a private party and the government,rather than between two private parties.and we have held that the united states has the right to offset a fine and interest thereupon against an order to return seized currency.ikelionwu united states,cir.reading section b in light of the statute purpose of maximizing federal revenue,we therefore see no reason to conclude that congress intended to circumscribe the government ability to offset based on equitable principles applied to private creditors under common law 
we conclude that the district court correctly held that ripa can assert no priority on behalf of his attorney lien over the federal tax liens under section b.
iii.romano arguments for abatement of interest and penalties 
romano does not challenge his liability for unpaid taxes.he questions only the interest and penalties assessed against him.he argues for relief on equitable grounds and also on the basis of several provisions of the code.
romano equitable argument is that the government receives an unjust windfall from its illegal seizure if he has to pay interest and penalties on the money that was seized.he argues that it is unfair for the government to charge a higher rate of interest on unpaid taxes than it pays him on the seized funds.romano also contends,without supporting evidence,that the money seized by customs was the only money with which he could have paid the taxes assessed against him.it is therefore unfair,he argues,for one branch of the government to charge him interest and penalties on taxes that another branch of the government deprived him of the ability to pay.
but congress has not given us general equitable powers to grant relief from whatever unfairness may be prescribed by the tax code or other federal statutes the different rates of interest applied to money held by the government and money owed to the government are set by statute,and we are not at liberty to change them.we also have no power to grant relief by analogy to inapplicable provisions of the code.for example,romano seeks relief based on provisions of the code allowi
