this case arises out of an investigation of adel habib iskander defendant or iskander.the united states government alleges he systematically skimmed cash receipts and corporate checks received by two hotels he owned and operated,while simultaneously paying no federal corporate or individual income tax.iskander was indicted,and after a three week trial,a jury found him guilty of three counts of tax evasion and one count of structuring financial transactions to evade reporting.the district court subsequently sentenced iskander to a term of imprisonment of months and ordered him to pay a fine.on appeal,iskander challenges the district court evidentiary rulings,the sufficiency of the evidence,and his sentence.we find,after careful review,no reversible error in the district court evidentiary rulings,and that the evidence in this case was sufficient to support the convictions.however,in following united states hughes,cir,our recently published opinion giving guidance to the application of united states booker,d,we find plain error in iskander sentencing,exercise our discretion to notice the error,vacate the sentence,and remand to the district court for resentencing.thus,we affirm in part,vacate,and remand in part.
defendant was originally charged in a indictment with conspiracy,tax evasion,and structuring currency transactions,in violation of,and a,respectively.a superseding indictment was filed one month before trial,charging defendant and his wife,cynthia lafon iskander,with one count of conspiracy to structure transactions so as to evade reporting requirements in violation of a,and eleven counts of structuring financial transactions to evade reporting requirements in violation of a.the superseding indictment also charged iskander individually with three counts of tax evasion in violation of.all the foregoing conduct allegedly occurred in,and.
during the relevant time period,iskander controlled two corporations,ocean properties,and fenwick properties,ocean properties and fenwick properties,each of which operated a hotel.for most times relevant to the indictment iskander was the sole shareholder of both companies.at trial the government alleged that between and defendant deposited approximately in currency into personal accounts under his control for his benefit and the benefit of his family.the government provided evidence that defendant and his wife at various times deposited approximately worth of corporate checks into personal investment accounts they held with merrill lynch and rowe price.in furtherance of the scheme,the government demonstrated,through bank records,that iskander systematically structured cash deposits to banks to be under to avoid the respective financial institutions federal currency transaction reporting requirements.during this time,defendant reported no taxable income for either of the corporations,or for himself,zero tax was paid to the federal government.
the government alleged that iskander tax evasion scheme involved skimming cash and credit card proceeds from both hotel properties and the gross receipts actually earned by the two him to conceal the diversion of funds.on his corporate tax returns,defendant claimed that the two hotels were losing money.in fact,he personally wrote off alleged loans he made to one of the hotels based on an assertion that the investment represented a bad,uncollectible debt.at trial,the government presented evidence showing that the gross receipts of the hotels exceeded the amounts stated on defendant corporate tax returns by hundreds of thousands of,showing that the hotels were likely profitable and capable of repaying the alleged loans.
the government also provided evidence that iskander attempted to establish an explanation for the skimming and for hiding his tax evasion scheme,by placing shareholder loan balances on the corporate tax returns.doing that allowed him to characterize the skimmed receipts as repayments of loans.according to the government,these stated loan balances were patently false and the diverted funds were taxable income.
the government contended that iskander was trained in business and accounting in his native egypt and taught business classes in egypt before emigrating to the united states.the government called one of iskander former hotel desk clerks,sam soliman soliman,who testified that iskander had told him that he had been trained as an accountant.iskander accountant,john vardavas vardavas,also testified that defendant rescinded a statement he had previously made to vardavas averring that defendant had been a cpa in egypt.the government also presented documentary evidence,in the form of a dun bradstreet report and an affidavit,listing defendant employment history as an accountant and as a controller.the report was admitted over defendant hearsay objections.in rebuttal,defendant put forth testimony from vardavas,who stated that defendant record keeping skills were poor and that the records seized upon execution of the search warrant were incomplete and disorganized.
after a three week trial,a jury found iskander guilty of three counts of tax evasion and one count of structuring financial transactions to evade reporting.iskander was acquitted iskander timely filed this appeal.
we review the district court decision as to admissibility of evidence for abuse of discretion,and we will not find an abuse unless a decision was arbitrary and irrational.united states weaver,cir discussing abuse of discretion standard in context of decisions as to admissibility of evidence.
to prevail on a sufficiency of the evidence claim,iskander must show that when evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the government,see united states stewart,cir,no rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt,that he acted willfully,see jackson virginia,d.
in light of the new sentencing scheme announced in booker,we state in hughes that we will review sixth amendment sentencing challenges,raised for the first time on appeal,under plain error analysis.at.
iskander challenges two evidentiary rulings made by the district court and the sufficiency of the evidence.first,he argues that the district court erred in excluding defendant evidence supporting his defense specifically by refusing to allow defendant expert to testify about unclaimed depreciation deductions he alleges were available to his hotels defendant asserts that such testimony would have rebutted both the government tax witness,who testified that the deductions taken on defendant personal tax returns were improper and therefore taxable income,as well as the government evidence that the appellant was a sophisticated accountant,and therefore willfully violated and a.second,iskander argues that the district court erred by admitting a dun bradstreet report that contained information regarding the defendant educational background and employment history third,defendant 
contends that the government evidence was insufficient to support the three tax evasion convictions.
in addition,iskander makes two related challenges to his sentence.first,he alleges that the district court did not make the required factual findings necessary to support the fine imposed at sentencing.second,defendant asserts that under blakely washington,d and booker,the district court sentence violated his right to a jury trial insofar as it rested on factual findings made by the judge at the sentencing hearing.we address each of defendant arguments in turn.
defendant contends that the district court abused its discretion in excluding evidence that supported his defense.in an effort to rebut the government expert,defendant retained an accounting expert,ivan mehler mehler.the defense proffered,fourteen days into trial,that mehler testimony would show that iskander had failed to use the depreciation schedules to which he was entitled and as a result,utilizing any accounting or reconstruction method the government preferred,no tax was owed.appellant br.at.according to defendant,mehler testimony would have shown that contrary to the government assertions,defendant was not cheating the irs he was not a sophisticated accountant,and that any inaccuracies in his tax returns had worked to his disadvantage more so than to the irs.id.at.additionally,defendant contends that mehler would have testified and used summaries of the depreciation schedules to show that the government overstated the income from the corporations and would have demonstrated that repayments of the principal on loans or return of capital contributions are not,as the government theory alleged,taxable income that must be reported on a tax return.id.
the government objected to mehler summaries,on grounds of hearsay,relevance,and timeliness,and moved to exclude five of them.the summaries were based on specific valuations of furnishings and other property at the hotel.the district court found that portions of the defendant expert testimony relating to the specific summaries and details regarding the depreciation schedules were irrelevant and that the probative value of the challenged evidence was therefore by its potential to cause jury confusion specifically,the court stated 
this whole question of depreciation it seems to me truly is a red herring in this case.
i fail to see the connection between depreciation that was not taken on the corporate tax returns and the failure of the defendant,if it was a failure,to declare on the tax returns that were filed income taken from the corporations.
thus,the district court excluded the depreciation schedules,summaries,and mehler testimony regarding them.
trial courts have considerable discretion to determine whether to admit expert testimony.see hamling united states,d see also united states jones,cir a reviewing court should not disturb a trial court determination to admit evidence unless the trial court has acted arbitrarily or irrationally.quotation and citation omitted.rule states that 
although relevant,evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury,or by considerations of undue delay,waste of time,or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.
the excluded portion of mehler testimony relating to the detailed summaries and depreciation schedules may have shown that iskander corporations were entitled to take additional corporate paper deductions.such a showing might have been relevant if the defendant was charged with corporate tax evasion.however,the grand jury charged iskander with evading personal income tax by skimming receipts from his businesses and then converting those receipts to his own use without reporting any income on his personal tax returns.the government referred to the corporate returns to prove that iskander the gross receipts from his hotels,because that fact supports their skimming theory and relates to their argument that the deductions,taken on his personal tax returns,were wilfully false.the availability of the depreciation deductions does not affect the gross receipts of the corporations.neither does the existence of those deductions undermine the government theory.fenwick properties was profitable based on the actual gross receipts presented by the government to the jury.therefore,the government used the corporate tax returns solely to show the defendant claimed deduction on his personal tax return was wilfully false,because he falsely asserted,as demonstrated on his corporate tax returns,that fenwick properties was losing money,a necessary predicate to claiming the deduction.consequently,the presentation of detailed valuation summaries and depreciation schedules for the corporations was irrelevant and potentially confusing to the jury.
importantly,the court exclusion of parts of mehler testimony did not impact defendant ability to argue that his failure to claim all depreciation deductions available to the corporations showed his lack of sophistication in tax and financial matters.during the cross examination of vardavas,defense counsel had already elicited testimony that vardavas believed that iskander had understated the corporate depreciation those businesses were entitled to take.furthermore,mehler was allowed to testify to the general fact that,in his opinion,iskander had not taken all the depreciation to which the hotels were entitled.
the district court also ruled that iskander failed to present to the government,in a timely fashion,the name of the expert and the evidence on which the expert planned to rely.the depreciation deduction testimony was based in significant part on mehler expert opinion concerning property valuations and depreciations.the government requested notice of the defendant intent to offer expert opinion evidence at trial and iskander failed to provide timely notice of his intent to introduce expert testimony on the matters of property valuations and depreciations or the basis of his expert opinions rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure required iskander to do both.the rule provides that 
c expert witnesses.the defendant must,at the government request,give to the government a written summary of any testimony that the defendant intends to use under rules,or of the federal rules of evidence as evidence at trial,if 
i the defendant requests disclosure under subdivision a g and the government complies or 
ii the defendant has given notice under rule b of an intent to present expert testimony on the defendant mental condition.
this summary must describe the witness opinions,the bases and reasons for those opinions,and the witness qualifications 
iskander does not deny that he failed to fully comply with the rules concerning expert discovery.instead he argues that within the context of the government late superseding indictment,timeliness should not be an issue for the government and that the government did not need time to prepare for mehler testimony.the district court did not agree based on an abuse of discretion standard of review and the facts related above,we can not find that the court decision to exclude a portion of defendant expert witness testimony was arbitrary and irrational.see.d c.failure to comply.if a party fails to comply with this rule,the court may prohibit that party from introducing the undisclosed evidence or enter any other order that is just under the circumstances.
next,iskander argues that the district court ruling,admitting a dun bradstreet report as a business record,was error.the report supported the government assertion that iskander educational background in egypt and work experience involved accounting.defendant avers that the dunn sic bradstreet affidavit contains uncorroborated,hearsay information from an unknown source.appellant br.at.defendant contends that the affidavit was inadmissable hearsay,which should have been excluded,because it was used as a basis to show an essential element of the offenses an accused willful intent to commit a tax evasion offense or structuring.id.at.
during trial,iskander made a confrontation clause type objection,asserting that the dun bradstreet report was improperly admitted because he did not have the opportunity for.the supreme court held in crawford washington,w here testimonial statements are at issue,the only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is the one the constitution actually prescribes confrontation,d.the court in crawford divided statements into two categories,those that are testimonial in nature and those that are not,asserting that testimonial hearsay is the primary,if not the only,object of the confrontation clause.see id.at.it then held that the testimonial statement of a person who does not appear as a witness at the trial may not be admitted against the accused to prove the truth of the statement unless the declarant is unavailable to appear as a witness and the accused had a prior opportunity for.id.
we find that we need not reach the issues of whether the dun bradstreet report qualifies as a business record or whether the admission of the report violates the confrontation clause,as set out in crawford,because the dun bradstreet report was merely cumulative of other testimony establishing that iskander had accounting and business experience.we articulated in cooper taylor,cir,the standa
