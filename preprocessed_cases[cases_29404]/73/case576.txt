in the underlying action,the scripps company and subsidiaries scripps seeks to recover interest payments from united states of america the government based on scripps overpayment of tax.on appeal,the government has not challenged the district court determination that scripps is entitled to statutory interest because the million scripps tendered to the internal revenue service irs constituted a payment of tax rather than a cash bond.instead,the government has asserted only that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over scripps suit and that the action should be transferred to the court of federal claims.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that the district court properly exercised subject matter jurisdiction over this suit,and thus we affirm.
factual and procedural history 
this case pertains to a federal income tax return filed by scripps almost two decades ago.in,scripps calculated its liability using a accounting system.two years later,in,scripps entered into an agreement with the irs providing that scripps would convert to an accrual accounting method and that it would recalculate its tax liability for tax years forward.
in,scripps decided to make a payment on its adjusted tax liability for tax years and so that interest would stop accruing on the outstanding liability,and so that scripps could take a deduction on its tax return for the portion of the payment allocated to interest.in the fall of,scripps corporate tax director,michael carroll carroll,asked sidney saewitz agent saewitz,an irs agent assigned to audit scripps,to calculate the amount of tax and interest scripps owed for tax years and.agent saewitz responded that the irs would be unable to provide such information by the end of the tax year.still wishing to make a tax payment in tax year,jerome hackman hackman,a member of scripps corporate tax department,attempted to calculate the amount owed by scripps for tax years and,arriving at a figure of million in additional tax and interest owed.not wanting to remit a payment in excess of its actual liability,scripps reduced its planned payment to million.on december,scripps delivered a million check to the irs care of agent saewitz.scripps included with the check a cover letter addressed to agent saewitz stating that

please have the duplicate copy of this letter and given to hackman as our evidence of the internal revenue service receipt of this payment.
joint appendix at.the letter also explained that million should be allocated to each tax year,million to each tax year adjusted tax liability and million to interest accrued on each tax year adjustment.
agent saewitz completed a form payment posting voucher voucher in connection with the payment.in doing so,agent saewitz checked a box indicating that the payment was a c ash bond.at voucher.hackman alerted agent saewitz to the fact that the cash bond box had been checked on the voucher,despite scripps desire to have the million treated as a payment of tax and interest.agent saewitz replied that he had been informed that the cash bond box had to be checked in order for the transaction to be processed,and he assured hackman that the payment would be treated as a payment of tax and interest.
in,the irs determined that,even after recalculating scripps tax liability using an accrual accounting method,scripps did not owe any additional tax for due to a large net operating loss.scripps then sought return of the million it had paid in that was attributable to the tax year,but the irs informed scripps that no refund could be made until the audit was closed because the million was payment of tax,not a cash bond.agent saewitz,however,assured carroll that the refund would include interest on the million tax overpayment.
at some point between october and april,during the audit of tax year,agent saewitz informed scripps that the million payment would be treated as a cash bond,that scripps could not deduct the interest portion of the million on its tax return,and that scripps would not receive any interest on the overpayment.in september,the irs refunded to scripps million for its overpayment in tax year.when the irs closed its audit of the tax year in january,the irs permitted scripps to deduct the million interest portion of the million payment on its return,despite its earlier indications that the interest deduction would be disallowed.scripps then filed a claim with the irs in september on the basis that it was entitled to interest on the million paid to the irs for tax year because it constituted an overpayment of tax.
the irs denied the claim in november,and scripps filed suit in the district court for the southern district of ohio in june.the government moved for dismissal of scripps action on the basis that a did not waive the government sovereign immunity with respect to taxpayer claims for interest on overpayments when the overpaid tax had already been refunded to the taxpayer via administrative,means.the district court denied the government motion to dismiss,concluding that statutory interest,which represents the time value of the alleged erroneously collected funds,is an integral and inseparable part of the original overpayment,at.op.denying def.mot.to dismiss at,and thus falls within a waiver of sovereign immunity for suits seeking recovery of an tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected.a.the parties subsequently filed for summary judgment,and the district court ruled that the million should be characterized as an overpayment of tax for which scripps was entitled to receive statutory interest,as opposed to a cash bond or deposit upon which the government would not be required to pay interest.the district court entered judgment for scripps in the amount of,the stipulated amount of statutory interest due.the government now appeals the district court entry of judgment in favor of scripps,contending that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action and that the action should be transferred to the court of federal claims.
ii.analysis 
that district courts have subject matter jurisdiction over taxpayer suits for interest on tax overpayments at first blush appears so obvious that many courts have found no need to dwell on the question at any great length.see doolin united states,such consent to suit by the federal government is found,obviously,when congress confers jurisdiction over a particular matter upon the district courts.in this regard,and without undue further elaboration,the court agrees that a federal district court having subject matter jurisdiction over taxpayer refund suits by virtue of a also has subject matter jurisdiction over disputes,perhaps ancillary particularly where the underlying liability has been established and discharged,regarding the interest required by congress to be paid on tax overpayments under a and b,rev on other grounds,cir phico group,united states.making no reference to subject matter jurisdiction motors united states,stating without further elaboration that t his court has jurisdiction under a citadel,united states.ruling on for summary judgment without stating basis for exercising jurisdiction draper united states,ustc p,dist.lexis,at,summarily concluding that t he court has jurisdiction of this controversy and of the plaintiffs hereto based on a.
this ease in finding subject matter jurisdiction likely results from the fact that congress has made quite clear that,as a general matter,taxpayers who are adjudged to have paid too much in taxes should be able to sue the federal government and recover interest as compensation for the lost of such overpayments.see a interest shall be allowed and paid upon any overpayment in respect of any internal revenue tax at the overpayment rate established under section.in any judgment of any court rendered whether against the united states,a collector or deputy collector of internal revenue,a former collector or deputy collector,or the personal representative in case of death for any overpayment in respect of any tax,interest shall be allowed at the overpayment rate established under section of the internal revenue code of upon the amount of the overpayment,from the date of the payment or collection thereof to a date preceding the date of the refund check by not more than thirty days,such date to be determined by the commissioner of internal revenue.the commissioner is authorized to tender by check payment of any such judgment,with interest as herein provided,at any time after such judgment becomes final,whether or not a claim for such payment has been duly filed,and such tender shall stop the running of interest,whether or not such refund check is accepted by the judgment creditor.see also c.further contributing to this ease in finding subject matter jurisdiction is a,which vests the district courts with broad jurisdiction over suits brought by taxpayers against the federal government 
the district courts shall have original jurisdiction,concurrent with the united states court of federal claims,of a ny civil action against the united states for the recovery of any tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected,or any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority or any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected under the laws.
indeed,the government concedes that,under a and,the district court would have had jurisdiction over scripps claim for interest if scripps suit also sought a refund of the million overpayment.the government also concedes that if the interest sought by scripps were not more than,the district court would have jurisdiction over a claim for interest.see a the district courts shall have original jurisdiction,concurrent with the united states court of federal claims,of a ny other civil action or claim against the united states,not exceeding in amount,founded either upon the constitution,or any act of congress,or any regulation of an executive department,or upon any express or implied contract with the united states,or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.thus,the question before us is a rather narrow one does the district court have subject matter jurisdiction over a claim for interest on an overpayment of tax when there is no separate claim seeking a refund of the overpaid tax and the interest sought by the taxpayer exceeds we conclude that the district court does have subject matter jurisdiction.
cleveland chair 
as an initial matter,we must consider whether the government is correct in asserting that our decision in cleveland chair united states,cir,is controlling in this case and renders the exercise of subject matter jurisdiction by the district court improper.after reviewing the factual circumstances of cleveland chair,we conclude that it is readily distinguishable from the case at bar.
in cleveland chair,the plaintiff taxpayers had been adjudged,in an earlier tax court proceeding,to owe million in income tax.id.at.the tax court entered a stay of assessment and collection of taxes pending the taxpayers appeal to this court.as a condition of the stay,the plaintiffs posted in treasury notes in lieu of appeal and supersedeas bonds,which were then transferred to the treasurer of the id.the notes matured in april,but the treasurer held the notes until may without converting or reinvesting them.id.thus,the taxpayers earned no interest on the notes for over a year.the plaintiff taxpayers were later required to pay interest on their income tax deficiency,including for the period that the notes were not generating interest.id.the plaintiff taxpayers subsequently filed suit in the district court alleging that they had made an overpayment of taxes equal to the amount of the lost interest income.the district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the suit and that the action should be transferred to the court of claims now the court of federal claims.id.
the plaintiff taxpayers appealed to this court,and we ruled that the district court was correct in finding subject matter jurisdiction lacking.in so ruling,we explained that the action did not relate to the overpayment of taxes but rather the of a federal official in his capacity as a custodian.id.at w e are dealing with an independent lawsuit to effect recovery of taxes alleged to have been overpaid when in fact no overpayment of taxes or of interest on taxes has occurred whatever duty the united states may have had as a pledgee and whatever loss the plaintiffs may have sustained by reason of the breach of that duty,such loss could not constitute an overpayment of taxes merely because it occurred as an incident to tax litigation rather than some other type of litigation.id.at citation omitted.
the case presently at bar,however,directly pertains to an alleged overpayment of tax.indeed,as the summary judgment proceedings below reveal,the central question before the district court was whether the million tendered to the irs constituted an overpayment of tax or whether it was instead a cash bond.see the scripps subsidiaries united states,d,the sole issue here with respect to the united states liability is whether scripps million remittance for the tax year was a,thus,an a cash bond.hence,we conclude that our decision in cleveland chair does not control the outcome of the case at bar.
overpayment interest as any tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected pursuant to a 
in denying the government motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,the district court below based its decision on that portion of a providing district courts with jurisdiction,concurrent with the court of federal claims,over civil action s against the united states for the recovery of any tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected specifically,the district court concluded that scripps suit fell within the scope of a because t he statutory interest compensates for that lost value and therefore should not be considered a sum separate from the initial overpayment.consequently,an overpayment is not fully refunded until the statutory interest accrued during the time the government held the money has been disgorged by the government.at.op.denying def.mot.to dismiss at.in reaching this conclusion,the district court referenced the district court for the district of connecticut decision in trustees of the bulkeley school united states,in which judge cabranes also ruled that district court jurisdiction was proper under the provision of a 
it is clear that the plaintiff is seeking to recover an tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected as is permitted by section a.the congress,by requiring the government to pay interest on tax overpayments,see,implicitly recognized that refunds of taxes overpaid in previous years must be appropriately adjusted to reflect the time value of money.a taxpayer has not received a full refund of erroneously collected taxes until he has recovered not only the nominal amount of the collection but also an amount of interest that will compensate him for the loss of the use of his money between the time that he paid the tax and the time that he received the refund.
id.at citation omitted.
the government not surprisingly takes issue with this analysis.first,the government argues that the internal revenue code irc treats statutory interest on an overpayment of tax as separate and distinct from the overpaid tax itself,and thus statutory interest does not fall within the scope of any tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected under a.in support of this argument,the government distinguishes between the irc treatment of deficiency interest,the interest paid by a taxpayer on an underpayment of taxes and statutory interest,the interest paid by the government on an overpayment of taxe
