introduction 
taxpayers living in huntington beach have been paying two taxes which taxpayers in next door sunset beach have.first,huntington beach taxpayers have been paying a utility tax of five percent.second,they have been paying a retirement property tax of about per each of assessed valuation,on top of proposition limit,for huntington beach pension costs incurred prior to the passage of proposition in 
until now the taxpayers of sunset beach have been spared those taxes.sunset beach is a relatively small strip of land,consisting of about acres,which,for over a century,has been an unincorporated part of the county of orange.because of this small size,huntington beach was able,with the approval of orange county local agency formation commission oc lafco,to annex sunset beach without a vote under california island annexation statute.see,
another california statute provides that any territory annexed to a city shall be subject to that city previously authorized taxes.so,with the annexation,sunset beach residents have now found themselves subject to the two additional taxes levied on taxpayers in huntington beach for which no one in sunset beach voted.
a group of sunset beach residents calling themselves the citizen association of sunset beach the citizens association brought this litigation just before the annexation,seeking either to prevent the annexation,or at least to require a vote by the electorate in sunset beach to approve the application of the two additional taxes that would otherwise accompany the annexation.their argument is that proposition the right to vote on taxes act,added to the california constitution as articles xiii c and xiii d,requires that sunset beach residents be given the chance to vote on the two new taxes the trial court eventually denied the citizens association petition,allowed the annexation to go through,and the citizens association has brought this appeal.
we conclude proposition was never intended to require votes incident to annexations of territory by local governments.it was intended to prevent politicians from trying to circumvent proposition by inventing assessment districts which supposedly could impose taxes without any vote of the electorate.nor does the text of proposition,even liberally construed,require an election on tax differentials in connection with an annexation.most dispositive are the dual track elections on taxes expressly required by proposition majority votes for general taxes,supermajority votes for special taxes.if the proponents of proposition had intended to require votes on annexations whenever there is a difference in the taxes between the annexing territory and the territory to be annexed,they would,at the very least,have made provision for the fact that some of the taxes would require only a majority vote,but other taxes would require a vote.none of that is in the text of proposition.we therefore affirm the trial court denial of the petition brought by the citizens association.
ii.background 
a.the move to annex sunset beach 
both sunset beach and its larger neighbor huntington beach got their start in in response to a railway extension connected with the construction of the huntington beach pier depot.at the time,the land that is now huntington harbor which lies generally behind sunset beach to the inland was marshland.until huntington harbor was developed in the early,sunset beach was almost a literal island,with train tracks running along the beach,housing tracts built on the inland side of the train tracks,and marshland behind it.
unlike huntington beach,though,sunset beach never incorporated as a city,in part due to its relatively small size.today,sunset beach consists of less than acres,tucked into the northwestern corner of orange county.there are roughly two beach acres for every residential acre.there are about permanent residents and most of the community is on the ocean side of pacific coast highway.all parties agree the community retains an identity distinctly separate from huntington beach.
as an unincorporated county area,sunset beach has been receiving a number of its local government services from the county of orange,including police protection from the orange county sheriff department.fire protection has been shared by the orange county fire authority and huntington beach fire department.however,since the the county of orange has wanted to pull back from services,thus raising the question of whether sunset beach might incorporate as a city on its own or be annexed by nearby huntington beach or seal beach.a feasibility study prepared in may to explore the possibility of sunset beach incorporating on its own projected total revenue would exceed costs by about percent and found incorporation feasible under three scenarios,albeit each of the three scenarios under consideration contemplated expanded utility taxes.nothing came of the option.
but each california county has its own lafco,or local agency formation commission to oversee annexations and formations of local governments.see community water coalition santa cruz county local agency formation com.th,d overview of cortese knox hertzberg local government reorganization act of.as part of the county general desire to divest itself of services,oc lafco had been eyeing the possible annexation of sunset beach by an adjacent city since at least.sometime before april,oc lafco initiated the idea of having huntington beach annex sunset beach.
a representative from oc lafco acknowledged the request was not initiated by huntington beach.it came up at a huntington beach city council meeting in august.the huntington beach city council voted to direct its staff to prepare the necessary paperwork for a formal application to oc lafco for annexation.huntington beach then applied to annex sunset beach.oc lafco staff recommended approval on december.
the next day the citizens association filed this action.
b.the litigation 
the citizens association petition sought a writ of mandate immediately prohibiting oc lafco from taking any further action on huntington beach annexation petition.the citizens association also sought an order directing oc lafco to either reject the annexation petition or impose as a condition a favorable vote by the residents of sunset beach in an election pursuant to proposition regarding imposition of all of the city special taxes,including but not limited to the utility tax and the property tax override.lastly,the citizens association asked for a preliminary injunction.the trial court granted the preliminary injunction on january,reasoning that the citizens association had shown a likelihood of success and would be entitled to some kind of protest proceeding or election on the annexation or taxation issue.
but when the matter was considered on the merits after briefing and oral argument in august,the result was different.the court determined proposition does not apply to island annexations under the government code specifically section.the court further concluded the annexation of sunset beach by huntington beach would not involve the imposition,extension or increase of any new general or special taxes.rather,the taxes at issue had already been established and approved by the electorate of huntington beach.
the trial court thorough three pages,covering the parties major arguments minute order was filed august.but the minute order did not deal with the existing preliminary injunction that had been in effect since january.
the citizens association thought the status of that preliminary injunction in need of clarification.huntington beach thought the denial of the petition for writ of mandate to be clear and.in any event,oc lafco did wait for further briefing.it filed its notice of completion of annexation four days later,on august.two days after that,the trial court denied an ex parte request for a stay of execution of judgment pending appeal.the formal judgment was filed september,and the citizens association filed this appeal.
iii.discussion 
respondent huntington beach argues the case is moot because the annexation is now final,but even so invites this court to reach the merits since the case is a matter of public interest and likely to arise anew.respondent oc lafco,by contrast,apparently does not think the case is moot at all.
the case is not moot,because the citizens association raises a constitutional argument against the application of the annexation statutes to sunset beach.if,indeed,proposition requires an election before either of the two huntington beach taxes at issue in this case may be applied to citizens of sunset beach,then it makes no difference whether the annexation itself is a fait accompli.constitutions trump conflicting statutes.delaney superior court cal d,fn.local governments can not avoid application of a constitutional provision simply by ramming through an annexation to completion and then argue the constitutional provision does apply to a fait accompli.
general considerations 
since this appeal centers on the possible application of proposition,a constitutional provision enacted by initiative,our task is ascertaining the intent of the voters.when construing a constitutional provision enacted by initiative,the intent of the voters is the paramount consideration.davis city of berkeley cal d.to determine intent,courts look first to the language of the provision,giving its words their ordinary meaning.if that language is clear in relation to the problem at hand,there is no need to go further.ibid.if,on the other hand,the language is ambiguous,we turn to extrinsic indicia of voter intent,particularly what the ballot pamphlet said about the initiative.people rizo cal th,d.
in construing the language of an initiative,we consider not only the ordinary meaning of the bare words,but how those words fit into the initiative as a whole.people superior court pearson cal th,d,professional engineers in california government kempton cal th,d.here,the context is key.
structurally,proposition sets up a dual system of voting on taxes.it contains two parallel subdivisions,now set forth respectively in article xiii c,section,subdivision b and article xiii,section,subdivision d,of the state constitution.they govern two different kinds of taxes.the language in each subdivision is almost identical.a vote is required before a tax may be imposed,extended or increased.but the required quantum of support for the tax varies with the kind of tax being imposed,extended or increased.if,as provided for in subdivision b,a tax is a general one,the quantum is a simple majority.but if the tax is special,a of is required we conclude this dual structure undercuts any argument there was an intent to require a vote in connection with an annexation.but to explain our conclusion,a little history is needed.
originally,section of proposition passed in cal,art.xiii a provided that cities and counties may impose special taxes by a vote.but four years later,in,a divided supreme court upheld an increase in what was arguably a special tax by only percent of the vote in,in specific response to that particular supreme court decision,the backers of proposition placed proposition on the ballot unlike proposition before it,proposition was a statutory initiative,not an amendment to the constitution.proposition added sections,and to the government code.section specifies that all taxes are either special taxes or general.section states that all special taxes must be approved by of the voters.and section states that no general tax may be imposed without a majority vote.
with the passage of proposition in came the possibility of a gallimaufry of differing tax regimes among california cities and counties.for example,voters in some counties could enact special sales taxes by a supermajority to fund construction of county jails rider county of san diego cal th,d,rider,or to fund county transportation projects santa clara county local transportation authority guardino cal th,d,guardino.likewise county voters could impose general sales tax increases by majority vote to fund general county objectives,coleman county of santa clara th,d coleman.and city voters might enact certain parcel taxes which,if properly classified as general taxes,could have squeaked by with a bare majority of the voters.see neecke city of mill valley th,d.
this history suggests strongly that if there was any intent in proposition to provide for elections in connection with annexations,that intent would have manifested itself in some provision for the multitude of elections that would be required.while much of the briefing in this case centers on the assumed confluence between proposition and the normal requirement of a majority election when unincorporated county territory is annexed by a city,we can not assume that an election on annexation is synonymous with an election on a tax.some voters might wish to vote one way on the annexation and another way on the tax.
so,if proposition were intended to apply to annexations,up to three separate elections might be required any time an annexation occurred first an election by majority vote on any general tax which the annexing jurisdiction had which the territory did not have second an election on any special tax which the annexing jurisdiction had and which the territory did not have and third at least in the case of annexations an election on the annexation per se.
and those are only the vanguard of the structural complications.given the diversity of tax regimes among local governments contemplated by proposition,some mechanism would also be needed to determine in the first place whether an annexation really would,or would not,result in additional taxes to be paid by the citizens of the territory beyond that,there would be the problem of ascertaining,before any vote required by proposition,whether any tax differentials between the annexing jurisdiction and the annexed territory were to be classified as special,requiring a vote.
in short,there is much in the very structure of proposition that,if it had been intended to apply to annexations,should have been there,but is.just as the silence of a dog trained to bark at intruders suggests the absence of intruders,this silence speaks loudly.it is indicative of a lack of voter intent to affect annexation law.see in re directv early cancellation litigation d,citing the arthur conan doyle short story silver blaze.
but quite apart from this context,the words themselves undermine appellant position.both subdivisions b and d use the same set of verbs may impose,extend,or increase.for the citizens association,the verbs impose,extend,or increase are unambiguous,and demand a simple application of proposition election requirements to the taxes at issue.
there is,however,a rule of construction well known prior to the passage of proposition that courts are required to try to harmonize constitutional language with that of existing statutes if possible.penziner west american finance cal d,metropolitan water district dorff d.dorff.put another way,the implied repeal of statutes by later constitutional provisions is not favored.accordingly,if it is possible to reconcile the language of proposition with the annexation statutes existing at the time of its passage,we must do so.see dorff,supra,d at.
it turns out that at least two annexation statutes were on the books prior to the passage of proposition which would be impliedly repealed by a construction of the measure that required an election any time an annexation involved a negative tax differential between the annexed jurisdiction and the annexing jurisdiction.
one was the island annexation statute.the citizens association argues that involuntary island annexations were the product of amendments to the government code in enacting section,hence proposition need not be harmonized with such involuntary annexations.says the citizens association,the island annexation statute,and the amendments accompanying it government code sections,were not added to the code until,therefore i t would have been impossible for the drafters of proposition to anticipate the island annexation law and make special provision for it.the argument,however,is not persuasive because involuntary island annexations long proposition enactment in.
