this case presents a simple issue with significant monetary the internal revenue service irs properly construed the term services appearing in revenue procedure,to exclude annual cardholder payments to american express for credit commitment,insurance,and luggage tags.we defer to the irs reasonable interpretation of its own revenue procedure that payments for credit are not for services.although some portion of the annual cardholder payments were made for services,even under the irs interpretation of the term,american express does not challenge the irs refusal to accept american express attempt to segregate this services portion from the portion that was not for services.therefore,all the revenue from the fees was properly required to be reported in the year it was received.we accordingly affirm the decision of the court of federal claims denying the refund sought by american express for the tax year.
background 
in,american express issued charge cards which entitled the cardholders to certain financial and products and services,insurance,and credit.like virtually all corporations,american express is an accrual basis taxpayer rather than a cash basis taxpayer.under the ordinary tax accounting rules governing the reporting of income,the annual fee payments it receives from cardholders are reported as income when earned.since it receives annual fee payments throughout the year,and the annual fee covers an entire year,one might assume that the fees necessarily were earned partially in the year of payment and partially in the next year.the analysis under the internal revenue code or code is,however,more complicated.
section of the code provides the commissioner of the irs commissioner with broad discretion to preclude a taxpayer from using a method of accounting that does not clearly reflect income and to require a taxpayer to use a method of accounting that,in the commissioner opinion,does clearly reflect income acting under that authority,the commissioner has required accrual basis taxpayers to include prepaid fees as income in the year they were received.the commissioner reasoned that at the time the taxpayer received the fees,all events had occurred that established the taxpayer right to the income.reg.c ii see also auto.club of,d.in automobile club of michigan,at,american automobile association united states,d,and schlude commissioner,d,the supreme court upheld the commissioner authority under b to require a taxpayer to include income attributable to prepaid fees in the year of receipt.
in,responding to taxpayer concerns about the claimed unfairness of the current year tax accounting of prepaid income,the commissioner,acting under the authority of of the code,issued proc,to allow accrual method taxpayers in certain specified and limited circumstances to defer the inclusion of gross income of payments received in one taxable year for services to be performed by the end of the next succeeding taxable year.proc.emphasis added.under proc,if a taxpayer satisfies the requirements of proc,then the deferral of the inclusion of gross income will be treated as an acceptable method of accounting under section of the code no deferral is permitted for income that does not represent payment for services.
until the tax year,american express reported the full amount of annual fee payments from cardholders as income in the month they were billed.on january,american express changed its financial accounting method to a ratable inclusion method,under which of the annual fee payments was included as income in the month the fee was billed and in each of the following months.this change apparently coincided with a change in accounting standards to permit such a deferral.financial accounting standards board of the financial accounting foundation,statement of financial accounting standards on june,american express filed applications for change in method of accounting forms with the irs requesting permission to use the ratable inclusion method for income tax accounting purposes but continued to report cardholder annual fee payments it billed in as income in the tax year.
the irs took the position that t he portion of the annual fees attributable to credit and goods are not deferrable under proc.because the revenue procedure applies only to advance payments for services performed by the taxpayer and credit and goods are not services.letter from paul ritenour,chief branch,irs,to daniel rosenbaum,outside counsel to american express august.the irs relied in part on general counsel memorandum,irs gcm lexis,in which the irs had previously interpreted bank credit card fees to represent loan commitment fees for a property right to use than a fee for services.the irs offered american express the opportunity to segregate payments for items that were not services,so that the services portion could be deferred pursuant to the revenue procedure,but unless american express could make an adequate segregation,the irs required that the entire annual card fee must be included in the taxpayers gross income in the tax year in which the fees are received.letter from ritenour at.american express tried but failed to convince the irs that its proposed segregation was satisfactory.
in,american express filed a timely claim for refund of income taxes for the tax year based on the requested change in accounting method.the irs denied the refund,and american express filed suit in the court of federal claims on or about september.based on stipulated facts,the parties for summary judgment.on june,the court of federal claims denied the refund and granted the irs motion for summary judgment because and the text of proc.provide d an adequate basis in law for the commissioner decision that the card fees in issue did not fall within the specified and limited circumstances of proc.am.express united states,fed.cl.in other words,the court held that t he text of proc.is not in conflict with the commissioner determination that the card fees were not paid for services and therefore could not be ratably included in gross income,id.at,and that could have reasonably been used by the commissioner for legal guidance in reaching his decision in this case that card fees were not payment for services under proc.id.at.american express timely appealed to this court.
discussion 
this case involves no issue of statutory construction.nor does it involve any questions as to the validity of the revenue procedure,which is plainly statutorily authorized.see b united states mead,d.rather,the sole issue is whether the irs properly interpreted its own revenue procedure.
we consider first whether the irs properly interpreted the procedure reference to services as not including fees for the acquisition of credit.the credit float is,the ability to charge purchases and to pay a common feature of all of the cards involved 
there is nothing on the face of irs proc.that defines the term services,and american express offers no dictionary definition that tells us,one way or the other,whether the extension of credit constitutes a form of service american express relies on a footnote in the supreme court american automobile association decision,describing services offered by the taxpayer to include furnishing road maps,routing,tour books,emergency road service through contracts with local garages bail bond protection personal automobile accident insurance and theft protection motor license procurement,brake and headlight adjustment service,notarial duties and advice in the prosecution of small claims.at.american express contends that the term services in proc.must be construed to include credit,because it is similar to the listed items.however,although the american automobile association case was an important predicate to the issuance of proc,the supreme court has suggested that we should not place undue weight on statements appearing in footnotes.cbs,fed.communication comm n,d rivet regions bank,d.there is no indication that the irs intended to adopt the supreme court definition in its revenue procedure.indeed,the stated purpose of proc.was to implement an administrative decision,made by the commissioner in the exercise of his discre
