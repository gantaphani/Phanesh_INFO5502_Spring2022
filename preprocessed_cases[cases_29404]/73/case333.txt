opinion of the court 
at issue in this case is the interpretation of a closing agreement between the internal revenue service irs and appellant bethlehem steel corporation bethlehem or taxpayer that preceded the payout by the irs to bethlehem of a refund of an anticipated overpayment of taxes,subject to later audit.resolution of the issue depends on whether an clause in the agreement prevents the irs from applying retroactive legislation,enacted after the parties execution of the closing agreement,in determining bethlehem tax liability.the district court held that the language of the clause limits its protection to terms of the agreement,and that the amount of the and the method by which it would be calculated were not terms of the agreement.the district court therefore granted summary judgment to the irs.bethlehem appeals.
under the law applicable from to,domestic manufacturers could claim tax credits based on certain modernization investments.if not fully used in the year earned,these credits could be carried forward for use in future years.the tax reform act of tra repealed the investment credit for property placed in service after december,and reduced the value of unused credits.one of various transition rules enacted in conjunction with the repeal provided a tax benefit for qualified domestic steel manufacturers,such as bethlehem,which were in dire financial straits and unlikely to generate sufficient income to use their remaining tax credits.
under tra,the steel manufacturers could elect to treat of their unused credits existing carryforwards as an income tax payment for the first taxable year after december,thereby enabling them to cash out the credits through a refund for overpayment of taxes.because this benefit was intended to enable the qualified companies to modernize their operations,f required the companies to reinvest their refunds into their businesses,although the tra did not set a reinvestment deadline.moreover,while the statute definition of existing carryforwards included credits,see tra g,the conference report on the statute clearly stated congress intent to include credits only through,see conf,at,cong.the house of representatives passed a bill in that would have retroactively amended to exclude credits,but the senate never addressed that bill.
meanwhile,bethlehem and other eligible steel companies collectively,the steel companies anticipated large refunds as a result of.in february and march,a committee of the steel companies including bethlehem met with the irs to discuss how to obtain the refunds prior to the actual filing and auditing of their returns.it was not unusual for steel companies to obtain extensions for filing their tax returns because of the complexity of their business affairs.the steel companies wanted the irs to issue the refunds on march,the statutory date of their overpayments,and there is legislative history that senators interested in the bill intended that the be quickly released.see cong.rec.statements of heinz and packwood.the steel companies initially proposed that the agency process the refunds using an expedited procedure designed to adjust overpayment of estimated income taxes.the irs rejected this proposal,negotiating to ensure that it had time to audit the refunds and that the steel companies complied with reinvestment mandate.in return for concessions in these areas,the irs agreed to issue the refunds promptly upon receipt of the steel companies claims.to memorialize the parties agreement,the irs drafted a closing agreement on final determination covering specific matters closing agreement without significant input from the steel companies.
on march and,respectively,bethlehem and the irs signed the closing agreement.it provided

app.at emphasis added.it is conceded that the clause,italicized above,was never an issue in the companies meetings.app.at.
the irs also drafted,again without significant input from the steel companies,an election and claim for quick release of overpayment resulting from the application of section of the tax reform act of claim form,which the steel companies were to use to request their refunds.app.at.the claim form referred to the election required under tra,allowed the electing company to specify the percentage of existing carryforwards as defined in tra g to which its election would apply,and required the company to list the carryforwards supporting its refund calculation.app.at.on march,bethlehem filed its claim form,electing the,and claiming a refund based on of existing carryforwards.it explicitly included its credits in its refund calculations which it attached to the form,as required.the irs paid the claimed refund on march.
bethlehem filed its consolidated income tax return on august.on november,congress enacted the technical and miscellaneous revenue act of tamra tamra f amended tra to exclude credits from the definition of existing carryforwards used to calculate refunds,and a provided that this amendment shall take effect as if included in the provision of the reform act to which it relates.consequently,upon its audit of bethlehem tax return,the irs determined that the company credits,worth,should not have been included in calculating the company refund.the irs and bethlehem entered into an agreement whereby the company agreed to pay the resulting deficiency of plus interest,for a total of,but reserved its right to claim a refund based on its purported right to include credits in its refund calculations.bethlehem paid the assessment and sought the refund,which the irs disallowed on april.
on july,bethlehem sued the irs to recover the refund,arguing that the agreement clause barred the application of tamra to exclude credits from the calculation of its refund.after submitting a stipulated record,the parties for summary judgment.the district court denied both motions,finding the agreement ambiguous.after discovery,the parties again for summary judgment.
on august,the court granted the irs motion and denied bethlehem motion.see bethlehem steel united states,d.after considering extrinsic evidence,it found that the agreement overriding purpose was to expedite bethlehem receipt of its refund,and that the parties negotiated and agreed to provisions providing for prompt release of the refund,an extension of the irs statute of limitations for challenging the refund,and a deadline for bethlehem reinvestment of the refund.finding that neither the amount nor the method of calculating the refund were negotiated terms of the agreement,the court held that they were not protected by the agreement narrow clause.bethlehem timely filed its notice of appeal.

the irs is authorized to enter into closing agreements which are final and conclusive except upon a showing of fraud or malfeasance,or misrepresentation of a material fact.b.courts interpret closing agreements according to general federal contract law principles.see united states steel,cir rink comm r,cir.
we determine a contract meaning as a matter of law when its language is clear and unambiguous,see int l union skinner engine,cir,but may use extrinsic evidence to clarify the meaning of an ambiguous contract.see in re new valley,cir.we have stated that t o decide whether a contract is ambiguous,we do not simply determine whether,from our point of view,the language is clear w e consider the contract language,the meanings suggested by counsel,and the extrinsic evidence offered in support of each interpretation.extrinsic evidence may include the structure of the contract,the bargaining history,and the conduct of the parties that reflects their understanding of the contract meaning.teamsters indus.employees welfare fund motor cars,cir citations omitted see also in re new valley,at.
in its discussion of the agreement,the district court cited the seventh circuit interpretation of an identical closing agreement between the irs and another of the steel companies.see bethlehem steel,d at steel,at.in national steel,the court held that the purpose of the closing agreement was to expedite national steel receipt of its refund while protecting the irs interests.it further held that the clause protects only those terms decided in the agreement.steel,at.the court concluded that despite the document references to the agreement did not specify the use of the section criteria,noting that h ad national steel wanted to avoid the risk of a retroactive change in law,it could have negotiated for a determination that its tax liability would be calculated in accordance with existing law.id.at.
in this case,the parties do not dispute that the clause applies only to terms of the agreement however,the irs claims that because,as both the district court and the seventh circuit found,the refund calculation is not a term of the agreement,the clause does not bar application of tamra retroactive exclusion of credits from the calculation of bethlehem refund bethlehem,on the other hand,contends that because this court considers extrinsic evidence in determining whether a contract is ambiguous,we should not follow the national steel decision which was made without the benefit of such evidence.the company asserts that the evidence in this case proves that the parties intended that bethlehem refund be calculated under the existing,thereby making the method of calculation a term of the agreement.any other interpretation,the company contends,renders the agreement clause meaningless.
we agree with the court in national steel that the method of refund calculation is unambiguously not a term of the agreement and is therefore not protected by the clause.although we agree with the irs that there is no ambiguity,even if we were to hold that there was,we would conclude that the extrinsic evidence of record reinforces this interpretation of the agreement plain language.
a.the method is not a term of the agreement 
the closing agreement,which by its title is expressly limited to s pecific m atters,app.at,contains only three substantive paragraphs describing terms agreed upon by the parties.each of these provisions deals with procedures pertaining to bethlehem receipt and investment of its refund,and the irs release and auditing of the refund.none of the three purports to set an amount,or describe a calculation formula,for the refund,and these matters plainly do not constitute terms of the agreement.bethlehem cites the two references to in the agreement as evidence that the section method of refund calculation,which included credits,is a term of the agreement.however,neither of the references purports to describe the method to be used in calculating the refund 
one reference,in the agreement first recital,states that bethlehem anticipates a tax overpayment in as a result of and desires a quick release of such overpayment.this recital explains the purpose of the agreement,rather than defining a term agreed upon by the parties.it focuses on the promptness of the irs response to bethlehem anticipated refund claim rather than the size or manner of calculating the refund.the reference to merely acknowledges the statute precipitating the agreement and can not reasonably be understood to provide for a particular method of calculating the refund.
the irs guideline describing the proper form for closing agreements relating to specific matters states,in relevant part 
the identification of the parties is followed by one or more whereas clauses which serve to introduce the subject matter of the agreement and state premises upon which it is based 
it is important to distinguish between matters which are merely informative and explanatory and matters which are being agreed upon.the former should be segregated from the latter and should ordinarily be reflected in the introductory recitals contained in the whereas clauses.
proc,this guideline further supports our conclusion that the agreement first reference to does not incorporate the section method into the contract as a matter agreed upon by the parties.
the second reference is in the second substantive provision of the agreement,which provides that bethlehem must reinvest the amount determined under within three years of receiving the money.the company argues that this phrase specifies the method for calculating the reinvestment amount and,therefore,the refund amount.however,the phrase is situated in a provision describing the time and manner,rather than the amount,of reinvestment,belying this interpretation.nonetheless,bethlehem contends that the actual effect of the reinvestment deadline in this case supports its position,stating that because it respected the deadline,it reinvested its entire refund before the irs disallowed the portion of the refund based on credits,with the result that it reinvested more than the amount of its ultimate refund.
bethlehem argues that by imposing the reinvestment deadline,the irs bound itself to use the same method to calculate the refund as the company had used to calculate the reinvestment obligation.this overinvestment claim is not supported in the record and does not compel bethlehem interpretation of the agreement.bethlehem points to no evidence that it reinvested more under the agreement than it otherwise planned to invest,or that it did so before tamra was enacted,less than one year into the reinvestment period.moreover,bethlehem undertook the risk of overinvestment when it agreed to extend the irs period of limitations for challenging the refund past the reinvestment deadline rather than negotiating for a different timeline.
in fact,bethlehem overinvestment argument highlights the fact that the agreement first substantive provision expressly reserves the irs right to challenge the company claimed refund should it be determined to be erroneous or excessive and extends the agency statute of limitations for such challenges.app.at.along with the final substantive provision,requiring prompt release of the claimed refund,this provision further demonstrates that the parties intended that the agreement would facilitate bethlehem quick receipt of the funds while allowing the irs ample time to audit the company claim.it follows that there was no reason why the agreement would contain any term detailing the anticipated refund size or calculation.we therefore agree with the irs that the closing agreement was not ambiguous and that it was entitled to summary judgment on its first motion.
