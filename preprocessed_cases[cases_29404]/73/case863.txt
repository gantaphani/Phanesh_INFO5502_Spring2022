the panel affirmed the tax court decision denying a petition for redetermination of federal income tax deficiencies that challenged the taxability of alleged maintenance payments received by taxpayers who have taken vows of poverty.
taxpayers contended that they did not earn taxable income and are exempt from paying taxes because they have taken vows of poverty.they explained that their maintenance is provided by bethel aram ministries bam,a church for which taxpayer elizabeth gardner is its corporation sole.the panel explained that substantial evidence supports the tax court determinations that the payments taxpayers received were not contributions to bam but were instead quid pro quo payments for taxpayers services in setting up corporations sole and llcs,and that taxpayers retained complete dominion and control over the payments even after they were deposited in bam accounts.accordingly,the payments to taxpayers are taxable and subject to tax.
callahan,circuit judge 
elizabeth and fredric gardner assert,in a nutshell,that bethel aram ministries bam is a church,that elizabeth is its corporation sole,and that both elizabeth and fredric have taken vows of poverty with their maintenance provided by bam.they argue that based on these facts they did not earn taxable income and are exempt from paying taxes.
the tax court,however,determined that the payments received by the gardners were not contributions to bam and that the gardners had complete control over bam assets.it concluded that because the gardners exercised dominion and control over bam accounts,all taxable deposits into those accounts are includable in their gross income.
