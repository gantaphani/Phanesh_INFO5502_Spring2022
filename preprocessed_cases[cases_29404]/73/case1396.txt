gerdau ameristeel and keystone consolidated industries,jointly,gerdau appeal from the judgment of the court of international trade upholding a final determination by the international trade commission.the issue on appeal is whether,on remand from a prior appeal to this court,the commission was compelled by our remand instructions and prior decisions of this court to conclude that less than fair value ltfv imports of steel wire rod from trinidad and tobago did not cause a material injury to a domestic industry.we hold that the commission was not compelled to reach that conclusion.we therefore vacate the judgment of the court of international trade and remand the case to that court with instructions to remand the case to the commission.
this appeal arises out of an antidumping investigation that began in august when several domestic producers of steel wire rod filed antidumping petitions with the commission.in their petitions,the domestic producers alleged that ltfv imports of steel wire rod from countries,including the republic of trinidad and tobago,had caused material injury to the domestic industry.in its first final determination,the commission concluded that ltfv imports from the countries had caused material injury to the domestic industry.the commission further determined that the evidence supported a finding that ltfv imports from trinidad and tobago alone had caused material injury to the domestic industry.

on appeal,we held that the court of international trade erred by concluding that the commission was prohibited from considering the effects of ltfv imports from countries when it assessed imports from trinidad and tobago.caribbean ispat united states.we therefore remanded the case for further proceedings in light of that holding.in addition,we directed the commission to take into account our decision in bratsk aluminium smelter united states.in bratsk,this court held that whenever the antidumping investigation is centered on a commodity product,and price competitive imports are a significant factor in the market,the commission is required to explain the presence and significance of the concluded that the subject imports caused material injury to the domestic industry.id.at.
based on the decision in bratsk,we instructed the commission to make a specific causation determination and in that connection to directly address whether other ltfv imports fairly traded imports would have replaced trinidad and tobago imports without any beneficial effect on domestic producers.caribbean ispat,at quoting bratsk,at.
on remand,the commission first considered the statutorily mandated present material injury factors specified in b i 
i the volume of imports of the subject merchandise,
ii the effect of imports of that merchandise on prices in the united states for domestic like products,and 
iii the impact of imports of such merchandise on domestic producers of domestic like products,but only in the context of production operations within the united states 
the commission found that each of those factors favored a finding of material injury by reason of subject imports from trinidad and tobago.in its analysis of the price effects and the impact of trinidadian imports,the commission found that the injury to the domestic industry could not be entirely explained by the market presence of imports and subject imports.the commission therefore concluded that subject imports from trinidad and tobago had caused material injury to the domestic industry based on the significant and increasing volume and market share of subject imports from trinidad and tobago in a shrinking market,significant price underselling and significant price suppression by these imports,and declining industry indicators from to.
with respect to the question whether the domestic industry was threatened with material injury in the foreseeable future,the commission found that mittal had the ability to increase its exports to the that the subject imports from trinidad and tobago had undersold the prices for the domestic like product and were likely to continue to have a significant suppressing effect on domestic prices and that the subject imports were likely to have a negative effect on the domestic industry production and development efforts.for those reasons,the commission found a likelihood of continued imminent injury to the domestic industry from subject imports from trinidad and tobago.the commission therefore concluded that application of the threat factors,as well as of the present material injury factors each would have led us to an affirmative determination.
despite reaching that conclusion,the commission stated that it could not issue an affirmative determination of material injury by reason of the subject imports because of this court remand instructions relating to the requirements of bratsk.first,the commission stated that our remand instructions seemed to require the commission to treat all steel wire imports as fungible commodity products.next,the commission determined that the record supported a finding that imports were present in significant quantities and were a significant factor in the market.the commission then turned to the question whether imports would have replaced trinidadian imports and,if so,whether the absence of imports from trinidad and tobago would have had any beneficial effect on domestic producers during the period of investigation.
in addressing that issue,the commission first concluded that the record supported a determination that producers in countries other than trinidad and tobago had sufficient capacity that they could have,if so inclined,exported sufficient volumes to the during the period of investigation to fully replace subject imports from trinidad and tobago.while the commission found that imports had the capacity to replace imports from trinidad and tobago,however,it stated that it was unable to conclude that those imports would have replaced subject trinidadian imports.the commission explained that it was unable to make that finding because of the lack of evidence in the record on that issue.nonetheless,the commission invoked a presumption that the subject imports would have been replaced.it applied that presumption based on its perception that this court had required the commission to make a negative determination unless evidence in the record supported the conclusion that imports would not have replaced subject imports or if they would have replaced them,would not have resulted in a benefit to the domestic industry.the commission added that this court appears to have created a presumption under the bratsk test that if a foreign producer could replace subject imports,it would.
the commission next turned to the question whether there would have been any benefit to the domestic industry if subject imports had been absent from the market.the commission found that the low prices or average unit values at which many imports entered the united states weighed against a finding that the removal of the trinidadian imports would have resulted in a benefit to the domestic industry.the commission therefore determined that the domestic industry was not materially injured by reason of the subject imports.in so doing,however,the commission made clear that it was reaching that conclusion only because it believed it was compelled to by the analysis required under bratsk.the commission stated that we believe the federal circuit decision in bratsk and its remand order in this case compel us to reach a negative determination in this investigation,even though we believe an affirmative determination is consistent with the statute and supported by the factual record.finally,the commission noted that its conclusion with respect to the causation analysis applied equally to its analysis of whether there was a threat of material injury by reason of subject imports from trinidad and tobago.
commissioners koplan and lane dissented from the commission analysis of bratsk.in their view,the commission majority had erred in considering the steel wire rod under investigation to be a commodity product.for that reason,they stated that they would have issued an affirmative determination.
on appeal from the commission negative determination,the court of international trade affirmed.the court ruled that the commission had conducted the remand proceedings as this court directed and that the court could not agree with the appellants that the agency record,such as it still is,does not support the commission specific causation determination.mittal steel point lisas united states,d.int l trade.
gerdau challenges the commission negative determination on a number of grounds.first,gerdau argues that the test applied by the commission,based on its understanding of this court decision in bratsk,lacks statutory support and therefore is not in accordance with law.second,gerdau challenges the commission conclusion that this court made a factual finding with respect to the interchangeability of the steel wire imports at issue in the investigation.third,gerdau argues that the commission erred in applying a rebuttable presumption that imports from trinidad and tobago would have been replaced by imports from countries having the capacity to replace the trinidadian imports.finally,gerdau argues that the commission misapplied the test in connection with its threat determination.
the commission responds that,although it regards this court remand instructions as reflecting an incorrect interpretation of the antidumping statute,its negative determination should be upheld because it faithfully applied the remand instructions in this case and the more general directions provided by this court decision in bratsk.mittal supports the commission negative determination,arguing that the commission correctly applied the principles of bratsk and that those principles are not in conflict with the antidumping statute.
the commission begins its argument by setting forth its contention that,apart from requiring that the commission consider the three factors specified in section b i,the antidumping statute does not require the commission to perform any further analysis when determining whether a material injury was by reason of subject imports.in addition to those three mandatory volume of subject imports,the effect of those imports on prices in the united states,and the impact of those imports on domestic b ii provides that the commission may consider such other economic factors as are relevant to the determination regarding whether there is material injury by reason of imports.because the language of section b ii is permissive,the commission argues that it has discretion to go beyond the three factors set forth in section b i,but it is not required to do so.
while the commission is correct that section b ii affords it discretion to consider factors other than the three factors set forth in section b i,that discretion is not unbounded,but is subject to general principles of administrative law.in particular,the commission would abuse its discretion if,by ignoring a relevant economic factor that it could consider under section b ii,the commission entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d see timken united states,applying that principle to an antidumping determination and citing other cases applying the same principle in the same context.in making its determination as to whether the harm to the domestic injury occurred by reason of the ltfv imports,the commission was required to examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action.motor vehicle mfrs.ass n,at.see also b in the notification required under section d or d of this title,as the case may be,the commission shall explain its analysis of each factor considered under clause i,and identify each factor considered under clause ii and explain in full its relevance to the determination.
while the commission may not enter an affirmative determination unless it finds that a domestic industry is materially injured by reason of subject imports,the commission is not required to follow a single methodology for making that determination.in united states steel group united states,this court emphasized the commission broad discretion with respect to its choice of methodology.the court stated 
this court has no independent authority to tell the commission how to do its job.we can only direct the commission to follow the dictates of its statutory mandate.so long as the commission analysis does not violate any statute and is not otherwise arbitrary and capricious,the commission may perform its duties in the way it believes most suitable.

in reviewing an affirmative injury determination for substantial evidence,this court requires evidence in the record to show that the harm occurred by reason of the ltfv imports,not by reason of a minimal or tangential contribution to material harm caused by ltfv goods.gerald metals,united states.in analyzing the issue of causation,the commission has broad authority to consider any relevant factors.allegheny ludlum united states.our review of the commission causation analysis in antidumping cases is therefore limited to whether the commission complied with certain minimum requirements imposed by statutory provisions and principles of administrative law.
we applied the principles described above in our decisions in gerald metals and bratsk.in gerald metals,we reviewed an affirmative determination by the commission,subsequently sustained by the court of international trade,that russian,ukrainian,and chinese magnesium imports caused material injury to the domestic industry.at.gerald metals appealed that determination with respect to ltfv ukrainian imports.on appeal,this court observed that the record supported an inference that fairly traded russian imports were substitutes for the subject ukrainian ltfv imports.id.at.we concluded that the commission fail ed to incorporate the undisputed facts about imports into its analysis of the harm caused by reason of the cumulated ltfv imports.id.at.in its review,the court of international trade had found no evidence in the record to support gerald metals argument that russian imports would have replaced all or the greater part of the subject imports.id.at.after reviewing the record,however,we held that we could not affirm the decision of the court of international trade without further explanation of whether fairly traded russian imports would have replaced the subject imports.id.because the record on appeal did not support the conclusion that ltfv imports were the reason for the harmful effects to the domestic magnesium industry,we remanded the case to the court of international trade.id.at.noting that the statute requires adequate evidence to show that the harm to the domestic industry occurred by reason of the ltfv imports,not by reason of a minimal or tangential contribution to material harm caused by ltfv goods,we held that the failure of the court of international trade to consider properly the presence of russian imports rendered the court decision erroneous.id.
in bratsk,we held that the commission had failed to consider an important aspect of the causation analysis under gerald metals when it did not address whether imports would have replaced the subject imports at metal imports from russia.at.we acknowledged in bratsk that there may have been support for the commission ultimate determination in the record,but we found that the commission did not provide a satisfactory explanation for its affirmative determination.id.instead of considering whether imports would have replaced the subject imports,the commission had limited gerald metals to its unique facts.id.we therefore remanded the case for the commission to include in its causation analysis a determination as to whether imports would have replaced subject imports without any benefit to the domestic industry.id.at.
in this case,as in bratsk,the commission first final determination did not specifically address whether trinidad and tobago imports could or would be replaced by other imports so that the domestic industry would not benefit from the removal of trinidad and tobago imports from the market.caribbean ispat,at.on remand,the commission analyzed whether other imports would have replaced subject imports from trinidad and tobago.at the conclusion of that analysis,the commission issued a negative determination as to whether the domestic industry had been injured by reason of the subject imports but,as noted,the commission made clear that it reached that conclusion only because it felt compelled to do so by the terms of this court remand instructions and the analytical approach required by bratsk.
we think the commission interpreted this court remand instructions and the decision in bratsk too rigidly,in three respects.first,the commission viewed our remand instructions as foreclosing it from making a finding as to one of the triggering factors for applying the bratsk question as to whether the merchandise subject to investigation was a commodity product.second,the commission interpreted the bratsk analysis as looking to whether an antidumping order would result in a benefit to the domestic industry by eliminating the subject imports from the market in the future,rather than looking to whether the hypothetical removal of the ltfv subject imports would have resulted in their replacement by or imports with no resulting benefit to the domestic industry.third,the commission interpreted bratsk as adopting a rebuttable presumption that subject imports would be replaced by imports and,absent an affirmative showing to the contrary,requiring the commission to make a negative determination.we now address each of these issues.
in the remand proceedings,the commission found that the products at issue comprise a continuum of at least major categories of products,ranging from low carbon wire rod such as industrial wire rod used for nails and coat hangers,to medium to high carbon wire rod.notwithstanding that finding,the commission concluded that our decision in the prior appeal in this case had already resolved the issue of fungibility and foreclosed the commission from making a contrary finding that the products were not fungible.the commission stated that our opinion appear ed to assume that wire rod is a commodity product as defined in bratsk,since it stated that the task remaining before the commission is to conduct the test,not to analyze whether the threshold factors in bratsk have been met.
our prior decision did not purport to make a factual finding that all steel wire rod imports at issue in the commission investigation were fungible and therefore should be treated as commodity products for purposes of the bratsk analysis.rather,we simply observed that the commission found a high level of fungibility between subject imports from trinidad and tobago and the domestic product,and between subject imports from trinidad and tobago and imports from each of the other subject countries.caribbean ispat,at quoting the final determination of the commission.while we may have assumed,based on the quoted language from the commission earlier determination,that the commission finding with respect to the commodity nature of the products would likely be the same as its finding with respect to cumulation,the commission has explained in some detail why the two are not necessarily the same.if we were wrong in our assumption as to what the commission finding would be with respect to the commodity issue,it was the commission prerogative to say so.
the commission,and not this court,is the finder of facts in antidumping investigations,and it is up to the commission to make findings of fact on issues such as fungibility.appellate courts do not make factual findings they review them.see icicle seafoods,worthington,d appellate court may set aside findings of fact it determines to be clearly erroneous and may reverse incorrect judgments of law based on proper factual findings,but it should not simply make factual findings on its own middleton dep t of,as an appellate court,we may not find facts first interstate bank of billings united states,it would be a distortion of our role to draw conclusions about the facts rather than having the trial court make its own findings in light of the legal standard that we have endorsed.citing icicle seafoods,supra.for purposes of further proceedings in this case,the commission should regard the issue of fungibility as an open factual issue for it to resolve.
in its final determination,the commission interpreted bratsk to require it to determine whether imports would fill the void created by the elimination of subject imports despite the fact that there may be no such void created by an order.the commission criticized that requirement on the ground that it misconstrues the purpose of the statute,which is not to bar subject imports from the market,but is meant instead to level competitive conditions by imposing a duty on subject imports and thus enabling the industry to compete against fairly traded imports.the commission added that the bratsk analysis is contrary to the principle that under the statute,it is not required,nor is it permitted,to reach a negative determination based on the likely effectiveness of an order the statute contemplates that not all orders will be effective and does not ask the itc to perform an additional inquiry to predict the future effectiveness of import relief.
in its brief on this appeal,the commission echoes the same concerns.it argues that the antidumping statute does not state that imposition of antidumping or countervailing duty is appropriate only if the commission establishes in its injury determination that such relief will be effective.the commission adds that the statute recognizes that not all orders will be effective and does not provide for the commission to perform an additional inquiry to predict the future effectiveness of import relief.
those objections are based on what appears to be a misapprehension of the purpose of the analysis discussed in bratsk.the comments reveal that the commission views bratsk as holding that an antidumping duty order may be entered only if the commission can determine that the order would be effective in the future by causing the elimination of the subject imports from the market,which imports would not then be replaced by imports.
that characterization misses the point of bratsk.the decision in bratsk was not addressed to the potential effectiveness of any possible remedial order.instead,it was directed to determining the cause of the injury already suffered by the domestic industry.
an important element of the causation necessarily dispositive,but whether the subject imports are the but for cause of the injury to the domestic industry.as the supreme court has explained,
but for causation is a hypothetical construct.in determining whether a particular factor was a cause of a given event,we begin by assuming that that factor was present at the time of the event,and then ask whether even if that factor had been absent,the event nevertheless would have transpired in the same way.
price waterhouse hopkins,d.
in this context,that principle requires the finder of fact to ask whether conditions would have been different for the domestic industry in the absence of dumping.thus,bratsk like gerald metals directs that in cases involving commodity products in which imported goods are present in the market,the commission must give consideration to the issue of but for causation by considering whether the domestic industry would
