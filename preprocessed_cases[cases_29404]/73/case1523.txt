no change in judgment 
it is ordered that the published opinion filed herein on february,be modified as follows in the first and second sentences of the paragraph that appears at.lexis at pages and,insert the new text underscored here for identification purposes only as follows 
here,ellis did not file his application challenging the base year value and seeking a refund until thus,he would not be entitled to a reduction in the assessment for purposes of a refund of the taxes paid in or.therefore,he has failed to state a cause of action for refund of his taxes for those years.to the extent his petition and complaint could be interpreted to contain a cause of action for a refund of taxes,the trial court properly sustained the demurrer as to that cause of action.and,to the extent he desires an order from the trial court or this court directing such a refund,he is not entitled to such relief as a matter of law.nor is he entitled to a reduction of his regular assessment in,even if he correctly challenges the base year value,because there had been two interceding assessments of the partially completed construction in the meantime,neither of which was challenged in ellis appeal to the aab.therefore,because he is barred,as a matter of law,from obtaining the relief he sought,the trial court did not err in sustaining the demurrer to ellis petition and complaint.
this modification does not effect a change in the judgment.appellant petition for rehearing is denied.

factual and procedural background 
ellis owned real property in calaveras county on which he was constructing a large detached garage.in,he was assessed property taxes based on an appraised value of the garage set by the assessor at percent of the estimated total cost of construction of.ellis sought a reduction of the assessment from the aab.following an evidentiary hearing in july,the aab reduced the value of the garage to,based on a finding that construction was only percent complete.in february,ellis contested that finding by seeking writ relief from the trial court,but the parties reached a settlement before the trial court ruled on the merits 
the parties settlement agreement,dated july,provided that the assessed value of the garage for property tax purposes for the lien date was and that the structure was percent complete as of the lien date.the settlement also required the aab to rescind its findings of fact,to issue new findings of fact consistent with the settlement agreement,to authorize the assessor to correct the tax roll,and to authorize the to issue a tax refund to ellis.the aab new findings stated that f or the lien date only,the valuation of the incomplete construction for the tax roll shall be.such construction shall be deemed percent complete as of the lien date 
in,ellis was assessed property taxes based on the partially constructed garage having a base year value in of.in light of this assessment,in december,after he had received a property tax assessment as of the lien date,ellis moved in the trial court writ proceedings mentioned above for enforcement of the settlement agreement.namely,he sought an order from the trial court directing county officials to correct the tax roll for the and lien dates to reflect the lien date value of,plus the statutorily required inflation factor,and to refund the excess tax ellis had paid for the tax year.the county and the aab opposed the motion,arguing the value was applicable only in the tax year.the trial court denied ellis motion,concluding the agreement and counsels declarations d id not support a finding the parties agreed to use the valuation of prospectively thereafter.
when his attempts to enforce the settlement agreement failed,ellis filed an application with the aab to reduce the assessment for his property taxes.he designated the application,which was filed november,as a claim for a tax refund,and he indicated his challenge was premised on the base year value being incorrect and there having been no new construction as of the lien date.by the time ellis filed his application,construction of the garage had been deemed complete and a supplemental assessment had been issued.he also received a regular assessment as of the lien date.
in july,the aab heard ellis appeal of his tax assessment.the assessor argued that neither the amount nor the amount entered for the tax roll were base year value s,and that ellis appeal was because it was not filed on or before november.ellis argued the amount was the base year value,that it had to be applied in subsequent years until more construction was completed,and that his appeal was timely filed within four years of the base value being entered on the tax roll.the aab determined ellis appeal was not timely filed,and that it therefore lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal.
in march,ellis petitioned the trial court seeking a traditional or administrative writ of mandate,refund of his property taxes,and declaratory relief.in his subsequently amended petition and complaint,ellis claimed the aab decision was arbitrary,in excess of its discretion,and violated the law because the aab erroneously concluded that neither the amount nor the amount was the base year value for the incomplete garage the aab did not address his contention that there was no time limit to his appeal and the decision is based on erroneous assumptions and misguided applications of law.ellis specifically sought orders from the trial court determining and declaring that the settlement amount was a base year value to be applied in subsequent years absent completion of additional construction,and that the assessment was also a base year value which could be challenged within four years and that could be corrected at any time directing the aab to rescind its findings of fact in ellis appeal of the tax assessment directing the assessor to enter corrected values on the tax roll as of the lien date directing the auditor to issue a refund of property taxes for the and subsequent tax years and declaring that ellis is entitled to damages and attorney fees.
the county,the aab,the assessor,and the demurred to ellis petition and complaint,contending ellis failed to state a cause of action because he had an adequate remedy at law his action is barred by the prohibition against writ relief codified in revenue and taxation code section he alleged facts that would bar his recovery his action is he had not exhausted his administrative remedies his claim was barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel and the assessor and were not properly joined as parties pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision d.ellis opposed the demurrer.
the trial court ruled that,though dubbed a petition for mandamus and complaint,the entire pleading was actually a petition for writ of mandamus to have the tax year settlement amount established as the base year value for all future tax years.the trial court further ruled that as the deemed completion was used to establish the base tax year,this in turn started the running of the four year statute of limitations to file an appeal with the aab or challenge this determinat
