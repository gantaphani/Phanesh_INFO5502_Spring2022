the estate of paul mitchell the estate petitions for review of the united states tax court decision allowing the commissioner of the internal revenue service the commissioner to assess an additional in federal estate taxes.the estate claims that the tax court erred by finding that the commissioner timely notified the estate of the additional taxes due failing to shift the burden of proof to the commissioner and failing to require the government to justify its calculation of the additional taxes failing to provide a detailed explanation of the methodology used to calculate the fair market value of the john paul mitchell systems jpms stock held by the estate and miscalculating the value of jpms stock held by the estate in a manner inconsistent with its own holding.although we find that the commissioner notice was timely,we nevertheless vacate the tax court judgment and remand because the tax court failed to shift the burden of proving the accuracy of the additional estate tax to the commissioner and failed to provide an adequate explanation for its valuation of the jpms stock at the time of paul mitchell death.
background 
paul mitchell,of the highly successful products company of the same name,died on april,pursuant to a,the estate filed for,and received,a six month extension of time to file its estate tax return,delaying the filing deadline from january,to july.because july,fell on a saturday,the estate mailed its return on friday,july.the irs received the estate return on monday,july.
on july,the irs mailed to the estate a notice of deficiency the notice,determining a deficiency in the federal estate tax in the amount of,and a total of in penalties the irs asserted that the estate had undervalued its shares of jpms stock.the estate had reported the stock was worth million based on a valuation conducted by a private accounting firm.the irs,however,calculated the stock value at million and assessed additional taxes based on the million discrepancy.
in october,the estate petitioned the united states tax court for review of the commissioner additional assessment.the estate first disputed the timeliness of the notice.in moving for summary judgment,the estate maintained that,under,its return was filed on july,date on which the return was mailed to the irs.therefore,the estate argued that the notice was untimely under because it was mailed on july,day after the three year statute of limitations ran.
in october,the tax court ruled that the notice was timely.estate of mitchell commissioner,wl.the tax court reasoned that was not relevant because it only applies in situations where a return is untimely filed.because the deadline,july,fell on a saturday,applied,which considers as timely filed a return due on a weekend or holiday that is received by the irs on the first business day following that weekend or holiday.the estate return was timely because the irs received it on monday,july.therefore,did not apply.
on june,the estate filed a motion with the tax court disputing that it bore the burden of persuasion to show the commissioner assessment was inaccurate.the estate argued that the evidence established that it owned percent of the outstanding stock in jpms on the valuation date and thus its interest in jpms was a minority interest,not a controlling interest.therefore,the commissioner appraisal,determining that the estate percent interest was a controlling interest,was erroneous,and any additional estate taxes were excessive.the estate contended that pursuant to herbert commissioner,cir,the burden should be placed on the commissioner to justify the government original assessment or to submit a more accurate figure.on july,the tax court denied the estate motion to shift the burden of persuasion without explanation.
the dispute over the value of the stock proceeded to trial.in addition to a substantial amount of documentary evidence,both the estate and the commissioner offered the testimony of expert witnesses as to the value of the shares of stock jpms stock.the experts testimony offered a wide variety of estimates and methods for calculating the stock value.as may be expected,the experts for the estate minimized the stock value,testifying that its value on the date of paul mitchell death ranged from approximately to million,while the experts for the commissioner maximized the stock value in a range from to million.the methodology each expert used was equally varied,with some producing estimates based on the stock prices of similar companies and others using elaborate economic formulae.the experts generally agreed that the most significant factors included the impact of paul mitchell death on the reputation of the company,the costs of litigation between the estate and john paul jones dejoria,mitchell and business partner patterns,the marketability of the estate minority interest of stock in the company and the overall competition in the hair care industry.
in,the tax court issued its opinion as to the stock value.estate of mitchell commissioner,cch.the tax court found that the stock fair market value was.the court began by assigning a million value to jpms based on the testimony of robert taylor,the president of minnetonka corporations,who testified that his company had offered million for jpms,but was rebuffed by dejoria who informed taylor that he had received a million offer from gillette.the court then discounted the company value by ten percent to account for the loss of mitchell public presence and creativity.from the now million total company value,the tax court calculated the value of the estate percent share in the company at.finally,the court granted a total percent discount to reflect the combined discounts of lack of marketability and minority interest and a million discount to reflect the possibility of a lawsuit over dejoria compensation.
in november,the estate filed a motion for reconsideration and to correct the tax court opinion,claiming the tax court had overvalued the stock by imposing a percent combined discount to reflect the minority interest and lack of marketability,which it argued was unsupported by and contrary to the record.specifically,the estate argued that the tax court misstated the testimony of expert witness george weiksner,erroneously reciting that he had adjusted the public value of the shares by a percent discount to reflect a combined discount for the minority interest and the lack of marketability,when in fact weiksner uncontroverted testimony suggested a combined discount of percent.on december,the tax court granted the estate motion in part,modifying it to correctly reflect weiksner testimony,but denied the estate request for reconsideration.
on june,the estate filed a second motion for reconsideration,pursuant to tax court rules of practice and procedure,renewing its objection to the tax court valuation of the stock.the estate also argued that our holding in leonard pipeline contractors commissioner,cir,which had been filed but not published at the time the estate filed its first motion for reconsideration required the tax court to more adequately explain how it arrived at the combined discount for minority interest and lack of marketability.on july,the tax court denied the estate second motion for reconsideration,ruling that the motion was untimely and that estate had failed to show unusual circumstances or substantial error.the court further explained that its determination of the percent combined discount rate was appropriate and fell within the ranges suggested by the parties experts.it further stated that valuation is necessarily an approximation and a matter of judgment,rather than one of mathematics,hamm commissioner,cir,on which petitioner has the burden of proof.
the estate filed a timely appeal.we have jurisdiction under and review the merits of each of the estate claims in turn.
ii.discussion 
timeliness of the notice of deficiency 
the estate claims that the notice of deficiency was untimely,and therefore the statute of limitations bars the assessment of additional federal estate tax and penalties.this presents a mixed question of law and fact,which is reviewed de novo.mayors comm r,cir.the estate contends that,under a,its return was filed on july,postmarked date.section a provides 
if any return,claim,statement,or other document required to be filed,or any payment required to be made,within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under authority of any provision of the internal revenue laws is,after such period or such date,delivered by the united states mail to the agency,officer,or office with which such return,claim,statement,or other document is required to be filed,or to which such payment is required to be made,the date of the united states postmark stamped on the cover in which such return,claim,statement,or other document,or payment,is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment,as the case may be.
a emphasis added.therefore,the estate argues,the notice was late because it was mailed on july,day after the three year statute of limitations ran.see a setting a three year statute of limitations for the commissioner to send a notice of deficiency.
the tax court rejected the estate argument,reasoning that was not relevant because the estate return was timely filed.the tax court held that because the deadline,july,fell on a saturday,the provisions of were applicable 
when the last day prescribed under authority of the internal revenue laws for performing any act falls on saturday,sunday,or a legal holiday,the performance of such act shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding day which is not a saturday,sunday,or a legal holiday.
given that the prescribed deadline for the estate return was july,a saturday,the tax court held that automatically extended the timely filing period to monday,july.accordingly,the tax court concluded that because the irs received the estate return on monday,july,the return was timely filed that day,and therefore did not apply.
we agree with the tax court.as we previously held in first charter financial united states,cir,section a intended to make the date of mailing the date of delivery only where a document would otherwise be considered untimely filed.id.at see also miller united states,cir holding that applies only in cases where the document is actually received by the after the statutory period.therefore,the tax court correctly concluded that the estate return was timely filed under,not.
even if we were to assume that the estate is correct and applies,the notice would be timely.under,the return would be considered delivered,and therefore filed,when it was mailed on july,day before the july,deadline.it also would be an early return.b states for purposes of this section,a return of tax imposed by this title filed before the last day prescribed by law or by regulations promulgated pursuant to law for the filing thereof,shall be considered as filed on such last day.id.emphasis added see also hotel equities comm r,cir discussing the effect of b on the three year statute of limitations.as an early filed return,the estate return would be considered filed on july,therefore,the statute of limitations would begin to run on that day,and not july,as the estate contends.consequently,the notice would be timely because it was sent on the last day before the statute of limitations ran july.thus,in light of either section or,the notice was timely.
shifting the burden of proof 
the estate argues that the tax court erred by denying its motion to shift the burden of persuasion,leaving the burden of proof on the estate.see herbert comm r,cir.the tax court denied the estate motion without explanation,and we will refrain from speculating as to the reasons for its decision.we nevertheless review de novo the tax court decision to deny the estate motion to shift the burden.see moss comm r,cir.
in cohen commissioner,cir,we stated 
at the outset of a tax court proceeding to redetermine a tax deficiency,the commissioner determination is presumed to be correct.the burden of proof is thus placed upon the taxpayer to show that the commissioner determination is invalid.
when the commissioner determination has been shown to be invalid,the tax court must redetermine the deficiency.the presumption as to the correctness of the commissioner determination is then out of the case.the commissioner and not the taxpayer then has the burden of proving whether any deficiency exists and if so the amount.it is not incumbent upon the taxpayer under these circumstances to prove that he owed no tax or the amount of the tax which he did owe.
id.at citations omitted.
according to the notice,the commissioner concluded the value of the jpms stock at the time of paul mitchell death was million.the estate had reported the value at million in its tax return.due to the million difference in value,the commissioner asserted that the estate owed an additional in estate taxes,not including a total of in penalties.at trial,martin hanan,a witness for the commissioner,valued the stock at million million less than the commissioner original valuation.furthermore,a letter written by the commissioner appraiser,aibe valuation,dated march,indicates that aibe valuation originally appraised mitchell interest at million as a minority interest,but increased it to million,at the request of the irs,to reflect the estate interest as a controlling interest.we find that hanan testimony and the aibe letter support the conclusion that the commissioner assessment was arbitrary and excessive.united states stonehill,cir holding that where the assessment has separable items,error which demonstrates a pattern of arbitrariness or carelessness will destroy the presumption for the entire assessment cohen,at holding that when the taxpayer has shown the determination to be arbitrary and excessive,the burden of persuasion shifts to the commissioner to prove the correct amount of tax owed and the presumption as to the correctness of the commissioner determination is out of the case see also helvering taylor.
we conclude that the tax court erred in denying the estate motion to shift the burden of persuasion.consistent with cohen,because the commissioner determination was demonstrated,by its own experts,to be invalid,the not the the burden of proving whether any deficiency exists and if so the amount.cohen,at.the tax court treated the case as one where the burden of proof made no difference it did not find that one party failed to carry its burden,but proceeded with its own valuation,weighing the evidence and choosing from among conflicting inferences and conclusions those which it considers most reasonable.tax court order,docket july,citing comm r scottish am.inv.however,in responding to the petitioner second motion for reconsideration,the tax court erroneously stated that valuation was a matter of approximation and judgment on which the petitioner has the burden of proof.emphasis added.because the burden of proving the evaluation of the estate and the commensurate deficiency shifted to the commissioner,it was error not to put the commissioner to its proof.
explanation of valuation 
the estate argues that the tax court also erred by failing to provide a more detailed explanation of its stock valuation pursuant to our holding in leonard pipeline contractors commissioner,cir.it further contends that the tax court decision is internally inconsistent,noting that the tax court erroneously stated that it selected a combined discount value for the stock that was within the ranges established by the expert witnesses testimony.finally,the estate argues that the tax court error in identifying the correct range follows from its failure adequately to explain its holding.
in leonard pipeline,the tax court had concluded that it was impossible to calculate the values at issue with any mathematical precision and instead substituted its best judgment to arrive at the appropriate figures.id.at.on appeal,we held that it is the obligation of the tax court to spell out its reasoning and to do more than enumerate the factors and leap to a figure intermediate between petitioner and the commissioner.id.in reversing and remanding that case to the tax court,we further held a reasoned decision as to what is reasonable in this context must bring
