background 
judicial watch,a,public interest law firm that uses the courts to fight corruption in the government and legal profession,was founded by attorney larry klayman in.it is exempt from the income tax as an educational organization pursuant to c of the internal revenue code,which applies to among others 
corporations,and any foundation,organized and operated exclusively for educational purposes,no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual,no substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda,or otherwise attempting,to influence legislation and which does not participate in,or intervene in including the publishing or distributing of statements,any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office.
in the attention of the irs was drawn to judicial watch by a letter from a recipient of a judicial watch solicitation who questioned whether the organization is entitled to its tax exemption.in december a committee of three irs bureau chiefs reviewed information and documents regarding judicial watch status and approved an audit of its tax return.the irs did not notify judicial watch that it had been selected for an audit until october.
judicial watch principals immediately objected,both in writing and in meetings with irs officials,that the audit was an attempt by the clinton administration and irs commissioner charles rossotti to retaliate against the organization for having sued the irs on behalf of the western journalism center in.judicial watch also claimed the clinton administration and congressional democrats had pressured the irs to audit judicial watch in retaliation for its having alleged,in a report it sent to the congress in september,that president clinton had committed a host of impeachable offenses.
the irs brought judicial watch claims to the attention of the treasury inspector general for tax administration tigta,an independent investigative office within the department of the treasury.the tigta twice investigated whether the irs pursued the audit for political reasons.the first report september found the irs recommended select ing judicial watch for audit in december,that is,before it had sued the irs or filed its impeachment report,and concluded n o information was developed to support judicial watch claims.the second report october found no evidence to support judicial watch allegation of political intervention during the audit process.a report by the staff of the joint congressional committee on taxation covering the same period likewise found no credible evidence that the irs selected taxpayers for audits based on the views espoused by an organization or individuals related to the organization.joint committee on taxation,report of investigation of allegations relating to internal revenue service handling of organization matters,at,march.
in april the irs notified judicial watch it was proceeding with the audit,and over the next two years expanded the audit to cover tax years and to require additional documents.according to the irs,the audit now addresses whether judicial watch provides a private benefit either to larry klayman or to his law firm,larry klayman and associates is entitled to status either as a private foundation or as a public interest law firm and earns unrelated business income for which it must pay taxes.
late in the irs agreed to delay the audit until president clinton left office,in exchange for which judicial watch waived any potential statute of limitations defense.in january the irs informed judicial watch the audit is now continuing and asked judicial watch to produce certain documents.judicial watch again protested,however,and the irs again delayed the audit.in august the irs notified judicial watch it was examining the corporation tax returns and again requested documents.
in september judicial watch sued the irs in the united states district court for the district of maryland,seeking damages for constitutional violations allegedly committed by the irs in pursuing the audit and an injunction barring the irs from conducting the audit.see judicial watch,rossotti,d,aff,cir.the irs then served judicial watch with a summons pursuant to a,which authorizes the service to summon the person liable for tax to produce such books,papers,records,or other data,and to give such testimony,under oath,as may be relevant or material to such inquiry.judicial watch moved to enjoin or to stay enforcement of the summons,but the district court denied the motion and dismissed the case.see rossotti,d at injunctive relief barred by the act,damages barred by defendants qualified immunity.
in march the irs repaired to the united states district court for the district of columbia to enforce its summons.the district court ordered the irs to provide for the court review in camera all documents relating to its motivation and purpose for the audit.after a hearing at which it heard arguments regarding the purpose and the scope of the audit,and the necessity,if any,of further discovery,the district court ordered the irs to produce additional documents and certain affidavits for in camera review.
in december the district court enforced the summons with a modification the original request for all of judicial watch internal and external correspondence was narrowed to reach only correspondence that is not privileged,is relevant to the audit,and is described with reasonable particularity.see united states judicial watch,d.the district court concluded there is no evidence of political vindictiveness or a retaliatory motive,respondent constitutional challenges are without merit,and the summons as modified is not so overbroad as to be unlawful.id.at.
ii.analysis

judicial watch argues the district court should not have enforced the summons because the audit lacks any legitimate purpose.according to the taxpayer,the district court ignore d the wealth of competent evidence presented by judicial watch of an improper,political and retaliatory motive for the audit and summons.
we review the district court determination of whether the factual conditions for enforcement of a summons have been met for clear error.united states ins.consultants of knox,cir see mazurek united states,cir spell united states,cir.for the court to enforce the summons the government must have established a prima facie case by showing the investigation will be conducted pursuant to a legitimate purpose the inquiry may be relevant to the purpose the information sought is not already within the irs possession and in issuing the summons the administrative steps required by the tax code have been followed by the irs.united states powell,d.this initial burden,however,is a slight one,for the statute must be read broadly in order to ensure that the enforcement powers of the irs are not unduly restricted.united states kis,cir see alphin united states,cir burden is fairly slight because this is a summary proceeding.
the district court properly concluded that declarations in which the irs agents and officials responsible for the audit attest to each of the four elements of the prima facie case discharged the slight burden placed upon the irs.see kis,at no more than such affidavits are necessary t
