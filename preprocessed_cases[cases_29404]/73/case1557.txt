the narrow,but potentially recurring and important,question we address in these writ proceedings is whether the california constitution,as amended by the voters in,allows the legislature to identify blank bills with an assigned number but no substance spot bills in the budget bill,pass the budget,and thereafter add content to the placeholder and approve it by a majority vote as urgency legislation.cal,art.iv,subds.d e.we conclude that spot bills which remain empty of content at the time the budget is passed are not bills that can be identified within the meaning of article iv,section,subdivision e of the california constitution and enacted as urgency legislation by a mere majority vote.

discussion 
the legislature urges us to dismiss the writ proceedings as moot because the petition does not present a justiciable controversy.since it is now too late to grant petitioners the relief they seek,that is,the reordering of the ballot propositions on the november,ballots,the legislature concludes there is no likelihood the instant dispute will ever recur and we should dismiss the petition without reaching the merits of the constitutional challenge.the legislature fails to properly characterize the narrow,but dispositive,question before us.properly understood,the constitutional issue we resolve is one that is likely to recur yet evade review and is of continuing public interest.howard jarvis taxpayers bowen th,d howard jarvis i.we therefore exercise our discretion to address the constitutionality of assembly bill.
the issue is neither as broad as petitioners contend nor as narrow as the legislature asserts.petitio
