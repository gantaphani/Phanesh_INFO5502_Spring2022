alvin copeland and patty copeland,also known as patty white collectively,taxpayers appeal the tax court grant of partial summary judgment to the commissioner of internal revenue commissioner and the tax court denial of their motion for summary judgment.we conclude that the tax court properly denied the taxpayers deduction under for their initial investments in the partnerships,and therefore affirm that ruling.the tax court erred,however,in sustaining the commissioner imposition of the increased interest rate under c c.because no deduction was disallowed under,and because the commissioner proffered no alternative basis for imposing the c interest rate,the commissioner may not impose that rate.accordingly,we reverse the tax court ruling on the c interest rate,and remand for imposition of a judgment consistent with these rulings.
facts and proceedings 
the disputed tax items and interest charges derive from the following transactions in,taxpayers invested in garfield oil and gas associates garfield,a partnership,and in they invested in capricorn company capricorn,also a partnership.capricorn invested in another partnership,cardinal oil technology partners cardinal,after which garfield and cardinal together invested in enhanced oil recovery technology projects.from to,garfield and cardinal reported partnership tax items relating to the investments in the enhanced oil recovery technology projects,and allocated the tax items to the partners,including taxpayers.taxpayers filed joint tax returns for the tax years through,which returns included deductions allocated to the taxpayers from the garfield and capricorn partnerships.
in,the commissioner issued notices of deficiency to taxpayers,based on the commissioner disallowance of the partnership deductions on taxpayers returns.the notice of deficiency also imposed interest at of the usual rate on the taxpayers underpayment of tax attributable to the disallowed deductions,employing the secretary temporary regulations issued pursuant to the version of c.taxpayers petitioned the tax court for a redetermination of the deficiency that year,but,aside from two flurries of activity in which the parties entered their pleadings,stipulated issues,and made appearances in the tax court,there was no further action taken in the tax court until.
in the interim,the tax court decided krause commissioner of internal revenue a case involving various enhanced oil recovery technology partnerships which had engaged in activities and transactions substantially identical to those in which garfield and cardinal were involved following the tax court decision in krause,taxpayers paid the principal amount of the tax deficiency,but were allegedly unable to afford to pay the interest that had accumulated by that time.when the tax court activities in this case resumed in,the court issued an order requiring the parties to show cause why a decision in this case should not be entered in accordance with the court disposition of the issues in krause.that issue was not actually addressed at the hearing,however.instead,when the tax court learned that taxpayers were willing to settle the case by paying the standard interest not the c increased interest on the deficiency in a payment,the court adjourned the hearing with instructions to the taxpayers to make the settlement offer within days,and to the commissioner to file a status report with the court regarding settlement discussions within days.the tax court further instructed that if the parties should fail to reach a settlement,they should file a stipulation of facts the commissioner should file a motion for summary judgment within days after the status report was due and taxpayers should file a response to the commissioner motion within one month thereafter.
the parties did not reach a settlement agreement.in accordance with the tax court instructions,they filed a stipulation of facts,which included an affirmation that the factual findings and legal conclusions made in krause were incorporated by reference,except for the conclusion that c applies and except for any implication that the krause partnerships are partnerships for federal income tax purposes,notwithstanding that they lack profit objective within the meaning of.in particular,the parties agreed that the krause decision control led the tax treatment of the partnership tax items,as well as the additions to tax asserted in these cases.
the commissioner then filed a motion for partial summary judgment,arguing that the increased rate of interest under c was properly applied to taxpayers underpayment of tax,and that taxpayers were not entitled to deductions under for their initial cash investments in the garfield and cardinal partnerships.taxpayers filed their own motion for partial summary judgment,directly opposing both of the commissioner contentions.
in a memorandum opinion the tax court granted the commissioner motion and denied taxpayers,sustaining the imposition of the c interest rate on taxpayers underpayment of tax,and disallowing the deduction for their initial cash investments in the partnerships.the court entered a decision reflecting this ruling in october,from which taxpayers timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
the tax court determinations of example,interpretations of statutory reviewed de novo,while its factual findings are reviewed for clear error.
deduction for initial investment 
as the tax court observed in its memorandum opinion,after the krause case was decided,taxpayers concede d all of the originally claimed tax benefits relating to their investments in the partnerships,and sought a loss deduction only for the amount of cash they invested in the partnerships.in support of this deduction,they framed their argument to the tax court as follows 
unless there is a finding of fact that taxpayers investment in the partnerships lacked sufficient profit motive under irc,taxpayers are entitled to their investment under irc.taxpayers have conceded that if the partnerships were partnerships for federal income tax purposes,then taxpayers are not entitled to deductions,however,taxpayers argue that the partnerships are not partnerships for federal income tax purposes.emphasis added.
although taxpayers have not made the above concession so clear in their appellate briefs and oral arguments to us,they have premised their argument in favor of the deduction solely on the assertion that garfield and cardinal are not partnerships for federal income tax purposes.if an enterprise,such as garfield and cardinal,is formed without any profit motive,their reasoning runs,it can not be a partnership for federal income tax purposes and the activities of the partnership can not be imputed to the investors for purposes of determining the applicability of to the investors.in such cases,a determination of profit motive must be made at the individual investor level.although this argument is certainly creative,it is without merit.
section a defines what a partnership is for federal income tax purposes 
a partnership.for purposes of this subtitle,the term partnership includes a syndicate,group,pool,joint venture,or other unincorporated organization through or by means of which any business,financial operation,or venture is carried on,and which is not,within the meaning of this title,a corporation or a trust or estate 
in keeping with this definition,the tax court observed that the garfield and cardinal limited partnerships 
entered into transactions,formed joint ventures,operated gas wells,and engaged in various other activities.they carried on a financial operation or venture.they are to be treated as partnerships under section a even though the underlying activities of the partnerships lacked a profit objective under section.the garfield and cardinal limited partnerships each had the formal indicia of partnership status and conducted themselves generally as partnerships.they are to be treated as partnerships.
the parties stipulation that activities and transactions of the garfield and cardinal limited partnerships were not entered into with a profit objective does not affect the status of the partnerships as partnerships for federal income tax purposes 
we agree with the distinction presented by the tax court on this issue a court decision that a partnership activity lacks a profit objective is not equivalent to a holding that the investors intended to create an entity other than a partnership.even though the krause court determined that the activities engaged in by the partnerships lacked a profit objective,none can seriously contend that those who created these business entities did not intend to create entities by means of which a business,financial operation,or venture would be carried on.we reject taxpayers argument that is premised on the proposition that the determination that the partnership activities lacked profit objective stripped the partnerships themselves of partnership status for federal income tax purposes.accordingly,we affirm the tax court determination that the commissioner properly denied the taxpayers deductions for their initial investments in the partnerships.
c interest 
in,congress amended to provide for an increased rate of interest on substantial underpayments of tax attributable to transactions as amended by the tax reform act of,c,which is applicable for the tax years here in question,provided 
c interest on substantial underpayments attributable to tax motivated transactions.
in general.in the case of interest payable under section with respect to any substantial underpayment attributable to tax motivated transactions,the rate of interest established under this section shall be percent of the underpayment rate established under this section.
substantial underpayment attributable to tax motivated transactions.for purposes of this subsection,the term substantial underpayment attributable to tax motivated transactions means any underpayment of taxes imposed by subtitle a for any taxable year which is attributable to or more tax motivated transactions if the amount of the underpayment for such year so attributable exceeds.
tax motivated transactions.
a in general.for purposes of this subsection,the term tax motivated transaction means 
i any valuation overstatement within the meaning of section c,
ii any loss disallowed by reason of section a and any credit disallowed under section c,
iii any straddle as defined in section c without regard to subsections d and e of section,
iv any use of an accounting method specified in regulations prescribed by the secretary as a use which may result in a substantial distortion of income for any period,and 
v any sham or fraudulent transaction.
b regulatory authority.the secretary may by regulations specify other types of transactions which will be treated as tax motivated for purposes of this subsection and may by regulations provide that specified transactions being treated as tax motivated will no longer be so treated emphasis added.
the secretary exercised the authority granted in c b,and enacted temporary regulation ttr,which provides,in relevant part 
what is a tax motivated underpayment 
a tax motivated underpayment is the portion of a deficiency as defined in section of tax imposed by subtitle a income taxes that is attributable to any of the following tax motivated transactions 
a valuation overstatement within the meaning of section c 
any deduction disallowed with respect to any other tax motivated transactions see of this section.
are any transactions other than those specified in of this section and those involving the use of accounting methods under circumstances specified in of this section considered tax motivated transactions under of this section 
yes.deductions disallowed under the following provisions are considered to be attributable to tax motivated transactions 
any deduction disallowed for any period under section,relating to an activity engaged in by an individual or an s corporation that is not engaged in for profit 
to summarize the foregoing,c authorized the imposition of of the usual interest rate on underpayments of tax in excess of,but only if they were attributable to tax motivated transactions as defined either in c a or in the regulations enacted by the secretary pursuant to c b.exercising this authority,the secretary added a sixth category of tax motivated transactions to the five specified by the congress in c a by promulgating ttr any deduction disallowed for any period under section,relating to an activity engaged in by an individual or an s corporation that is not engaged in for profit.
as a threshold matter,taxpayers argue that the commissioner abused his discretion by imposing the tax from the date the payment was due,instead of giving them the opportunity to resolve this matter without payment of interest at the penalty increased rate.at oral argument,they asked specifically that we reverse the tax court decision and render judgment in their favor as to the interest that accrued between the due date of the relevant tax returns and the notice of deficiency.in support of this request,they argue that the legislative history of c shows that the section was intended to serve as a tool for managing the tax court docket,by providing incentive for taxpayers to concede to the commissioner assessment of tax deficiencies without resorting to litigation.instead of furthering the legislative intent,taxpayers argue,the commissioner imposition of the c rate,of which they learned only when they received the notice of deficiency,amounted to a penalty.as noted above c expressly applies to interest accruing after december,even if the offending transaction was entered into before the date of its enactment.according to taxpayers,the commissioner penalizing imposition of c interest is therefore particularly unfair on these facts,because their investment in the partnerships,which is the only transaction for which this penalty could serve any deterrent purpose,the enactment of c.
we are not persuaded by taxpayers arguments on this point.if c is applicable at all to taxpayers underpayment,it is applicable from the due date of the tax that they have been determined to owe.the initial language of c references interest payable under section,in turn,states 
interest on underpayment,nonpayment,or extensions of time for payment,of tax.
a general rule.if any amount of tax imposed by this title whether required to be shown on a return,or to be paid by stamp or by some other method is not paid on or before the last date prescribed for payment,interest on such amount at the underpayment rate established under section shall be paid for the period from such last date to the date paid 
the application of this provision is mechanical,and we find no abuse of discretion by the commissioner in calculating the interest from the date that taxpayers tax deficiency was due.
neither are we persuaded by taxpayers invocation of the legislative intent of c.in combination,c and are unambiguous,requiring the imposition of interest starting from the last such date of the period for which the unpaid tax was due.as the commissioner emphasizes,in the absence of ambiguity,we are not to look beyond the plain wording of the statute or regulation to divine legislative intent 
the larger question presented here is the propriety of imposing the c interest rate on taxpayers underpayment at all.in contesting the imposition of that rate,taxpayers argue that the tax court erred in failing to analyze whether they,the taxpayers,had a profit motive when they invested in the subject partnerships.our close analysis of this argument leads us to conclude that indeed it was error,on these facts,to impose the c interest rate at all,irrespective of the individual partners profit motive,because there was no deduction disallowed under,as ttr pellucidly requires.we therefore reverse the tax court ruling and hold that the c interest rate is inapplicable to taxpayers underpayment of tax 
to repeat,c interest may be imposed only when there is a substantial underpayment of tax that is attributable to a tax motivated transaction as defined either in c a or in the regulations enacted by the secretary pursuant to c b.as any underpayment of or more is deemed substantial,that element of the section is not at issue.and,the commissioner does not contend that any of the definitional categories of tax motivated transaction listed under c a apply.rather,the only kind of tax motivated transaction that is proffered by the commissioner is the one found in ttr,
deductions disallowed under the following provisions are considered to be attributable to tax motivated transactions 
any deduction disallowed for any period under section,relating to an activity engaged in by an individual or an s corporation that is not engaged in for profit.emphasis added.
the commissioner maintains that because the tax court determined that the partnerships in which taxpayers invested lacked a profit motive under,the requirements of ttr were met,and it was proper to impose the c interest rate.this application of ttr,which was adopted by the tax court and blessed by the ninth and tenth circuits,impermissibly broadens the reach of this penalty.
examination of the plain language of ttr establishes that the essential elements of the type of tax motivated transaction defined by that regulation are as follows there must be a deduction that is disallowed under,that is related to an activity engaged in by an individual or an s corporation,and that is not engaged in for profit.despite this clear and unambiguous regulatory mandate,however,the commissioner appellate brief asserts that,p ursuant to the secretary statutory grant of authority,the treasury regulations under c adopt the profit motive test of as a litmus test for tax motivated transactions.similarly,the tax court,in its memorandum opinion,quoted hildebrand commissioner of internal revenue as it insisted 
section c imposes an increased rate of interest on any substantial underpayment attributable to tax motivated transactions,which include activities not engaged in for profit 
these statements are both imprecise and flatly incorrect.the ttr definition indisputably requires that a deduction be disallowed under before the increased penalty may be imposed,not that an activity be determined to lack profit motive under the factors of.being disallowed under is not congruent with being found the factors set forth in.indeed,the taxpayers deductions were not disallowed under but were,as the commissioner notes,purportedly found to be lacking in profit motive under the factors set forth in the regulations that accompany.more importantly,even if the commissioner had wanted to disallow the taxpayers deductions under for purposes of ttr,he could not have done so 
activities not engaged in for profit.
a general rule.in the case of an activity engaged in by an individual or an s corporation,if such activity is not engaged in for profit,no deduction attributable to such activity shall be allowed under this chapter except as provided in this section 
the plain language of the statute thus explicitly cabins its applicability to activities engaged in by individuals or s,by virtue of the traditional maxim of statutory construction,expressio unis est exclusio alterius the expression of one thing is the exclusion of others,precludes the section applicability to partnerships.yet the only parties that engaged in an activity for other than profit were the two partnerships no individual and no s corporation engaged in any activity here,with or without a profit motive.
the commissioner nevertheless relies on the fact that the tax court in krause sustained the commissioner disallowance of deductions under section.the deduction having been disallowed under section,argues the commissioner,leads inexorably to the conclusion that the c increased interest rate applies.we disagree with the commissioner basic premise that these deductions were disallowed under.
in krause,the tax court engaged in an analysis of whether the deductions at issue met the requirements of and those two sections provide,in relevant part 
trade or business expenses.
a in general.there shall be allowed as a deduction all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business 
research and experimental expenditures.
a treatment as expenses.in general.a taxpayer may treat research or experimental expenditures which are paid or incurred by him during the taxable year in connection with his trade or business as expenses which are not chargeable to capital account.the expenditures so treated shall be allowed as a deduction 
both statutes require that the expense be paid or incurred in connection with a trade or business before the deduction is allowed.it is that the determination whether an undertaking qualifies as a trade or business involves an inquiry into profit motive 
congress allows deductions under for expenses of carrying on activities that constitute a taxpayer trade or business,or under for research and development expenses in connection with a trade or business expenditures may only be deducted under sections and if the facts and circumstances indicate that the taxpayer made them primarily in furtherance of a bona fide profit objective independent of tax consequences 
it is equally accepted that in the partnership context,the profit motive inquiry focuses on the partnership,not the individual partners and that the factors in the treasury regulations to for determining whether an activity is engaged in for profit may be employed to determine the profit motive required by sections and exists it bears emphasizing,however,that the factors from are only tools for determining the requisite profit objective under and deductions for partnership expenses are not allowed or disallowed directly under itself.
despite this truism,however,the tax court in krause,after employing the factors from the regulations under in its analysis of the deductions claimed under and,concluded 
in summary,presented to us in this case is a chain or multilayered series of obligations,stacked or multiplied on top of each other via the numerous partnerships to produce debt obligations in staggering dollar amounts,using a largely undeveloped and untested product,in a highly risky,very speculative,and length manner in an attempt to generate significant tax deductions for investors.the transactions did not,and do not,constitute legitimate business transactions.
losses of the partnerships are disallowed under section 
the tax court wording to the contrary notwithstanding,however,the deductions were not actually disallowed under,but under and,neither of which are is activities engaged in by individuals and s corporations,to the exclusion of partnerships provided the krause court with only the factors for analysis,not statutory authority to allow or disallow deductions themselves.to say that the deductions are disallowed under section impermissibly conflates the sections in question and thereby glosses over this crucial distinction.
the tax court again endorsed this gloss,however,when it considered the instant case.adopting the rationale offered by the ninth circuit the tax court stated,
t he secretary has authority to define certain transactions as tax motivated,the secretary has defined transactions lacking a profit motive under section as tax motivated,the transactions in this case lack a profit motive under section,petitioners activities relating to these transactions are therefore tax motivated 
that,of course,is not what ttr states.again,that regulation designates as tax motivated a ny deduction disallowed for any period under section,relating to an activity engaged in by an individual or an s corporation that is not engaged in for profit and,again,the deductions disallowed in krause which ruling was stipulated to apply here were disallowed under and,employing only the profit objective factors in the treasury regulations accompanying.the ninth circuit and tax court pronouncements that transactions lacking a profit motive under section constitute tax motivated transactions under c impermissibly broadens the reach of this punitive interest provision.the definition of a tax motivated transaction found in ttr ineluctably requires that the underpayment of tax be attributable to deduction disallowed under,and such a disallowance simply did not take place in the instant could it have.
as the
