between and,of the internal revenue provided tax relief by permitting taxpayers subject to the alternative minimum tax amt to offset up to of their taxable income with net operating losses nols to qualify for this relief,nols had to be carryovers to the or tax years,or carried back from the or years to a prior tax year.the plain meaning of the term carryovers prevents taxpayers from using nols that are carried back to or to from a later tax year to take advantage of the relief rule.therefore,we affirm the tax court assessment of a deficiency,because metro one telecommunications may not take advantage of the relief rule with nols it carried back from the and tax years to.
metro one telecommunications was a company based in beaverton,oregon that operated call centers throughout the united states.in this case,metro disputes the determination of a deficiency by the commissioner of the internal revenue service based on metro use of nols accumulated in and to completely offset its taxable income.
for the tax year,metro was subject to the amt in,metro claimed a refund for by offsetting of its taxable income with nols that it had accumulated in and.in response,the commissioner sent metro a notice of deficiency in the amount of.metro then filed a petition with the united states tax court.agreeing with the commissioner,the court imposed the amount of the deficiency metro then appealed.

iii.analysis 
background 
we determine here whether a taxpayer,subject to the amt in may under the applicable version of the code reduce its income tax liability by claiming a deduction for nols that arose in later years.section of the code permits taxpayers to deduct nols from taxable income as a net operating loss deduction nold.a.a net operating loss arises in a given tax year,if the sum of the taxpayer deductions in that year exceeds the amount of the taxpayer taxable income.c.further,permits taxpayers to apply nols that arise in a given tax year as deductions in other tax years.see b a.relevant here,b a specifies that 
a net operating loss for any taxable year 
i shall be a net operating loss carryback to each of the taxable years preceding the taxable year of such loss,and 
ii shall be a net operating loss carryover to each of the taxable years following the taxable year of the loss.
according to this paragraph,a carryback is any nol that is carried to one of the years preceding the tax year in which the loss arises.conversely,a carryover sometimes called a carryforward is any nol that is carried to one of the years following the taxable year in which the loss arises.for a given tax year,the amount of the nold is the sum of the amount of nol carrybacks plus the amount of nol carryovers that are carried to that year.a.
if a taxpayer is subject to the amt,the taxpayer must claim an alternative tax net operating loss deduction atnold instead of the nold permitted by.a.under the tax relief act of d defined atnold as 
the net operating loss deduction allowable for the taxable year under section,except that 
a the amount of such deduction shall not exceed the sum of 
i the lesser of 
i the amount of such deduction attributable to net operating losses other than the deduction described in clause ii i,or 
ii percent of alternative minimum taxable income determined without regard to such deduction,plus 
ii the lesser of 
i the amount of such deduction attributable to the sum of carrybacks of net operating losses from taxable years ending during or and carryovers of net operating losses to taxable years ending during and 
job creation and worker assistance act of,c hereinafter jobs act of,as amended by working families tax relief act of,b hereinafter tax relief act of emphasis added.this section limits the amount of the atnold that can be claimed by a taxpayer who is subject to the amt.in general,this limit is of the taxpayer alternative minimum taxable income amti,or the amount of nols,whichever is lesser.id.d a i.on the other hand,under the relief rule,there is no limit up to the amount of taxable income on the amount of the atnold that a taxpayer can claim in a given taxable year,if those nols are carried from or to an earlier tax year carrybacks,or to or from an earlier tax year carryovers.id.d a ii.
ultimately,we address here whether the term carryovers of net operating losses in the relief rule includes both nols that are carried to a later tax year carryforwards and nols that are carried to a preceding tax year carrybacks,or only carryforwards.metro argues that carryovers means both carryforwards and carrybacks,and therefore it was entitled to use nols from and as carrybacks to offset of its taxable income in.the commissioner disagrees,arguing that,as used in the relief rule,carryovers is a synonym for carryforwards,so the amount of the atnold attributable to nols that metro carried back from and was,like any other nol carried under,limited to of metro amti.
thus,under the commissioner interpretation,metro would be able to carry back only of its nols to.that amount would increase to under metro interpretation of the relief rule,because the atnold would not be limited to of metro amti.therefore,if metro is correct,it would be able to claim an additional atnold against its amti,reducing its taxable income for that year to.however,the plain meaning of carryovers indicates that the relief rule does not apply to nols that are carried back under these circumstances.we therefore affirm the tax court.
b.the plain meaning of carryovers refers only to items that are carried from an earlier period to a later one.
when interpreting a statute,we must start with the language of the statute.williams taylor,d.moreover,i n the absence of an indication to the contrary,words in a statute are assumed to bear their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.walters metro.educ,d internal quotation marks omitted.
the term carryovers ordinarily and commonly refers only to something that is carried from an earlier period to a later one only to carryforwards.to ascertain the plain meaning of terms,we may consult the definitions of those terms in popular dictionaries.af cap,chevron overseas congo,when determining the plain meaning of language,we may consult dictionary definitions.black law dictionary defines a carryover as a n deduction esp.for a net operating loss that may be taken in a later period black law dictionary ed electrolux holding,united states,n defining carryovers in by reference to black.likewise,webster third new international dictionary contains multiple definitions of carry over,all of which suggest movement from one period of time to a later period of time.webster third new international dictionary,to hold over for another season.courts also commonly employ carryovers for this meaning,kansas colorado,d in re grand jury subpoenas duces tecum,cir united states gregory,cir of these,were new hires and the remaining were carryovers from the previous administration.hoots pennsylvania,cir.none of these definitions or usages suggest that the ordinary meaning of carryover encompasses movement from a point in time backward to an earlier point in time.therefore,according to the plain meaning of carryovers,the relief rule does not apply to carrybacks of nols.
it becomes even more clear that congress used carryovers in the relief rule as a synonym for carryforwards after considering the relationship between and.see samantar yousuf,d w e do not construe statutory phrases in isolation we read statutes as a whole.quoting united states morton,d.section is closely related to,because define s atnol by expressly incorporating the definition of regular nol in and then enumerating specific exceptions kadillak comm r,cir.accordingly,defines nol as the sum of two parts the carrybacks to that year of nols and the carryovers to that year of nols.a.paralleling,the relief rule addresses each component of the nold the amount of the nold attributable to the sum of carrybacks of net operating losses from taxable years ending during or is not subject to the limit typically imposed on nol carrybacks.d a ii i emphasis added.likewise,the amount of the nold attributable to carryovers of net operating losses to taxable years ending during and is also not subject to that limit.id.emphasis added.because congress used carryovers in the relief rule to refer to the part of the nold computed under with the same label,it intended the words to have the same meaning.
additionally,we note that congress could have easily and clearly extended the benefit of the relief rule to taxpayers like metro who carried back nols from tax years after,without using carryovers contrary to its plain meaning.inserting the words to or into the phrase carrybacks of net operating losses from taxable years ending during or would have this effect.the resulting phrase would read carrybacks of net operating losses to or from taxable years ending during or.however,congress elected not to insert those words into the text of the statute.if congress did intend to extend the relief rule to nols that a taxpayer carried back from tax years later than,it would be odd to do it by using the word carryovers contrary to its plain meaning,when simply adding two words would have produced the same effect with more clarity.
we understand that congress has used the term carryovers in other parts of the tax code to refer to both carryforwards and carrybacks.however,that fact does not suggest that carryovers must have a meaning in the relief rule.such uses only indicate that congress sometimes uses carryovers in an way the varied uses of the term carryovers in the code also explain why we can not,here,assume that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.sorenson sec y of treasury of united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.clearly,congress intended to use carryovers in some provisions of the code to mean both carryforwards and carrybacks,and in other provisions,to mean only carryforwards.therefore,we can not adopt a uniform definition of the term carryovers applicable to every usage of the term in the code.rather,we only confirm that,in the relief rule,carryovers means carryforwards.
metro argues that we should reject the plain meaning of carryovers and instead follow the canon that where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.united states wahid,cir.however,where the plain meaning rule has provided a clear answer,we do not need to look to other canons of statutory construction.see united states harrell,cir quoting hughes aircraft jacobsen,d.nevertheless,metro also argues that our exclusive reliance on the plain meaning of the statute text,rather than other canons of construction,may unnecessarily establish precedent regarding the relative weight given to competing canons.this concern is moot.it is already that,in the realm of the canons of statutory construction,the plain meaning rule is preeminent.see mcdonald sun oil,cir.therefore,regardless of what other canons of statutory construction might suggest,under the plain meaning of the text,carryovers in the relief rule means carryforwards.
relying on benton commissioner,wl,metro also argues that we should abandon the plain meaning of carryovers,and instead define the term according to its purpose.however,the benton court implicit construction of the term carryovers in to include carrybacks does not change our conclusion.section imposes conditions on the use of nols in and after a chapter or chapter bankruptcy case.a benton,at.under g,the bankruptcy estate succeeds to the debtor net operating loss carryovers determined under section upon the commencement of a bankruptcy case.after the case terminates,the debtor then succeeds to the tax aspects of the estate including nols specified in g,but taking into account that the transfer is from the estate to the debtor instead of from the debtor to the estate.i.
based on these provisions,the tax court in benton concluded that the losses succeeded to by the debtor from the estate may be used,to the extent permitted in section benton,at.because provides for nols to be carried back,the court conclusion implies that the debtor could carry back nols that he inherited under i.necessarily,this means that the tax court read the term carryovers in g which defines the tax attributes that the debtor succeeds to as including nol carrybacks.
the tax court implicit interpretation of g in benton does not undermine our conclusion that congress used carryovers according to its ordinary meaning in the relief rule.assuming that the tax court analysis is correct,we can accept that is another instance in the code where congress used carryovers to refer to both carryforwards and carrybacks at the same time,we recognize that the plain meaning of carryovers could not be applied to g for reasons that do not prevent its application in the relief rule.if carryovers in g meant only carryforwards,then j b,which prohibits a debtor from offsetting income by carrying back nols it inherits from the bankruptcy estate,would serve no purpose.section g would already effectively bar any nols from being carried back,because the debtor would not inherit them from the bankruptcy estate.thus,the plain meaning of the term carryovers could not apply in g without rendering j b meaningless or superfluous.united states cabaccang,cir.the relief rule does not present the same structural problem.therefore,at most,benton confirms that the term carryovers is not always used according to its ordinary meaning the case does not suggest,however,that congress used carryovers in the relief rule to mean something other than its plain meaning.
legislative history confirms that congress intended carryovers in to have its plain meaning.
the plain meaning also does not produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of the rule drafters.united states ron pair,d see also albertson,comm r,cir.although legislative history can be read as an expression of the intention of the legislature,it is certainly not the best expression.see lyons mendez,cir t he text of the statute is the best expression of the intent of congress.rather,it is often murky,ambiguous,and contradictory.gonzalez arizona,cir rawlinson,concurring in part and dissenting in part quoting exxon mobil allapattah,d,cert.granted sub nom.arizona inter tribal council of arizona,d.
here,congress has given us very little legislative history to go on 
the september,attacks have caused adverse effects to the economy.thousands of americans have lost jobs.consumer confidence and investor confidence are low.the committee believes that it is necessary to spur economic growth and job creation and help struggling businesses and unemployed workers.the provisions approved by the committee will stimulate and strengthen the economy.
at.parsing the general language in this passage,congress apparently enacted the relief rule among other legislation to stimulate and strengthen the economy in response to the economic downturn that followed the terrorist attacks of september.specifically,congress sought to strengthen the economy by spur ring economic growth and job creation and help ing struggling businesses and unemployed workers.temporally,congress was apparently targeting an immediate problem,because it employed the past tense to describe the source of economic downturn the terrorist attacks have affected the united states in numerous ways.in addition to the lives lost,the september,attacks have caused adverse effects to the economy,at emphasis added.thus,congress enacted the relief rule to address an economic slowdown that existed at the time of its enactment.
consistent with this understanding of congress intent,the original relief rule would have had its primary economic effect in and by providing businesses with extra cash as a result of refunds and deductions generated during the and tax years.originally,the relief rule only applied to carrybacks of net operating losses for taxable years ending during or and carryforwards of net operating losses to taxable
