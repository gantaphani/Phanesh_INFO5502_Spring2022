introduction 
appellants are the operators of nine hotels in the city of santa cruz city.appellants challenge the superior court orders directing them to comply with subpoenas issued by city pursuant to government code section et,requiring the production of records necessary for a tax compliance audit.the tax in question is city transient occupancy tax,a percent tax upon stays of days or less at hotels,motels,and like accommodations within the city.santa cruz,et scmc.appellants contend that they should not be required to produce the records because the ordinance is unconstitutional and because the subpoenas are invalid.we reject the arguments and affirm the orders.
ii.factual and procedural background 
city enacted the uniform transient occupancy tax ordinance ordinance in.pursuant to the ordinance,the hotel operator collects the tax from the hotel guest and remits the tax to city on or about february,city finance director notified hotel operators that city would be conducting an audit to determine the operators compliance with the ordinance.such audits are permitted by scmc section,which provides that hotel operators must keep records pertaining to the tax for a period of three years and that the director of finance shall have the right to inspect such records at all reasonable times.
appellants refused to permit the audit.city,therefore,issued legislative subpoenas pursuant to government code section,directing appellants,as the custodians of records of their respective hotels,to produce specified documents pertaining to collection of the tax.appellants still refused to comply.city then asked the superior court to issue an attachment or,in the alternative,for orders directing appellants to show cause why they should not comply with the subpoenas.the trial court issued orders to show cause and appellants responded by arguing that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and a violation of equal protection.appellants also argued that the subpoenas were unlawful because they were not issued based upon probable cause to believe a crime had been committed and that they did not fall within any exceptions to that requirement.the trial court rejected the arguments and ordered appellants to comply with the subpoenas.these appeals followed.since the issues in each appeal are identical,we have ordered the appeals considered together for purposes of briefing,oral argument,and decision 
iii.appealability 
introduction 
before proceeding to the substance of the dispute we must decide whether the superior court orders are appealable.we conclude that they are.
government code section authorizes the legislative body of a city to issue subpoenas requiring attendance of witnesses or production of books or other documents for evidence or testimony in any action or proceeding pending before it.in the event a witness refuses to comply with the subpoena,the mayor may report that fact to the judge of the superior court.the judge shall issue an attachment directed to the sheriff of the county where the witness was required to appear,commanding him to attach the person,and forthwith bring him before the judge.on return of the attachment and production of the witness,the judge has jurisdiction.refusal to comply with a subpoena could subject the witness to contempt proceedings.in that event,the witness has the same rights he or she would have in a civil trial to purge himself or herself of the contempt.
city issued the subpoenas and obtained enforcement orders according to the foregoing statutory scheme.appellants claim that the compliance orders are appealable.city does not dispute that claim.there is no case directly holding that these compliance orders are appealable.because there is a split of authority on the point as it relates to orders compelling compliance with administrative subpoenas,et,we consider the issue in some detail.
there is no constitutional right to an appeal the right to appeal is wholly statutory.trede superior court cal d.code of civil procedure section lists the types of rulings that are appealable in this state.a judgment,other than an interlocutory judgment,is appealable.code civ,subd.a.other specified orders are also appealable.an order compelling compliance with subpoenas issued under government code section et is not one of them.nor are we aware of any case specifically considering the appealability of such orders.city of vacaville pitamber th,d vacaville was an appeal from such an order,but vacaville did not consider appealability,apparently assuming the order was appealable.the cases differ on the question of whether an analogous order compelling compliance with an administrative subpoena,et is appealable.
in millan restaurant enterprises group,th,d millan,the fourth district court of appeal held that an order compelling compliance with an administrative subpoena issued pursuant to government code section is appealable as a final judgment in a special proceeding.in so holding,millan primarily relied upon the fact that many cases,including cases from the supreme court,had considered appeals from such orders without addressing the appealability issue,citing younger jensen cal d,board of medical quality assurance gherardini d.fielder berkeley properties d.see also arnett dal cielo cal th,d.of course,a case is not authority for an issue it has not considered.people toro cal d,fn.
millan also cited as a basis for its holding wood superior court d.millan,supra,th at,d.wood provides no independent analysis but simply relies upon the observation in franchise tax board barnhart d,that a n order made under the authority of government code sections can be viewed as a final judgment in a special proceeding,appealable unless the statute creating the special proceeding prohibits such appeal.
a line of cases from the second district court of appeal holds that compliance orders made under government code sections through are not appealable.barnes molino d.order is not a final determination of parties rights and does not fit description of appealable orders listed in code civ,people ex rel.franchise tax bd.superior court d.following barnes accord,bishop merging capital,th,d bishop.bishop was of the view that,when a witness is ordered to comply with an administrative subpoena issued under government code section et,the witness is not aggrieved until he or she has disobeyed the order and been found in contempt.prior to that,any ruling the appellate court could make would be purely advisory.that is to say,if we were to rule in favor of the respondent,we would simply be advising the appellants that,if the respondent pursues contempt proceedings,and the trial court finds appellants in contempt,we will uphold that ruling on appeal.similarly,our decision in favor of appellants would amount to no more than our advice to the respondent that contempt proceedings will ultimately prove fruitless.bishop,supra,th at,d.the appellate court did not consider the order to be a judgment because,under its analysis,the order was not final.
the orders before us compel compliance with legislative subpoenas issued pursuant to government code section et.as to these,we believe the better view is that the orders are appealable as final judgments.a judgment is the final determination of the rights of the parties in an action or proceeding.code civ.the statutory scheme at hand provides for an original proceeding in the superior court,initiated by the mayor report to the judge,which results in an order directing the respondent to comply with a city subpoena.indeed,the compliance order is tantamount to a superior court judgment in mandamus,which,with limited statutory exceptions,is appealable,subd.a agricultural labor relations bd.land management,cal d.whether the matter is properly characterized as an action code civ,or a special proceeding,it is a final determination of the rights of the parties.it is final because it leaves nothing for further determination between the parties except the fact of compliance or noncompliance with its terms.agricultural labor relations bd.land management,supra,cal d at.
the fact that an intransigent witness may be subject to a contempt order does not mean that the order compelling compliance is not final.the normal rule is that injunctions and final judgments which form the basis for contempt sanctions are appealable the purpose of any judicial order which commands or prohibits specific conduct is to make the sanction of contempt available for disobedience.as we have noted,this fact does not render such an order nonfinal,and thus nonappealable.agricultural labor relations bd.land management,supra,cal d at.indeed,the contempt judgment is not appealable.code civ,subd.a.it must be reviewed,if at all,by writ.davidson superior court th,d.therefore,review of the underlying order can reliably be had only if that order is appealable.
the superior court order determined all of the parties rights and liabilities at issue in the proceedings the only determination left was the question of future compliance,which is present in every judgment.agricultural labor relations bd.land management,d.we conclude that the orders herein must be deemed final judgments and are,therefore,appealable pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.
iv.discussion 
standard of review 
appellants renew the arguments they made below,that the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague and a violation of equal protection and that the subpoenas were unlawful.there are no factual issues.the issues are purely legal.accordingly,we apply the de novo standard of review.ghirardo antonioli cal th,d.
due process 
introduction 
appellants argue that the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague in violation of the due process clause of the united states constitution,amends.v,xiv.an enactment may be declared unconstitutionally vague if it fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits or if it authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.hill colorado,d chicago morales,d people castenada cal th,d.a tax law in particular must prescribe a standard sufficiently definite to be understandable to the average person who desires to comply with it.citation.state bd.of equalization wirick th,d.patel city of gilroy th,d gilroy.
an ordinance is presumed to be valid and must be upheld unless its unconstitutionality clearly,positively and unmistakably appears.hale morgan cal d,tobe city of santa ana cal th at,d,voters for responsible retirement board of supervisors cal th,d.furthermore,even when criminal penalties apply,a statute or ordinance will be upheld against a vagueness challenge if any reasonable and practical construction can be given its language.state bd.of equalization wirick,supra,th at,d people townsend th,d people ex rel.gallo acuna cal th,d.gilroy,supra,th at,d.
appellants argue that this case should be controlled by city of san bernardino city of san bernardino th,d san bernardino and britt city of pomona d.pomona,both of which found a transient occupancy tax to be unconstitutionally vague.the argument is unavailing for the simple reason that the present enactment is different from the enactments in san bernardino and pomona.
discussion 
the pertinent ordinance provisions are as follows 
for the privilege of occupancy in any hotel,each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in an amount of nine and percent of the rent charged by the operator.effective october,such tax shall be at the rate of ten percent of the rent charged by the operator.the tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment by the operator to the city.the transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid.if the rent is paid in installments,a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment.the unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient ceasing to occupy space in the hotel.if for any reason the tax is not paid to the operator of the hotel,the director of finance may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the director of finance.scmc.
hotel is defined as any structure,or any portion of any structure,which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling,lodging or sleeping purposes,and includes any hotel,inn,tourist home or house,motel,studio hotel,bachelor hotel,lodging house,rooming house,dormitory,public or private club,mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location,or other similar structure or portion thereof,wherein overnight accommodations are offered for hire,or wherein living accommodations for periods of less than thirty days are customarily offered for hire.scmc.
transient is defined as any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession,permit,right of access,license or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less,counting portions of calendar days as full days.any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has expired a person is not a transient within the meaning of this chapter if a rent has been paid in advance for a period of thirty days or more and b neither the occupant,nor the operator may terminate the tenancy in less than thirty days.scmc.
in san bernardino,the ordinance defined hotel as any structure designed for occupancy by transients for lodging or sleeping purposes,and includes any hotel for occupancy on a transient basis for a period of thirty days or less.san bernardino,supra,th at,d.transient was defined as any person who exercises occupancy for a period of ninety consecutive calendar days or less and any person who so occupies premises intended for transient occupancy on a temporary basis for more than ninety days without contracting for occupancy on a permanent basis.id.at,d.there were other,even more confusing,provisions,but this small sample amply shows how the san bernardino ordinance was unacceptably vague.the definition of hotel used a limit,while the definition of transient used a limit and at the same time provided that transient could also apply to persons who stay in a hotel for more than days if they had not contracted for occupancy on a permanent basis.further provisions suggested that a permanent basis could be any period of time so long as the period was specified in a written agreement.id.at,d.
the ordinance at issue in pomona defined transient as one who occupies a hotel and hotel as a structure which is occupied or intended to be occupied by transients.pomona,supra,d at.this circular definition was complicated by the definitions of hotel and occupancy,which included the word dwelling.ibid.the appellate court noted that dwelling implied something more permanent than transient occupancy.since there was no separate definition for transient,the ordinance seemed to apply to both transients and persons in residence.ibid.
one of the problems appellants see with city ordinance is that it,too,uses the word dwelling as well as the word lodging,both of which imply permanent residency.but these words in the ordinance do not raise the confusion that concerned the pomona court.as appellants point out,the problem with the san bernardino and pomona ordinances was that what was supposed to be a transient occupancy tax appeared to apply even in some genuinely permanent residency situations.here,the ordinance defines hotel as a structure wherein overnight accommodations are offered for hire,or wherein living accommodations for periods of less than thirty days are customarily offered for hire.scmc.it defines transient as any person who occupies a hotel for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less.there is no internal conflict.the tax plainly applies only to temporary occupancy situations.
the language of the ordinance is very similar to that considered in gilroy,supra,th,d,which this court held was not unconstitutionally vague.the gilroy ordinance defined hotel as any structure occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling,lodging or sleeping purposes,and includes any hotel.id.at,d.transient meant any person who exercises occupancy for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy.ibid.
appellants seek to distinguish gilroy by arguing that gilroy relied heavily upon the fact that the ordinance allowed a resident to avoid paying the tax for the first days of residency if he or she had a written agreement for a longer occupancy.this is a misreading of gilroy.
the appellant in gilroy made the same arguments appellants make in this case.this court responded it is true that the definitions of hotel and occupancy refer to dwelling as well as lodging or sleeping purposes,but the tax applies solely to those who occupy a hotel for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less.there is no confusing period as in san bernardino the hotel guest is invariably deemed to be a transient until the first days have passed,even if he or she appears to be dwelling in the hotel for that period.that the provision may require tax on a tenant rent for the first days does not make it impermissibly vague.furthermore,a written agreement providing for a longer occupancy will remove the rental arrangement from the reach of the ordinance.this exemption provision is not as ambiguous as that of the san bernardino ordinance,which inadequately defined permanent as well as agreement in writing in the context of the convoluted definition of transient.gilroy,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.as this passage reveals,the inclusion of the written agreement exemption in the gilroy ordinance was not the reason this court found the ordinance was constitutional.rather,it was constitutional because,measured by common understanding and experience,the language sufficiently specified the taxable circumstances.ibid.
appellants also contend that the ordinance is confusing because it exempts from taxation an occupancy in which the person pays rent in advance and n either the occupant,nor the operator may terminate the tenancy in less than thirty days.according to appellants,since transience is elsewhere defined as days or less,this provision seems to exempt persons who would otherwise be considered transients since the occupancy may be terminated in days.as this court remarked in gilroy,many,probably most,statutes are ambiguous in some respects and instances invariably arise under which the application of statutory language may be unclear.so long as a statute does not threaten to infringe on the exercise of first amendment or other constitutional rights,however,such ambiguities,even if numerous,do not justify the invalidation of a statute on its face.gilroy,supra,th at,d,quoting evangelatos superior court cal d.measured by common understanding and experience,the ordinance clearly describes the circumstances in which it applies.it is not unconstitutionally vague.
equal protection 
appellants contend that the transient occupancy tax violates the equal protection clause of the united states constitution.principles of equal protection require that persons who are similarly situated receive like treatment under the law and that statutes may single out a class for distinctive treatment only if that classification bears a rational relationship to the purposes of the statute.thus,if a law provides that one subclass receives different treatment from another class,it is not enough that persons within that subclass be treated the same.rather,there must be some rationality in the separation of the classes.city of pomona,supra,d at.kumar superior court th,d kumar.
in considering whether a tax is consistent with equal protection principles,courts will look for a rational basis for the class of persons selected to pay the tax.additionally,the classification must bear a reasonable relation to a legitimate governmental purpose.arbitrary and capricious classifications are not permitted.citation.the persons who are to pay the tax must be a reasonably justifiable subclassification of persons otherwise,the operation of the tax must be such as to place liability therefor equally on all members of the class.pomona,supra,d at,quoting gowens city of bakersfield d.
under the rational basis test,w e will not overturn such a law unless the varying treatment of different groups or persons is so unrelated to the achievement of any combination of legitimate purposes that we can only conclude that the people actions were irrational.gregory ashcroft,d.this deference is particularly important in the context of complex tax laws.city and county of san francisco flying dutchman park,th,d flying dutchman.
appellants claim that the ordinance improperly classifies for taxation persons who can not afford housing and can afford residing at a motel only on a basis.this is not so.the ordinance distinguishes between persons who stay in accommodations for only short periods of time and persons who reside in city on a nontransient basis.the rational basis for the classification is city desire to tax persons for the privilege of enjoying occupancy of accommodations within city jurisdiction.transient occupancy is a proper subject of taxation.see gowens city of bakersfield d.kumar,supra,th at,d.
appellants argue that the exemption clause in city ordinance,which excludes from taxation those persons who pay the first days rent in advance,could result in taxation of some persons who truly intend to be guests but can only afford to pay on a or basis.according to appellants,there is no rational basis for such a distinction.as city explains,city has a vital interest in ensuring the collection and remittance of the tax,which provides a significant source of revenue for funding the vital services city provides.the exclusion clause advances that interest by limiting the exclusion to legitimate occupants.it may be that some occupants will be ineligible for the exclusion based upon their financial situation at the time,and will have to pay the tax for the first days of their occupancy.if this is unfair,it is not our role to judge.the ordinance does not proceed along suspect lines and it infringes no fundamental rights.fcc beach communications,d.
appellants again cite the apparent inconsistency in the ordinance,which defines transience as days or less but excludes from taxation persons who have paid days rent in advance and may not terminate the occupancy in less than thirty days.as appellants read it,this means that a person would be exempt even if he or she terminates the occupancy on the thirtieth day,a situation that would otherwise make him or her transient.i t is not the role of a court considering an equal protection challenge to scuttle the law because there may exist circumstances where the purpose of the law could be eluded.u nder the rational relationship standard,a court may not strike down a classification simply because the classification may be imperfect citation or because it may be to some extent both underinclusive and overinclusive.citation.warden state bar cal th at,fn,d.flying dutchman,supra,th at,d.
aside from argument,appellants offer no authority to support their position that the tax violates equal protection principles.in kelly city of san diego d,cited by appellants,the court struck down a tax that applied to persons living in house trailers but not to persons living in other types of housing.the court held that the tax was not a property tax but an occupancy tax.as such,persons living in house trailers and persons living in other types of living structures were similarly situated.the court stated we can see no valid distinction,for the purpose of classification,between the occupancy of a trailer and the occupancy of a permanent structure except perhaps the greater comfort and convenience of the latter and the higher rent paid.id.at.in pomona,also cited by appellants,the ordinance imposed a tax upon persons who lived in housing regardless of the length of time they resided there.the appellate court held that there was no rational basis for distinguishing between persons permanently residing in hotels and persons who lived in apartments or houses.pomona,supra,d at.in contrast to both kelly and pomona,l
