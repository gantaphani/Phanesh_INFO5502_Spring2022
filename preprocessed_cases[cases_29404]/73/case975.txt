martin kapp appeals the district court entry of a permanent injunction preventing him from preparing or assisting in preparing federal tax returns that assert the position that mariners are entitled to an unreimbursed deduction for meal expenses while working on board a ship,when no meal expenses are actually incurred the mariner tax deduction.he also appeals the grant of summary judgment for the government and the denial of his cross motion for summary judgment.we have jurisdiction of this timely appeal under,and affirm the judgment of the district court.
facts and procedural history 
kapp is a certified public accountant who specializes in preparing federal income tax returns for individuals employed in the transportation industry.this case relates to his preparation of federal tax returns for mariners who work on oceangoing ships and who are at sea for long periods without returning to port deep sea mariners,and mariners who work on tug boats and barges tug and barge mariners,which return to port more frequently.deep sea mariners are provided meals by their employer while working on board the ship.tug and barge mariners also typically do not incur meal related expenses.
between approximately january and february kapp prepared tax returns for mariners who lived on vessels in the course of their employment that claimed the mariner tax deduction.two of these returns were for marin johnson and jim westling,who were employed as deep sea mariners during the tax year in question.both individuals were provided meals at no cost,but claimed a deduction based on the number of days at sea multiplied by the full meals and incidental expenses m ie rate.
the internal revenue service irs disallowed the deductions,and johnson and westling filed petitions in the tax court.in,the tax court held that although the mariners could deduct travel expenses while working away from home,johnson and westling could not deduct the full m ie rate because they had not actually incurred meal expenses.johnson comm r,wl westling comm r,cch.they were permitted to deduct the incidental expenses portion of the m ie rate,however,because the mariners paid for items including personal hygiene supplies and bottled water at the ship store.johnson,at westling,cch at.after these rulings,the irs modified its revenue procedures and issued two chief counsel advisories which concluded that the taxpayer may not claim the full m ie rate when only incidental expenses are incurred.see,chief counsel advisory october,wl,at chief counsel advisory october,wl,at.
after the johnson and westling decisions,kapp wrote several articles in a trade publication,the professional mariner,discussing potential tax deductions available to mariners.kapp theorized about the different deductions available to deep sea mariners,and acknowledged that claiming this additional meal deduction when meals are provided is considered double dipping.he asserted that tug and barge mariners were entitled to claim the full m ie deduction,reduced by the amount of their grocery allowance although he temporarily stopped claiming deductions on behalf of deep sea mariners,he continued to file returns claiming the deduction on behalf of his tug and barge mariner clients.
in november the irs notified kapp that he was under investigation for conducting a tax shelter promotion.attorney dennis perez represented kapp.perez and kapp met with george campos,the irs agent in charge of the investigation,several times in and.in a march meeting,the irs informed kapp that the mariner tax deduction was not allowed under the internal revenue code.a memorandum dated april,drafted by an attorney in perez firm concluded that little authority supported kapp position that either deep sea mariners or tug and barge mariners were entitled to deduct the full m ie amount,because both types of mariners are typically provided meals by their employer at no cost 
on may,perez wrote a letter to campos detailing kapp position on deductions for tug and barge mariners.he followed with a second letter on july,which stated that although kapp does not necessarily agree with the position you articulated for the first time in our meeting last month he has agreed to cease claiming meal deductions as he has done previously.campos did not respond to the letters.after completing his investigation,campos prepared a final report concluding that kapp is instrumental in preparing erroneous returns and incorrectly interpreting the internal revenue code.the government filed a complaint in april seeking an injunction that would prevent kapp from claiming deductions for meals that are provided to an employee without cost.
during the course of the litigation,kapp was deposed by the government.he stated that he did not routinely ask mariners whether they were provided meals free of charge by their employer before claiming a deduction on their behalf.additionally,he acknowledged that while he stopped claiming the full m ie deduction for deep sea mariners after the johnson decision,he began claiming it again in late or early based on purported endorsement of his position by campos,and because he needed to be more aggressive in claiming deductions to provide negotiating room with the irs.
both parties moved for summary judgment in february.kapp asserted that he was entitled to summary judgment because his position regarding the deemed substantiated deductions for mariners was legally correct and taken in good faith.the government argued that an injunction was proper because kapp continued to claim the mariner tax deduction even though he knew the deduction was improper.in august the district court granted summary judgment for the government and permanently enjoined kapp from preparing tax returns that claim a deduction for meals that are provided to mariners without cost.the injunction also required that kapp provide a list of clients for whom he prepared returns claiming these deductions,post a link to the court order on his websites,and explain to his clients that the court determined that he had incorrectly advised them about the mariner tax deduction.
subsequent to the judgment enjoining kapp,the tax court published two cases specifically addressing kapp position regarding tug and barge mariners.see zbylut comm r,cch,balla comm r,cch.relying on the johnson decision,both cases held that tug and barge mariners could not use the regulations that permit deemed substantiated deductions for meals when no expense was incurred by the taxpayer.zbylut,cch at balla,cch at.
ii.statutory overview 
the permits taxpayers to deduct reasonable business expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year,including travel expenses such as meals and lodging a.however,disallows such deductions unless the taxpayer meets strict substantiation requirements.d.section d also contains a provision that allows the secretary of the treasury secretary to create regulations that eliminate some or all of the substantiation requirements when the expense is below a prescribed amount.d.the applicable regulations authorize the commissioner of internal revenue commissioner to create optional methods of computing travel expenses,including a per diem deduction for meals and incidental expenses,which satisfy the substantiation requirements of d.reg.j.
the commissioner issued revenue procedures which specify the federal travel regulations m ie rate as the amount that a taxpayer may deduct in lieu of substantiating the actual cost of meals proc.the commissioner updates these revenue procedures annually,but the relevant provisions have remained substantially the same since.see.travel expenses below the threshold m ie amounts are deemed substantiated and the taxpayer is not required to provide documentation in order to deduct the expense.proc.
additionally,the federal travel regulations provide that the m ie rate must be adjusted for a meal furnished to the taxpayer except as provided in by deducting the appropriate amount.however,a meal provided by a common carrier or a complimentary meal provided by a does not affect your per diem.ships are included within the definition of common carriers.
iii.standard of review 
a summary judgment granting a permanent injunction is generally reviewed for abuse of discretion.sprint.pcs,county of san diego,cir.however,we review any determination underlying the grant of an injunction by the standard that applies to that determination.id.quoting ting v.at t,cir.thus,we review a district court findings of fact for clear error and its determinations of law de novo.id.
the determination that there are no genuine issues of material fact that preclude the entry of summary judgment is reviewed de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see united states alameda gateway,cir.
iv.entry of the injunction 
standard for injunctive relief.
the district court enjoined kapp from preparing tax returns claiming the mariner tax deduction under.an injunction is proper under if the court finds that the tax preparer has engaged in conduct subject to penalty under,and an injunction is appropriate to prevent recurrence of the violation.section provides that a tax return preparer is subject to penalty if he prepares a return with understated liability due to an unreasonable position not supported by substantial authority.
the applicable regulations further define what conduct is subject to penalty under.the regulations provide that a person has a reasonable basis for his position if a reasonable and analysis by a person knowledgeable in tax law would lead such a person to conclude that the position has approximately a one in three,or greater,likelihood of being sustained on the merits reg.b.additionally,the substantial authority standard is objective,and is not affected by the taxpayer subjective belief in the correctness of his position.reg.d i.the government bears the burden of proving each element for enjoining a tax preparer by a preponderance of the evidence.see united states estate,cir.
thus,the district court properly enjoined kapp if he prepared a return that understated liability,due to an unreasonable position,a position that objectively had a less than one in three chance of being sustained on the merits,and an injunction is appropriate to prevent recurrence.
kapp prepared returns that understated tax liability.
kapp argues that mariners do not have to pay or incur meal expenses in order to claim a deduction under the regulations that allow certain expenses to be deemed substantiated without documentation.he notes that meals provided by common carriers are not required to be subtracted from the allowed per diem deduction amount,and that ships are included within the definition of common carriers.therefore,he reasons that mariners who are provided meals while on board a ship should be allowed to claim the full m ie allowance for days at sea,even though no meal expense is incurred.kapp also creates several complicated hypothetical examples to support his argument that under the regulations,certain travelers could claim a deduction for deemed substantiated expenses when no actual costs are incurred.
kapp argument is based on a misunderstanding of the regulations that create the deemed substantiated exception.he essentially argues that executive branch agency regulations can be manipulated to subvert provisions of the enacted by congress.the regulations are intended to interpret and assist in the enforcement of the,not to undermine it.the gives the secretary and the commissioner discretionary authority to issue regulations to ease the burden on taxpayers,who would otherwise have to meet the extensive substantiation requirements of in order to claim deductions for business related travel.d see additionally balla,cch at.the regulations,however,do not eliminate the requirement in that expenses must be paid or incurred in order to be deducted 
the regulations reflect the requirements of.in the first section outlining their purpose,the regulations state that they provide an optional method for employees and individuals who pay or incur meal costs to use in computing the deductible costs of business meal and incidental expenses paid or incurred while traveling away from home.proc,emphasis added.after the johnson decision,the regulations were altered to provide a method for computing the applicable deduction for incidental expenses when no meal costs are paid and incurred.see.
therefore,a meal provided by a common carrier need not be deducted from the per diem m ie rate under,but a taxpayer can not take the per diem deduction if he does not incur any meal related expenses.proc.additionally,kapp examples of individuals who may attempt to manipulate the regulations to claim impermissible deductions when they do not incur expenses does not alter the requirement in that expenses must be paid or incurred in order to be deducted.because kapp claimed deductions on behalf of mariners who did not pay or incur meal expenses,he prepared returns that understated liability.
kapp position was unreasonable.
kapp argues that even if he incorrectly claimed the mariner tax deduction for taxpayers who incurred no meal costs,his position was not unreasonable and was supported by substantial authority.the analysis of the reasonableness of his position differs slightly for deep sea and tug and barge mariners,and we discuss each group separately.
deep sea mariners 
kapp assertion that deep sea mariners were permitted to take the mariners tax deduction is patently unreasonable in light of the ruling in the johnson case.in that case,which arose from conduct nearly identical to the conduct that is the basis of the injunction,the court stated w e do not read the revenue procedures to allow a taxpayer to use the full m ie rates when he or she incurs only incidental expenses.johnson,at.kapp unsuccessfully attempts to distinguish johnson,but the clear implication of the holding is that taxpayers may not deduct meal expenses when no such expenses are incurred.id.kapp acknowledged as much himself in his the professional mariner articles.
kapp claims that he recently resumed the practice of taking a deduction on behalf of his deep sea mariner clients based on alleged approval of the position by campos.in his declaration submitted in opposition to the government summary judgment motion kapp stated that 
i had a long meeting with irs agent george campos on august,during which i reviewed my legal position with him in detail at the end of the meeting,campos sort of threw his arm around me and stated now i understand.since campos at no time during or after the meeting stated that he disagreed with my position,or that my position was frivolous,i interpreted campos s statement as an endorsement of my legal position 
even accepting the accuracy of kapp description of his interaction with campos,the conduct is not an affirmation of kapp position allowing him to claim the deduction on behalf of deep sea mariners,especially in light of the johnson ruling.because a analysis of the issue by a person knowledgeable in tax law would not lead to the conclusion that kapp position had at least a one in three chance of being sustained on the merits,his position was unreasonable and not based on substantial authority.
tug and barge mariners 
kapp argues that claiming the mariner tax deduction for tug and barge mariners was reasonable because johnson applied only to deep sea mariners.he contends that taking the deduction on behalf of tug and barge mariners,who return to port more frequently,presented novel issues.although the johnson case arose from a slightly different factual situation,the principles of the tax court holding clearly extend to tug and barge mariners.the essence of the court holding is that individuals may not deduct the full m ie rate when they do not incur meal expenses.johnson,at.by extension,if tug and barge mariners do not incur meal expenses,they may not take a deduction.the frequency of a mariner return to port is irrelevant to the holding of the case.
a memorandum prepared by an associate of kapp lawyer perez concluded there was little support for kapp position that tug and barge mariners could deduct meal expenses when no cost was incurred.although kapp claims that he asked perez to play devil advocate and draft a memorandum that laid o
