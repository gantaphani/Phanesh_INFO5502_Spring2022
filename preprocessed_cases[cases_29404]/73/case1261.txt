mason brown appeal of the summary judgment against his complaint of sexual harassment and retaliation while employed at the internal revenue service presents a threshold issue of jurisdiction and then two issues about the merits of his complaint.the jurisdictional issue is whether brown failed to exhaust his administrative remedies when he filed his complaint in the district court fewer than days after he had filed an appeal with the equal employment opportunity commission and he allegedly did not seek counseling with an equal employment office counselor within days of the alleged harassment.the issues about the merits of brown complaint are whether brown suffered sexual harassment and retaliation when the score on an evaluation of his job performance was lowered and whether brown pleaded a claim for retaliation based on his later termination.
we conclude that jurisdiction was proper.brown exhausted his administrative remedies.brown cooperated with the investigation of the eeoc the record does not establish that he failed to seek counseling within days of the harassment and his premature filing in the district court did not deprive the eeoc of the time allotted for its investigation.
we also conclude that brown complaint fails on the merits.brown can not establish that he suffered any sexual harassment or retaliation from the lowered score on the evaluation of his performance because he can not prove a causal connection between the lowered score and the denial of promotions that he later sought.brown remaining claim of retaliation by termination was not pleaded in his complaint.we affirm.
background 
from to,brown was employed by the irs as a tax examiner.brown received an evaluation of his job performance from june,to may,in which he received a score of out of and was rated fully successful in the four performance categories.in,dolores bagley was assigned to brown division as an interim manager.bagley began making sexual comments and advances towards brown and made several attempts at physical contact with brown.brown resisted bagley advances.
on january,bagley revised the earlier evaluation of brown job performance.bagley lowered brown rating from to,but the evaluation still rated brown fully successful in the four performance categories.shortly afterwards,bagley allegedly threatened to get brown back for refusing her sexual advances.
brown reported bagley behavior to numerous superiors,but he contends that his complaints went unaddressed.brown also applied for several positions within the irs that would have given him greater responsibility and salary.brown was denied these promotions.
brown filed a complaint of sexual discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission on july,and met informally with an eeoc representative on september.brown also filed a formal grievance with the irs on november.on january,the irs issued a final decision,which denied brown complaints of sexual discrimination and retaliation and informed brown of his right to sue in federal court.brown filed a notice of appeal with the eeoc on february.the irs responded on april,and reiterated the denial of brown complaint without further comment.
brown filed this complaint against the secretary of the treasury in the district court on july.brown alleged sex discrimination and retaliation in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of.et.on august,the irs informed the eeoc of brown lawsuit and requested that the eeoc cease its investigation of brown claim.on august,the secretary of the treasury,john snow,filed a motion to dismiss brown complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.the district court denied this motion on october.
both parties consented to the jurisdiction of the magistrate judge.on june,snow moved for summary judgment based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction and on the merits.brown responded and filed motions for summary judgment and injunctive relief.the magistrate judge granted snow motion on the merits and denied brown motions.
brown also alleges that,after he filed a complaint with the eeoc,the manager of his department,bagley successor,continually questioned him about the status of the complaint.when brown refused to answer,the manager allegedly informed brown that his superiors would remove brown if he did not drop the complaint.brown was terminated in early.

iii.discussion 
our discussion of this appeal is divided into three parts.we first address whether brown complaint should have been dismissed based on his failure to exhaust his administrative remedies.second,we discuss whether the district court erred by entering summary judgment for snow on the ground that brown did not suffer an adverse employment action.third,we examine whether the district court correctly entered summary judgment against brown claims of retaliation.
brown exhausted his administrative remedies.
snow argument that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because brown failed to exhaust his administrative remedies is twofold.first,snow contends that brown failed to wait days from the day he filed his appeal with the eeoc before he filed his complaint in the district court.c.second,snow contends that brown failed to contact a counselor at the equal employment office of the irs within days after the alleged harassment.we address each argument in turn.
brown did not fail to cooperate with the eeoc when he prematurely filed his complaint.
both federal statutes and eeoc regulations require a federal employee to exhaust an administrative process before filing a civil complaint of discrimination in the workplace.an aggrieved federal employee first must file a formal complaint with the agency that allegedly discriminated against him.a.after the agency has rendered a final decision,the employee has the option to appeal the decision of the agency to either the federal district court or the eeoc.c.if the employee appeals to the eeoc and the eeoc does not issue a decision within days,the employee may file a complaint in the district court.d.
although the waiting period is part of the administrative process that must be exhausted before filing suit in a federal district court,it is unclear whether a premature filing of a complaint deprives a district court of subject matter jurisdiction.although our case law establishes that a federal employee must pursue and exhaust her administrative remedies as a jurisdictional prerequisite to filing a title vii action,crawford babbitt,cir,we have not addressed whether prematurely filing a complaint is,by itself,a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
the constant theme of our precedents is that the purpose of exhaustion is to give the agency the information it needs to investigate and resolve the dispute between the employee and the employer.wade sec y of the army,cir see also johnson bergland,cir.to determine whether an employee failed to exhaust his administrative remedies,we consider whether the complainant made a good faith effort to comply with the regulations and,particularly,to provide all the relevant,specific information available to him or her.wade,at see also crawford,at.satisfaction of this requirement will ensure that the agency is given every opportunity to investigate and resolve the dispute all that is intended by the exhaustion requirement.wade,at.
we have applied the exhaustion requirement to affirm dismissals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction when the employee did not provide information requested by the investigating agency.in johnson,for example,we concluded that a federal employee failure to make a complaint more specific regarding dates and incidents of discrimination,as required by the agency,was a failure to exhaust administrative remedies that required dismissal.at.more recently,in crawford,we concluded that another federal employee failure to pro
