introduction 
this appeal involves a question of first impression.we are asked to determine the proper calculation under revenue and taxation code section of the fee a county may charge local governmental entities within its jurisdiction for the services counties perform under two specifically designated tax statutes,the triple flip and the vlf swap.appellants plaintiffs below,of the general law or charter cities in the county of los angeles,petitioned the trial court for a writ of administrative mandamus contending that defendants,the county of los angeles and wendy watanabe in her official capacity as the county auditor controller together the county,failed to follow the law and violated a clear and plain duty in calculating the section service fee.a referee found that the county was faithfully following the law.petitioners appeal from the judgment adopting the referee ruling.we conclude the statute is clear on its face and hold that the county method of calculating its fee under section was unlawful.accordingly,we reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings.
factual background 
the parties stipulated to the following pertinent facts 
one effect of proposition on counties 
counties are responsible for,among other things,assessing and collecting ad valorem property tax revenues from assessed property within their borders.as part of their administration of the property tax system,the counties calculate and distribute to the various local governmental entities including cities,redevelopment agencies,special districts,and counties themselves hereinafter cities within their jurisdiction each city share of the property tax revenue.
before passage of proposition cal,art.xiiia,in,counties set their property tax rates at a level that enabled them to recoup the cost to them of property tax administration.with limited exceptions not relevant here,proposition capped property tax rates to one percent of assessed value.after proposition,counties continued to bear the burden of assessing,collecting,and allocating property tax revenues,but lacked a means of recovering their costs for this administration.
in,the legislature passed the first of several measures that addressed reimbursement to the counties of cities proportionate share of the cost of property tax administration.
in fiscal year,the legislature created an educational revenue augmentation fund eraf in each county.the eraf is a fund into which property tax revenue is shifted to pay for the state constitutional responsibility to fund public education.the property taxes paid to both local schools and the eraf are exempt from having to pay this property tax administration fee,or ptaf.
in,the legislature enacted revenue and taxation code section that,with the exception of schools and funds schools receive from erafs,permits counties to fairly apportion the burden of collecting property tax revenues by recovering from each city within its borders a ptaf that correlates to the property tax revenues allocated to that city,subd.b.section provides the method for calculating an administrative cost apportionment factor.
generally speaking,the ptaf for a given city is computed as follows 
a.the county calculates the prior year property tax administration costs of the assessor,tax collector,assessment appeals board,and the.such costs include the direct costs,all activities directly involved in assessing,collecting,and processing property taxes,and overhead costs established in accordance with federal budget circular a.
b.the county calculates each city proportionate share of such costs by calculating an apportionment factor from the ratio of the property tax revenue received by each city to the total property tax revenue distributed.
c.the county multiplies the administrative costs it incurred in the immediately preceding fiscal year by each city cost apportionment factor to determine each city ptaf.the city annual ptaf is withheld by the county from the property tax distributions made by the county to cities for each fiscal year.see arbuckle college city fire protection dist.county of colusa th,d arbuckle college.
the revenue statutes at issue here 
the three relevant revenue provisions were created nearly simultaneously.on december,the legislature enacted revenue and taxation code section to be operative on march.stats,ex.sess,ch,assem.bill ex.sess.seven months later in august,the governor signed senate bill,which amended section and enacted sections and at issue here,all effective august.stats,ch,bill.we describe these three provisions individually.
a.the triple flip 
in,california voters passed the economic recovery bond act,proposition,which authorized the issuance of bonds to preserve public education,among other things.ibid.to fund repayment of the economic recovery bonds,the legislature passed revenue and taxation code section a temporary measure for a revenue swap known as the triple flip.the triple flip works thusly section reduced the bradley burns sales and use tax rate paid to cities and counties by cent.under section,the state retains that cent and uses it to repay economic recovery bonds the first flip.to compensate the cities and counties for the lost revenue,section provides that,in lieu of the cent sales tax money,counties take an equivalent amount in property tax revenue that would otherwise have been allocated to each county eraf and deposit it in a sales and use tax compensation fund set up in each county treasury,subd.a.the revenue deposited in the fund is then allocated and distributed by the counties to each city recipient in the county in lieu of the lost cent sales tax revenue the second flip,subd.c c.the state replaces funds that local schools otherwise would have received from the eraf out of the state general fund the third flip.
b.the vlf swap 
effective july,the state permanently reduced the amount of the vehicle license fee vlf payable to cities and counties from percent to percent of a vehicle assessed value.revenue and taxation code section replaces the lost vehicle license fee revenue with property taxes in a substitution referred to as the vlf swap.as with the triple flip,counties take an amount of property tax revenue,otherwise required to be allocated to each county eraf,that is equivalent to the lost vehicle license fee revenue,subd.a a,and deposit that money in a vehicle license fee property tax compensation fund established in each county treasury.id.at subd.a.the counties distribute the money in this fund to each city recipient in place of lost vehicle license fee proceeds,subd.b a b.the vlf swap has no sunset provision.
revenue and taxation code section 
pursuant to the revenue and taxation code sections triple flip and vlf swap,the county has a duty to annually allocate and distribute to the cities within the county,the appropriate payments from property tax revenues under the triple flip and vlf swap.
revenue and taxation code section,at issue in this appeal,reads notwithstanding any other provision of law,for the and fiscal years,a county shall not impose a fee,charge,or other levy on a city,nor reduce a city allocation of ad valorem property tax revenue,in reimbursement for the services performed by the county under sections and.for the fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter,a county may impose a fee,charge,or other levy on a city for these services,but the fee,charge,or other levy shall not exceed the actual cost of providing these services.italics added.
the california state association of county auditors prepared senate bill guidelines guidelines in response to the legislature enactment of revenue and taxation code sections triple flip,vlf swap,and,among other provisions of the budget act.the guidelines do not have the force of law.consistent with the guidelines,the county did not charge appellants for any property tax administrative services relating to the funds paid to cities under the triple flip and vlf swap in the and fiscal years.beginning in fiscal year,the county included the property tax funds paid under the triple flip and vlf swap as additional property tax share to each city and apportioned the total ptaf costs to each city based on this share.
the financial consequences of the county method of calculating the ptaf for appellants are that the ptaf the county charged appellants was collectively,over million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year,more than such fees would have been charged had the triple flip and the vlf swap revenues not been included in appellants property tax share used for apportioning ptaf.by comparison,beginning with the fiscal year,the county actual cost of the incremental tax allocation duties required by the triple flip and vlf swap only was approximately per year.
procedural history 
in,appellants petitioned the trial court for a writ of administrative mandate code civ,challenging the county method of calculating the ptaf charged to appellants starting in fiscal year.maintaining that the ptaf the county charged each appellant and retained by the county was in excess of that permitted by revenue and taxation code section,appellants sought a writ ordering the county to comply with that statute and to credit the excess withheld.the county denied appellants contention that its method of calculating ptaf under section is unlawful.appellants argued that section authorizes the county to charge only the actual cost of administering the triple flip and vlf swap it does not empower the county to include the property tax revenue under the triple flip and vlf swap as additional property tax share for each city for purposes of calculating the administration fee for operating the property tax system as a whole.the county contended that the legislature enactment of sections triple flip and vlf swap decreased the amount of ptaf exempt from reimbursement because that money otherwise would have been attributable to the eraf,and thus increased each city proportionate share of the total property taxes distributed,thereby increasing appellants ptaf.the county also argued that its method of calculating ptaf accords with applicable revenue and taxation code sections including,but not limited to,sections,and.
the parties agreed to try this case by reference code civ,and submitted the comprehensive stipulation of facts from which the above factual description was taken the parties also agreed to defer the question of recalculating each appellants ptaf until the trial court determined whether the method currently used by the county was lawful.the referee ruled that the county interpretation was consistent with legislative intent,and thus the county method of calculation did not violate revenue and taxation code section.the trial court entered judgment accordingly and appellants timely appealed.
discussion 
a traditional writ of mandate under code of civil procedure section is a method for compelling a public city to perform a legal and usually ministerial duty.citation.the trial court reviews an administrative action pursuant to code of civil procedure section to determine whether the agency action was arbitrary,capricious,or entirely lacking in evidentiary support,contrary to established public policy,unlawful,procedurally unfair,or whether the agency failed to follow the procedure and give the notices the law requires.citations.klajic castaic lake water agency th,d,fn.omitted.
at issue here is the meaning of revenue and taxation code section.the county contends that the legislature enactment of sections and,decreased the amount of ptaf that otherwise would have been attributable to the eraf and thus exempt from ptaf and increased each city proportionate share of the total property taxes distributed,thereby increasing each appellant ptaf obligation.the county believes the legislature intended it to recoup from cities the costs associated with property tax administrative efforts of assessing,collecting,and allocating the share of property taxes that are included in the triple flip and vlf swap.appellants counter that the ptaf charged in fiscal years and to each appellant was in excess of the actual cost of providing the services under the triple flip and the vlf swap.that is,the county charged appellants more than that permitted by section because the county should not have included the property tax proceeds under the triple flip and vlf swap in its calculation and apportionment of the cities general ptaf responsibilities.rather,the county should have charged each city only its proportion of the specific cost of making the accounting entries necessary to shift money in treasury accounts under the triple flip and vlf swap.therefore,we are tasked with determining whether the county method of calculating appellants ptaf violates section.where the facts are undisputed,the issue here involves solely the interpretation of a statute,which is a question of law that we review de novo.goodman lozano cal th,d,international engine parts,feddersen cal th,d.
the county method of calculating the fee for its services is not authorized by revenue and taxation code section and is hence not lawful.
our task is to ascertain the intent of the drafters so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent,we first examine the words themselves,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning and construing them in context.citation.mejia reed cal th,d.we accord significance,if possible,to every word,phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose.a construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided.dyna med,fair employment housing com.cal d.if the language of a statute is unambiguous,the plain meaning governs and it is unnecessary to resort to extrinsic sources to determine the legislative intent.kavanaugh west sonoma county union high school dist.cal th,d.if the statutory language does not yield a plain meaning,we may consider extrinsic evidence of intent,including the legislative history.mejia reed,supra,at,d.w e presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute governs.citation.hunt superior court cal th,d.
as noted,revenue and taxation code section reads notwithstanding any other provision of law,for the and fiscal years,a county shall not impose a fee,charge,or other levy on a city,nor reduce a city allocation of ad valorem property tax revenue,in reimbursement for the services performed by the county under sections and.for the fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter,a county may impose a fee,charge,or other levy on a city for these services,but the fee,charge,or other levy shall not exceed the actual cost of providing these services.italics added.
we agree with the referee that revenue and taxation code section is clear in that notwithstanding any other provision of law,in fiscal years and,the counties were forbidden to charge or recoup from the cities any administrative costs whatsoever for services performed by the county under triple flip and vlf swap and the words these services in sentence two have the same meaning as the phrase for services performed under by the county under sections and in the first sentence.
beyond that conclusion,the referee found that revenue and taxation code section was ambiguous and,there being no pertinent legislative history,the referee read section as part of the statutory scheme which encompasses,among other statutes,sections,and,involving the computation of fees counties charge for property tax administration.however,we agree with appellants that section is not ambiguous and hence,does not require resort to extrinsic aids for its meaning 
looking at the words of revenue and taxation code section alone,they reveal the clear intent that services are those that counties render pursuant to the triple flip and vlf swap only.this is plain because section tells us the fee is for the services performed by the county under sections and.the county has stipulated that p ursuant to sections and,the county has a duty to annually allocate and distribute to cities within los angeles county the appropriate payments from property tax revenues under the provisions of the triple flip and the vlf swap.the tasks the triple flip and vlf swap direct the county to undertake are to transfer,allocate,and distribute amounts,the size of which are specified by the state director of finance,subd.c,subd.b.the services counties render under sections triple flip and vlf swap do not include the additional activities of equalizing,assessing and collecting property tax,processing appeals,or otherwise administering the property tax system as a whole.rather,the triple flip and vlf swap are mechanisms designed to replace lost sales and use tax and vehicle license fee revenue with funds derived from property taxes that have already been levied.our task is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein,not to insert what has been omitted,or to omit what has been inserted code civ.it is against all settled rules of statutory construction that courts should write into a statute by implication express requirements which the legislature itself has not seen fit to place in the statute.citations.in re rudy th,d code civ.therefore,the absence from the triple flip or vlf swap statutes of the words equalize,assess,or collect,demonstrates the legislature intent that the administrative activities counties perform under the triple flip and vlf swap are not part of the traditional ptaf generating tasks of property tax administration,but are limited to the services the counties perform to process the triple flip and vlf swap only.
furthermore,not only does revenue and taxation code section limit the scope of services counties provide to those necessary to process the triple flip and the vlf swap,but the second sentence of section specifies that counties may only recover the actual cost of providing these services.the legislature use of this phrase reveals its intent to restrict cities payment to no more than the definite costs related to performing the services under the two revenue provisions,sections and,the only two revenue sections mentioned in section.all three statutes,the triple flip,the vlf swap,and section,were fashioned by senate bill the legislature knew of the existence of section and other existing statutes governing ptaf,and yet it passed senate bill creating section as a statute separate from property tax generating statutes,whose sole reference is to the triple flip and vlf swap.generally,it can be presumed that when the legislature has enacted a specific statute to deal with a particular matter,it would intend the specific statute to control over more general provisions of law that might otherwise apply.citation.arbuckle college,supra,th at,d.the legislature choice to enact section where statutes addressing the calculation of ptaf have existed for decades indicates the legislative intent that actual cost refers to the cost to counties of performing the newly created triple flip and vlf swap only,and should not be included in the cost to counties to perform the general property tax administration.otherwise the phrase actual cost would be superfluous.stated differently,section is a provision authorizing payment for the actual cost to the county of administering the triple flip and vlf swap only.adding the property tax revenue related to the triple flip and vlf swap to the general property tax shares from which the county calculates the ptaf for property tax administration,as the county advocates,would violate section language limiting reimbursement to actual cost of providing these services,the triple flip and vlf swap.
the county contends,where revenue and taxation code section is ambiguous,that we must read it in the context of the statutory scheme for property tax administrative fees as a whole,including sections,and.the argument is unavailing for two reasons.first,we have concluded that section is not ambiguous.it is a settled principle in california law that when statutory language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,and courts should not indulge in it.citation.citation.california ins.guarantee workers comp.appeals bd.th,d,italics added.
second and more important,however,is the fact that revenue and taxation code section commences with n otwithstanding any other provisions of law this term of art expresses a legislative intent to have the specific statute control despite the existence of other law which might otherwise govern citation people franklin th,d,italics added and thus clearly indicates the legislature intent that section govern the fees for administering the triple flip and vlf swap regardless of any earlier enacted statutes governing the assessment and collection of property tax administration fees in general,such as section.see arbuckle college,supra,th at,d.stated otherwise,the legislature intended that section stand alone with respect to the administrative costs incurred in performing the services required for the triple flip and vlf swap,while assuring that counties would still be reimbursed for those efforts even if the phrase n otwithstanding any other provisions of law were to apply only to section first sentence prohibiting the counties from recovering a service fee for the first two years fiscal years,and,our conclusion would be the same.the second sentence of section reinstates the service fee,but specifies that such fee shall not exceed the actual cost of providing these services under the triple flip and vlf swap.
indeed,had the legislature meant for the services performed pursuant to the triple flip and vlf swap to encompass those governed by the property tax administrative fee statutes including revenue and taxation code sections,and,it could have said so in section.the legislature is deemed to be aware of statutes and judicial decisions already in existence,and to have enacted or amended a statute in light thereof.citation.people mcguire th,d.cognizant of the extensive statutory scheme governing traditional property tax administrative fees,coupled with the repeated legislative aim of compensating counties for their efforts in administering the state property tax system see,subd.e the legislature could have,but notably did not refer to those traditional statutes in the body of section.alternatively,had the legislature intended the property tax revenues in the triple flip and vlf swap to be treated in the same manner as property tax money in general,it could have remained silent because sections and already addressed the calculation of traditional ptaf.
we are unpersuaded by the county argument that under the ptaf allocation rule in effect for the better part of the last two decades,the county should be able to recoup the ptaf associated with the additional property tax revenues being allocated to cities under the triple flip and vlf swap.neither the triple flip nor the vlf swap existed two decades ago.the legislature added section a mere six years ago in conjunction with its creation of the triple flip and vlf swap,and section reference to sections triple flip and vlf swap only clearly indicates that services under section refers solely to activities performed under the triple flip and vlf swap.thus,the property tax payment amounts under these two revenue swapping measures should not be included in the traditional computation for ptaf.our reading of section is in harmony with the traditional statutes as it addresses the actual cost of the services the county performs under the newer triple flip and vlf swap.chatsky associates superior court th,d code civ.
the parties argue at length about the effect of the differences between each sentence in revenue and taxation code section.the first sentence lists a fee,charge or other levy reduc tion of a city allocation of ad valorem property tax revenue,whereas the second sentence of section lists only the fee,charge,or other levy on a city and then instructs that the fee,charge,or other levy shall not exceed the actual cost of providing these services,italics added.these two sentences are easily reconciled under the rule expressio unius est exclusio alterius,that is,the expression of certain things in a statute necessarily involves exclusion of other things not expressed.citation or where exceptions to a general rule are specified by statute,other exceptions are not to be implied or presumed.citation.bonner county of san diego th,d.reducing
