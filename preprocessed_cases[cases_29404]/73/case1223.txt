we consider whether the commissioner of internal revenue properly disallowed losses incurred by richard keeler taxpayer through his participation in a derivatives market created by merit securities.the commissioner determined taxpayer transactions lacked economic substance and were not entered into primarily for profit.the tax court agreed with the commissioner,holding that taxpayer gains and losses from trading in the merit market could not be recognized for tax purposes.the court also ordered keeler to pay additional taxes for his negligence in reporting losses under a and increased interest for substantial underpayments attributable to transactions under c.see leema,comm r,cch.exercising jurisdiction pursuant to,we affirm.
the trading program we examine provided hefty opportunities for tax savings but only illusory opportunities for economic profit.under scrutiny,what profit potential the merit markets offered appears anemic beside their considerable capacity for tax gaming.merit traders incurred inflated losses in one year and recognized corresponding gains in the next,accelerating deductions and deferring gains to reduce overall tax liability in a given year to as little as zero.these straddle trades allowed taxpayer to exploit the necessary construct of separate taxable years and to violate a cardinal rule of the tax code transactions lacking economic substance are not recognized for tax purposes.see gregory helvering.
because the relevant facts in this case are recounted in the tax court exhaustive opinion,we need only summarize them here.in,congress passed the economic recovery tax act of erta,a,stat.to limit the use of straddle tax shelters,erta added to the internal revenue code the code,providing that losses from straddle trades can be recognized only to the extent they exceed unrealized gain on the offsetting portion of the straddle see,at,cong.however,losses from ownership of stock were excepted from loss disallowance rule,and in merit created its stock forwards program,the derivatives trading market at issue in the instant case.
participation in the stock forwards program allowed taxpayer to incur significant tax losses in one year while deferring corresponding gain into future taxable years by holding instruments in the form of a straddle,a hedged position composed of two substantially offsetting positions.typically,taxpayer would purchase both a long contract to buy stock from merit at a future date and specified price and an equivalent short contract to sell the same stock to merit at another future date and specified price.a rise in the value of one contract,or leg,ordinarily approximates a decline in the value of the other leg,functioning as a hedge against adverse market moves.while the price differential between two legs may change,a straddle carries substantially less risk than a single short or long correspondingly less profit potential.ownership of combination spreads further limited the risk to investors through the acquisition of two straddles on the same underlying security.in order for a combination spread to undergo a net change in value,the price differential between the legs of one straddle would have to change with respect to the price differential of the legs of the other straddle.
nearly all of the trades in merit stock forwards program exhibited an pattern.an investor opened a position by buying or selling a straddle.late in the year of purchase,the investor would sell or cancel the losing a tax purchase a replacement leg the switch,waiting until the new tax year to close out his or her position and recognize gains approximating taxable losses from the previous december.although cancellations are typically used in derivatives trading only to correct errors,see freytag comm r,cir,aff on other issues,d,merit promotional materials advertised that positions could be canceled and losses from cancellations could be deducted as ordinary losses.
because the forward contracts were not subject to the loss disallowance rules of erta,investors could continue to enjoy the tax advantages of the sequence no longer available through merit option programs.merit offering memorandum for the stock forwards program included an extended discussion of its tax advantages in contrast,detailed projections of actual economic returns were notably absent from the document.
the high volatility of the stocks chosen as the underlying securities in the program ensured that substantial tax losses would be available at year end.the stock forwards program was open only to sophisticated,experienced investors,and merit small group of clients transacted almost exclusively among themselves,never with unrelated participants,making competitive pricing improbable at best.
merit profited from operation of its markets in two ways.first,it charged a fee known as a differential,which,with few exceptions,was used only on opening transactions.second,it retained the interest on participants margin deposits.merit investors maintained margin accounts in amounts much larger than its explicit margin policy would suggest was necessary.for example,taxpayer had approximately million on deposit for over a year,while his margin requirement averaged less than.
instruments traded on the stock forwards market were not listed on any formal exchange,registered with the securities and exchange commission or sold anywhere outside the merit market,and the prices of the contracts were determined according to a formula.although option and forward contracts contemplate actual delivery of the underlying commodity or security,delivery was the rare exception in the merit programs out of transactions,investors took delivery on only two,and taxpayer never took delivery see freytag,at it is the norm that marketplace investors enter into forward contracts intending to take or make delivery of the underlying security on a specified date.
in,the first year of the stock forwards program,every participant took a loss,for aggregate losses of million.those losses were accompanied by simultaneous replacement contracts and by aggregate unrealized gains of million.in,the aggregate loss incurred late in the year was million,and the amount of offsetting unrealized gains was million.
taxpayer results in the stock forwards program mimicked that pattern.in,his net losses of in the merit programs were within of his adjusted gross income agi a difference of only offsetting his entire agi for that year.of his seventeen transactions in that year,only one produced a gain.all of taxpayer closing transactions in december of produced realized losses.in,his december losses offset percent of his adjusted gross income for that year,including gains incurred in january by closing out his straddles.of taxpayer closing transactions in december,each produced a loss,for a total of.
amid concern that taxpayers were exploiting a loophole to achieve tax deferral,congress repealed its exception of stock from the loss disallowance rules of,effective for positions established after december.see deficit reduction act of defra,stat.taxpayer ended his participation in the stock forwards program in january.
the commissioner disallowed taxpayer claimed merit losses from,and and issued a notice of deficiencies and additions to tax.following trial,the tax court determined keeler liability in the following amounts 
the tax court also ordered additions to tax pursuant to a in amounts equal to fifty percent of the statutory interest on his deficiencies,as well as increased interest on underpayments attributable to transactions pursuant to c.
in inquiring whether taxpayer deductions were properly disallowed,we look past the form of the transactions at issue and examine their substance.we conclude the tax court properly determined that the merit trades were intended as generators of tax benefits,not of economic profits.see leema,slip op.at t he substance of the merit transactions did not reflect their form.the form was the investment in financial products the substance was the production of tax deductions.
economic substance 
when examining a finding that a transaction lacks economic substance,this court reviews findings of f
