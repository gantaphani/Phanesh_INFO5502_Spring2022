this appeal involves the federal tax return filed by the metro leasing and development corporation and the east bay chevrolet company collectively metro leasing,two small,california corporations.we must decide whether the united states tax court properly determined the amount of a corporate officer salary that metro leasing may deduct as a reasonable business expense under a.we affirm because the tax court did not clearly err when it adjusted the amount of this deduction.see elliotts,comm r,cir.
we must also resolve when a paid,but contested,federal income tax accrues for purposes of the accumulated earnings tax penalty under b.this section provides that,when calculating the accumulated taxable income to which the tax is applied,a corporate taxpayer may deduct only those federal income taxes that had accrued in the taxable year in question.here,the tax court did not permit metro leasing to deduct a contested tax liability that it paid in while its appeal in the tax court was pending.this presents a question of first impression in our circuit.we decline to follow the fifth circuit decision in rutter rex comm r,cir,and hold that a contested tax liability that is paid before the legal contest is resolved does not accrue in the taxable year in which it was originally assessed.we affirm the tax court ruling on this issue as well.
george valente owned of metro leasing common stock and served as its director.when he fell ill in,his wife lena served as the president.despite his illness,valente remained actively involved in the business.the tax court found that he continued to make most of the business decisions,which valente then carried out.valente determined his salary each year based on the profitability of the business,and he and his wife were paid an undivided amount to compensate them for their joint efforts.metro leasing did not issue shareholder dividends from or from,though dividends ranging from to were paid to valente,the sole shareholder,during.metro leasing only other employee during this time was a corporate secretary who maintained the company financial records.
metro leasing business ventures included valente consultation to a san francisco bay area automobile dealership he once owned,as well as the ownership and lease of real property,buildings,and automobiles.one key transaction in this appeal is metro leasing january sale of a piece of real property in south san francisco on an installment basis,which resulted in a mortgage receivable of secured by the property itself.
in,metro leasing paid the valentes a salary of,which included a bonus of.the company then deducted their compensation on its federal income tax return as a reasonable business expense under a metro leasing return reported a total income of from interest,rents,net capital gains,late payment fees,and net gain from the sale of real property.the company paid only in federal taxes that year.
in general,corporations may not deduct the dividends they pay to shareholders from their federal income tax returns,and shareholders are taxed on the dividends they receive.for many small corporations in which the shareholders are also employees or officers,this creates an incentive to either retain profits or to pay them out as salary rather than as dividends.to discourage businesses from sheltering potential tax revenue in this manner,the internal revenue code permits corporations to deduct only reasonable amounts for employee salaries,see id.a,and taxes any unreasonable accumulation of earnings,see id.in february,the commissioner of internal revenue commissioner issued a statutory notice of deficiency to metro leasing regarding its income tax return,citing both of these concerns.
first,after examining corporate documents and comparing data about corporate officers salary levels in similar and estate businesses,the commissioner determined that the valentes had been paid an unreasonable or excessive salary under a and concluded that metro leasing should be allowed to deduct only as a reasonable amount for officer compensation that year.in addition,the commissioner assessed an accumulated earnings tax pursuant to finding that metro leasing was a mere holding or investment company that had unreasonably accumulated its earnings and income for the purpose of avoiding shareholder income tax.see id.b.
metro leasing appealed the commissioner decisions to the united states tax court.metro leasing dev.comm r,cch hereinafter metro leasing i.the tax court agreed that the valentes salaries were unjustified in light of the actual work they had performed for metro leasing in,and thus could not be completely deducted.at.however,because it found that their efforts in the sale of some assets had contributed to a measurable increase in metro leasing income that year,the court added to the commissioner figure resulting in a total allowed deduction of.id.at.the court next agreed that metro leasing was a mere holding company under b and was thus properly subject to the accumulated earnings tax in the amount of.id.at.
in august,approximately three months after the tax court initial decision,metro leasing tendered a payment of to cover any income taxes and accumulated earnings tax it would be found to owe in september,following tax court rule metro leasing and the commissioner both submitted proposed computations of metro leasing accumulated income tax to the tax court for its review.
not surprisingly,the parties provided different calculations of metro leasing accumulated taxable income under.the commissioner permitted metro leasing to deduct only the taxes the company initially paid in,while metro leasing sought to also deduct the payment it had made in august.see b permitting corporations to deduct from their accumulated taxable income any federal income taxes that had accrued during the taxable year.because the parties disagreed about the proper calculation,the tax court also reviewed this dispute.see tax.b and c.
in a supplemental opinion,the tax court rejected metro leasing proposed computation.metro leasing dev.comm r,wl hereinafter metro leasing ii.the court declined to follow the fifth circuit decision in rutter rex comm r,cir,and did not allow metro leasing to deduct its paid,yet still contested,tax liability for.see metro leasing ii,at.

to assess whether the valentes salaries were reasonable under a,the tax court applied the analysis we established in elliotts,comm r,cir,by addressing the valentes role in the corporation the salaries paid by similar companies for like services metro leasing character and condition any conflicts of interest in which metro leasing may be disguising shareholder dividends as salary and the internal consistency of the compensation plan.see metro leasing i,at following elliotts,at.
in addition,the tax court noted that in elliotts,we recognized that it is helpful to consider the matter from the perspective of a hypothetical independent investor,by asking whether an inactive,independent investor would be willing to compensate the employee as he was compensated.id.at citing elliotts,at.unlike other circuits that rely primarily on this independent investor test,see exacto spring comm r,cir,or use the perspective of an independent investor as the lens through which the other factors are viewed,see rapco,comm r,cir,our approach deems none of these factors to be decisive or controlling.see elliotts,at see also william barnard,the unreasonable compensation issue rises from the dead and takes on the independent investor,tax,comparing our test to the approach adopted by the seventh circuit in exacto spring.when considering the perspective of an independent investor,reviewing courts should examine the nature and quality of the services a corporate officer provides,as well as the effect of those services on the return the investor is seeing on his investment.elliotts,at.
after examining all of these factors,the tax court agreed with the commissioner that metro leasing claimed deduction for the valentes compensation was excessive in relation to the work they had actually performed in.metro leasing i,at.metro leasing does not dispute this conclusion.however,the court then determined that metro leasing was entitled to a small increase from the amount the commissioner had determined was reasonable,to reflect the increase in income generated by the valentes during.id.metro leasing now challenges the figures the trial court used to calculate this small increase,contending that they do not comply with the elliotts,independent investor test.
the court explained that this additional deductible amount was calculated as follows first,it subtracted metro leasing average income over the past three years from the income that it reported on its tax return to find that its income in was greater than its average yearly earnings in the recent past.id.at.however,the court noted that this figure included worth of income from recapture of depreciation,so it excluded that amount.id.it then roughly divided by half the remaining increase in income to reach a bonus of.id.at.the court noted that this amount was simply an approximation because u nfortunately,the parties did not provide the court with appropriate expert testimony or some methodology by which to decide the quantum of compensation bonus to be attributed to the results obtained by the valentes efforts.id.at.
although metro leasing does not object to the court basic methodology,it claims that the court failed to properly account for proceeds from the corporation sale of its south san francisco property in,which resulted in a taxable gain of metro leasing contends that instead of looking to its tax return to determine the corporation gain from that sale,the court should have used the figures that would matter to an independent investor the corporation financial accounting statements.
the gain from the sale of this property is counted differently for tax and financial reporting purposes.from a tax perspective,metro leasing total gain on the sale of the south san francisco property was not taxed all at once in the year of the sale.instead,the corporation was taxed annually on the installment payments it received from the property buyer during each year in,the property buyer made payments totaling,of which only was required to be reported as taxable income.therefore,for tax purposes only a small amount of gain from this sale counted towards metro leasing income in.
in contrast,for financial accounting purposes metro leasing recognized and reported as earned income the full gain in because the corporation employs the accrual method of accounting,which counts income at the time of sale instead of when the buyer installment payments are actually received.metro leasing reasons that because the tax court was applying an independent investor test,it should have looked at the large gain reported in the corporation financial accounting statement because that is what an independent investor would have done see thor power tool comm r,d noting that tax return income figures are not typically used by investors to measure a company annual performance.
however,metro leasing fails to recognize that the perspective of an independent investor is but one of many factors that are to be considered when assessing the reasonableness of an executive officer compensation.see elliotts,at.the tax court adequately addressed this factor by examining,in great detail,how an outside investor would have viewed the valentes efforts that year and the income resulting from the work they actually performed.see metro leasing i,at.because its calculation of the bonus amount was simply a rough approximation designed to give some credit for the results of the work the valentes performed in,we can not conclude that the tax court clearly erred by permitting metro leasing to deduct this additional portion of the valentes salary.see labelgraphics,at.
metro leasing also contends that the court erred by failing to include,as part of the company profits for,the that it characterized as recapture of depreciation.the court did not count this amount as part of metro leasing income for because it could not be attributed to any work actually performed by and valente,and the court was attempting to calculate how much additional income the valentes efforts had actually produced.metro leasing i,at.it did not clearly err by excluding this amount.
after a thorough analysis in which it examined all the factors required by elliotts,the tax court made a reasonable calculation of the proper deduction metro leasing may make for the valentes compensation.because we are not left with a definite and firm conviction that an error was made,united states gypsum,at,we affirm the court decision.
we next consider the tax court determination that metro leasing may not deduct the payment of its contested tax deficiency as an accrued federal income tax under b.we review de novo the tax court interpretation of the internal revenue code and related regulations.see boeing united states,cir.
in,imposed a tax on the amount of income that a corporation had unreasonably accumulated known for purposes of the internal revenue code as the corporation accumulated taxable income.this accumulated earnings tax is a penalty imposed on corporations that are formed for the purpose of avoiding income tax by permitting their earnings and profits to accumulate,instead of distributing them as shareholder dividends.a.in essence,it is designed to force businesses to distribute any excess profits they do not need for normal business operations so shareholders can then receive them as income and be taxed on the dividends received.helvering chi.stock yards.the tax percentage is applied to a corporation accumulated taxable income,a figure that is calculated by making several adjustments to regular taxable income.see listing various deductions and adjustments.
metro leasing tendered a payment on august,after the metro leasing i decision issued but while the case was still pending before the tax court.this payment was intended to cover any deficiency the corporation might be found to owe for.the parties then submitted proposed computations of metro leasing accumulated earnings tax pursuant to tax court rule.metro leasing computation deducted this payment,but the commissioner did not.metro leasing appeal requires us to decide whether this paid,but still contested,income tax deficiency may be deducted from metro leasing accumulated taxable income under b.this is purely a question of statutory interpretation.
our first step in interpreting a statute is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.robinson shell oil,d.when a statute text contains undefined terms,we construe them in accordance with their ordinary meanings.fed.deposit ins.meyer,d.
section b provides 
b adjustments to taxable purposes of subsection a defining accumulated taxable income,taxable income shall be adjusted as follows 
shall be allowed as a deduction federal income and excess profits taxes and income,war profits,and excess profits taxes of foreign countries and possessions of the united states accrued during the taxable year.
b.we must interpret the phrase accrued during the taxable year to determine whether metro leasing tax liability that was paid in qualifies as such.
the ordinary meaning of this statutory language has been in the tax context for many years.basic principles of accrual accounting were first set forth by the united states supreme court in united states anderson.the court held that before an expense becomes deductible,all events which fix the amount and the taxpayer unconditional obligation to pay must have occurred.id.at.
in this all events test was engrafted into the internal revenue code.see deficit reduction act of,a,stat,codified at h.in general,an accrual basis taxpayer may not deduct an expense until all events have occurred that determine the fact of liability the amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy and economic performance or payment has occurred.see h see also reg.a reflecting these three elements in the codified version of the all events test.
under the third factor of the test,the time when economic performance of a tax liability has occurred is when the tax is paid to the governmental authority that imposed the tax.reg.g see also h d permitting the secretary of the treasury to prescribe regulations for any liabilities not specifically listed in h a c.if a taxpayer chooses to pay an income tax deficiency rather than challenge it,the all events test is considered to be met at the close of the deficiency year.see lutz comm r,cir adopting dravo united states.in contrast,when a taxpayer contests a tax liability in court,the all events test is not satisfied until the legal challenge is resolved,because until then the amount of the liability and the obligation to pay it are not certain.dixie pine prods.comm r.
in,the supreme court extended the all events test to taxpayers who had paid,but continued to contest,a tax liability.see united states consol.edison,d.shortly thereafter,congress carved out an exception to consolidated edison by permitting contested taxes to be deducted in the year of payment if certain criteria are met,even if the taxpayer legal dispute is not conclusively resolved until later.f as defined by the supreme court and congress,traditional principles of accrual can be summarized as follows the all events test is not met with respect to a contested tax that liability has not the year in which the legal contest is finally resolved.however,if the contested liability is paid before the legal contest concludes,the liability may be deductible in the year of payment pursuant to f.see metro leasing ii,at halpern,concurring.
the eighth circuit was the first of our sister courts to conclude that the all events test and traditional principles of accrual applied to statutory language similar to that found in b.in estate of goodall comm r,cir,the court considered d a,which permitted a deduction for accrued federal income taxes when computing an element of the former version of the accumulated earnings tax.id.at see also metro leasing ii,at halpern,concurring noting that was a precursor to.relying on dixie pine,the estate of goodall court held that the all events test should apply when determining whether a corporation federal income taxes had accrued during the taxable year.at.relying in turn on estate of goodall,the tax court has held that dixie pine and its progeny should apply to the accrued income tax deduction under b,so that the meaning of accrued is consistent with other cases.see,comm r,wl.
given the authorities discussed above,we agree with the commissioner that,unless some exception applies,see infra part,the phrase accrued during the taxable year in b should be interpreted in accordance with these principles.
because the statutory language is not ambiguous,there is no need to rely on the department of treasury regulations or administrative rulings that interpret.see chevron,natural.res.def.council,d holding that courts should defer to an administrative agency interpretation only when the statute is silent or ambiguous.however,we do note that our conclusion is consistent with treasury regulation a,which reads in relevant part 
the b deduction is for taxes accrued during the taxable year,regardless of whether the corporation uses an accrual method of accounting,the cash receipts and disbursements method,or any other allowable method of accounting.in computing the amount of taxes accrued,an unpaid tax which is being contested is not considered accrued until the contest is resolved.
see reg.a emphasis added though the last sentence of this regulation is silent as to the treatment of paid but contested taxes,as we have in this case,this language does seem to apply dixie pine to situations involving unpaid taxes.the internal revenue service has also concluded that the all events test should apply to b,having issued a ruling that unpaid federal income taxes are only deductible under that section in the year that the contest is resolved,not the year in which they were originally assessed.see rul,
notwithstanding the clear meaning of these traditional principles of accrual and their logical application to b,metro leasing urges us to read the statute to permit deductions for taxpayers who pay their contested deficiencies before the legal contest has concluded.this same argument was first considered by the tax court in rutter rex comm r,cch.in that case,the commissioner assessed tax deficiencies for and,which the taxpayer proposed to pay in before the entry of decision.id.consistent with dixie pine and estate of goodall,the tax court concluded that traditional concepts of accrual should apply to bar deduction of this payment from the computation of the taxpayer accumulated taxable income under b.id.
however,on appeal the court of appeals for the fifth circuit reversed.rutter rex comm r.after recognizing that traditional principles of accrual should apply,see id.at,the rutter rex court agreed that these taxes were contested but questioned whether they had accrued in and,the years they were assessed and attributed in,the year of payment or sometime in the future when the legal contest would be conclusively resolved by the exhaustion of appellate remedies.id.at.concluding that the tax court had read b too narrowly,the fifth circuit decided that the tax deficiency at issue accrued in the year in which it was originally assessed.id.at.
the fifth circuit conclusion was based primarily on equitable considerations.it first noted that the accumulated earnings tax was a penalty that must be strictly construed,id.at citing ivan allen united states,d,and emphasized that it would be inconsistent and unfair to disallow a deduction for taxpayers who are willing to pay the disputed amount while their appeals continue.id.the court concluded that there was no evidence that congress intended this inequitable result.id.the court also relied on the final sentence of reg.a,noting that while the regulation specifically mentions unpaid tax deficiencies,it says nothing about paid deficiencies.id.at.
furthermore,the fifth circuit did not agree that the all events test and traditional principles of accrual should be indiscriminately applied when determining a corporation accumulated taxable income,because doing so would lead to an an overt upward distortion in the company accumulated taxable income that has no basis in economic reality.id.not permitting a deduction for these paid but contested taxes,the court reasoned,would cause a corporation to pay accumulated earnings tax on money that it had already paid to the internal revenue service.id.therefore,the court concluded that a distinction from general accrual rules should be made to better determin e the actual economic reality of the corporation for the year at issue,or else the accumulated earnings tax would become unfair and oppressive.id.at.the fifth circuit emphasized that its holding was not an abandonment of dixie pine all events test,but simply a narrow exception for purposes of b.id.
in the proceedings below,the metro leasing ii court specifically disagreed with two aspects of the fifth circuit decision.see rusty brewer,note,a strain between the contested tax liability accrual doctrine and the accumulated earnings tax metro leasing and dev.comm r,tax law.first,the tax court examined the last sentence of reg.a a n unpaid tax
