the opinion filed on july,and appearing at cir is withdrawn.the superseding opinion will be filed concurrently with this order.
the government petition for rehearing en banc is denied as moot.
the parties may file new petitions for rehearing or rehearing en banc as provided by federal rule of appellate procedure.
we are called upon to decide whether petitioners convictions for subscribing to a false statement on a tax return and for aiding and assisting in the preparation of a false tax return qualify as aggravated felonies that subject them to removal under the relevant immigration laws.
this is our third published opinion in this case.in our first opinion,kawashima gonzales,cir,withdrawn cir kawashima i,we conducted a limited examination of the record of petitioners convictions to answer such question.one day after our panel opinion was filed,our en banc court decided gonzales,cir en banc,which caused us to reconsider.we published a second opinion,kawashima mukasey,cir,withdrawn,wl cir kawashima ii,in which we answered the question by applying to kawashima conviction in light of our circuit existing caselaw construing the statute defining aggravated felony.
after we published our second opinion,the government filed a petition for rehearing en banc.while the government petition was pending before us,the supreme court granted certiorari in nijhawan attorney general,cir,cert.granted,d.like the case before us,nijhawan concerned whether a particular conviction for a financial offense constitutes an aggravated felony under relevant immigration laws.after the court issued its opinion,nijhawan holder,d,we ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs on nijhawan impact on the case before us.in light of this recent guidance from the court,we issue this hopefully final opinion in this litigation.
akio kawashima and fusako kawashima are natives and citizens of japan.the kawashimas were admitted to the united states as lawful permanent residents on june.
in,kawashima pled guilty to subscribing to a false statement on a tax return,in violation of.in his plea agreement,he stipulated that the total actual tax loss for the purpose of determining his offense level under the sentencing guidelines was.kawashima further conceded that he could be ordered to pay the same amount in restitution.on the same date,kawashima pled guilty to aiding and assisting in the preparation of a false tax return,in violation of.her plea agreement was not included in the record before us.
on august,the immigration and naturalization service issued separate notices to appear to the kawashimas alleging that the couple was removable because their prior convictions constituted aggravated felonies under a m i subsection m i defining as an aggravated felony any offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds.see id.a a iii stating that a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable 
after holding a removal hearing,an immigration judge ij concluded that the kawashimas convictions were aggravated felonies under subsection m i.accordingly,the ij found the kawashimas removable,denied their motion to terminate the proceedings,and ordered that they be removed to japan.
the kawashimas appealed the decision,and the board of immigration appeals bia remanded because the transcript containing the testimony of the hearing and the ij oral decision was defective.after further proceedings,the ij again denied the kawashimas motion to terminate proceedings and ordered them removed to japan.the bia affirmed and adopted the ij decision.
the kawashimas subsequently filed a motion to reopen seeking waiver of inadmissibility under the immigration and nationality act ina c,c repealed.the bia denied the motion as untimely.
the kawashimas timely filed separate petitions for review of the bia affirmance of the ij removal order and the bia denial of their motion to reopen.we consolidated the petitions for review pursuant to b.we consider each in turn.
we are faced with the task of determining whether kawashima conviction for willfully making and subscribing to a false statement on a tax return,in violation of,and kawashima conviction for aiding and assisting in the preparation of a false tax return,in violation of,constitute aggravated felonies.section a m defines an aggravated felony to include an offense that i involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds or ii is described in section of title relating to tax evasion in which the revenue loss to the government exceeds.a m i ii.
as a threshold statutory interpretation matter,we must decide whether tax offenses other than those described in qualify as aggravated felonies under subsection m i in their supplemental brief to this court,the kawashimas renew their argument,first raised in their opining brief,that subsection m i is inapplicable in this case.they reason that subsection m ii specific reference to indicates congress intent to exclude all federal tax offenses from the definition of aggravated felonies under the more general subsection m i.in our initial opinion in this case,we rejected this argument.kawashima gonzales kawashima i,cir.our ultimate view of this issue remains unchanged.
the plain text of subsection m i sets forth two requirements for an offense to qualify as an aggravated felony.first,the offense must involve fraud or deceit.second,the loss to the victim or victims must exceed.ferreira ashcroft,cir.in our view,and necessarily involve fraud or deceit because the provisions require the government to prove either that the defendant willfully subscribed to a statement in a tax return he did not believe to be true,or that the defendant willfully aided and assisted in the making of a false or fraudulent return.moreover,because the government is a qualifying victim,see,balogun attorney,cir,a tax loss in excess of satisfies the second prong of subsection m i.thus,according to the plain meaning of the statutory language,convictions for violating and in which the tax loss to the government exceeds constitute aggravated felonies under subsection m i.mukasey,cir.and because such interpretation does not lead to an absurd or unreasonable result,our inquiry must end 
we recognize that a divided panel of the third circuit reached a contrary conclusion in ki se lee ashcroft,cir there,the court found that the presence of subsection m ii reflected congress intent to specify tax evasion as the only removable tax offense,and thereby exclude tax offenses from the scope of subsection m i.writing in dissent,however,now justice alito concluded that the plain text of subsection m i did not preclude the inclusion of tax offenses within its definition of aggravated felonies.id.at alito,dissenting.we are persuaded by judge alito interpretation of the statute.
the court in ki se lee applied two interpretive canons in support of its reading.first,the court applied the canon that prescribes that,whenever possible,a statute should be interpreted to avoid rendering other provisions superfluous.id.at.in the court view,reading subsection m i to include tax offenses would render subsection m ii superfluous because any of the tax evasion offenses described by would fall within the scope of subsection m i fraud or deceit provision.id.at.second,the court applied the familiar canon that the specific governs the general.id.at.noting that subsection m i is a general provision that covers fraud and deceit and subsection m ii is a narrower provision that only covers federal tax evasion,the court reasoned that this canon also supported its conclusion that tax evasion in violation of,as described in subsection m ii,is the only removable tax offense.id.at 
while such canons are valuable tools in interpreting a statute text,it is unnecessary to resort to these devices where,as with subsection m i,the statutory text is clear.see ki se lee,at alito,dissenting see also clark martinez,d.subsection m i plainly categorizes an offense as an aggravated felony as long as it includes two elements,fraud and deceit and loss to the victim in excess of.no further limitations are imposed.
further,the interpretation adopted by the court in ki se lee imputes an intent to congress that is not supported by the statute text.as the dissent in ki se lee noted,i f congress had not wanted subsection m i to apply to tax offenses,congress surely would have included some language in that provision to signal that intention.as adopted,however,subsection m i contains no such hint.id.
finally,there are many reasons why congress might have included subsection m ii even though many,if not all,of the tax offenses it describes would fall within the scope of subsection m i.as the dissent in ki se lee emphasized,s ubsection m ii may have been enacted simply to make at the risk of tax evasion qualifies as an aggravated felony.id.although we recognize that the avoidance of surplusage in statutory text is an important goal,congress harbors other important goals as well when adopting legislation.judge alito dissent suggested two examples.first,even if congress could not think of a tax evasion offense under that would not involve fraud or deceit and therefore be adequately covered by subsection m i,congress has often realized its inability to anticipate every possible type of case,and may have added subsection m ii just to ensure that no tax evasion case fell outside subsection m definition of an aggravated felony.id.at.alternatively,congress might have wanted to ensure that no court would hold that tax evasion falls outside the definition of an aggravated felony simply because fraud and deceit are not specific elements of that offense.id.at.
we therefore respectfully decline to adopt the third circuit interpretation of subsection m i.as noted above,our view is bolstered by the fifth circuit recent decision to reject ki se lee in light of our prior holding in kawashima,at.accordingly,we reaffirm that tax offenses not covered by subsection m ii specific reference to qualify as aggravated felonies under subsection m i where the loss exceeds.
our next task is to determine whether the kawashimas convictions under and are aggravated felonies within subsection m i definition.in answering this question,we have the benefit of the supreme court recent opinion in nijhawan holder,d,which explained the analysis we must follow in answering this question.in nijhawan,the court considered the applicability of subsection m i to manoj nijhawan,an alien who was convicted for a variety of federal fraud offenses.id.at.none of the statutes under which nijhawan was convicted required the government to prove the amount of his victims loss to the jury.at sentencing,however,nijhawan stipulated that the total loss to his victims exceeded million.id.
based on these convictions,the government sought to remove nijhawan from the united states,arguing that his conviction for fraud and his stipulation at sentencing combined to demonstrate that his conviction constituted an aggravated felony under subsection m i.the court agreed with the government.in so doing,it added a new step to the familiar approaches first announced in taylor united states,d.nijhawan.at.under this approach,we must first decide whether a requirement under a generic crime is an element of the generic crime instead of simply a description of the particular circumstances in which the offender committed the crime on a specific occasion.id.at.if the requirement is an element,we apply the taylor approach if the requirement is circumstance specific,we ensure that the bia used fundamentally fair procedures to determine whether the offender crime satisfies the description of the generic offense.id.at.
with these principles of analysis established,we consider akio and fusako cases separately.
the information,plea agreement,and admission in kawashima case establish that he was convicted of violating.that section has four elements the defendant made and subscribed a return,statement,or other document that was incorrect as to a material matter the return,statement,or other document subscribed by the defendant contained a written declaration that it was made under the penalties of perjury the defendant did not believe the return,statement,or other document to be true and correct as to every material matter and the defendant falsely subscribed to the return,statement,or other document willfully,with the specific intent to violate the law.united states boulware,cir emphasis added.thus,kawashima conviction under necessarily involved fraud or deceit.see ki se lee,at alito,dissenting fraud or deceit is a necessary element of.
moreover,the bia followed fundamentally fair procedures in finding that the offense for which kawashima was convicted resulted in a loss to the government of more than.specifically,kawashima stipulated in the plea agreement that the total actual tax loss was.given that in nijhawan,the supreme court relied on such a stipulation to conclude that a petitioner prior crime was an aggravated felony under subsection m i,we can not conclude that the bia reliance on such a stipulation in this case was improper.
based on the evidence available to us in the administrative record,we conclude that clear and convincing evidence supports the bia determination that kawashima conviction under constitutes an aggravated felony as described in subsection m i because it involved fraud or deceit and because his offense resulted in a loss to the government in excess of.accordingly,we deny kawashima petition for review of the bia affirmance of the ij order.
the record of conviction in kawashima case establishes that she was convicted of aiding and assisting in the preparation of a false tax return,in violation of that section requires the government to prove the following the defendant aided,assisted,or otherwise caused the preparation and presentation of a return that the return was fraudulent or false as to a material matter and the act of the defendant was willful.united states salerno,cir emphasis added.moreover,as we observed in salerno,t he supreme court has repeatedly held that in order to make out a willful violation of section the government must prove defendants acted with specific intent to defraud the government in the enforcement of its tax laws.id.thus,a conviction under necessarily involves fraud or deceit and therefore satisfies the first element of an aggravated felony as described in subsection m i.
as to the second element,in kawashima i we concluded that the record of conviction did not contain sufficient evidence to establish that kawashima offense resulted in a loss to the government in excess of.at.that conclusion was predicated on our assumption that our analysis should proceed under taylor modified categorical approach,and therefore the scope of our review was limited to the types of documents described in shepard united states,d,and its progeny.
that assumption,it turns out,was wrong.in nijhawan,the petitioner argued that an immigration court deciding whether an aggravated felony meets subsection m i threshold should look only to the charging documents,jury instructions,and any special jury finding if one has been requested.if there was a guilty plea and no trial the subsequent court should examine the written plea documents or the plea colloquy.at.the court rejected this argument,stating that 
nothing in prior law that so limits the immigration court t he cases that developed the evidentiary list to which nijhawan points developed that list for a very different purpose,namely that of determining which statutory phrase contained within a statutory provision that covers several different generic crimes covered a prior conviction.for another,nijhawan proposal itself can prove impractical insofar as it requires obtaining from a jury a special verdict on a fact that is not an element of the offense.
further,a deportation proceeding is a civil proceeding in which the government does not have to prove its claim beyond a reasonable doubt.
id.at.thus,the bia is not limited to only those documents which a court applying the modified categorical approach may review.
given this,the government argues that we should remand this case to the bia so that the agency may determine,in the first instance,what addit
