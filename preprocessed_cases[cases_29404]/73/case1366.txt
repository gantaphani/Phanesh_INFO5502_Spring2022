after paying under protest an excise tax for importing products containing ozone depleting chemicals odcs,the panasonic communications corporation of america panasonic filed suit seeking a refund based on alleged flaws in a gas chromatography test performed by the government during a tax audit to check for odcs.during discovery,the united states court of federal claims compelled the government to turn over the audit tests and related information of taxpayer entities similarly tested,to help assess the validity and reliability of the test methodology.this court is asked to decide as a matter of first impression whether that discovery can be sustained in light of the internal revenue code general prohibition against disclosure of tax return information.a,a.because we hold that it can not and that the court order was a clear abuse of discretion,we grant the petition.
a brief description of the excise tax on odcs and the government audit process relating to imports will be helpful in understanding the issue raised by this petition.
chlorofluorocarbons cfcs and halons are chemical compounds often used as refrigerants,cleaners,solvents,sterilants,and propellants in the manufacture of insulation,fast food cartons,and electronic items.their longevity and stability allow them to persist in the atmosphere long enough to rise into the stratosphere twelve to thirty miles above the earth.once there,the ultraviolet radiation from the sun causes cfcs and halons to become unstable,break apart,and release chlorine atoms,which readily react with the earth ozone layer.
to discourage further depletion of the ozone layer,a imposes an excise tax on any product imported for consumption,use,or warehousing,which is sold or used in the united states and in which any odcs were used as material in the manufacturing or production of the product.the total liability for the excise tax for imported taxable products is reported on a quarterly basis on irs form.
manufacturers are allowed to the excise tax owed based on the weight of each odc used as a material in the imported product and to submit as supporting proof a letter signed by the manufacturer that adequately identifies the product and states the weight of each odc used as a material in the product manufacture.
the internal revenue service irs,however,found that many foreign manufacturers were not paying the tax and were instead submitting letters claiming to have never used odcs or to have eliminated their use to avoid the costs of switching to manufacturing processes.this led the irs to contract with the pacific northwest national laboratory pnnl,a federally funded research center,to develop a test to determine whether odcs were being used in the manufacture of imported items and to assist the irs in auditing reporting companies.
to the extent relevant here,according to the ozone depleting chemicals odc excise tax audit techniques guide,available on the irs website after placing the electronic circuit board of an item being testing in a sterile environment,pnnl subjects it to various levels of heat.the gases released from the board at each temperature level are captured and analyzed in order to detect for the presence,although not the actual quantity,of odcs in the board.
the facts relevant to this petition are not in dispute.
during the calendar quarters ending june,through december,panasonic manufactured and imported for sale in the united states consumer telephones assembled in tijuana,mexico.panasonic reported that it owed no excise tax and submitted a certified letter from its overseas manufacturers and suppliers stating that no odcs were used in the manufacture of the phones.
in,the irs audited panasonic imports.pnnl purchased panasonic phones from retail stores and tested the phones circuit boards.after completing its audit,the irs assessed panasonic a total of in excise taxes,penalties,and interest payments.
panasonic paid the odc excise tax assessments for two alleged taxable transactions for the quarterly tax period ending september,and for one alleged taxable transaction in each remaining quarterly tax period ending june,through december.it then filed a complaint in the court of federal claims seeking a refund.panasonic complaint asserts that no odcs were ever used in its manufacturing process,and that pnnl testing procedures are scientifically invalid and unreliable.
in preparation for a on the validity and reliability of pnnl testing procedures,panasonic sought to discover information regarding pnnl testing of commercial products during the irs audit of other taxpayers.
for instance,panasonic interrogatory reads in relevant part i dentify all instances in which the irs has used testing for odcs as a basis to determine or consider whether excise taxes should be imposed on any taxpayer other than panasonic including for each case the testing methodologies used,the results of the testing,whether odcs were detected,the amount of the taxes assessed,and whether the assessment was appealed or contested.
after the united states refused to turn over the requested materials on confidentiality grounds,panasonic sought and obtained from the court of federal claims an order compelling discovery.
the court held that,while the information sought was return information as broadly defined under a,and thus generally prohibited from disclosure by the irs,it was nonetheless authorized to be disclosed in these proceedings under the enumerated exception provided in h b.panasonic commc ns of am.united states,cv slip op.at.that provision authorizes disclosure of tax information on a tax return in a judicial or administrative proceeding pertaining to tax administration if the treatment of an item reflected on such return is directly related to the resolution of an issue in the proceeding.h b.
the court determined that pnnl testing activities relating to other taxpayers were derivatively part of the treatment of odc tax liability,which is the item identified by plaintiff and which is reflected on the taxpayer return,whether as a specific line item or as part of the overall tax liability reported.panasonic,slip.op.at.the court therefore concluded that the information was subject to the h b exception.id.the court also determined that pnnl testing of other taxpayers products met the directly related requirement of h b because panasonic discovery was directed to the purpose of the,that is,the validity of the scientific testing for odcs employed by pnnl,not to a direct comparison of its excise tax assessment with that of other taxpayers id.
before this court,the united states contends that the court of federal claims improperly interpreted h b in compelling discovery,so as to require the irs to turn over information it is statutorily required to keep confidential.thus,the united states urges that this court issue a writ of mandamus directing the court of federal claims to vacate its order compelling disclosure.
pursuant to the all writs act,a,this court has authority to issue the requested writ as necessary or appropriate in aid of jurisdiction.the use of mandamus is limited to correcting a lower court usurpation of judicial power or clear abuse of discretion.cheney dist.court,u,see also in re regents of the of.
notwithstanding the extraordinary nature of such relief,this court has issued the writ in appropriate cases to prevent the wrongful exposure of privileged or confidential communications.see regents,at see also mohawk.carpenter,noting that an appellate court may grant a writ of mandamus to correct a particularly injurious or novel privilege ruling.
thus,in in re seagate technology,llc,en banc,we explained that mandamus review may be granted of discovery orders that turn on claims of privilege or confidentiality when there is raised an important issue of first impression,the privilege would be lost if review were denied until final judgment,and immediate resolution would avoid the development of doctrine that would undermine the privilege.quoting regents,at.
these criteria are met here.the tax law requires millions of individuals and business entities to furnish the irs with highly confidential information.this informati
