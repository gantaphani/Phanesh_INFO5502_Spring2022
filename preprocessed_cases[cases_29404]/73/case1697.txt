this appeal concerns a claim for refund of property taxes.respondent,the county of santa clara county,issued to appellant amdahl corporation amdahl escape assessments covering a span from through.the property assessed involves a pool of spare parts used by amdahl to service and repair its customers computer equipment under extended service contracts.the county and amdahl reached agreement as to the value of the spare parts pool subject to the tax,and amdahl paid the taxes and interest thereon,which amounted to approximately and,respectively.
amdahl brought this action under revenue and taxation code section et,for refund of the property taxes paid amdahl claimed that the spare parts pool is exempt from taxation under section,which provides that no property taxes shall be assessed on business inventories.
amdahl and the county filed for summary judgment,based upon stipulated facts.the trial court granted the county motion,and judgment was entered in its favor.amdahl appealed,asserting that the trial court erred,because,as a matter of law,the spare parts pool must be classified as business inventories,exempt from the assessment of property taxes.for the reasons stated below,we disagree with amdahl assertion,and affirm the trial court decision.
stipulated facts 
amdahl manufactures,sells and leases information technology hardware products computer equipment for business applications.amdahl also services and repairs the computer equipment that it sells or leases,pursuant to warranties and extended service contracts.
in connection with its service and repair functions,amdahl maintained a pool of spare parts the spares pool or the rotable spares.amdahl utilized the rotable spares for two purposes a for replacement parts in fulfilling its maintenance and repair duties under extended service contracts with its customers and b to diagnose and isolate problems with particular computer equipment,through a trial and error method of replacing various parts to determine which part was nonfunctioning.
an amdahl customer paid a flat monthly fee under the extended service agreement,which fee did not vary on the basis of whether the computer equipment being serviced was sold or leased.during the term of the extended service agreement,the customer monthly fee was fixed,irrespective of either amdahl actual cost to perform under that agreement,or the number of replacement parts provided to that customer the number of replacement parts utilized,however,may have impacted the fee charged for subsequently executed service contracts with that customer or with other future customers.
the standard extended service contract required amdahl to use new parts or refurbished parts as replacement parts,and provided that parts removed from the customer computer equipment during service would become the property of amdahl.pursuant to the extended service contracts,amdahl and its customers understood that amdahl would use parts from its spares pool to satisfy amdahl repair and maintenance obligations.
parts removed from the customer computer equipment during a service call were either repaired and reconditioned and then held for future use by amdahl in its spares pool or,alternatively,scrapped.the removed parts,consistent with the parties understanding,became the property of amdahl.conversely,the rotable spares parts installed in the customer computer equipment became part of the equipment owned or leased by the customer.after termination of an extended service contract,any such installed parts remained part of the equipment owned or leased by the customer.
amdahl treated the spares pool as fixed assets rather than as inventory in connection with its income tax reporting and financial accounting.amdahl capitalized the spares pool,and claimed depreciation deductions on those parts.in performing its work under extended service contracts,when amdahl exchanged a part from the spares pool with a part from its customer computer equipment,amdahl continued to record depreciation expense as if there had been no exchange of parts.
the county of santa clara levied escape assessments against amdahl for the fiscal years,and and.the escape assessments were based upon the county assessor conclusion that the spares pool maintained at amdahl distribution center in santa clara county were taxable property,and did not qualify as business inventories under section.
thereafter,the parties reached agreement as to the full cash value of the spares pool for the relevant fiscal years.on april,the assessment appeals board for the county accepted this valuation stipulation.based upon the stipulation as to value,the county assessed property taxes and interest upon amdahl spares pool,under section as follows fiscal year fy tax and interest fy tax and interest fy tax and interest fy tax and interest and fy tax and interest.amdahl paid all taxes and interest assessed against the spares pool for the fiscal years.
procedural history 
pursuant to section,on september,amdahl filed a verified claim for refund of property taxes and interest it paid relative to the spares pool for the fiscal years.the county board of supervisors did not act on amdahl claim within six months,and amdahl,on august,filed timely a refund action in the santa clara county superior court,pursuant to section et 
the complaint filed by amdahl alleged two causes of action,namely,a refund claim,and a claim for declaratory relief.thereafter,on february,amdahl filed a dismissal without prejudice of the second cause of action for declaratory relief.
the parties stipulated to a briefing schedule and the scheduling of a hearing on their for summary judgment.on december,the court below granted the county motion for summary judgment,and denied amdahl motion.the trial court concluded that amdahl rotable spares are not exempt business inventory sic under revenue and taxation code section,as the spare parts are not goods intended from sic sale or lease in the ordinary course of business judgment was entered on january,and amdahl filed timely this appeal on february.

ii.tax exemption for business inventories 
as a general proposition,all forms of tangible personal property are taxable in california.cal,art.xiii.by constitutional enactment and by statute,however,the california legislature has provided that certain property is exempt from property tax.see,cal,art.xiii,subd.b and tax code,property used exclusively for religious,hospital,or charitable purposes cal,art.xiii,subd.d and tax code,subd.a property used exclusively for public schools,community colleges,state colleges,and state universities cal,art.xiii,subd.h and tax code,subd.a growing crops cal,art.xiii,subd.i and tax code,fruit and nut trees under four years and grape vines under three years cal,art.xiii,subd.d and tax code,subd.a free public libraries and free museums cal,art.xiii,subd.g and tax code,burial property.it must be recognized,however,that n o property is exempt from taxation except as declared in the constitution.cane city and county of san francisco d.
in,the legislature adopted section,which provided at the time for a partial tax exemption for business inventories.former,added by stats,ch.section was subsequently amended seriatim,providing ultimately that business inventories were fully tax exempt.former,amended by stats,ch.section now provides as follows for the fiscal year and fiscal years thereafter,business inventories are exempt from taxation and the assessor shall not assess business inventories.
the term,business inventories,is defined by statute,in part,as includ ing goods intended for sale or lease in the ordinary course of business.it is,therefore,essential that the property,in order to qualify for the exemption,be intended for sale or lease.ehrman flavin,taxing cal.property ed.exempt property.further,business inventories do not include,inter alia,business machinery or equipment or office furniture,machines or equipment,except when such property is held for sale or lease in the ordinary course of business.
the tax exemption for business inventories under section is explained further in title,section,of the california code of regulations regulation.the exemption is intended to include all tangible personal property,whether raw materials,work in process or finished goods,which will become a part of or are themselves items of personalty held for sale or lease in the ordinary course of business.reg,subd.a.the phrase,ordinary course of business,in the preceding phrase is critical to an understanding of the scope of the term,business inventories does not constitute a limitation on the type of property which may be held for sale or lease,but it does require that the property be intended for sale or lease in accordance with the regular and usual practice and method of the business of the vendor or lessor.reg,subd.a a.further,t he phrase,goods intended for sale or lease means property acquired,manufactured,produced,processed,raised or grown which is already the subject of a contract of sale or which is held and openly offered for sale or lease or will be so held and offered for sale or lease at the time it becomes a marketable product.property which is ready for sale or lease must be displayed,advertised or otherwise brought to the attention of the potential purchasers or lessees by means normally employed by vendors or lessors of the product.reg,subd.a b.
regulation explains further that the exemption for business inventories is not intended to apply,inter alia,to p roperty being used by its owner for any purpose not directly associated with the prospective sale or lease of that property.reg,subd.b.the regulations make a distinction between property held by service industries that are connected with a profession,and property held by businesses that provide services of a nonprofessional nature.reg,subd.c.goods of a service professional are not business inventories,even if they may be transferred to the patient or client incidental to the rendition of the professional service.ibid.conversely,property held by businesses performing nonprofessional services is to be regarded as business inventories held for sale if such property is delivered as an item regularly included in the service.ibid.those who repair or recondition personal property with the intent of transferring parts and materials shall be regarded as holding said parts and materials as business inventories.reg,subd.d.
iii.amdahl contentions 
amdahl contends that the trial court erred in concluding that amdahl rotable spares were not exempt from taxation under section,because they were not business inventories under section.amdahl advances three essential arguments in support of its position that the rotable spares are business inventories rotable spares meet the definition under section,because they are goods intended for sale or lease in the ordinary course of amdahl business of servicing and repairing its customers computer equipment amdahl is a nonprofessional service provider,which holds its rotable spares as property delivered to its customers as an item regularly included in the service,thereby meeting the requirements of subdivision c of regulation and amdahl repairs and reconditions its customers equipment with the intent of transferring parts and materials,the rotable spares,and,therefore,those parts and materials are business inventories under subdivision d of regulation.for the reasons stated below,we reject each of these arguments,and conclude that amdahl rotable spares are not business inventories,exempt from taxation.
iv.strict construction of tax exemption laws 
in our consideration of this appeal,we are mindful of certain general principles governing the claim of exemption by amdahl.tax exemptions are construed strictly against the taxpayer.weber county of santa barbara cal d.a private owner of property has the burden of showing it clearly comes within the property tax exemption.fellowship of friends,county of yuba d,d see also sterigenics internat.county of orange th,d sterigenics.an exemption from property taxation will be rejected,unless the intention to do so is expressed in direct terms or is fairly inferable from the language of the instrument by which the right is claimed.cypress lawn san francisco cal.doubts concerning the applicability of the tax exemption are to be resolved against that exemption.alpha therapeutic county of los angeles d.
we must not,however,in applying these rules of strict construction and placement of burden upon the taxpayer,disregard the language of the statute.in our analysis of the statutory exemption,strict construction must still be a reasonable construction.cedars of lebanon hosp.cal d,quoting state ex rel.spillers johnston.with these principles in mind,we address amdahl contentions that the trial court erred in concluding the amdahl rotable spares were not exempt from taxation.
v.the statutory and regulatory language do not support amdahl claim 
amdahl asserts that the plain language of regulation requires the conclusion that the rotable spares are business inventories that qualify for a tax exemption under section.we disagree.
as it pertains to the property at issue in this appeal,the goods must be intended for sale or lease in the ordinary course of business,in order for them to constitute business inventories.both the prerequisites that the property be intended for sale or lease,and be held in the ordinary course of business considered in the context of regulation the conclusion that rotable spares are business inventories,at best,doubtful.
goods intended for sale or lease 
goods intended for sale or lease must be property that is already the subject of a contract of sale,is held and openly offered for sale or lease,or will be so held and offered for sale or lease at the time it becomes a marketable product.reg,subd.a b.the property is subject to the further requirement that it be displayed,advertised or otherwise brought to the attention of the potential purchasers or lessees ibid.based upon the stipulated facts presented by the parties to the court below,the rotable spares could only qualify as being intended for sale or lease under the second prong of regulation,subdivision a b.
it is questionable that,once amdahl installed a particular part from the spares pool into its customer computer equipment,there was,in fact,a sale or lease of that product.in a very literal sense,the part was not sold or leased to amdahl customer,because the customer was not charged for the replacement part.this is underscored by the fact that the customer may have received multiple replacement parts from the spares pool at no charge beyond the flat monthly maintenance fee.
in a broader the absence of a charge for the replacement part s it is nonetheless doubtful that a sale or lease occurred when amdahl customer received a replacement part from the spares pool.in the ordinary sense of a sale or lease of tangible property,there is a transfer of the property from the to the,coupled with a corresponding reduction in the supply of the former.in the case of the installation of a replacement part from amdahl spares pool,however,there was a swap of that part for the customer defective part,and at least where amdahl refurbished that part there was no pro tanto reduction of parts in the spares pool.
further,a sale of property requires that there be a transfer in exchange for some consideration.crocker,mcfaddin d.such consideration need not be money,but may be its equivalent or any valuable consideration.id.at.in this instance,it is apparent that no consideration was given by amdahl customers in exchange for any replacement parts taken from the spares pool.under the standard,extended service contract,amdahl customers received any and all replacement parts installed in their computers at no additional cost.thus,during the life of the contract,it did not matter if the amdahl customer received one hundred replacement parts or no parts from the spares pool the cost was the same in either instance.
moreover,the statements of amdahl,other court proceedings and in its financial into serious question the notion that its rotable spares were held for sale or lease.in unrelated federal tax proceedings,amdahl stated that its pool of rotable replacement parts were used in its maintenance business and were not acquired and held for sale.while this statement is not necessarily dispositive it is certainly suggestive that the true nature of the spares pool was not business inventory held by amdahl for sale to its customers.
likewise,amdahl used consistently the fixed asset method of accounting for the spares pool and did not treat it as inventory,both for income tax and accounting purposes.amdahl capitalized the rotable spares,and claimed depreciation deductions on those parts.it continued to record depreciation expense for a spares pool part,even after it was installed in a customer computer and exchanged for the customer malfunctioning part.thus,amdahl,itself,took the position on its financial statements that the rotable spares were not inventory.
a company financial statements are representations of management as to the company financial position.see small fritz companies,cal th,d,a corporation financial report invites shareholders to read and rely on it.based on generally accepted accounting principles gaap the financial statements are implied or expressed representations by management.management makes,in these financial statements,assertions regarding existence and occurrence of assets,obligations,and equities,valuation and allocation,asset,liability,equity,revenue,and expense have been included in the financial statements at the proper amount under gaap,and presentation and disclosure,the financial statements are classified,described and disclosed properly.state bd.of equalization,assessors handbook assessment of personal property and fixtures,fn.we,therefore,consider amdahl method of accounting described,in particular,its decision to classify its rotable spares as fixed assets and not as inventory on which it took depreciation deductions as probative evidence on the question of whether the rotable spares are business inventories under section.
furthermore,there is scant evidence before us to suggest that amdahl openly offered the rotable spares for sale or lease to its customers.the spares pool was apparently not displayed,advertised or otherwise brought to the attention of amdahl customers.reg,subd.a b.
the critical inquiry in determining whether the property constitutes business inventories qualifying for an exemption under section is whether the goods are to be transferred away from the business pursuant to sale transworld systems,supra,th at,d.in,the court considered whether rotable by the taxpayer for precisely the same purpose as amdahl sold upon installation into the computer of the taxpayer customer the appellate the propriety of depreciation of property under federal tax that the rotable spares were maintained so that the taxpayer could provide better service to its customers the court concluded that i n any realistic sense the taxpayer substitution of a rotable spare part for a malfunctioning original part in a customer computer was not a sale of that part to the customer.id.at.
we adopt the reasoning in to this case.amdahl installation of a replacement part from the spares pool into its customer computer in exchange for the customer malfunctioning part did not constitute a sale.therefore,amdahl did not hold for sale or lease the rotable spares.
goods held in the ordinary course of business 
in order to constitute business inventories under section and regulation,the goods must have been held by the taxpayer for sale or lease in the ordinary course of business.reg,subd.a.the property must be intended for sale or lease in accordance with the regular and usual practice and method of the business of the vendor or lessor.reg,subd.a a.for the reasons discussed above,amdahl did not intend to hold the rotable spares for sale or lease,and the practical effect of exchanging a part from the spares pool for a malfunctioning one from the customer computer was not a sale.
amdahl usual practice and method of its business did not involve the intended sale or lease of the property in the ordinary course of business.one of amdahl purposes for maintaining this pool was to have parts available to troubleshoot problems experienced by its customers.clearly,utilizing the spares pool for this purpose was not holding the parts for sale of lease in the ordinary course of business.further,amdahl admitted previously in a court petition filed in unrelated proceedings that the rotable spares were not acquired and held for sale.the rotable spares were established by amdahl for its maintenance business,in order to provide better service to its customers,and were not held for sale in the ordinary course of amdahl business.
amdahl tax and accounting treatment of the spares pool was part of the company usual practice and method of business.this practice suggests that the property was not held for sale or lease.the taxpayer failure to treat the exchange of the rotable spares to the customers as sales,to collect any sales tax from such transfers,are factors pointing to the conclusion that the goods were not business inventories that were held for sale or lease in the ordinary course of business.westinghouse beverage group,county of san diego d.westinghouse beverage soft drink manufacturer reusable containers supplying carbon dioxide gas and syrup,supplied to wholesale manufacturer did not account for exchanges of containers as sales and did not collect sale tax for the not business inventories.furthermore,amdahl practice of holding and using the rotable spares is identical to the practice of the repair company in,supra,in that case,the federal circuit concluded that the taxpayer did not hold the spares for sale.
a critical component of business inventories is that the goods being held for sale or lease are so held in the ordinary course of business.we conclude that amdahl rotable spares fail to meet this criterion under regulation.
goods supplied by a nonprofessional service provider regulation c 
amdahl claims that it is a nonprofessional service provider,which held its rotable spares as property delivered to its customers as an item regularly included in the service.amdahl urges that the rotable spares,thus,constituted business inventories,because they met the requirements of subdivision c of regulation.we disagree for three principal reasons.
first,amdahl has not established that it was a nonprofessional service provider within the ambit of regulation,subdivision c.the regulation identifies certain nonexclusive examples of professional and nonprofessional service providers.endeavors such as medicine,law,architecture or accountancy,are considered professions that are primarily service activities,in which the goods,even though they are transferred to the patient or client,are deemed not business inventories.reg,subd.c.businesses such as dry cleaners,beauty shop operators and swimming pool service companies are of a nonprofessional type,and the goods delivered to the customer incidental to the service are considered business inventories.ibid.
amdahl does not fall neatly into either category.as it pertains to this appeal,amdahl serviced and repaired the information technology equipment that it sold or leased to its customers under extended service contracts.unlike law,medicine,or accountancy,the services amdahl provided did not require that its employees obtain advanced degrees.on the other hand,servicing and repairing computers involves a significant degree of technical training and,which is in stark contrast to the nonprofessional service provided by dry cleaners,beauty shop operators,and swimming pool service companies.
the services of a professional are those arising out of a vocation,calling,occupation,or employment involving specialized knowledge,labor,or skill,and the labor or skill involved is primarily mental or intellectual,rather than physical or manual.citations.citation.hollingsworth commercial union ins.d,quoting marx hartford accident and indemnity company.a profession is a vocation requiring advanced education and training.black law dict.ed.
the repair and maintenance of sophisticated computer equipment requires a significant amount of specialized knowledge,training,and skill.clearly,it is of a quality far different from the nonprofessional services performed by dry cleaners,beauty shop operators,and swimming pool service companies.we conclude,therefore,that the work performed by amdahl in servicing and repairing its customers computer equipment was a profession within the meaning of regulation,subdivision c.
second,there is a somewhat subtle but distinct difference between the property that nonprofessionals identified in reg,subd.c supply to their customers,and the property that amdahl provided to its customers.for example,the customer of the swimming pool service actually receives something,chlorine that he or she did not have before the service at the same time,the service provider supplies are diminished.where an amdahl customer received a replacement part from the spares pool,however,it exchanged that part to amdahl for the nonfunctional part the customer did not receive something that he or she did not already have,and amdahl spares pool was not reduced.thus,even if amdahl services were to be considered nonprofessional,the rotable spares that it provided in conjunction with its service do not fall squarely within regulation,subdivision c.
third,amdahl argument requires a reading of subdivision c of regulation out of context.regulation must be read as a whole.in particular,subdivision a of the serves to amplify the definition of business inventories found in section a base line requirement.thus,one can not by application of subdivision c of regulation goods regularly included to a customer in service provided by a nonprofessional constitute business inventories.that property must also satisfy the requirements in subdivision a and in section it be goods held for sale in the regular course of business.for the reasons discussed above,amdahl spares pool were not goods held for sale in the regular course of amdahl business.
parts and materials furnished by a repairer or reconditioner under regulation,subdivision d 
amdahl claims that it repairs and reconditions its customers equipment with the intent of transferring parts and materials,the rotable spares,and,therefore,those parts and materials are business inventories,under subdivision d of regulation.we disagree.
superficially,this provision would appear to have some application to the instant case.amdahl role in servicing and repairing its customers equipment,however,was not the typical situation of a repairer or reconditioner.for example,in the case of an auto mechanic,an inventory of spare parts is kept for installation in customers vehicles the mechanic charges for those parts installed,and the installation of those parts results in a reduction in the mechanic inventory.in contrast,amdahl did not charge its customers for the replacement parts utilized from the rotable spares,even if multiple parts were used furthermore,since the replacement parts from the spares pool were swapped with the customers nonfunctional parts which were refurbished and placed into amdahl rotable spares supply,there was no reduction in amdahl spares pool.
moreover,the rotable spares must be held for sale or lease in the ordinary course of business.reg,subd.a.for the reasons discussed above,we conclude that the subject property was not so held.
property used for purposes other than its sale or lease under regulation,subdivision b 
certain property,by definition,is not classified under the category,business inventories.under subdivision b of regulation,captioned,exclusions,the following property,inter alia,is deemed not to be eligible for the business inventories tax exemption property being used by its owner for any purpose not directly associated with the prospective sale or lease of that property.reg,subd.b.
we have determined that amdahl rotable spares were not held for sale or lease in the ordinary course of business.this conclusion is founded,in part,upon the fact that amdahl held its spares pool in order to provide better service to its customers in connection with amdahl carrying out its maintenance and repair obligations under its extended service contracts.it follows logically,therefore,that amdahl used the rotable spares for a purpose not directly associated with the prospective sale or lease of that property.reg,subd.b.the rotable spares,thus,are excluded under regulation,subdivision b from the definition of business inventories.
amdahl,the taxpayer,bears the burden of showing that the property at issue,the spares pool clearly comes within the terms authorizing exemption citations,and any doubt must be resolved against the right to an exemption citations.citation.sterigenics,supra,th at,d,quoting associated beverage board of equalization d.we have concluded that amdahl has failed to meet its burden,and that a strict,but reasonable,construction of sections and does not support the taxpayer claim of exemption.
vi.the legislative intent of section does not compel the conclusion that amdahl rotable spares are exempt from taxation 
amdahl contends that the classification of its rotable spares as business inventories is consistent with the legislative history of section,and that the intent was for the tax exemption to be read broadly our review of the legislative history does not lead us to these conclusions.
the business inventories exemption dates back to,at which time california enacted a percent property tax exemption for business inventories,beginning in the year.former.the enactment of former section and the promulgation of its successor a partial,and ultimately a complete tax founded upon criticism of the inequities and negative economic consequences associated with the taxation of business inventories.see bagley azevedo,tax reform pacific.
the perceived inequities and negative economic factors relating to the taxation of inventory were described in a senate staff study.see com.on tax.march staff report,an analysis and evaluation of proposals relating to the ad valorem taxation of business inventories in california march staff report.significantly,the inequities and negative economic factors identified in the march staff report do not suggest that property of the type at issue herein,amdahl rotable spares be exempt from taxation.
the march staff report delineated the following alleged inequities with respect to the taxation of inventory the effective tax rate may be slightly higher on inventories than the tax rate for other property,because of the annual appraisal of inventories the less frequent appraisal of real property or selling operations are taxed on inventories that they are required to maintain,while businessmen involved in service operations generally do not pay such taxes there is a degree of arbitrariness in the assessment of property tax as between different businesses,in that certain businesses require high levels of inventory on the march lien date,while others have lower inventory levels on the same date taxes on inventory are paid,irrespective of the profitability of the business and some businesses may have higher inventories and higher taxes during unprofitable periods and the inventory tax is loosely related to gross sales,which may result in unequal treatment of different businesses with the same gross sales,one business with a more frequent turn of inventory may pay significantly less taxes than a business with the same annual gross sales,but with a slower inventory turn.march staff report,supra,at.these perceived inequities do not apply to the taxation of amdahl rotable spares.further,the factors identified in the march staff report are associated primarily with inventory businesses,such as manufacturing,wholesaling,and retail concerns they are not reflective of businesses such as the service and repair of computers at issue in this appeal.
the march staff report also identified several economic arguments made by proponents of a tax exemption for inventories,including taxation of inventories discourages manufacturers and some wholesalers from locating or expanding in california california producers and manufacturers whose inventories are taxed can not compete with their counterparts located in states that do not tax inventories taxation of inventories results in increased storage of goods outside of california and discourages construction of warehouse space in this state manufacturers,wholesalers,and retailers deplete their inventory prior to the lien date to reduce their tax liability,resulting in economic losses a tax exemption for inventory will decrease the price of goods and exempting inventories from taxation will encourage manufacturers to locate new facilities in this state.march staff report,supra,at.again,these factors identified as potential reasons for enacting a property tax exemption for inventories do not obtain to the type of property or the kind of business we consider in this appeal.
for the reasons discussed in part v,ante,based upon a fair reading of section and regulation,we conclude that rotable spares are not business inventories.furthermore,the legislative history does not suggest that the tax exemption provided for business inventories under section should be expanded to include the rotable spares.simply stated,the reasons for the tax exemption do not demonstrate that business inventories should be broadened to include the rotable spares property at issue in this appeal.
vii.case authority under section does not support amdahl claim 
there are only four reported decisions that have considered whether particular items of personal property were business inventories,exempt from taxation under sections and.none of those cases involved the specific type of rotable spares property that amdahl claims herein to be exempt.likewise,none of the analyses in any of the cases compels us to conclude that the rotable spares property constitute business inventories.
amdahl contends that the holding in may department stores county of los angeles d,is consistent with the view that amdahl rotable spares are exempt,business inventories.may department stores,involved,inter alia,the question of whether the price tags and sales receipts delivered to a retailer customers were business inventories,entitled to exemption under section.the appellate court concluded that the price tags and sales receipts were delivered to the customer with the merchandise purchased,and,thus,were properly classified as business inventories rather than as supplies.id.at.
may department stores is entirely distinguishable.in contrast to the facts herein,the taxpayer in may department stores was a retailer selling goods to its customers.the property at issue was transferred to the customers as part of the sale of goods.in this instance,amdahl sold services to its customers for a flat fee.moreover,in may department stores,the transfer of the price tags and sales receipts to a customer resulted in a the customer receiving something that he or she did not have previously,and b the reduction in the retailer supply of the product transferred.neither result occurred in the case of amdahl supplying replacement parts from its spares pool to its customers.
amdahl also urges that its position is consistent with the holding in westinghouse beverage,supra,d.in that case,the court addressed,inter alia,whether the reusable containers containing carbon dioxide and syrup that were provided by a beverage manufacturer to wholesalers were business inventories.the appellate court concluded that the containers were not exempt property,because they were retrievable by the manufacturer,and they were not intended for sale within the meaning of the statute.id.at.
the holding in westinghouse beverage does not support amdahl position.the facts are entirely distinguishable from this case the taxpayer in westinghouse beverage was a seller of products,not a service provider.amdahl claims that,the fact that the beverage manufacturer in westinghouse beverage did not relinquish control of the reusable containers,is supportive of its position herein.we disagree.the absence of relinquishment of control in westinghouse against amdahl transfer of the replacement parts from the spares pool to its customer in exchange for the customer malfunctioning not compel the conclusion that the rotable spares,by contrast,were held for sale.
likewise,the case of sterigenics th,d,does not compel a different result.in sterigenics,the taxpayer claimed that its cobalt,which it used to irradiate its customers products,were business inventories.the court of appeal affirmed the trial court rejection of this exemption claim.id.at,d.in so holding,the appellate court rejected the taxpayer three arguments,concluding that the taxpayer a did not hold the cobalt for sale or lease,b did not intend to incorporate the cobalt into an item for sale or lease,and c did not deliver the cobalt as part of its nonprofessional service.id.at,d.
the facts presented in sterigenics,supra,are distinguishable.the court of appeal acknowledgment that goods supplied by a nonprofessional service provider incidental to the service may be considered business inventories,does not suggest that amdahl rotable spares should be so classified.for the reasons we have discussed above,the subject goods were not business inventories,under subdivision c of regulation or under any other section of that regulation.
lastly,amdahl contends that a reading of transworld systems,supra,th,d,suggests that amdahl rotable spares were exempt,because they were goods furnished incidental to amdahl rendition of nonprofessional service.transworld systems concerned whether the preprinted form letters of the taxpayer a collection service,which were provided as part of its service of sending collection letters to debtors of its customers,were business inventories.the court of appeal concluded that the preprinted form letters were exempt,because they were business inventories delivered incidental to the rendition of the nonprofessional service,within the meaning of subdivision c of regulation.id.at,d.
again,the facts presented in transworld systems are distinguishable.because we have concluded that amdahl rotable spares were not held for sale or lease in the ordinary course of business,and were not property provided by a nonprofessional service provider as an item regularly included in the service,transworld systems is simply not precedent in support of amdahl position.
viii.the case 
the county cites,supra,as being strongly supportive of its position that amdahl rotable spares are not exempt under section.conversely,amdahl argues that has no application whatsoever,since the case concerned the entirely different issue of whether a computer repair company,under federal tax law
