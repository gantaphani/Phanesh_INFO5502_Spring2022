background 
the burlington northern santa fe railroad company bn or the company,a corporation,runs a rail line that crosses over miles of the fort peck indian reservation the reservation,governed by the assiniboine and sioux tribes the tribes.the rail line is built on a granted by congress in to bn.act of,ch,stat.bn runs an average of trains per day over the rail line through the reservation,totaling more than cars in.
we are asked to decide if the tribes may continue to impose on bn an ad valorem tax levied on the value of all utility property,defined as including any publicly or privately owned railroad.see the tribes comprehensive code of justice,tit.xxiii,quinault indian nation grays harbor county,cir an ad valorem tax is imposed on the value of property.the tribes have,since,imposed the annual tax currently on bn,which paid it from to.
the company brought an immediate challenge to the tax when it was first imposed on the same at issue now,but lost.see burlington blackfeet tribe of blackfeet indian reservation,cir burlington i,cert.denied,d.burlington i held that the used by bn was on trust land and that the ad valorem tax was therefore valid.in,however,the supreme court held,in strate contractors,d,that a granted by the federal government and crossing through indian trust land is the equivalent of fee land.following strate,this court,in big horn county coop.adams,cir,addressed the vitality of burlington i and held i n light of strate,burlington i is overruled to the extent it upholds an ad valorem tax on property located on a.
after big horn,bn stopped paying the tribes ad valorem tax.the company agreed to a settlement with the tribes through and provided that unless the tax were upheld by a court of competent jurisdiction,no further payments would be forthcoming.on february,the tribes filed suit against bn in fort peck tribal court,seeking a declaration that the tax is valid.soon thereafter,on february,bn filed this case in federal district court.almost march,moved for summary judgment.the tribal court,in which preliminary discovery and other pretrial proceedings had begun,then declined to schedule a trial until the federal courts have determined whether tribal remedies must be exhausted.after the district court granted bn motion for summary judgment,the tribal court stayed all its proceedings pending this appeal.
in granting bn motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoining the tribes from acting on the tax,the district court held that our cases after strate require that the in question be viewed as fee land and therefore as presumptively exempt from the tribes civil authority,citing montana united states,d.the district court went on to find that neither exception to this principle recognized in montana applies because the tribes had not established a consensual relationship with bn sufficient to justify the property tax and the tribes contentions concerning the potentially dangerous impact of bn hazardous cargo were nothing more than a recharacterization of the tribes argument that the generalized availability of tribal services is sufficient to support the tax.without comment,the district court denied all other pending motions,including the tribes request for discovery under federal rule of civil procedure f,although the court did provide that its permanent injunction shall become void,if in the future one or both of the montana exceptions are established.
discussion 
reviewing the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,big horn,at,and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,we must determine whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law and whether there are any genuine issues of material fact.balint carson city,cir.we affirm most of the district court grant of summary judgment but hold that the tribes should be permitted some discovery concerning whether bn activities so threaten their political integrity,economic security,health,or welfare,as to bring the tax within the second montana exception.
the tribes argue that res judicata or,in contemporary terminology,claim preclusion,bars a challenge to their tax on bn.we recently summarized the doctrine of res judicata or claim preclusion 
res judicata is applicable whenever there is an identity of claims,a final judgment on the merits,and privity between parties.identity of claims exists when two suits arise from the same transactional nucleus of facts.
stratosphere litig.grand casinos,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the tribes assert that,applying these standards,the burlington i holding survives the change in law effected by big horn.
we disagree.the same transactional nucleus of facts is not present in both burlington i and this case.commissioner sunnen,considering res judicata principles in the tax context,established that e ach year of taxation is the origin of a new liability and of a separate cause of action.id.at.see also limbach hooven allison,d holding in a case involving discrete tax years where t he parties,the tax,and the goods imported and their containers are the same that although c concepts might have an initial appeal t he reason for not applying the doctrine in the present case is even stronger than that in sunnen,for here the constitutional analysis of the earlier case was repudiated by this court intervening pronouncement.emphasis in the original.
although burlington i was an action for injunctive relief rather than a retrospective challenge to taxpayer liability for particular tax years,the principles of sunnen apply.as the sunnen court explained 
a taxpayer may secure a judicial determination of a particular tax matter,a matter which may recur without substantial variation for some years thereafter.but a subsequent modification of the significant facts or a change or development in the controlling legal principles may make that determination obsolete or erroneous,at least for future purposes.if such a determination is then perpetuated each succeeding year as to the taxpayer involved in the original litigation,he is accorded a tax treatment different from that given to other taxpayers of the same class.as a result,there are inequalities in the administration of the revenue laws,discriminatory distinctions in tax liability,and a fertile basis for litigious confusion.
at.see also carter united states,cir collateral estoppel or issue preclusion must be applied in such a manner as to avoid endowing taxpayers with perpetual,vested rights in a certain tax treatment,based on decisions that have become obsolete or erroneous with time,thereby causing inequities among taxpayers.quoting sunnen,at.
the core of sunnen is the holding that tax cases by their nature raise different claims concerning different tax years,although the issues may be precisely the same.thus,claim preclusion res judicata should give way to issue preclusion collateral estoppel where a different tax year is in question,even if the legal issues and facts are otherwise the same.the impact of this distinction on the present case flows from the principle that issue preclusion is susceptible to changed legal conditions,while claim preclusion is generally not.
the burlington i litigation does not preclude bn claim that an intervening change of law rendered the company future payments of taxes,distinct annual events,invalid.the burlington i court could not have established bn tax liability forever.burlington i,like any other declaratory or injunctive case,was necessarily adjudicating liability on the basis of discrete this case tax years past and there was no retrospective relief at issue.as in limbach,at,
f ailure to follow sunnen dictates would lead to the very tax inequality that the admonition of that case was designed to avoid.hooven then would be immune forever from tax on its imported goods because of an early decision based upon a now repudiated legal doctrine,while all other taxpayers would have their tax liabilities determined upon the basis of a fundamentally different approach 
the sunnen line of precedents establishing that litigation concerning different tax years is subject not to claim preclusio
