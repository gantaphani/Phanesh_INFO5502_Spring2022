twin brothers samuel and saul saldana,challenge their respective convictions for corruptly endeavoring to impede the administration of internal revenue laws and for filing false statements.they also contend that the district court sentenced them in violation of their sixth amendment rights in light of the supreme court recent united states booker decision or,in the alternative,that the sentences imposed by the district court were unreasonable.although the brothers were tried and sentenced separately,they moved successfully to have their cases consolidated on appeal.following oral argument,we issued an order of limited remand regarding samuel sentence to allow the district court to provide written reasons for its upward departure in that sentence having received and reviewed such written reasons from the district court,we now affirm both defendants convictions and sentences.
facts and proceedings 
samuel and saul were indicted by a grand jury on one count each for corruptly endeavoring to obstruct and impede the due administration of internal revenue laws in violation of a.saul was indicted on twelve,and samuel on sixteen,additional counts for filing false statements in violation of a.the government charged the brothers with filing false tax reports regarding several individuals for the purpose of triggering internal revenue service irs audits and thereby harassing and intimidating these individuals.different juries convicted each brother on all counts at separate trials before the same district judge.
the brothers were convicted for sending irs forms,report of cash payments over received in a trade or business,to the irs,falsely stating that the defendants had paid or received cash payments to or from a number of individuals identified in such forms.on the portion of the that request information regarding the amount of money exchanged by the filer with another party,the defendants either left the space blank or wrote or filled in some astronomical figure such as quintillion or.none of the persons identified in these forms had ever received any money from,or given any money to,either defendant.no one disputes that each brother engaged in the acts with which he was charged.rather,each trial centered on whether the defendant harbored the requisite intent corruptly to obstruct the administration of internal revenue laws.
each of the individuals with whom,on the,saul and samuel claimed to have transacted was in some way connected with state or local government.most of the individuals targeted by saul had never met him but had written to him letters about his tax obligations,had otherwise assessed fines or penalties for the government,or were lawyers representing governmental entities that were seeking to assess fines,penalties or taxes against him.samuel targeted judges and attorneys involved in proceedings against him or other public officials against whom he bore grudges.
saul argues that he filed these in good faith,having learned about this tactic in a tax course that he attended with his fianc√©e,which course purported to inform those in attendance about a redemption or process.this process purportedly permits individuals to redeem money from the government for a variety of nonsensical reasons,including that the government has an account for each citizen that is linked to the citizen birth certificate.
saul attempted to introduce into evidence black manuals that he claims to have received in this class and that explain this process.the trial court refused to allow the manuals into evidence,ruling that they were,alternatively,inadmissible hearsay,cumulative evidence,and would confuse the jury.nevertheless,saul testified to the jury that he relied on these manuals and generally described the redemption process.an acquaintance of saul,rick garcia,testified that saul advised him to file false against a judge presiding over garcia narcotics trafficking trial,as doing so would intimidate the judge and cause him to back off from garcia case.
at each trial,irs special agent jeff allen testified that the defendants actions cost the irs several hundred hours of investigative manpower,requiring numerous levels of administrative review.at samuel trial,allen testified additionally that samuel was an tax protester who did not believe the irs had jurisdiction over him and that,in filing the,samuel sought to retaliate,intimidate,and harass the persons named in these forms.allen stated that this is a common scheme used by protestors against public officials with whom the protestors have come into contact.
the targets of the false report forms testified at trial,stating that they had experienced various levels of concern,primarily about the possibility of an audit or,for many of the public officials,about their reputations if the public were to believe that they had received large sums of unreported income.none of the targeted persons was audited by the irs or employed an attorney to defend them.
june collerd,the mother of samuel children,testified that samuel sent her an during a custody battle,advising that he would report her to the irs,the treasury department,and six other federal agencies.collerd stated that samuel also told her that public officials involved in the custody case would get theirs,that he was going to get them,or that they would pay for what they did to him.
the trial court sentenced saul to a six month term of imprisonment on each count,ordering that he serve counts one through four consecutively with counts five through thirteen to run concurrently,for a total incarceration of months,that he remain on supervised release for three years,and that he pay a mandatory assessment.the court sentenced samuel to consecutive terms of imprisonment on six counts,and concurrent terms of imprisonment on the remaining eleven counts,for a total of sixty months imprisonment.in addition,the court ordered samuel to be placed on supervised release for a term of one year on count one and three years on counts two through seventeen,to run concurrently,for a total of three years supervised release.the court also imposed a mandatory assessment of.
in directly appealing his conviction,each defendant challenges the district court interpretation of and also challenges his sentence.saul also appeals the court refusal to allow his tax manuals into evidence.
ii.analysis 
defining corruptly.standard of review 
as each brother makes an identical argument with respect to the first issue on appeal,we discuss their cases together.all parties characterize the defendants first argument as a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,but it actually implicates the proper interpretation of a,which prohibits 
corruptly or by force or threats of force endeavor ing to intimidate or impede any officer or employee of the united states acting in an official capacity under this title,or in any other way corruptly or by force or threats of force obstruct ing or imped ing,or endeavor ing to obstruct or impede,the due administration of this title.
the brothers argue that the evidence did not support the jury finding that either acted corruptly within the meaning of a.they insist that our case law requires the government to show that the defendant sought an unfair benefit or advantage under the tax laws to prove that he acted with the requisite intent.
although the government in its response frames the defendants challenges as going to the sufficiency of the evidence to show that the brothers sought an unfair advantage or benefit without reference to the tax laws,the prosecution points out that,at samuel trial,the court instructed the defense the meaning of corruptly to act corruptly means to act knowingly and dishonestly with the specific intent to secure an unlawful benefit either for oneself or for another.the record shows that an identical instruction was given to the jury in saul case,also without objection by the defendant.
ordinarily,we review issues of statutory interpretation de novo in this case,however,neither defendant objected to the trial court instructions to the jury defining corruptly,so we review that instruction for plain error to prevail under this standard of review,a defendant must demonstrate that an error occurred that the error was plain,which means clear or obvious the plain error must affect substantial rights and not correcting the error would seriously affect the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.
jury instructions 
at the outset,we must determine whether the district court instructions to the jury were erroneous defendants attempt to argue that the district court should have instructed the jury that corruptly,as used in,means intentionally endeavoring to gain an advantage or benefit inconsistent with a person rights and duties under the tax laws.the internal revenue code criminal section does not define corruptly,yet defendants assert that we have defined corruptly with this reference to the tax laws when evaluating in so doing,defendants rely on united states reeves in actuality,two cases.
in reeves i,we reversed the defendant conviction for violating,holding that the district court had wrongly interpreted corruptly to mean with improper motive or bad or evil purpose.defendants are correct in noting that we stated in reeves i that t he legislative history supports an interpretation of a as forbidding endeavors intended to give some advantage inconsistent with the rights and duties of others under the tax laws.defendants fail to mention,however,that,without any reference to the tax laws,we went on to state in the same paragraph that a ccordingly,the legislative history of section a supports interpreting its prohibition against corruptly endeavoring to impede or obstruct title as forbidding those acts done with the intent to secure an unlawful benefit either for oneself or for another.even more significantly,our actual holding in reeves i made no mention of benefits or advantages obtained under the tax laws we hold that the filing of frivolous common law liens with the intention of securing improper benefits or advantages for one self or for others constitutes a prohibited corrupt endeavor under section a.we remanded reeves case for a determination whether he had acted corruptly under this new definition.
when,in reeves ii,we heard the defendant second appeal from conviction,we reiterated our earlier holding without reference to an improper benefit or advantage under the tax laws.defendants argument therefore rests on one statement in reeves i that was not the holding and was not repeated anywhere else in either opinion 
other circuits,many citing reeves,have also defined corruptly under as meaning to act with the intent to secure an unlawful advantage or benefit either for one self or for another without addressing whether the advantage or benefit is confined to benefits under the tax laws although the advantages or benefits sought by the defendants in those cases were often related to manipulation of the tax laws,none of the decisions listed has relied on or emphasized this fact or included under the tax laws in their holdings.in fact,the eighth and sixth circuits have upheld convictions under when the defendants had not sought any advantage under the tax laws.the eighth circuit in united states yagow noted only that the defendant sought a financial advantage,not an advantage under the tax laws,by filing fraudulent irs forms in a case very similar to the instant one,united states bowman,the sixth circuit affirmed a defendant conviction for violation of a when the defendant had filed false and forms for the sole purpose of intimidating and harassing his creditors the bowman court held that the defendant conduct fell within the ambit of a proscribed conduct even though he sought no financial advantage or benefit for himself under the tax laws 
in the context of these holdings by other circuits,the facts that the reeves holdings did not include under the tax laws,and the language of the statute itself does not require that an individual intend to procure a benefit for himself under the tax laws to have formed the requisite mens rea,we hold that the district court did not not its jury instructions.we do not address whether a defendant must be seeking a financial advantage,as in yagow or whether is aimed at any behavior that seeks to thwart government efforts to execute tax laws,as the eleventh circuit has held because the defendants in this case sought to do both 
admission of saul saldana tax manuals 
standard of review 
we review the admission or exclusion of evidence for abuse of discretion if we conclude that a district court has abused its discretion,we apply the harmless error doctrine accordingly,unless the trial court has abused its discretion and a substantial right of the defendant has been affected,we will not reverse on the basis of the evidentiary ruling in question 
the government advances that we should review saul challenge to the district court exclusion of the manuals for plain error,because he did not counter the government hearsay objection at trial and raises his argument for the first time on appeal even if we assume arguendo that the district court plainly erred when it excluded the manuals as hearsay,we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion when it decided to exclude the manuals as cumulative and as potentially confusing to the jury.
saul challenges the district court decision to exclude the black manuals that he claims to have received in a tax class at which he purports to have learned about the or redemption process.saul contends that his receipt of and reliance on these manuals demonstrate his belief and intent to use a valid legal process to discharge his property taxes and other public debts.the government counters that saul and his girlfriend,peggy briggs,were allowed to testify without contradiction about the scheme,and that saul also testified about his reliance on the manuals and their contents.the government states that the district court properly excluded the manuals both as hearsay and because the manuals probative value was not outweighed by their potential to confuse the jury.
the manuals at issue are plastic binders containing a random assortment of xerox copies of statutes,cases,banking and credit card instructions,and various bizarre papers,such as a chart illustrating the diogenes historical society contrast of our creator law and man legal system,a copy of the communist manifesto,a comic strip,and a description of the movie,the matrix.there is no summary or obvious organization of the contents,but the binders do contain copies of irs forms,suspicious activity reports,and instructions on something that looks similar to what saul described as the process.the binders are labeled with a piece of paper on which redemption process is in marker.
rule of the federal rules of evidence fre permits a trial court to exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury,or by considerations of undue delay,waste of time,or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.in this case,the manuals probative value is slight they are cumulative of saul unchallenged testimony that he relied on the tax class and these binders in implementing the redemption process their appearance is so unprofessional and random that,if anything,they undermine saul arguments that he truly believed that he engaged in a legitimate legal process.the manuals potential to confuse the jury,in contrast,was quite high.they contain inaccurate legal advice and an assortment of strange and unrelated documents that have nothing to do with taxes or with this case 
the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the manuals on the basis of fre balancing.even if the manuals were not inadmissible hearsay,because their admittance was sought not for the truth of the matter asserted but to show the defendant belief in the redemption process,the district court exercised appropriate discretion when it decided that the probative value of the manuals did not outweigh their potential to confuse the jury.
sentencing challenges 
samuel and saul raise objections to their sentences under the supreme court recent opinion in united states booker contending that the district court increased their sentences beyond that authorized by the jury verdict.they argue that the court based their sentences on facts not proved to a jury or admitted by defendants,and did so while proceeding under a mandatory guidelines regime,thereby violating defendants sixth amendment rights.additionally,saul argues that the district court based its decisions to depart upwardly on impermissible factors.and,both defendants insist that the sentences imposed were unreasonable.
standard of review 
saul did not raise any sixth amendment argument or challenge the sentencing guidelines before the district court,so we review his booker claim for plain error only samuel did preserve this objection before the district court,so we review his sixth amendment challenge for harmless error 
additionally,booker directs us to review upward departures for reasonableness as required by the prosecutorial remedies and tools against the exploitation of children today act the protect act as we explained in united states smith,this circuit used an standard to review the reasonableness of upward departures under the protect act accordingly,we now evaluate the district court decision to depart upwardly and the extent of that departure for abuse of discretion 
saul saldana 
sixth amendment challenge plain error review 
it is clear,after booker,that the district court committed plain error when it departed upward on saul sentence and did so based on facts not admitted by the defendant or found by the jury we hold,however,that saul can not show that such error affected his substantial rights.to meet the plain error standard,a defendant must show that a district court error affected the outcome of the proceedings saul can not meet his burden to show that,if the district court had sentenced him under an advisory rather than mandatory sentencing guidelines system,it would have sentenced him differently.there is simply nothing in the record to indicate that the court would have decided differently had it not been bound by the guidelines we therefore hold saul booker argument to be unavailing.
upward departure 
saul also challenges the district court upward departure,arguing that the court based its decision on impermissible factors and that the extent of the departure was unreasonable.saul investigative report psr grouped all thirteen counts together in accordance with the grouping requirements in united states sentencing guidelines.his base offense level for this group was calculated to be eight,including a enhancement for obstruction of justice under the edition of the guidelines was used to avoid ex post facto problems his criminal history category was together with his base offense level,this yielded a prison sentence range of zero to six months,probation of one to five years,and supervised release for count one of one year and counts two through thirteen of two to three years.the district court ordered that the sentences for counts one through four run consecutively,for a total term of imprisonment of months,with the remaining counts to be served concurrently three years supervised release and a mandatory fee assessment 
prior to booker,a district court could upwardly depart under the guidelines if there exists an aggravating circumstance of a kind,or to a degree,not adequately taken into consideration by the sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines.the sentencing commission intended for sentencing courts to treat each guideline as carving out a heartland,a set of typical cases embodying the conduct that each guideline describes.if the court considered a factor in its decision to depart that the guidelines either discouraged or had already included in some other way,the court could upwardly depart only if the factor is present to an exceptional degree or in some other way makes the case different from the ordinary case where the factor is present.
although district courts are no longer bound by the guidelines,they still must consider them,including the appropriate sentencing range,and state reasons for imposing a sentence outside that range a sentencing court does not abuse its discretion in deciding to upwardly depart when its reasons for doing so advance the objectives set forth in a are authorized by b and are justified by the facts of the case a district court reasons supporting its choice of a sentence must be included,with some specificity,in its written order of judgment or commitment under c 
at saul sentencing hearing,the district court orally explained its reasons for departing as the harm done by the defendant,his disrespect for the law,the fear he caused,and the number of times that he committed the crime.the court went on to say that saul was involved in legal processes in which he caused the stop of those legal processes,not just on one occasion,but on separate occasions.in contrast,the court written statement of reasons said only that it upwardly departed because the sentencing commission had not adequately addressed the harm caused when the offense occurs on multiple counts,and because saul,by his conduct,caused legal stoppage.
saul argues that a district court may not upwardly depart based on the number of counts of conviction,because the guidelines specify a method for calculating an offense level for defendants convicted on several counts related to similar activity he cites united states miller,in which we held that t he mere fact that defendant commission of crimes in separate jurisdictions exposed him to separate prosecutions and thus possibly a longer sentence is not,in our view,a sufficient reason for a departure.
although,in chapters and,the sentencing guidelines do address how district courts should sentence defendants convicted for multiple counts,the comments to also make clear that district courts may depart from those requirements in unusual circumstances situations in which there will be inadequate scope for ensuring appropriate additional punishment for the additional crimes are likely to be unusual and can be handled by departure from the guidelines.further,the guidelines policy statement explains the multiple counts grouping requirement as necessary to prevent arbitrary casting of a single transaction into several counts to produce a longer sentence a defendant who engages in conduct or a single course of conduct that causes several harms does not necessarily merit punishment proportionately increased with each additional harm the policy statement describes two situations in which grouping is appropriate and describes how the offense level may be fairly calculated when the conduct involves fungible items,separate drug transactions or thefts of money,the amounts are added and the guidelines apply to the total amount when nonfungible harms are involved,the offense level for the most serious count is increased according to a diminishing scale to reflect the existence of other counts of conviction.
in the ordinary case,a district court may adjust an offense level upward under and for multiple count convictions,to account for the greater harm however,no such adjustment was available in this case an upward departure based on multiple counts in this case does not,moreover,subvert the guidelines policy reasons for the grouping rules,as such a result does not arbitrarily cast a single transaction into several counts.when a defendant like saul has been convicted of as many as thirteen separate counts,and the grouping rules of the guidelines do not permit for any sort of enhancement in a defendant punishment based on the harm or number of counts included,the district court does not abuse its discretion when it upwardly departs on this basis 
saul also argues that the guidelines have already taken into account the possibility that filing false tax forms could cause aggravation and harm.section that contains the base offense level for and under which saul was primarily concerned with tax evasion.it relies on the loss or intended loss caused by a defendant conduct to establish the true base offense level to reflect the amount of harm plainly does not account for harm caused by a tax protestor who not only impedes the irs ability to function but also uses the irs as an attack dog to harass other individuals neither does it anticipate that the tax protestor will file false forms in an attempt to stop legal proceedings against him saul victims suffered a greater degree of harm than is typically involved in a false tax form case,so this factor was an appropriate one for the sentencer to consider under.
we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in deciding to upwardly depart because its orally stated reasons address a directive to reflect the seriousness of the offense,to promote respect for the law,and to provide just punishment for the offense and represent aggravating circumstances that take saul conviction out of the heartland of the district court properly relied on evidence presented at trial and in the psr in making its factual determinations,namely,the number of counts and the fact that saul behavior caused greater aggravation and harm than the typical defendant sentenced under accordingly,the decision to upwardly depart was reasonable.
we still must determine,however,whether the degree or extent of the departure or the sentence as a whole was unreasonable the district court did not rely on any impermissible factors in making its decision to depart upwardly,and we have held that,in such cases,we owe great deference to the sentence imposed by the district court furthermore,the supreme court instructs us to measure the reasonableness of a sentence against the policy and justifications for the guidelines as set forth in a 
at the outset,we note that,by running four sentences consecutively,the district court quadrupled the maximum sentence allowable for saul under the guidelines,the equivalent of a departure.while the mere fact that a departure sentence exceeds by several times the guideline maximum is of no independent consequence in determining whether the sentence is reasonable,it may indicate the unreasonableness of the departure viewed against the court justification for that departure.even though,in this case,we concur with the district court decision to depart above the guidelines,we conclude that the extent of that departure approaches the outer boundary of reasonableness.
first,the degree of departure appears to overstate the harm produced by saul acts.several victims testified that they were inconvenienced by receipt of these forms,and some feared an audit by the irs,yet none testified to experiencing any significant disruption to their daily lives or to having any audits actually initiated as for the harm done to the irs,having to investigate the accusations contained in the false forms sent by saul,no evidence suggests that the number of hours spent by the agency on these probes exceeded the amount of time that it would normally spend investigating false forms.further,saul sent a total of only twelve forms,affecting a total of only six individuals.although the number of counts in this case might also have justified a greater sentence,we are not convinced that this number justifies multiplying a sentence to a point four times beyond the maximum under the guidelines range.
we also note that,even though the district court was required to consider whether the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct before upwardly departing it did not do so saul cites numerous cases in which individuals convicted of sending false tax forms to the irs under circumstances similar to those in his case,and in many instances sending far more forms and causing more trouble to the irs and to their victims,received shorter sentences 
despite our misgivings about the length of this sentence,however,we are unwilling to hold that it is unreasonable.the sentence does overstate the degree of harm,does not appear to advance the goal of uniformity,and does for the number of counts,but each of these was a permissible reason for the district court to depart from the guidelines range and,taken together,would likely justify a sentence at least within striking distance of that imposed by the district court.given the deference we owe to the district court that has properly applied the guidelines,we decline to hold the degree of the departure unreasonable.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing saul sentence,and we therefore affirm it.
samuel saldana 
sixth amendment challenge 
it is true that samuel preserved his booker challenge to the district court decision to depart upward by citing blakely at his sentencing hearing,mandating that we review his challenge for harmless error this case presents one of those rare circumstances,however,in which we hold that a defendant who has preserved booker error is nonetheless not entitled to vacatur and remand of his sentence on this ground.as we stated in mares,we will ordinarily vacate a defendant sentence when he has preserved an objection to a booker sixth amendment violation,and we find error that is not harmless rule a of the federal rules of criminal procedure provides that a harmless error is any error,defect,irregularity or variance that does not affect substantial rights and such error must be disregarded.stated differently,before vacating a defendant sentence,we must determine whether such an error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under our harmless error analysis,the government bears the burden of persuading us,beyond a reasonable doubt,that an error did not affect the defendant substantial rights 
when the district court departed upwardly under the guidelines,based on facts not found by a jury or admitted by the defendant,it plainly erred yet in this instance the government has demonstrated that this error is harmless during samuel sentencing hearing,the judge stated that,in the event that the booker decision should hold the federal sentencing guidelines unconstitutional,the court would sentence him to the same amount of imprisonment and supervised release permitted under the substantive statutes.for an error to have affected substantial rights,it means that the error must have been prejudicial i t must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.it is obvious to us that the error committed by the district court in this case did not affect the outcome of the sentencing proceedings,so any error committed by the district court was harmless 
upward departure 
the district court sentenced samuel in the same manner that it sentenced saul,the only difference being that samuel criminal history category was ii yielding a greater guidelines range of four to ten months on the grouped counts.count one,violation of,carried a statutory maximum of three years imprisonment and one year supervised release counts two through seventeen,violations of a,each carried a statutory maximum of five years imprisonment and three years supervised release.as noted above,the district court sentenced samuel to the statutory maximum of five years imprisonment.
the district court departed upwardly on samuel sentence because it found that there were aggravating circumstances of a kind and to a degree that were not adequately considered by the sentencing commission.specifically,the district court explained in its written reasons that samuel filed the false as a weapon against numerous public officials for daring to perform their public duties.as noted above,however,the guideline under which samuel was sentenced focuses primarily on filing false returns or claiming fraudulent on using the irs as a personal attack dog.moreover,the district court found that the guideline did not adequately take the number of victims into samuel case,there were seven.the court emphasized at the sentencing hearing,and confirmed in writing,that samuel had committed the crime on sixteen separate occasions,and ultimately concluded that without an adequate sentence,the defendant will not be deterred and will continue his unlawful activities.
the district court reasons for its upward departure were not,deterrence,promoting respect for the law,and the seriousness of the offense were factors that the court was required to consider under a.and,samuel does not challenge the validity of the court reasons for its upward departure.rather,he contends that the extent of the departure is unreasonable,insisting that his sentence of months imprisonment is disproportionately long in comparison to sentences imposed in similar cases of defendants using fraudulent irs forms to harass individuals he also urges that the facts of his case do not support a sentence of five years,which is six times longer than the maximum sentence under the applicable sentencing range on any count of conviction if all are served concurrently.
at the outset,we again acknowledge that the extent of the departure here comes close to the outer limits of reasonableness.first,the degree of the departure overstates the harm done to the victims.specifically,most victims testified to experiencing only some annoyance and trepidation at the thought of an irs investigation,and their greatest inconveniences were contacting the irs or fbi and filling out forms.second,samuel sentence is significantly longer than those imposed in similar tax protestor cases.we note,however,in saul district court reasons for upwardly departing are valid and,taken together,clearly justify a sentence of the length of the one actually imposed by the district court.given the deference we owe to the district court,we will not overturn the extent of the upward departure here as unreasonable.
iii.conclusion 
we affirm both defendants convictions the district court did not err when it instructed the jury on the meaning of corruptly both defendants convictions are supported by sufficient evidence and the court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to admit the tax manuals into evidence at saul trial,as these manuals were cumulative,confusing,and had little probative value.we also affirm both defendants sentences neither has successfully stated a claim under united states booker,and the district court did not abuse its discretion in any aspect of its sentencing methodology.the saldana brothers convictions and sentences are,in all respects,
