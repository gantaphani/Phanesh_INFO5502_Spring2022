the estate of virginia bigelow the estate appeals the decision of the united states tax court upholding a deficiency in the estate federal estate tax return imposed by appellee commissioner of internal revenue the commissioner.we consider the applicability of a of the internal revenue code,a,which recaptures in a decedent gross estate the value of certain assets transferred inter vivos.upon bigelow death,the estate filed a federal estate tax return that applied a discount for lack of control and marketability to her remaining interest in a family limited partnership that held a residential property bigelow had transferred before her death.the commissioner filed a notice of deficiency and assessed an additional in federal estate tax,claiming that the residence fair market value,rather than the value of the partnership shares subject to the discount,should be included in the gross estate.the tax court affirmed the deficiency determination,finding that bigelow and the bigelow children had an implied agreement that bigelow would retain income and economic enjoyment from the transferred asset,and that the inter vivos transfer was not a bona fide sale for adequate and full consideration under a.we have jurisdiction under a.we affirm.
virginia bigelow decedent died testate on august,at the age of she was survived by her son,franklin bigelow,bigelow,who is the executor of the estate,was attorney in fact pursuant to a durable power of attorney from until decedent died,and is the attorney of record for this appeal by her daughter virginia burke burke and by nine grandchildren.
in,decedent and her husband purchased as their principal residence a beachfront house on sand point road in carpinteria,california the sand point road property.decedent became the sole owner of that property in when her husband died,and lived there until.decedent gave each of her three,burke and katharine fitzgerald fitzgerald deceased a undivided interest in the sand point road property in or.these gifts were in keeping with decedent practice of making cash gifts to her children every year around christmas,each of which fell below the threshold level where gift tax liability would accrue.
in,decedent executed a declaration and agreement of trust the trust agreement and a deed transferring her remaining undivided interest in the sand point road property to the trust,over which she and bigelow acted as.
on march,decedent suffered a debilitating stroke.after she was released from the hospital,she moved to an facility in alhambra,california and never again lived at the sand point road property.after the stroke,bigelow assumed control over decedent financial concerns and paid her bills.aside from the principal asset of the sand point road property,decedent had a personal bank account and an account held under a revocable trust left by her late husband,which together totaled about.in the fall of,the trust listed the sand point road property for sale.in january,the trustees and decedent children collectively the bigelow children entered into an exchange and leaseback agreement with peter and margaret seaman the seamans,who owned a residence on padaro lane in carpinteria,california the padaro lane property.under the exchange agreement,the trust and the bigelow children agreed to transfer to the seamans the sand point road property,appraised at,and the seamans agreed to pay the bigelows and to transfer to the trust the padaro lane property valued at.as part of the agreement,the trust agreed to lease the padaro lane property to the seamans,with a monthly rent of under an initial term of twelve months,until the seamans could build a new house on the sand point road property.the bigelow children also transferred their fractionalized interests to the seamans and received in return.
to repay the two existing mortgages on the sand point road property,the trust obtained a loan from great western savings and loan great western,which was evidenced by a promissory note and secured by a first position deed of trust on the padaro lane property in favor of the bank,which included the assignment of rents as additional collateral.decedent and bigelow guarantied the performance of the trust under the promissory note.decedent signed the exchange agreement and the deed transferring the sand point road property to the seamans.bigelow signed the other documents,including the loan guaranties,for himself as trustee and for decedent under the power of attorney.
in december,the trust obtained a line of credit from union bank secured by a second position deed of trust on the padaro lane property.decedent guarantied the performance of the trust under the line of credit.the trust drew down on this line of credit between december and november,in part to make cash gifts to decedent children and grandchildren.
in december,the trust and the bigelow children executed a limited partnership agreement the partnership agreement that formed spindrift associates,a california limited partnership spindrift or the partnership whose stated purpose was to engage in the business of owning and operating residential real property,the padaro lane property.the partnership agreement prohibited the partnership from engaging in any other principal business.the partnership agreement permitted the partnership to issue share units with different rights and preferences.each unit represented a contribution of cash or property of.a units were issued to limited partners for cash,while b units were issued to limited partners in exchange for contributions of property.
the trust was both the sole general partner and a limited partner.the bigelow children were limited partners.in december,the trust contributed to the partnership in exchange for a interest as general partner,and the trust and the bigelow children each contributed in exchange for one a unit.on december,the trust transferred the padaro lane property,then worth,to the partnership in exchange for b units.however,the partnership provided that the transferred real property would be encumbered by the great western and union bank debts for which decedent remained personally liable.decedent,in her capacity as grantor and beneficiary of the trust,also agreed to hold the partnership harmless for the great western loan and the union bank line of credit.the partnership agreement required that the trust capital account be reduced to the extent that partnership funds were used to pay any of the principal on the great western loan or the union bank line of credit.
as of february,after the seamans vacated the padaro lane property,the partnership leased it at per month to michael healy and timothy walsh under a lease.in august,decedent care insurance expired,prompting the bigelow children to consider the sale of the padaro lane property.up to this point,the rental receipts from the padaro lane property were deposited into a partnership bank account,and the expenses for the padaro lane property were paid from partnership funds.despite decedent personal obligation to make the monthly payment on the great western loan,the partnership made each payment in her stead,while decedent trust paid monthly toward the union bank debt.
decedent initially met her financial obligations,but her revenue sources dwindled over time.at first,decedent received income from a trust that she and her late husband had established in the trust,the corpus of which was an insurance policy on the life of decedent husband.when the partnership was formed in,decedent had monthly income of from the following sources residential care insurance policies and a fireman fund american express policy an policy rental income from the padaro lane property and other income.decedent monthly expenses were assisted living health insurance supplement miscellaneous medical servicing of great western loan servicing of the union bank debt flood and liability insurance property taxes storage and phone and miscellaneous costs,all of which totaled.after the padaro lane property was transferred to spindrift,decedent no longer received the rent from the real property and her income was reduced to.her expenses were reduced to by shifting the property taxes and home owner insurance to spindrift.the trust transfer of the padaro lane property thus created a shortfall for decedent of.though the debt secured by the padaro lane property was not transferred to the partnership,the partnership nevertheless paid the monthly payment on the great western loan,which offset decedent shortfall.after her death,decedent capital account was reduced to reflect the extent to which these payments went toward the principal of the loan.as the estate concedes,however,most of the monthly payment,especially at the beginning,went toward the interest on this loan and was not offset by a debit to decedent spindrift account.
the monthly benefit under decedent residential care insurance policy expired in august,reducing decedent monthly income to,and creating a shortfall of.in august,the monthly benefit under the fireman express policy expired,further reducing decedent income to,which created a deeper shortfall of.after these policies expired,bigelow informed the trustee of the trust that decedent did not have enough income to pay her expenses.as a result,the trustee of the trust disbursed the remaining assets and terminated the trust.by april,the trustee had distributed a total of to decedent from the trust.
on august,decedent died.bigelow,as trustee,signed a statement of ownership in which he certified the following division of spindrift shares,which reflected the gifted interests by decedent during her lifetime decedent trust a unit,b units estate of fitzgerald a unit,b units burke a unit,b units bigelow a unit,b units.the total partnership interest was a units and b units.bigelow certified that decedent nine grandchildren had income rights associated with b units units each,though the b units themselves were still owned by the trust as general partner because the grandchildren were never substituted as limited partners.disregarding the limited partnership interests associated with the income rights transferred to decedent grandchildren,decedent trust owned a general partnership interest and a limited partnership interest in the partnership on august.
from april,to august,bigelow transferred funds between the spindrift partnership and decedent trust forty times.bigelow transferred funds from the trust to the partnership soon after it was formed to pay the property taxes on the padaro lane property.these transfers,which are characterized by the estate as loans,were interest free and unaccompanied by a promissory note.bigelow transferred funds from the partnership to decedent trust to repay the earlier advances and later to pay decedent expenses.when decedent died,decedent trust owed spindrift for a loan in july and to cover funeral expenses.
on september,the partnership agreed to sell the padaro lane property for.the partnership received from the sale on november,after decedent debt was fully retired.the partnership began distributing the proceeds to the partners,including the trust,by december.until then,the partnership had not made formal distributions to its partners,notwithstanding any advances made to decedent before her death.after her death,the trust continued to act as the general partner of the partnership until the partnership was terminated as of december.final distributions were made to the partners,and the partnership dissolution documents were recorded in the office of the california secretary of state.
on november,bigelow,as executor of decedent estate,signed gift tax returns for and decedent estate tax return,which the internal revenue service irs received on november.on the gift tax returns,bigelow reported that decedent had made taxable gifts of in,in,zero in,and in.bigelow reported that decedent had given limited partnership interests in spindrift to her children and grandchildren valued at per unit in and,per unit in,and per unit in,applying a discount for lack of marketability.bigelow reported on the gift tax return that decedent had made cash gifts of to bigelow and to his wife,forgiven bigelow of indebtedness evidenced by a promissory note,and assigned interests in a promissory note payable to decedent by bigelow to franklin bigelow iii and anna bigelow,at each.bigelow also reported on the gift tax returns combined cash gifts to himself and his wife of in,in,and in.
on the estate tax return,bigelow reported a gross estate of and taxable gifts of.the amount reported as the gross estate included of personal property,the refund of a deposit owed to decedent by the facility,and of transfers during decedent life.the amount reported as transfers during decedent life included for decedent limited partnership shares in spindrift for her general partnership interest in spindrift held by the trust in a merrill lynch cash account offset by an overdraft of in the checking account a cash payment due from boston company and in a savings account.
in computing the value of decedent limited partnership interest on the estate tax return,the tax court determined that bigelow applied the following calculation computed of the value of the padaro lane property,subtracted,the amount of the great western bank loan and the union bank line of credit secured by the property,and applied to the remainder a discount for lack of marketability.bigelow comm r,cch.bigelow also reported that the value of decedent general partnership interest was,computed by taking of the value of the padaro lane property and applying a control premium.
after an audit,the irs issued a notice of deficiency of on october.the irs determined that the full value of the padaro lane property,rather than the value of decedent interest in spindrift discounted for lack of control and marketability,should be included in the gross estate because decedent had retained the possession,enjoyment,or the right to income from the asset that she transferred to spindrift within the meaning of internal revenue section a.
after a bench trial,the tax court upheld the deficiency imposed by the commissioner.the tax court concluded that decedent use of partnership income to replace the income lost because of the transfer of the padaro lane property to the partnership shows that there was an implied agreement between decedent and her children that she would retain the right to the income from the padaro lane property.id.at.the tax court also found decedent used partnership income to secure the great western loan and the union bank line of credit,which further evidenced an implied agreement that she would retain for her life the present economic benefit of the padaro lane property.id.finally,the tax court determined that the transfer of the padaro lane property was not made in good faith because the transfer would have impoverished decedent,left her unprepared to meet her financial needs absent an implied agreement that spindrift would supplement her income,id.at the bigelow children had not implemented partnership formalities,id.at and there was no evidence that any nontax purpose animated the formation of spindrift.id.at.
the estate timely appeals.
the estate advances two main arguments that the tax court erred in upholding the commissioner deficiency determination.first,the estate argues that the tax court clearly erred in finding that there was an implied agreement that decedent would retain the enjoyment of,or derive income from,the padaro lane property.second,the estate argues that the tax court erred in concluding that the bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration exception under a did not apply to the transfer of the padaro lane property from the trust to the spindrift family partnership.
the federal estate tax imposed under the internal revenue code applies generally to the value of assets that pass from an individual at death to the beneficiaries of the decedent estate.see.a taxable estate is defined as the value of the gross estate,less applicable deductions,id,where the value of the gross estate includes the value of all property to the extent of the interest therein of the decedent at the time of his death.id.in addition,a transfers with retained life estate provides 
the value of the gross estate shall include the value of all property to the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer except in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money worth,by trust or otherwise,under which he has retained for his life or for any period not ascertainable without reference to his death or for any period which does not in fact end before his death 
the possession or enjoyment of,or the right to the income from,the property 
section a is designed to recapture the value of certain assets transferred by the decedent during his or her lifetime where the decedent has retained economic benefits from the transferred asset.see kimbell,at.section a is intended to prevent parties from avoiding the estate tax by means of testamentary substitutes that permit a transferor to retain lifetime enjoyment of purportedly transferred property.strangi comm r,cir,pet.for r hrg granted on other grounds,cir see also estate of thompson comm r,cir.this provision under a is in keeping with longstanding congressional recognition that inter vivos gifts would undermine the effectiveness of the federal estate tax if the irs could not recoup the value of transfers that are essentially,transfers which leave the transferor a significant interest in or control over the property transferred during his lifetime.united states estate of grace,d holding assets transferred inter vivos under reciprocal trusts could not escape operation of predecessor statute to see also helvering hallock.recognizing the governing principle of c of the revenue act of that congress meant to include in the gross estate inter vivos gifts which may be resorted to,as a substitute for a will,in making dispositions of property operative at death internal quotation marks omitted.
an estate can avoid the operation of a by demonstrating that the decedent did not retain the possession or enjoyment of,or the right to the income from,the property.a.even where the decedent has retained an interest in the transferred asset,moreover,a is inapplicable if the asset was transferred in a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money worth.a see also thompson,at strangi,at estate of maxwell comm r,cir.
we address first whether the decedent,bigelow,retained any cognizable economic benefits from the padaro lane property under a after the trust transfer of the real property to spindrift.we agree with the tax court that decedent and the bigelow children impliedly agreed that decedent would have access to income from the transferred property and that decedent continued to enjoy the economic benefit that the property secured her personal debt.next,we address the question of whether the transfer of the property was a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration under a parenthetical exception.we conclude that the tax court correctly upheld the deficiency.
applicability of a turns on whether there is an express or implied agreement at the time of transfer that the transferor will retain lifetime possession or enjoyment of,or right to income from,the transferred property.thompson,at.the existence of an implied agreement is a question of fact reviewed for clear error.see estate of korby comm r,cir.in reviewing for clear error,we ask only whether the tax court findings are supported by evidence in the record as a whole,not whether we would necessarily reach the same conclusions.strangi,at.
the tax court found that there was an implied agreement between decedent and the bigelow children that decedent would retain income and the benefit of using the padaro lane property to secure her debt.as to the retained income,the tax court explained 
after the partnership was formed,decedent used of the net income from the rental of the padaro lane property to make monthly payments on the great western loan.after the aarp prudential residential care insurance policy expired in august,decedent expenses exceeded her income by.the partnership continued to make the payments on the great western loan,and bigelow transferred partnership funds to decedent trust to support decedent.no distributions were made to any other partner before decedent death.
bigelow comm r,cch.as to the decedent retention of the padaro lane property as security for her personal debt,the tax court found 
after the transfer of the padaro lane property to spindrift,the property continued to secure decedent legal obligation to pay the great western bank loan and the union bank line of credit.thus,decedent retained the economic benefit of ownership of the padaro lane property after it was transferred to the partnership.
the estate disputes the tax court first finding,arguing that decedent did not receive income in the form of debt cancellation or otherwise because under the partnership agreement each debt payment toward the principal was reduced from decedent share in spindrift and shifted to the other partners.the estate disputes the tax court second finding,claiming that spindrift assumed a practical liability for the great western loan,even though the decedent remained personally liable for this debt and the union bank line of credit.the estate rests its theory of practical liability on two grounds.the estate first contends that under the deed of trust,the trust assigned rental income from the padaro lane property to great western as additional collateral for the loan and second that the transfer of the padaro lane property to spindrift carried with it a practical obligation to meet the loan repayment schedule with the rental income to avoid foreclosure.the commissioner responds that the practical necessity that spindrift repay the debt is evidence itself of an implied agreement that the bigelow children would supplement decedent financial needs because decedent transfer of her main asset,while retaining the indebtedness secured by it,would have left her unable to meet her monthly expenses without resort to partnership funds.
we agree with the commissioner.a key problem with the conveyance of the padaro lane property to spindrift is,for estate tax purposes,that the great western and union bank debt that was secured by the property was not also transferred.this discrepancy indicates that spindrift repaid the debt in decedent stead despite no legal obligation to do so.because spindrift used funds to make these payments of debt that were derived from income on the property decedent had purported to transfer to spindrift,it supports the commissioner position that decedent retained an interest in the property.in an effort to deflect the significance of decedent legal obligation to repay her debt,the estate argues that it had a practical liability to make the monthly payment purportedly to avoid foreclosure.but whether or not spindrift had any practical need to make monthly payments does not undercut the finding that decedent retained the economic benefit from the transferred property.
as to the estate second theory,the tax court also did not clearly err in finding an implied agreement,in light of the entire record,that decedent was to receive income from the padaro lane property.bigelow testified that his mother,the decedent,wanted her initial contribution of the property,and any potential gifted partnership shares to be free and clear of the debt she felt it was her responsibility to keep those obligations.as a practical matter,however,decedent shifted her responsibility to the partnership.first,assuming arguendo the propriety of debiting decedent capital account post mortem to reflect the extent to which these payments went toward the principal of the great western loan,bigelow testified before the tax court and conceded at oral argument that any payment toward the loan interest was not similarly debited.bigelow also testified that interest payments consumed the majority of each payment.in light of this concession,it is clear that decedent received income each less than according to the estate spindrift paid the interest on the loan that she was legally obligated to pay,and in this sense decedent retained an interest in the property that decedent had purported to transfer to spindrift.
the record also supports the tax court finding that decedent received piecemeal income to supplement her financial needs.in the absence of an expectation that the partnership would supplement decedent monthly income as necessary,the transfer of the padaro lane major have impoverished decedent and left her vulnerable to monthly shortfalls.the bigelow children knew that the decedent care coverage was of fixed residential care insurance policy was set to expire in august and the fireman express policy in august the foreseeable possibility that decedent might outlive the coverage.in this event,decedent stood to lose per month after the expiration of the second policy in august.yet both bigelow and burke testified that they were unwilling to pay for their mother care out of their own funds.this testimony supports the tax court finding.in the foreseeable absence of other funds,and the fact that decedent received a loan in july and spindrift advanced after decedent death to cover funeral expenses,it is a reasonable inference that the bigelow children and decedent had an implied agreement that decedent could access funds as needed that were derived from the padaro lane property.
the bigelow children also testified that as the expiration of the fireman express policy in august approached,the bigelow children began taking steps to put the padaro lane property on the market to liquidate the asset and have funds available to cover the decedent living expenses.in fact,burke testified that because she would not pay decedent additional expenses out of her own pocket,she viewed liquidation of decedent spindrift shares through sale of the house as the only option.the bigelow children also testified that they were committed to their mother care and maintaining her in a manner to which she was accustomed.this testimony suggests that the decedent need of funds,rather than other unrelated business criteria that might have informed partners operating at arm length,drove spindrift decision after august to consider liquidating the asset.
the tax court finding that partnership formalities were not observed buttresses the conclusion that there was an implied agreement.bigelow testified that the partnership accounts were not regularly to reflect the monthly payments toward the great western debt that spindrift made for decedent.the estate relies on a provision in the partnership agreement that spindrift funds could be used to retire any of the principal of the contribution debt at the time of the sale of the property,or,otherwise to suggest that the partners capital accounts could have been after the sale of the padaro lane property in compliance with partnership formalities.reliance on this provision in the partnership agreement is unavailing.it is inconsistent that decedent capital account was duly debited in annual updates to reflect the yearly gifts made to children and grandchildren between and,yet a similar annual update was not implemented to reflect the payments of the great western debt during the same period.moreover,no other partner benefited from such an informal and ad hoc access to partnership funds.finally,the post mortem accounting indicates that the decedent and flp had an implied agreement that decedent could access income from the transferred asset.see estate of reichardt comm r,wl finding year end and post mortem adjusting entries made by a certified public accountant were a belated attempt to undo decedent commingling of partnership and personal accounts.
the facts here are analogous to the thompson and korby cases,which upheld the commissioner deficiencies in the context of flps.in thompson,the third circuit upheld the tax court finding of an implied agreement to retain control where decedent transferred of his assets to flps,did not retain sufficient assets to support himself for the remainder of his life,and the flps made significant cash distributions to the decedent in the three years before his death.see at.likewise in korby,the eighth circuit concluded that the tax court findings of an implied agreement were not clearly erroneous where the flp made several distributions to the decedents living trusts in the three years prior to their deaths in part to defray the cost of one decedent nursing home costs.see at.spindrift regularly paid the interest on decedent loans and any payment toward the principal was not promptly debited from the decedent capital account.although these payments may have differed in form from those in thompson and korby,they nonetheless provided supplemental income that defrayed the monthly cost of decedent as her insurance coverage lapsed.
the tax court here did not commit clear error in determining under a that decedent retained the economic benefit from the transferred asset because decedent continued to use the padaro lane property to secure her debt,and because spindrift paid the monthly payments on the great western loan despite decedent personal obligation to do so.also,the tax court committed no clear error in determining that there was an implied agreement that the bigelow children through spindrift would supplement decedent financial needs before her death as such needs arose.
the estate can escape the mechanism under a if it demonstrates that the transfer was a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money worth under the provision parenthetical exception.a.
assessment of the adequate and full consideration element in a is not straightforward in this context because of the nature of the real property transferred to the flp.here,the value of the real property was reconfigured from its fair market price into pro rata partnership interests,which may be subject to a discount from the devaluation in the decedent partnership interest due to a lack of control and marketability see strangi,at because a partnership interest is worth less for tax purposes than a proportional share of the partnership to lack of direct control and exchange would reduce the taxable value of the estate.
the estate urges us to adopt the fifth circuit test for adequate and full consideration set forth in kimbell 
the proper focus on whether a transfer to a partnership is for adequate and full consideration is whether the interests credited to each of the partners was proportionate to the fair market value of the assets each partner contributed to the partnership,whether the assets contributed by each partner to the partnership were properly credited to the respective capital accounts of the partners,and whether on termination or dissolution of the partnership the partners were entitled to distributions from the partnership in amounts equal to their respective capital accounts.
see kimbell,at see also strangi,at holding that the consideration requirement is met only where any reduction in the estate value is joined with a transfer that augments the estate by a commensurate amount.quoting kimbell,at alteration in original.
the estate claims that it meets the first prong of the kimbell test because the decedent transferred the padaro lane property,valued at,in exchange for limited partnership units b units valued at.this exchange,continues the estate,was proportional because decedent initially took a interest in spindrift and the bigelow children took only a,which reflected their respective contributions.as for the second and third prongs,the estate argues that the capital accounts belonging to each partner were credited with the amount proportionate to each respective contribution albeit post mortem,and that each partner received commensurate distribution upon dissolution.the commissioner counters that it is inconsistent to assert on the one hand that the decedent received a proportional number of limited partnership shares in exchange for the fair market value of the padaro lane property,while simultaneously claiming that the partnership interests are entitled to a substantial discount for lack of control and marketability for estate tax purposes.
in estate of harper commissioner,the tax court declined to adopt the per se rule suggested in the commissioner argument that a decedent could not have transferred an asset to an flp for adequate and full consideration in light of the consequent reduction in value that results from the lack of control and marketability.cch,i t is not unreasonable to assume that a genuine pooling for business purposes injects something different into the adequate and full consideration calculus than does mere,unilateral value recycling in the former situation,there is at least the potential that intangibles stemming from a pooling for joint enterprise might support a ruling of adequate and full consideration.emphasis added.in kimbell,the fifth circuit likewise rejected the commissioner inconsistency argument 
the business decision to exchange cash or other assets for a,interest in a limited partnership involves financial considerations other than the purchaser ability to turn right around and sell the newly acquired limited partnership interest for cents on the dollar.investors who acquire such interests do so with the expectation of realizing benefits such as management expertise,security and preservation of assets,capital appreciation and avoidance of personal liability.
at.the third circuit also acknowledged that the dissipation of value resulting from the transfer of marketable assets to a entity will not automatically constitute inadequate consideration for purposes of a.thompson,at emphasis added citing harper comm r,cch.
we agree with the third and fifth circuits and the tax court that an inter vivos transfer of real property to a family limited partnership,which inherently reduces the fair market price of the resultant partnership interests,does not per se disqualify the transfer from falling under a exception.as the qualifying language in all the cases suggests,however,the estate must demonstrate more than a proportional exchange between fair market value and b units valued at.to avoid the reach of a,the estate must also show the genuine pooling of assets,see harper comm r,cch,and a potential for intangibles stemming from pooling for joint enterprise,thompson,at alteration in original quoting harper,at.the validity of the adequate and full consideration prong can not be gauged independently of the business purposes involved in making the bona fide transfer inquiry.
in this context,we consider the bona fide sale and adequate and full consideration elements as interrelated criteria.see estate of bongard comm r,in the context of family limited partnerships,the bona fide sale for adequate and full consideration exception is met where the record establishes the existence of a legitimate and significant nontax reason for creating the family limited partnership,and the transferors received partnership interests proportionate to the value of the property transferred.but see strangi,at treating a exception as having two discrete requirements.
in estate of bongard,the tax court explained that a bona fide transfer is applicable only where there was an arm length transaction.at.although transfers are permitted under section a,they are subject to heightened scrutiny.see kimbell,at.courts look to whether the terms of the transaction differed from those of two unrelated parties negotiating at arm length.bongard,at.the crux of the bona fide transfer inquiry is whether the taxpayer can demonstrate that the transfer had legitimate and significant nontax reasons.see also kimbell,at.courts that have considered this issue hold uniformly that an objective standard is applied to determine whether the decedent inter vivos sale of assets to an flp was bona fide see korby,at a sale is bona fide if,as an objective matter,it serves a substantial business or other purpose.quoting strangi,at kimbell,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted alteration in original thompson,at o bjective indicia that the partnership operates a legitimate business may provide a sufficient factual basis for finding a good faith transfer.kimbell,at applying objective criteria to distinguish the legitimate transfer from the sham transaction or disguised gift bongard,at the objective evidence must indicate that the nontax reason was a significant factor that motivated the partnership creation.
the tax court found that the parenthetical exception did not apply because the transfer of the padaro lane property to the spindrift partnership was not executed in good faith,resting its decision on three grounds the transfer resulted in the impoverishment of the decedent,who,before the transfer,was able to meet her financial needs but required assistance from the partnership afterward until her death,bigelow comm r,cch,the partnership did not honor partnership formalities,id.at and the transfer did not create a potential benefit for the decedent see id.at.we conclude that the tax court did not err in declining to apply the parenthetical exception on these bases.
with respect to the first two findings,the tax court did not err in concluding that,in the absence of an implied agreement that decedent would retain income,the transfer of the padaro lane property in december major have impoverished the decedent.the transfer left her unable to meet her financial obligations whereas prior to the transfer she had applied the monthly rental income under the seaman lease toward her monthly expenses that decedent trust transferred the padaro lane property,which accounted for the vast bulk of her assets,invites salient comparison with the thompson and korby cases.
in thompson,the third circuit examined the legitimacy of two flps into which the decedent,at age,transferred million in assets million in the form of marketable securities while retaining in personal assets.the decedent continued to receive an annual income of to offset yearly expenses of,with an actuarial life expectancy of years.at.the third circuit upheld the tax court finding of an implied agreement,pointing to the general testamentary character of the partnership arrangements that supported the finding 
decedent transferred the vast majority of his investment assets to two family limited partnerships when he was years old.the record reveals,with one exception,that neither partnership engaged in business or loan transactions with anyone outside of the family.transferring this type and volume of assets to family partnerships under these circumstances is more consistent with an estate plan than an investment in a legitimate business.
id.at footnote omitted.the eighth circuit similarly recognized that the extent to which a decedent transfers the majority of his or her assets will be a probative factor in determining whether there was a legitimate,rationale for the creation of and participation in an flp.see korby,at noting that the korbys retained less than in assets in a living trust,their sole source of income,after they contributed over million to fund an flp.
as discussed supra,spindrift did not assume the great western debt when decedent trust conveyed to spindrift the padaro lane property,yet the partnership nonetheless made monthly payments for decedent.although the estate argues that spindrift had a practical liability to make the monthly payment purportedly to avoid foreclosure,that does not erase the fact that when the trust transferred the property decedent did not,as a legal matter,receive adequate and full consideration in light of her assumption of the debt.conversely,that the estate repaid the debt gratuitously suggests that the transfer without the debt would have impoverished her and that any anticipated shortfall could not be remedied absent an implied agreement that spindrift would supplement decedent by servicing her debt.
as to the tax court second finding,any attempt to treat other disbursements as loans is unpersuasive because the partnership formality of proper accounting was not adequately observed in the partners capital accounts to reflect the disbursements.as discussed supra,the estate post mortem debiting of decedent account is insufficient in the face of evidence of an implied agreement.see reichardt,at.
finally,the estate argues that the tax court clearly erred in not recognizing that spindrift had benefits.first,the estate argues that a partnership shielded the included family members from personal liability for any inj
