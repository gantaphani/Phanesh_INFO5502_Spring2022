pacific gas and electric company and pg e corporation collectively pge appeal the united states court of federal claims judgment that the internal revenue service irs or service properly offset statutory interest that was erroneously paid to pge erroneous interest with respect to the tax year,against a later refund of tax and interest determined to be due pge for the same tax year.pac.gas united states.pge i.because the irs made this offset after the statute of limitations under b would have precluded the government from filing suit to recover the erroneous interest,we reverse.
this case involves statutory interest erroneously paid to pge for tax year.pge timely filed its tax return.pge thereafter filed claims for refund for and the irs made other adjustments with respect to that year,which are not necessary to detail.suffice it to say that in august,the irs determined that pge had overpaid its tax.in determining the statutory interest under to be paid to pge on this overpayment,the irs made errors in its calculation resulting in too much interest being paid to pge 
pge thereafter filed additional refund claims for tax and interest for the tax year primarily to claim certain statutorily authorized carryback adjustments from tax year.in reviewing those refund claims,the irs discovered the interest computation errors it had previously made in the august refund and determined that it had erroneously overpaid pge in statutory interest.the irs then used the amount of this erroneous interest previously paid to pge in to offset and reduce the tax and interest for the tax year that it refunded to pge in.
pge filed suit in the court of federal claims,contending it was entitled to the additional amount of in connection with the refund pge argued that the irs was not permitted to offset such erroneous interest against its allowable refund of tax and interest in because it was done after the expiration of the statute of limitations for filing suit to recover an erroneous refund under,b.the government argued that its use of the offset was permissible.both parties moved for summary judgment.
the court of federal claims held that the irs offset action in was proper.pge i.at.although recognizing that a suit under for the amount of the erroneously paid interest would have been,the court said there is no provision in the internal revenue code forbidding the administrative remedy the service chose here.id.at.the court was not persuaded by pge efforts to distinguish precedent the court found controlling.specifically,the court explained 
the most clearly applicable precedents,lewis,dysart,and fisher,all contemplate the allowance of an offset by the government when,as here,the same tax,taxpayer,and tax year are at issue.plaintiff has attempted to distinguish the facts of this case from lewis and fisher the most important fact for the court is that this case involves the same tax,with the same taxpayer,for the same tax year.as the court of appeals for the federal circuit stated in fisher,lewis and dysart together stand for the proposition that the government may offset against a tax refund claim any additional amounts the taxpayer owes with respect to the tax shown on the return,even though the statute of limitations would bar assessing the additional amount owed.at.here,plaintiff received an amount in overpayment with respect to tax year.by requesting another refund in with respect to tax year,plaintiff opened the door to the service offsetting the overpayment amount.therefore,the service action in was legal.
id.at.the court further determined that the offset was implemented correctly.
pge now appeals the issues of whether the offset was permissible and,if it was,whether the irs implemented it properly.we have jurisdiction under a.
we review the court of federal claims grant of summary judgment without deference.agwiak united states.
we must determine whether the irs was entitled to offset the erroneous interest paid to pge in against amounts due and owing pge on a subsequent refund relating to the same tax year when the government could not have maintained a suit for such erroneous interest due to the expiration of the statute of limitations.see,b.surprisingly,this issue appears be one of first impression 
pge argues that when a taxpayer receives an erroneous refund of statutory interest it is not a tax liability but an ordinary debt obligation to the government.thus,such erroneous interest mistakenly paid can not be assessed or collected by the irs in the same manner as a tax liability.pge contends that it must be recovered,if at all,only by suit for an erroneous refund under or by means otherwise afforded to the government for collection of debts,through a right of offset,provided that the right is exercised within the period of limitations applicable to suits brought under.pge also asserts that there is no statutory or regulatory basis for extending the supreme court decision in lewis reynolds,and its progeny to liabilities.
the government responds simply that under lewis reynolds and its progeny the taxpayer claim for refund of its overpayment reopened its entire liability to redetermination by the irs.as such,it argues that the remedy of offset was available to the irs.
lewis reynolds was an income tax refund suit in which,in response to the refund claimed,the commissioner of internal revenue determined that a deduction taken on the return,which was previously allowed,had been improperly taken.in determining the amount of the refund,the improper deduction was disallowed by the commissioner.the limitations period for assessing an additional tax to reflect the disallowance of the deduction had passed when the commissioner acted.the supreme court agreed with the court of appeals conclusion that the relevant statutory provisions clearly limit refunds to overpayments.it follows that the ultimate question presented for decision,upon a claim for refund,is whether the taxpayer has overpaid his tax and t his involves a redetermination of the entire tax liability.id.at.quoting lewis reynolds,cir emphasis added.affirming the commissioner action,the court stated 
while the statutes authorizing refunds do not specifically empower the commissioner to reaudit a return whenever repayment is claimed,authority therefor is necessarily implied.an overpayment must appear before refund is authorized.although the statute of limitations may have barred the assessment and collection of any additional sum,it does not obliterate the right of the united states to retain payments already received when they do not exceed the amount which might have been properly assessed and demanded.
at.emphases added.thus,the court simply applied the statutory provisions dealing with which require that an overpayment must be shown by the taxpayer before a refund can be authorized.accordingly,where the taxpayer has filed a claim for a tax refund,the irs may offset against the refund claim a tax deficiency for the same tax year that previously had not been assessed,even though the assessment of such tax is barred by the expiration of the applicable period of limitations.otherwise,a refund might be made when there was not,in fact,an overpayment,an event that would be inconsistent with the statute.see supra at.
this defense of lack of overpayment,permitting the government to offset a refund claim with a tax deficiency for the same tax year owed by the same taxpayer,was further explored by our predecessor court in dysart united states.in this case,the taxpayer sought a refund of an erroneously assessed and collected penalty for the tax year.the government conceded that the penalty was collected in error but claimed an offset in view of a tax deficiency that exceeded the penalty,despite the fact that the statute of limitations barred the assessment of the tax deficiency the court ruled that the tax penalty is an addition to the tax,and as such is considered as part of the income tax for the taxable year.see,wl.id.at.
another issue before the court was whether in a suit for refund where both the taxpayers claim and the government setoff concern the same tax for the same year by the same taxpayers,the right of the government to assert such a defense is an unconditional right or whether such a right is subject to the court discretion after evaluating the equities involved in each particular case.id.at the court held that the supreme court language in lewis reynolds laid down an unqualified rule that an overpayment must appear before refund is authorized,at quoting lewis reynolds,at,and that there was nothing to suggest limiting the defense of lack of overpayment where the refund claim and the setoff relate to the same tax,for the same year,payable by the same taxpayer,id.at.the court further commented that when determining whether there was an overpayment,a taxpayer entire tax liability under the particular tax return was open for redetermination.id.at emphasis added.
the dysart case,therefore,reiterated the necessity of an overpayment before a refund can be authorized and held that a court may not look to the equities of a case to deny the defense of lack of overpayment to the government.contrary to the government assertion,dysart did not open the door wider than lewis reynolds already had for the irs to offset a refund.at most,it simply clarified that setoff applied to the refund claim for a tax penalty improperly collected,because a tax penalty is an addition to tax and should be considered part of the tax liability.
our holding in fisher united states,involved a refund claim against which the government offset deficiency interest owed by the same taxpayer for the same tax year.our analysis characterized the teachings of lewis reynolds and dysart as permitting the government to offset against a tax refund claim any tax owed for that year lewis and dysart together stand for the proposition that the government may offset against a tax refund claim any additional amounts the taxpayer owes with respect to the tax shown on the return,even though the statute of limitations would bar assessing the additional amount owed.id.at emphasis added.we also emphasized the necessity of the existence of an overpayment before a refund could be authorized.id.at noting that in dysart our predecessor court stated the essential principle that a taxpayer suing for a refund of tax for a particular year must show that,in actuality,he overpaid that tax.
the crux of our decision in fisher,however,involved the question of whether deficiency interest should be treated any differently than the tax deficiency in lewis reynolds or the tax penalty in dysart.looking to the revenue code and our predecessor court,we held that for the purposes of offset,interest should not be treated any differently than other components of tax liability.fisher,at see e stating that interest on tax underpayments shall be assessed,collected,and paid in the same manner as taxes and that any reference to any tax imposed by this title shall be deemed also to refer to interest imposed by this section on such tax alexander proudfoot united states,stating t he code design for such interest is to assimilate it to the tax itself for a long time,deficiency interest has been so closely braided to principal that it has been deemed an integral part of the tax.
the common thread in these cases is that the refund statute requires that there be an actual overpayment of tax to support a refund.there can not be such an overpayment without taking into account any additional amount of assessable tax,interest,or penalty owed by the taxpayer even though such an amount could not be assessed and collected because of the running of the statute of limitations.
in the instant case,the amount used to offset the refund claim in was the erroneously calculated statutory interest,a nonassessable amount.the assessable quantities in lewis reynolds and its progeny tax deficiency,deficiency interest,and tax penalty are a part of a taxpayer tax liability,whereas nonassessable statutory interest is not.thus,contrary to the government assertion,lewis reynolds and its progeny are not directly on point with the case before us.we must,however,decide whether to extend this line of cases to cover the situation at issue here.because the courts have distinguished components of tax liability which are assessable amounts from statutory interest which is not a tax liability component or assessable,we have found no convincing reason the two quantities should be treated the same.we,therefore,decline to extend lewis reynolds and its progeny to reach the facts of this case.
the tax deficiencies including assessable interest and penalties asserted as an offset in lewis reynolds and its progeny are very different from the offset at issue here and even treated differently by the internal revenue code.our case law notes the distinctions.in proudfoot,for example,our predecessor court explained that statutory interest arises simply because the government had possession of the taxpayer funds,whereas deficiency interest is additional money due the government that arises from the taxpayer tax liability 
t he revenue code deals quite differently with statutory interest payable by the government on overpayments.regulated by,that form of interest is paid by the united states,not as a refund of interest previously paid by the taxpayer on demand of the service,but simply because the government has had use of money found to belong to the taxpayer 
id.at see also fisher,at the internal revenue code treats deficiency interest as an integral part of the liability itself.thus,e,provides that interest on tax underpayments shall be assessed,collected,and paid in the same manner as taxes and that any reference to any tax imposed by this title shall be deemed also to refer to interest imposed by this section on such tax.
we are not the only court to treat tax monies differently based on the nature or generation of the funds.see united states,cir crocker first bank of united states,explaining that a suit to recover an erroneous refund is not a suit in respect of any liability in respect of any tax,because any tax liability was satisfied when the tax was originally paid.in,the taxpayers paid their tax and interest liability in advance,which amounts were then assessed.the service later erroneously sent the taxpayers a refund check.without reassessing the tax,the service then instituted collection activities and recovered a portion of the erroneous refund.the taxpayers sued to quiet title and recover the monies they claimed were unlawfully taken by the government.the seventh circuit noted that the refund taxpayers received was a nonrebate refund.nonrebate refunds are sent to the taxpayer not because the irs determines that the tax paid is not owing but because of mistakes,typically clerical or computer errors,at.the court stated that there is a fundamental difference between taxpayers liability for tax and their obligation,if any,to return a refund paid by mistake 
the government proposed approach would overlook the fundamental difference in character between the money that the now possess a refund caused by the irs error and the money they originally owed the irs their tax liability.the money the have now is not the money that the irs original assessment contemplated,since that amount was already paid.rather,it is a payment the irs accidentally sent them.they owe it to the government because they have been unjustly enriched by it,not because they have not paid their taxes.
id.at.the court held that because the money the taxpayer received was not a part of the taxpaying transaction,the service could not recover the funds through procedures.id.
a tax deficiency,tax penalty,and deficiency interest,the quantities permitted to offset the taxpayer claimed refunds in lewis reynolds and its progeny,are all components of a taxpayer tax liability.see dysart,at t he tax penalty is considered as part of the income tax for the taxable year.proudfoot,at t he code design for such deficiency interest is to assimilate it to the tax itself for a long time,deficiency interest has been so closely braided to principal that it has been deemed an integral part of the tax.therefore,these components are taken into account in determining whether an overpayment exists and permitting them to
