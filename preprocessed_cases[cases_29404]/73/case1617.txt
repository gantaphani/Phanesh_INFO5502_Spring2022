labor code section embodies the public policy of california to require employers engaged on public works projects to pay the prevailing wage to their workers if the project is paid for in whole or in part out of public funds.the novel question presented here is whether tax credits provided by the state to facilitate construction of housing comes within this definition.the trial court concluded that it does.upon de novo review of the issue,we conclude however worthy the policy goals of encouraging the construction of housing and ensuring compliance with the prevailing wage requirements,the statutory language in its present form can not be construed to command that result.tax credits are,at best,intangible inducements offered from government,but they are not actual or de facto expenditures by government.as such,they do not qualify as either the payment of the equivalent of money by the state subd.b,or as a transfer by the state of an asset for less than fair market price subd.b,the portions of the definition of paid for in whole or in part out of public funds considered here.we thus reverse.
background 
california prevailing wage law 
california prevailing wage law traces back to,the same year congress enacted the federal counterpart,commonly known as the act.stats,ch,stat,as amended.prevailing wage laws were enacted in response to economic conditions of the depression,when the oversupply of labor was exploited by unscrupulous contractors to win government contracts when private construction virtually stopped.see universities research coutu,d.
the legislature has declared that it is the policy of california to vigorously enforce minimum labor standards in order to ensure employees are not required or permitted to work under substandard unlawful conditions or for employers that have not secured the payment of compensation,and to protect employers who comply with the law from those who attempt to gain competitive advantage at the expense of their workers by failing to comply with minimum labor standards,subd.a.this general objective subsumes within it a number of specific goals to protect employees from substandard wages that might be paid if contractors could recruit labor from distant areas to permit union contractors to compete with nonunion contractors to benefit the public through the superior efficiency of employees and to compensate nonpublic employees with higher wages for the absence of job security and employment benefits enjoyed by public employees.lusardi construction aubry cal th,d.
the prevailing wage law is fairly straightforward in operation.its general thrust is that except for public works projects of one thousand dollars or less,not less than the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for work of a similar character in the locality in which the public work is performed,and not less than the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for holiday and overtime work shall be paid to all workers employed on public works.the minimum threshold is increased to for construction work,and for alteration,demolition,repair,or maintenance work.
public works is given a broad definition,to include construction,alteration,demolition,installation,or repair work done under contract and paid for in whole or in part out of public funds,and includes work performed during the design and preconstruction phases of construction,subd.a.the project may involve property that will remain in private hands but will be leased to the state or a political subdivision.however,the prevailing wage requirement does not apply to work carried out by a public agency with its own employees.
the director of the department of industrial relations director is given the responsibility for determining the general prevailing wage according to statutory criteria.the director fixes the prevailing wage rates for every category of worker needed for a public works project,which are then used by public entities soliciting bids for the project.the director also has the authority to give opinions as to whether a specific project or type of work requires compliance with the prevailing wage law,tit,a lusardi construction aubry,supra,cal th,d.
a contractor or subcontractor who pays less than the established prevailing rate may be assessed civil penalties,may be suspended from bidding or working on public works projects for up to three years,and is also subject to criminal prosecution for failing to maintain payroll records demonstrating compliance.
before the particulars that led to this appeal can be fully understood,a knowledge of the prevailing wage law must be augmented with a description of the low income housing tax credit lihtc programs.
the federal and california lihtc programs 
according to the state board of equalization,the federal housing tax credit program,instituted by the tax reform act and subsequently codified as section of the internal revenue code allows eligible taxpayers to take a credit against federal income taxes due for qualified expenditures involving housing projects.to be eligible for the tax credit,the taxpayer must hold an ownership interest in a housing project for which tax credits have been awarded.in exchange for the tax credits,the project owners agree to operate the project in accordance with the restrictions contained in section and irs regulations.furthermore,as a condition of receiving tax credits,the project owners are required to enter into a recorded regulatory agreement restricting the use of the property to its terms.each year,the federal government allocates a fixed amount of housing tax credits to each state under section,each state must annually adopt a qualified allocation plan describing how its annual share of federal tax credits will be allocated among eligible,competing projects 
the california agency responsible for tax credit allocation,and for developing the state annual qualified allocation plan,is the california tax credit allocation committee ctcac,a unit of the state treasurer office.ctcac reviews applications from project developers and allocates the state federal tax credits on a competitive basis,using the prescribed criteria in section and the additional tax criteria contained in ctcac own regulations.see health,tit.ctcac currently receives applications for about four times the annual amount of federal tax credits available 
the california legislature has also authorized a state housing tax credit program to augment the federal program that is also administered by ctcac.state bd.of equalization guidelines for the assessment of properties financed using housing tax credits july pp.sbe guidelines see health,tit,et after the credits have been allocated,they are still subject to reservations,conditioning their use upon timely project completion and its subsequent operation.see,tit,subd.a.the project when completed must serve tenants for a period equal to the greater of years or the life of the building,subd.c c,subd.c c,subd.c c see health,subd.f.there is a rigorous ongoing compliance monitoring program administered by the irs and ctcac.see.if a project is found to be in material noncompliance,ctcac notifies the irs,which by law may take action to disallow tax credits.sbe guidelines,supra,see health,subd.b,tit.
according to the state board of equalization,the existence of tax credits is the principal instrument for achieving the goal of increasing the supply of housing the tax credits allocated to a project form the basis for the project equity financing typically,a public or private real estate syndication is the mechanism for converting tax credits allocated to a project into cash proceeds used to develop the project.a limited partnership is formed,with the developer of the project as general partner.equity in the tax credit project is sold to investors in the form of limited partnership interests.the buyers of the tax credits become limited partners and equity holders in the project,which entitles them to claim the future tax credits.sbe guidelines,supra.a lthough it is commonly stated that the developer of a tax credit project raises equity funds by selling the tax credits,this is not exactly what happens.what in fact are sold are limited interests in the project that include rights to certain tax credits,not the tax credits per se,fn.
the project and start of this dispute 
the project at issue is the proposed rehabilitation of the units in the woodhaven manor apartments located in rancho cucamonga,san bernardino county.the rehabilitation is to be done by a limited partnership known as hb housing partners hb housing.the managing partner of hb housing is the nonprofit southern california housing development corporation housing development.late in,hb housing executed an agreement with the rancho cucamonga redevelopment agency,under the terms of which hb housing would purchase the complex,rehabilitate it,and for a period of years rent all of the apartments to persons earning no more than of the area median income.the cost of the project was estimated at million,most of which would be obtained by loans from the california housing finance agency and the rancho cucamonga redevelopment agency.slightly more than would represent state lihtcs allocated over a period following completion of the rehabilitation.
in august,housing development asked the director for a coverage determination that the project was not required to comply with the prevailing wage law because it does not constitute public works paid for in whole or in part out of public funds.see,tit,any interested person may file a request to determine coverage under the prevailing wage laws.noting that the director had already determined that federal lihtcs did not involve an expenditure of public funds,housing development requested that the same reasoning be applied to state lihtcs.
on november,the director issued his coverage determination,reaching the result desired by housing development.the director reasoned as follows 
the federal tax credits do not entail payment out of public funds for the reasons set forth in pw,rancho santa fe senior affordable housing project february.although state tax credits were not at issue in that case,much of the analysis of federal tax credits is equally applicable to them.however,each of the definitions of payment out of public funds set forth in section b requires a payment or other action by the state or political subdivision.thus it is necessary to examine whether state tax credits fall within any of these definitions.
section b provides that payment of money or the equivalent of money by the state or political subdivision constitutes payment out of public funds.a tax credit involves no expenditure of public moneys received or held but merely reduces the taxpayer liability for total tax due.center for public interest law fair political practices com.d.accordingly,the allocation of state tax credits is not a payment of money or the equivalent of money within the meaning of section b.
section b defines payment out of public funds to include that t ransfer by the state or political subdivision of an asset of value for less than fair market price.lihtcs do not constitute a right to a payment of money,have no independent value,and are not freely transferable upon receipt.rainbow apartments property tax app.bd.dist d.thus a fair market price can not be assigned to state tax credits,and they are not payment out of public funds within the meaning of section b.
section b defines as payment out of public funds to include fees,costs,rents,insurance or bond premiums,loans,interest rates,or other obligations that would normally be required in the execution of the contract,that are paid,reduced,charged at less than fair market value,waived,or forgiven by the state or political subdivision.
while the tax credits may reduce developer state income tax obligations,these are not obligations that would normally be required in the execution of the contract.the execution of the contract entails expenditures by,not income to,developer.the tax credits therefore would reduce tax obligations,if any,on income derived from activities other than construction of the housing.
section b defines payment out of public funds to include c redits that are applied by the state or political subdivision against repayment obligations to the state or political subdivision.an income tax is not an obligation to repay money obtained from a governmental entity.moreover,the state tax credits at issue here are not against any repayment obligation pertaining to this project,but rather will reduce the tax liability that investors incur on income unrelated to the project.
thus the state tax credits do not constitute payment out of public funds within the meaning of section b.
for the foregoing reasons,the project is not a public work subject to prevailing wage requirements.public works case,woodhaven manor apartments.
proceedings in the trial court 
because the director designated his decision as precedential,thus allowing it to be relied upon in subsequent determinations see,this coverage determination reverberated beyond the specific controversy.the state building and construction trades council of california trades council,which had initially opposed housing development requested interpretation of the applicability of the prevailing wage law,sought to have the director decision reversed by administrative appeal.see,tit,interested party may appeal coverage determination.when that failed,trades council commenced this action in february against the director and the department of industrial relations department housing development was named as interested party.
trades council sought a writ of traditional mandate code civ,on the ground that the director has abused his discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law,in that he misinterpreted and misapplied the law in reaching his opinion that the project is not a public work subject to california prevailing wage act.trades council prayed that the director be commanded to set aside his erroneous decision and to issue a new decision that correctly applies the law.trades council also asked for declaratory relief consistent with the contentions as set forth above if the trial court concludes that review of the director decision is not available under.
the trial court heard extensive argument on trades council motion for issuance of the writ.in its written order,the court concluded that lihtcs qualified as both payment of money or the equivalent of money by the state directly to or on behalf of the public works contractor,subcontractor,or developer,subd.b,and the t ransfer by the state of an asset of value for less than fair market price subd.b,which are two of the definitions of paid for in whole or in part out of public funds set out in section.
noting that the plain language of section does not expressly list tax credits in those definitions,the trial court concluded the economic reality of lihtcs showed that they are an asset of value.as the court explained to hold that lihtcs are not an asset of value would be inconsistent with the reality of their function in the funding of the project.even if the tax credits can not be used immediately,and even if they come with various limitations and conditions,they are obviously an asset of value in some sense.it does not matter that the tax credits have no value except to the owners of limited partnership interests in this particular project.the legislature clearly intended to finance the development of low income housing by issuing these tax credits,and succeeded in doing so,in so far as the tax credits were clearly treated as a source of construction funding by the developer to whom they were issued.the state created the credits and allocated them specifically to housing development project to accomplish exactly this result.
the court concluded its thoughtful and order by ruling that trades council was entitled to the writ consideration of the statute as a whole,therefore,leads to the conclusion that lihtcs come within the scope of either section b or,more likely,section b.the director prevailing wage determination is therefore in error.the woodhaven project involves construction done under contract and funded in part by lihtcs allocated after december.the use of the state lihtcs to subsidize the construction means the construction is paid for in part out of public funds within the meaning of section b and,therefore,that the workers performing that construction are entitled to be paid prevailing wages.
separate notices of appeal were filed by housing development and by the director and the department we ordered the appeals consolidated.
discussion 
there is but a single issue before us,namely,whether the lihtcs involved in the financing make the project a public work requiring workers to be paid the prevailing wage.in deciding this issue,we have had the benefit of highly competent briefs filed by the parties.in addition,trades council is also supported with an amicus brief from the state treasurer,while the california redevelopment association and the california building industry association have submitted amicus briefs behind the director and the department.but before we address the merits,we must settle the issue of our standard of,how much,if any,deference must we pay to the director coverage determination.
the broad question of the deference due to administrative decisions has perplexed some of our best judicial minds.see the majority opinion of brown,and the concurring opinion of mosk,in yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,citing,wilkinson workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,tobriner,culligan water conditioning state bd.of equalization cal d,sullivan,whitcomb hotel,cal.emp.com.cal d,traynor,bodinson california com.cal d,gibson,see also dare bd.of medical examiners cal d,concur.dis.opn.of traynor,laisne cal.bd.of optometry cal d,dis.opn.of gibson.fortunately,we are not required to make an original contribution to this topic.
the parties and one amicus devote a considerable amount of space in their briefs to the issue of whether the director coverage determination was the equivalent of an established administrative interpretation of a statute by the official responsible for administering that statute,and thus a rule entitled to our deference.see generally yamaha of america state bd.of equalization,supra,cal th,d,yamaha.there are three compelling reasons why there is not much,if any,deference due.
first,following completion of briefing for this appeal,the director discontinued the practice of designating coverage determinations as precedential he also stripped prior determinations of precedential value,and announced that past and future coverage determinations would be advisory only.the obvious conclusion is that the director and the department have jettisoned a general interpretation of whether lihtcs meet the statutory definition of a public work paid for in whole or in part out of public funds,and adopted a approach using decisions on specific projects.in other words,coverage determinations are no longer,if they ever were,treated as by the department itself.see,tit,declaring that the director authority to establish the prevailing wage for any craft,classification,or type of worker is,and a ny hearing under this process is tidewater marine western,bradshaw cal th,d,a written statement of policy that an agency intends to apply generally and that predicts how the agency will decide future cases is essentially legislative in nature.
second,and just as significant,judicial deference to an administrative interpretation of a statute is extended if the interpretation is long standing,consistent,and if the interpretation was contemporaneous.people cole cal th,d,sara superior court cal th,d,yamaha,supra,cal th,d.such is not the case here.
the director coverage determination is less than two years old,so it hardly qualifies as long standing.moreover,that determination reversed the department position taken in,that lihtcs did make a project a public work paid for in whole or in part out of public funds within the meaning of section.public works case,pacific apartments,june,the director current reading of section thus hardly qualifies as consistent.w hen an agency s construction flatly contradicts its original interpretation,it is not entitled to significant deference.murphy kenneth cole productions,cal th,fn,d,quoting henning industrial welfare com.cal d.put more bluntly,a vacillating position is entitled to no deference.yamaha,supra,at,d,
third,and most importantly,the nature of the issue before us involves the quintessential judicial function.because the issue here is a pure one of statutory interpretation,this is not a situation where the administrative agency has a comparative interpretative advantage over the courts.yamaha,supra,cal th,d,quoting cal.law revision,tent.recommendation,judicial review of agency action,supra,people cole,supra,cal th,d,bonnell medical bd.cal th,d.statutory language is not something where the materials are technical and engage an agency expertise.asimow,the scope of judicial review of decisions of california administrative agencies,supra,ucla.to the contrary,it is the judiciary which has the ultimate authority for determining the meaning of a statute.yamaha,supra,at,d,culligan water conditioning state bd.of equalization,supra,cal d,the ultimate resolution of legal questions rests with the courts morris williams cal d,whatever the force of administrative construction final responsibility for the interpretation of the law rests with the courts.see cal,art.iii,only appellate courts,not administrative agencies,can declare laws invalid.
nevertheless,the opinion of an administrative agency as to a statute meaning may be helpful even if it is not binding or necessarily even authoritative.yamaha,supra,cal th,d,accord,sara superior court,supra,cal th,d.courts must,in short,independently judge the text of the statute,taking into account and respecting an agency interpretation of its meaning,whether embodied in a formal rule or less formal representation.where the meaning and legal effect of a statute is the issue,an agency interpretation is one among several tools available to the court.depending on the context,it may be helpful,enlightening,even convincing.it may sometimes be of little worth.yamaha,supra,at,d.
in short,while we consider the director current interpretation of section,we do not extend that interpretation any particular deference.because there is no factual dispute,only the question of how that statute is to be construed and applied,we exercise our independent judgment.murphy kenneth cole productions,supra,cal th,fn,d,city of long beach department of industrial relations cal th,d,city of long beach discussed in fn,post people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d.before addressing the merits of the pure legal issue before us,we first examine the history of section in this court,and the legislative aftermath.
the precise issue here may be novel,but its general context has previously been before this court,in mcintosh aubry th,d mcintosh,where we considered the director conclusion that a project was not a public work and thus did not require payment of prevailing wages.the project there was to be a residential shelter for or abused minors.the facility was to be constructed on acreage leased by the county that it would sublease,to the developer for years.the trial court denied mandamus to overturn the director decision.id.at,d.we affirmed,on the basis of section as it then read reasoning that the county forbearance of rent did not qualify as a payment of public funds 
to determine the intent of legislation,we first consult the words themselves,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.citations.citation.the full statutory phrase here is paid for in whole or in part out of public funds,subd.a.does it encompass the forbearance of rent.the verb pay,standing alone can in its usual and ordinary sense include the transfer of things other than money.it means to satisfy someone for services rendered or property delivered or to discharge an obligation pay is a general term,usu ally lacking particular connotation but sometimes bluntly stressing the purchase of services webster third new internat.dict.even i n a more restricted legal sense,payment is the performance of a duty promise,or obligation by the delivery of money or other value the delivery of money or its equivalent black law dict.ed.
however,the payment here must be out of public funds,subd.a.the word funds is not specially defined in the statute but has a meaning in common parlance the dictionary defines it as available pecuniary resources ordinarily including cash and negotiable paper citation,and in a legal context the courts have also taken it to include property of value which may be converted into cash citations.citation.the county right to charge rent is not an available pecuniary resource like cash or some readily asset.to take rent collected from one source and use it to pay obligations would plainly be a payment of public funds,but the county here will not collect the rent.nor,according to our record,will it lose appreciable rents it otherwise might have charged for the acreage in its unimproved state.also,it may be more accurate to view uncharged rent over years as an ongoing subsidy of services rather than the initial construction.the contract originally envisioned only a year of construction,during which time,of course,the commercial value of the land would be at its lowest.
the forbearance of rent here,while valuable as a negotiating tool in securing the project,does not fit comfortably into the idea of construction paid for out of public funds.plaintiffs attribute the ill fit to changing times words which were easy to apply when counties contracted for projects directly have become awkward in a age when counties turn increasingly to alliances with private industry.in plaintiffs view,we must expand the meaning of anachronistic language to fit the realities of the present,or risk frustrating legislative intent.
we view the situation differently.courts will liberally construe prevailing wage statutes citations,but they can not interfere where the legislature has demonstrated the ability to make its intent clear and chosen not to act.citations.we do not share plaintiffs view that the legislature has overlooked changes in county needs or practices in this area.it has in fact been active.it has regularly amended the prevailing wage law to keep pace with evolving realities.section was such a reaction,as was the addition of section and subdivision f of section those balanced solutions show current awareness by the legislature.we adhere to the plain meaning of section,subdivision a,and decline to read it more expansively.mcintosh,supra,th,d.
although it was not an express term of the contract between the county and the developer,it appears that during the construction process in mcintosh the county incurred inspection costs that would ordinarily have been charged to the developer,but in fact were absorbed by the county.we held that these expenses likewise did not qualify as the payment of public funds 
the nature of the costs is important,and is undisputed.the county waived costs it normally charges for routine inspections and allocated them between departments for internal accounting purposes we hold that the cost waivers were not public funds paid for construction,subd.a.like the forbearance of rent,these costs involve no payment of funds out of county coffers.legislators could easily express an intent to bring waived costs or rent within the concept of payment with public funds but have not done so.a holding that waived inspection costs are partial payments from public funds could make public works of any project where a county has used cost waivers as incentives to development,even though the project may serve purely private needs.the statute gives no warning that this result was intended.mcintosh,supra,th,d.
mcintosh generated repeated attempts in the legislature to modify or overturn it.these efforts culminated in the passage of senate bill in.stats,ch.the bill was sponsored by the trades council.rules,off.of floor analyses,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.it began modestly as an amendment of government code section,a provision of the statutory scheme for the california infrastructure and economic development bank,et,to simply provide that all public works financed by the bank,including those projects financed through the use of industrial development bonds shall comply with the prevailing wage law.bill reg.sess.it cleared the senate government operations committee on april,and was passed by the full senate two days later.
it was the assembly which began amending section as it then read.see fn,ante.the first amendment would have added a subdivision g,to the effect that paid for in whole or in part out of public funds includes,but is not limited to,the payment of money or the equivalent of money by a public agency directly to or on behalf of the public works contractor or developer,performance of work in execution of the project,transfer of an asset of value for less than fair market price,or payment or waiver of fees,costs,rents,or other obligations that would normally be required in the execution of the contract.assem.amend.to bill reg.sess.june.
the bill was again amended to move this language to subdivision b so that it would provide for purposes of this section,paid for in whole or in part out of public funds means the payment of money or the equivalent of money by a state or local public agency directly to or on behalf of the public works contractor,subcontractor,or developer,performance of construction work by the state or local public agency in execution of the project,transfer by the state or local public agency in execution of the project,transfer of an asset of value for less than fair market price fees,costs,rents,insurance or bond premiums,loans,interest rates,or other obligations that would normally be required in the execution of the contract,which are paid,reduced,charged at less than fair market value,waived,or forgiven or credits applied against repayment obligations.assem.amend.to bill reg.sess.july.
two days later,the assembly amended the bill for a third time,this time adding as subdivision e the language now found in section,subdivision c.assem.amend.to bill reg.sess.july.the bill was amended for the fourth time by the assembly on july,to specify that paid for in whole or in part out of public funds shall not include tax credits provided pursuant to section or of the revenue and taxation code.assem.amend.to bill reg.sess.july.
senate bill was amended for the fifth,and final time by the assembly on august.this was the version passed by the legislature and signed by governor davis on october.although minor changes were enacted the following year stats,ch,the final version of senate bill is essentially the version of section with which we are concerned.
as statutes go,section is hardly a triumph of the drafter art.
the problem starts with subdivision a,which defines public works as various categories of work done under contract and paid for in whole or in part out of public funds,and subdivision b,which enumerates what is meant by the latter clause.of the two,subdivision b is obviously more important for present purposes.as definitional provisions of a statute in a statutory scheme that has traditionally received a liberal construction as we noted in mcintosh,one would expect these provisions to be prefaced with the familiar wording that the definition includes or,more broadly still,includes but is not limited to,particularly as this was a bill intended to broaden the scope of section.in fact,the first assembly amendment used the broader language,but it was subsequently deleted.instead,in both subdivisions a and b the legislature employed the word means,a term accepted as one of limitation,not enlargement.see sutherland statutes and statutory construction ed,brown scott paper worldwide.and conspicuous by their absence from subdivision b are the words tax credits,an omission only made more glaring by subdivision b,which includes this within the definition of paid for in whole or in part out of public funds credits that are applied by the state or political subdivision against repayment obligations to the state or political subdivision.
however,the legislature was not content to halt with subdivision b.it went on in subdivision c to specify a number of situations that might be paid for in whole or in part out of public funds.the most pertinent of these exclusions is subdivision c,which unambiguously states that paid for in whole or in part out of public funds does not include tax credits provided pursuant to section or of the revenue and taxation code.italics added.
but there is more.subdivision d identifies three types of projects that shall not,solely by reason of this section,be subject to the requirements of the prevailing wage law.italics added.all of the three situations are expressly pegged to projects already commenced on or before december,one of which is precisely the type of that at issue here low income housing projects that are allocated federal or state housing tax credits pursuant to section of the internal revenue code or chapter of division commencing with section of the health and safety code 
it is more than a little confusing to attempt to discern a consistent logic to subdivisions b,c,and d.subdivision b specifies that its enumerated categories are what paid for in whole or in part means.subdivision c is a true hodgepodge it designates two categorical exclusions from the prevailing wage law subds.c c,but the remaining four categories of project may or may not be exempt depending on the circumstances.subdivision d then sets out three types of projects that shall not,solely by reason of this section,be subject to the requirements of the prevailing wage law.italics added.a careful reader is naturally inclined to wonder if subdivision d is simply an extension of subdivision c and whether both serve the same functions,namely,adding and subtracting from the public funds definition of subdivision b.
this is the raw material with which we must grapple to resolve these appeals.that resolution turns on the construction we give to section.that construction is not to be reached by examining bits and pieces of the statute,but after a consideration of all parts of section in order that we may effectuate the legislature intent.coalition of concerned communities,city of los angeles cal th,d,county of riverside superior court cal th,d,alford superior court cal th,d.in the rare case,widening the analytical aperture brings additional difficulties statutory language which seems clear when considered in isolation may in fact be ambiguous or uncertain when considered in context.quarterman kefauver th,d.
such is the case here.we can not look at subdivision b by itself,because subdivisions c and d address the same subject,namely,what is encompassed by subdivision b definition of what constitutes a public work paid for in whole or in part out of public funds.in addition,just what is meant by credits can not yield a single answer because the legislature did not use the word in the same and consistent sense.see people nguyen cal th,d,hoag howard cal.with these provisos,we come at last to the issue of whether lihtcs are within the section definition.
both the director and housing development argue for reversal on the basis of the reasoning in the director coverage decision,and the spirit of our decision in mcintosh.stripped to its essentials,their argument is that giving a tax credit does not amount to paying out public funds.a tax credit has no intrinsic value to the state.it is not sold by the state.it can not be stolen from the state.and in allocating a tax credit,the state parts with nothing of any realizable monetary worth.it thus is not the payment of money or equivalent of money by the state subd.b,nor is it a transfer by the state of an asset of value for less than fair market price subd.b.after careful consideration of the issue,we agree with the director and housing development.
there is nothing in the language of subdivision b which furnishes a basis for concluding that the legislature intended to overthrow the mcintosh ordinary meaning approach to determining what qualifies as paid for in whole or in part out of public funds.indeed,precisely the opposite appears true,that the trigger for application of the prevailing wage law carried over from the version of section quoted at fn,ante is still the payment of public funds.the various provisions of section,subdivision b,demonstrates that the legislature was guided by the mcintosh language that payment meant the delivery of money or its equivalent.mcintosh,supra,th,d.
the statutory emphasis is very much upon the tangibility and form of the payment.the legislature virtually adopted our mcintosh formulation in subdivision b,which defines paid for in whole or in part out of public funds as first and foremost the payment of money or its equivalent.transfer of an asset of value for less than fair market price,and fees,costs,rents or bond premiums,loans,interest rates,or other obligations that would normally be required in the execution of the contract,that are paid,reduced,charged at less than fair market value subds.b,b are obviously in the same vein.so is money loaned when repayment is not guaranteed.subd.b.it is not hard to understand that extending credits that are applied against repayment obligations subd.b is simply money that would otherwise be paid.and there is certainly a cash value if the state actually undertakes performance of construction work in execution of the project.subd.b.
moreover,subdivisions b and b speak to the state or political subdivision parting with a thing possessing current value.within the definition of paid for in whole or in part out of public funds is the payment of money or the equivalent of money by the state or political subdivision specified by subdivision b.subdivision b includes in the same definition the transfer by the state or political subdivision of an asset of value for less than fair market price.it is significant that both of these provisions are couched in the present tense.by contrast,when the legislature meant to refer to an exchange occurring in the future,it used language to reflect that expectation,as in subdivision b,which places within the definition money loaned by the state or political subdivision that is to be repaid on a contingent basis.italics added.
even more significant is subdivision b,which speaks to credits that are applied by the state or political subdivision against repayment obligations to the state or political subdivision.repayment in this context can hardly refer to a private contract where no moneys are advanced by the state that can be thus there is nothing to be repaid.if the legislature had intended that lihtcs be included with subdivision b,one would naturally expect to see something like the language of subdivision d in subdivision b.that absence can not be without meaning.it is a well recognized principle of statutory construction that when the legislature has carefully employed a term in one place and has excluded it in another,it should not be implied where excluded.brown kelly broadcasting cal d,brown accord,smith law group cal th,d,when different terms are used in parts of the same statutory scheme they are presumed to have different meanings.
there is,moreover,an impressive body of authority,much of which was cited by the director in his coverage decision,that excludes tax credits from the category of goods and services that amount to public assets or are treated as the equivalent of money.for example,within the context of california personal income tax system,a credit is treated as something that involves no expenditure of public moneys received or held but merely reduces the taxpayer liability at a future point in time.center for public interest law fair political practices,supra,d.federal tax law is to the same effect it likewise does not recognize receipt of a tax credit as a taxable event,on the theory that the taxpayer has received no money or other income within the meaning of the internal revenue code.randall loftsgaarden,d randall.the credits have no value in themselves,only the contingent benefit to reduce the taxes otherwise payable.id.at.see also,at.credits have economic value only indirectly to extent they reduce tax liability.
both california and the federal courts have declined to treat tax credits as sufficiently substantial to offset civil damage awards.depalma westland software house d.randall,supra,d.for purposes of california criminal law,a tax credit is not a public money that can be misappropriated.center for public interest law fair political practices,supra,d.see.federal law follows a similar approach unissued tax credits have zero intrinsic value and thus are not property when they in the possession of the allocating state agency.griffin cir,griffin.
it is true that certain references to an lihtc being sold can be found in reported decisions,griffin,supra,maryville properties,nelson.but this is misleading unless substantially qualified.a person or entity can not be allocated a lihtc and immediately sell it on any street corner.the housing project must be completed and made operational before the credit begins to appear of a tax return.thereafter,the project may be sold,but the lihtc is transferred with the property the lihtc can not be sold separately.as the state board of equalization puts it under irc section,low income housing tax credits may only be claimed by owners of qualifying housing that is,the tax credits can not be claimed unless the taxpayer also holds a concomitant equity interest in a housing project.sbe guidelines,supra,fn.see d,f,f,f.
even the most prominent of the authorities using the word sale agrees with this limitation once tax credits have been allocated,they can not be transferred from the property to which they were allocated once the tax credits have been issued on a property,the owner can sell limited partnership interests in the property so that investors can take advantage of the tax credits allocated to that project.griffin,supra,italics added.moreover,the state board is equally explicit that tax credits may be disallowed if the project falls out of compliance with the terms of the developer regulatory agreement with the state.sbe guidelines,supra,see,tit,subd.a.this is hardly the unqualified finality one would ordinarily associate with a sale.
courts across the country have,in the main,adopted this view of the lihtcs existence and alienability,brandon bay payette county idaho,the tax credits do not exist separate from an ownership right in the housing pine pointe housing lowndes county,if a property eligible for section tax credits is sold,then the subsequent owner is entitled to the future tax credits associated with the property rainbow apartments property tax app,supra,d,the benefit of a tax credit is entirely incidental to ownership.more than twenty years ago the united states supreme court characterized as obvious the logic underlying the connection between ownership and the right to claim a tax credit.randall,supra,d.
following that approach,illinois courts have held that tax credits,as randall instructs us,have no independent value in and of themselves instead,they are an incidental benefit that investors receive when they purchase their interest in a limited partnership.the investors can not transfer or sell the tax credits separate from the partnership interest itself.the limited partnership did not sell the tax credits to the investors the tax credits remain exactly where they resided before in the limited partnership.chicago michigan beach housing.dist d,accord,rainbow apartments prop.tax app,supra,d.we agree entirely.the arguments to the contrary are not persuasive.
trades council argues that state lihtcs are the equivalent of money within the meaning of subdivision b because they have an immediate and ascertainable cash value on a syndication market as shown by the fact the state is aware that lihtcs will immediately be converted to cash to pay for construction of the project.this may be so,but it is irrelevant.the fact that lihtcs may indeed be marketable by others,after they have been allocated by the state,does not establish that they have a realizable monetary worth to the state before they are allocated.see griffin,supra,the only property interest the state has in the tax credits is purely abstract or theoretical,even after the project is completed.moreover,as previously established,it is actually interests in the property that are sold the tax credits are merely an incidental feature of purchasing ownership.chicago michigan beach housing,supra,d,rainbow apartments property tax app,supra,d.
in arguing that lihtcs amount to an asset of value for purposes of subdivision b,trades council notes that california tax law was very recently amended to exclude the value of lihtcs from the assessed value of real property.stats,ch.ab.if tax credits had no value as a matter of law,this recent tax statute would have been unnecessary.not at all.the question had divided the courts of the nation see huron ridge ypsilanti twp,and decisions cited,so it would be eminently logical for the legislature to provide a clear answer and resolve any uncertainty.further,and as just noted,the fact that lihtcs may acquire value in the hands of a subsequent holder does not establish that they had value before they were allocated by the state.in sum,we do not conclude that lihtcs have no value as a matter of law for all that their allocation by the state is not a transfer of an asset of value for less than fair market value.
trades council reasons that lihtcs entitle the holder to a offset of unrelated tax liabilities.to persons or entitles with tax liabilities,who would otherwise be required to pay that money to the state,the tax credit is an asset of value for which they are willing to pay.true enough,but the operative point is that the purchase price is not paid to the state.the value for which buyers pay accrues when the lihtcs come within the disposition of the developer for the project,not the state.it is from the developer,not the state,that persons or entities with tax liabilities purchase an ownership interest in the underlying project.the buyer realizes the value of the tax credit only project is completed in a timely fashion,becomes operational,and remains so for a number of years see health,subd.f,subd.c c,subd.c c,subd.c c,tit,subd.a griffin,supra.
trades council argues that the lihtcs were allocated to the developer for no consideration,and were thus transferred for less than their fair market price.we are not persuaded.while we do not disagree with the trial court conclusion that lihtcs are obviously an asset of value in some sense,the issue here is whether lihtcs qualify as an asset of value to the state when they were allocated by ctcac,acting for the state.we hold they do not.the value of the lihtcs is at that point merely latent.their potential for economic worth is not realized until after the project has been completed and they can be used to neutralize certain tax liabilities.thus,the factual nexus between the allocation of the lihtcs and the anticipated construction or alteration is at that moment in time only contingent,indirect,and incidental.randall,supra,d chicago michigan beach housing,supra,d.
the situation is more akin to the loss of rent faced by the county in mcintosh.concerning this forbearance of rent,we noted that the county right to charge rent is not an available pecuniary resource like cash or some readily asset.mcintosh,supra,th,d.all we have to do is substitute collect taxes for charge rent and the reasoning is just as valid.
trades council and the state treasurer as amicus labor mightily,and creatively,to convince us that an lihtc qualifies as the equivalent of money within the meaning of subdivision b or an asset of value within the meaning of subdivision b.and they are persuasive that tax credits are an important mechanism for achieving objectives the legislature deems in the public interest.but their undoubted importance and utility is not at issue here.tax credits operate to reduce future tax liability,and can not be used until the project is built and operating,subd.f,tit,subd.a.further,any worth the credits may have is obviously predicated on the taxpayer having tax liabilities to offset.in other words,the worth of lihtcs is,at the time they are allocated by the ctcac,speculative and contingent upon future conditions 
the united states supreme court has held that the mere receipt of a tax credit confers no economic benefit because the credits have no value in themselves.randall,supra,d.we simply hold the in this context lihtcs when allocated to a proposed project likewise entail no actual diminution of the state economic resources.it bears emphasis that the operative event here is the allocation of lihtcs to a project not yet completed.there is nothing in our record which shows allocation is anything more than a promise or an administrative assignment,the mere movement of figures from one column to another.nothing tangible,such as certificates evidencing ownership of a property interest in the project,is transferred or delivered to the developer.any movement of lihtcs is purely abstract,a matter at best of bureaucratic bookkeeping.lihtcs are not property.allocated lihtcs represent only the possibility of future benefit that may be realized after construction or rehabilitation of the proposed project.see randall,supra,d griffin,supra.we therefore hold that they do not amount to either the payment of money or the equivalent of money within the scope of subdivision b or the transfer of an asset of value for less than fair market value within the scope of subdivision b 
in the course of their diligent examination of section,the parties and amici comment upon a number of flaws,inconsistencies,and peculiarities in the statute.so have we.
as previously noted,the first proposed amendment to section used the broadly inclusive approach of includes but is not limited to when framing the definition of paid for in whole or in part out of public funds,but the final version employed the far more restrictive means.this precludes us from reading subdivision b as reaching subjects not specified within it,or otherwise brought within subdivision b by provisions of section.this conclusion follows from a principle of statutory construction best enunciated by division one of this district the rejection by the legislature of a specific provision contained in an act as originally introduced is most persuasive to the conclusion that the act should not be construed to include the omitted provision.rich state board of optometry d.see arden carmichael,county of sacramento th,d every word excluded from a statute must be presumed to have been excluded for a purpose.the director asks us to reach the same result through application of the familiar rule of construction that where a statute enumerates things upon which it is to operate it is to be construed as excluding from its effect all those not expressly mentioned.capistrano union high school dist.capistrano beach acreage d.we understand the logic of this argument,but we need not formally invoke it here because there are other prudential considerations that persuade us the language of section in its current form can not be construed to reach lihtcs.
housing development points out a number of specific statutes apart from section where the legislature has expressly directed designated public works to comply with the prevailing wage law the implication is that by not ordering compliance with the prevailing wage law in the statutes establishing the lihtc program,the legislature has decided not to require that compliance.we do not think it unduly significant that the lihtc program does not have a similar directive in its enabling statutes,because such an approach would strip section of much of any independent utility,and threaten it with desuetude,if not extinction.on the other hand,the tenor of the argument is correct in drawing our attention to the undoubted ability of the legislature to resolve any statutory doubt or ambiguity when it is so minded.and,we note,it is significant that section has no such expression,an omission even more striking because of the express reference to the lihtc program in subdivision d.we are not authorized to rewrite section to conform to an assumed intent the legislature did not express.stop youth addiction,lucky stores,cal th,d,in re hoddinott cal th,d.
trades council also insists that the legislature significantly revised section in in large part to overturn the mcintosh court narrow construction of the word pay.under the current version of b,the word pay has a broad meaning that reflects economic reality,not the narrow meaning used in mcintosh.this is true,but only up to a point.the legislature clearly intended to broaden the scope of section from the way it read at the time mcintosh was decided see fn,ante,but the revision was not as significant as trades council imagines.
trades council points to subdivision c,where the legislature categorically excluded one type of tax credit as demonstrating that there is no comparable exclusion for lihtcs.and,so it argues,if tax credits were not subsumed within the basic b definition,this exemption would have been wholly unnecessary.hence,the adoption of this tax credit exemption at the same time that the coverage definition was expanded shows the legislature intended the coverage definition to encompass lihtcs.this may be valid as a point of abstract logic,but it collides with other parts of section.
for one thing,if subdivision c was meant to fulfill the function trades council assigns it,what is the intent behind subdivision d,which might be read as putting lihtcs partly outside subdivision b we say partly because of the dateline established in subdivision d,a matter to which we will return.if,as trades council argues,the effect of subdivision c brings lihtcs within the ambit of subdivision b,and if the legislature truly meant to include lihtcs within the definition of paid for in whole or in part out of public funds,why did it simply not say in a manner that would remove any doubt,by using the precise language it did in subdivision d 
but,as already noted in part iii,both subdivisions b and b speak to the state or political subdivision parting with a thing possessing current value.subdivision b,the payment of money or the equivalent of money by the state or political subdivision,and subdivision b,transfer by the state or political subdivision of an asset of value for less than fair market price,are couched in the present tense,and therefore would not ordinarily be thought to govern a future exchange or transfer.by contrast,such an intent can be seen in subdivision b,where the legislature placed within the definition money loaned by the state or political subdivision that is to be repaid on a contingent basis.italics added.as also noted,subdivision b speaks to credits that are applied by the state or political subdivision against repayment obligations to the state or political subdivision.and repayment in this context can hardly refer to a private contract where no moneys are advanced by the state,and thus nothing to be repaid.if the legislature had intended that lihtcs be included with subdivision b,one would naturally expect to see something like the language of subdivision d in subdivision b.that absence can not be without meaning.
it may be true,as the treasurer points out,that by granting lihtcs the state accepts it will forego tax revenues which would otherwise be owed to the state.if the logic of this point is conceded,one would expect to see the point addressed in subdivision b which was obviously intended to abrogate part of our decision in which brings within the definition of paid for in whole or in part out of public funds the following items of compensation that may be foregone fees,costs,rents,insurance or bond premiums,loans,interest rates,or other obligations that would normally be required in the execution of the contract,that are paid,reduced,charged at less than market value,waived,or forgiven by the state or political subdivision.
it could be argued,as is done here,that the prevailing wage act is in fact a disincentive to expanding the supply of housing,and that,aware of this,the legislature intended subdivisions c,c,and d to remove that disincentive.logically,however,one might expect the exemption to be categorical.subdivision c has that degree of certainty,and subdivision c only slightly less.based on this,the director argues that it would have been anomalous for the legislature to have granted immunity for some types of housing projects,but not for ones using lihtcs.while it is not beyond the realm of possibility,or power,that the legislature could adopt differing approaches to a matter as large and important as housing,we would not adopt that conclusion without trepidation.if there is a logical line of division,we can not discern it.the matter is further complicated by the peculiar nature of subdivision d.
mention has already been made of the unusual language in subdivision d.it directs that residential rental projects,residential projects,and housing projects financed with bonds,mortgage certificates,or lihtcs in accordance with specified federal and state statutes on or before december,shall not,solely by reason of section,be subject to the prevailing wage law.this,trades council argues,shows a legislative compromise not to apply the prevailing wage law to projects that had already started or were imminently to be started so as not to jeopardize projects already financed on the assumption that prevailing wages would not have to be paid.while this is,as the trial court noted,a plausible explanation there are difficulties with it.
for one thing,if projects commenced before december,are to be treated as exempt from the prevailing wage law solely because lihtcs have been allocated,it might logically follow that a different rule was intended for projects commenced after that date more specifically,does it mean that projects begun after january,do not enjoy a like exemption such a clear chronological delineation naturally suggests a distinction of some sort,and what is a more logical distinction than a not dichotomy 
this is how trades council views the matter,noting that it would be strange for the legislature to focus on exempting projects for a limited time if lihtcs themselves did not trigger prevailing wage coverage.the director responds that the effect of the expiration of the sunset date is not that lihtcs became payment out of public funds,but rather that after that date,each source of funding for a project has to be examined against the definition in section b.in other words,a project allocated lihtcs after december,may be subject to prevailing wage requirements if it receives other forms of financial assistance that are enumerated by section b.
neither of these arguments is completely satisfying.the problem with the director position is that it simply begs the question of whether,after january,lihtcs are covered by the definitional provisions of subdivision b,which is where we came in.it begs the additional question of why,if this was its intent,the legislature did not simply use language comparable to the permanent exclusion it established for a different tax credit program in subdivision c here again,the difficulty with acceding to the arguments of housing development and the director is that the very precision used for subdivision c cautions against implying that level of precision with respect to lihtcs.see brown,supra,cal d.as one court of appeal noted in a different statutory context,the legislature knows how to speak the language and they used it.people palomar d.but not in subdivision b.
the difficulty with the way in which trades council reads subdivision d is simply one of proportionality.to accept it,we must accept that the fact that the legislature in effect made subdivision d an oblique way of introducing lihtcs allocated after january,into the general definition of paid for in whole or in part out of public funds.we would need much stronger proof that the legislature played such a game.
courts do not lightly conclude that substantial statutory changes are intended or accomplished by legislative misdirection.at the federal level,the united states supreme court has observed that congress does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary does not,one might say,hide elephants in mouseholes.whitman american trucking assns,d see fda brown williamson tobacco,d w e are confident that congress could not have intended to delegate a decision of such economic and political significance in so cryptic a fashion.gonzales oregon,d.california courts have adopted a similar skepticism.garcia mccutchen cal th,d,in re christian cal th,d,ailanto properties,city of half moon bay th,d pleasant hill bayshore disposal,recycling,th,fn,d.thus,we can not view subdivision d as a shoehorn for inserting lihtcs into subdivision b.
the preceding discussion has shown that existing law prior to the amendments to section did not treat tax credits as tangible property akin to expenditure of public funds.that consensus has only increased since then.we do not believe that the legislature insertion of the generic term credits into subdivision b meant to diverge from this agreement this conclusion is only fortified by consulting subdivision c,where the legislature made explicit reference to a specific type of tax credit,and subdivision d,where it made a highly opaque reference to the lihtc program.we can not treat all of these differing references as synonyms.people nguyen,supra,cal th,d,brown,supra,cal d.if there are blanks or gaps in section,it is not for us to fill them.stop youth addiction,lucky stores,supra,cal th,d,in re hoddinott,supra,cal th,d.
conclusion and disposition 
california courts accept that tax credits are,for all practical intents,a matter of legislative grace,which the legislature may grant or deny in any manner it sees fit,and the scope,application,and terms of eligibility are entirely for the legislature to establish.general motors franchise tax bd.cal th,d.the legislature has decided to join with the federal government to enlarge the stock of housing by using lihtcs as an inducement for private parties to help achieve what is deemed in the public good.but did the legislature when it amended section intend that lihtcs were to be used as one of the instruments for expanding the ambit of the prevailing wage law 
there are weighty arguments and worthy goals arrayed on each side.trades council and the treasurer,citing the rule of liberal construction traditionally afforded the prevailing wage law city of long beach,supra,cal th,d,mcintosh,supra,th,d,see the issue as the threatened frustration of the clear statutory mandate to apply the prevailing wage law to a category of residential construction that would not exist but for the gift of lihtcs.the director,housing development,the building industry association,and the redevelopment association are eloquent in describing what they perceive will be the adverse impact of extending the prevailing wage law to future projects,thereby reducing the willingness of developers to expand the stock of housing.these are issues of high public policy.to choose between them,or to strike a balance between them,is the essential function of the legislature,not a court.our role is confined to ascertaining what the legislature has actually done,not assaying whether sound policy might support a different rule.general motors franchise tax,supra,cal th,d.
the rule of liberal construction is subject to an important proviso courts will liberally construe prevailing wage statutes citations,but they can not interfere where the legislature has demonstrated the ability to make its intent clear and chosen not to act citation.city of long beach,supra,cal th,d,quoting mcintosh,supra,th,d accord,peralta community college dist.fair employment housing com.cal d.ultimately,this is how we deal with section.subdivision c demonstrates that the legislature knew how to craft a categorical exemption for a project connected to a statutory tax credit.subdivision d demonstrates that the legislature knew about,and knew how to address,the lihtc programs at issue here.the fact that it did not do so tips the scales.
the purported appeals from the writ of mandate are dismissed.the order granting the petition for a writ of mandate is reversed,and the cause is remanded to the trial court with directions to recall the writ of mandate set aside the order granting the petition and enter a new order denying the petition.appellants shall recover their costs on appeal.
