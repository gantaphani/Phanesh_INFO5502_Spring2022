amended opinion 
the in this action,michael and marla sklar,challenge the internal revenue service irs disallowance of their deductions,as charitable contributions,of part of the tuition payments made to their children religious schools.in the notice of deficiency sent to the sklars,the irs explained that s ince these costs are personal tuition expenses,they are not deductible.specifically,the sklars sought to deduct of the tuition,on the basis that this represented the proportion of the school day allocated to religious education.the sklars contend that these costs are deductible under section of the internal revenue code,as payments for which they have received solely intangible religious benefits.they also argue that they should receive this deduction because the irs permits similar deductions to the church of scientology,and it is a violation of administrative consistency and of the establishment clause to deny them,as orthodox jews,the same deduction.the tax court found that under de jong commissioner,cir,tuition paid for the education of a taxpayer children is a personal expense which is under.the tax court also rejected the administrative inconsistency argument and the establishment clause claim,and ruled inadmissible several documents supporting the sklars contentions with respect to the church of scientology on the ground that the sklars are not similarly situated to the members of the church of scientology.the sklars filed this timely appeal.
we review the tax court conclusions of law and its construction of the tax code de novo,and no deference is owed that court on its application of the law.schachter commissioner,cir custom chrome,commissioner,cir leslie commissioner,cir.
i.the provisions of the tax code governing charitable contribution deductions do not appear to permit the deduction claimed by the sklars 
the sklars assert that the deduction they claimed is allowable under section of the internal revenue code which permits taxpayers to deduct,as a charitable contribution,a contribution or gift to certain organizations.not only has the supreme court held that,generally,a payment for which one receives consideration does not constitute a contribution or gift for purposes of,see united states american bar endowment,d stressing that t he sine qua non of a charitable contribution is a transfer of money or property without adequate consideration,but it has explicitly rejected the contention made here by the sklars that there is an exception in the code for payments for which one receives only religious benefits in return.hernandez commissioner,d.the taxpayers in hernandez,members of the church of scientology,sought to deduct,as charitable contributions under c,payments made by them to the church of scientology in exchange for the religious exercises of auditing and training.the court affirmed the tax court reading of the statute disallowing the deductions on the following three grounds congress had shown no preference in the internal revenue code for payments made in exchange for religious benefits as opposed to other benefits,at.to permit the deductions the taxpayers demanded would begin a slippery slope of expansion of the charitable contribution deduction beyond what congress intended,at.and to permit these deductions could entangle the irs and the government in the affairs and beliefs of various religious faiths and organizations in violation of the constitutional principle of the separation of church and state,at.specifically,the supreme court stated that to permit these deductions might force the irs to engage in a searching inquiry of whether a particular benefit received was religious or secular in order to determine its deductibility,a process which,the court said,might violate the establishment clause.hernandez,at.
despite the clear statutory holding of hernandez,the sklars contend that recent changes to the internal revenue code have clarified congressional intent with respect to the deductibility of these payments.we seriously doubt the validity of this argument.the amendments to the code appear not to have changed the substantive definition of a deductible charitable contribution,but only to have enacted additional documentation requirements for claimed deductions.omnibus budget reconciliation act of obra,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of.section f of the code adds a new requirement that taxpayers claiming a charitable contribution deduction obtain from the donee an estimate of the value of any goods and services received in return for the donation,and exempts from that new estimate requirement contributions for which solely intangible religious benefits are received f a b ii.similarly,requires that organizations inform that they will receive a tax deduction only for the amount of their donation above the value of any goods or services received in return for the donation and requires donee organizations to give donors an estimate of this value,exempting from this estimate requirement contributions for which solely intangible religious benefits are received.
given the clear holding of hernandez and the absence of any direct evidence of congressional intent to overrule the supreme court on this issue,we would be extremely reluctant to read an additional and significant substantive deduction into the statute based on what are clearly procedural provisions regarding the documentation of tax return information,particularly where the deduction would be of doubtful constitutional validity.hernandez,at.see lemon kurtzman,d holding that a statute is unconstitutional under the establishment clause if it fosters an excessive government entanglement with religion.we need not,however,decide this issue definitively in this case 
ii.the irs policy regarding the church of scientology may not be withheld from public scrutiny and appears to violate the establishment clause further,it appears that the sklars have not made out a claim of administrative inconsistency 
additionally,the sklars claim that the irs engages in a policy of permitting members of the church of scientology to deduct as charitable contributions,payments made for auditing,training,and other qualified religious services,and that the agency refusal to grant similar religious deductions to members of other faiths violates the establishment clause and is administratively inconsistent.they assert that the policy is contained in a closing agreement that the irs signed with the church of scientology in,shortly after the hernandez decision and the changes to of the internal revenue code because the irs erroneously asserted that it is prohibited from disclosing all or any part of the closing agreement,we assume,for purposes of resolving this case,the truthfulness of the sklars allegations regarding the terms of that agreement.however,rather than concluding that the irs policy would require it to adopt similar provisions for all other religions,we would likely conclude,were we to reach the issue,that the policy must be invalidated on the ground that it violates either the internal revenue code or the establishment clause.see hernandez,at.lemon kurtzman,at.
a.the irs refusal to disclose the terms of its closing agreement with the church of scientology 
we are required,for purposes of our analysis,to assume the contents of the irs policy towards the church of scientology,because of the irs refusal to reveal to the sklars,to this court,or even to the department of justice the contents of its closing agreement,although that agreement has apparently been reprinted in the wall street journal.see scientologists and irs settle for million,wall,at agreement reprinted in wall interactive edition.the irs insists that the closing agreement in this case can not be disclosed as it contains return information which the irs is required to keep confidential under.under,the irs is prohibited from disclosing return information,which is defined to include closing agreements.the prohibitions of are subject to,where that provision applies,and mandates public disclosure by each entity of its application for tax exemption which itself contains detailed financial information about the entity,including revenues and expenses as well as all documentation in support of that application.a a.the legislative history of the amendment to which added closing agreements to the definition of return information,makes it clear that 
t he new provision b d is not intended to foreclose the disclosure of organization closing agreements to the extent that such disclosure is authorized under section.since section permits the disclosure of return information as authorized by title,a disclosure authorized by section is permissible,notwithstanding the fact that a closing agreement is return information.
conf,wl at footnote omitted.
in tax analysts irs,the only circuit court case on this issue,the circuit rejected the irs argument,and held that disclosure of closing agreements is not categorically prohibited by,but may be required under.the legislative history of the amendment,in addition to stating that may still require disclosure of organization closing agreements,also specifically cites to tax analysts,stating that the new provision does not overrule its reasoning or its result.the tax analysts court concluded that the irs reading of was directly at odds with the broad language of,the statutory provision requiring public disclosure by each entity of its application for tax exemption as well as all documentation in support of that application.a a in that case,tax analysts sought disclosure of a closing agreement between the irs and the christian broadcasting network cbn,a entity.the irs had audited cbn and examined its eligibility for status after the network allegedly engaged in impermissible political activities.tax analysts argued that because cbn was able to retain its status only after signing the closing agreement,the agreement constituted documentation in support of the exemption application that must be publicly disclosed pursuant to a a.rejecting the irs argument that disclosure of closing agreements is categorically prohibited by,the circuit held that judicial examination of such closing agreements is necessary to determine whether or not they might indeed constitute information in support of an application for tax exemption required to be disclosed under.at.as the court stated with respect to the closing agreements at issue in that case 
precluding disclosure of a closing agreement,without regard to its content or circumstances,merely because it carries that particular label is inconsistent with the statutory inclusion in the disclosure requirements for organizations of any papers submitted and any letter or document issued in connection with an application for tax exemption.particularly in this case,where the evidence suggests that the closing agreement and application for exempt status were part of a single,overall negotiation between the irs and the christian broadcasting network,the irs rigid reliance on the type of documents at issue rather than their content is questionable.
we agree with the circuit.disclosure of closing agreements is not categorically prohibited by,which is subject to in appropriate circumstances,disclosure may be required under or otherwise.similarly,we reject the notion that prohibits the disclosure of the entire closing agreement whenever part of the agreement contains return information.we also conclude that there are several reasons why the closing agreement in the case before us likely is subject to disclosure,at least in substantial part.first,just as in the tax analysts case the settling of the church of scientology tax liability through the closing agreement was required in order for the organization to regain the status it had previously lost.therefore the closing agreement would appear to constitute documentation in support of the exemption application which must be publicly disclosed pursuant to a a.see alison eaton,can the irs overrule the supreme court emory,discussing the fact that,as part of the closing agreement,the main church of scientology regained the status it had lost in the.this is fully consistent with the already extensive disclosure generally required of organizations under in this case,the publication of the church of scientology application for status,which contains detailed financial information about the organization,including its revenues and expenses.a a d irs form.
second,public disclosure of agreements that affect not just one taxpayer or a discrete group of taxpayers,but a broad and indeterminate class of taxpayers with a large and constantly changing membership,is also necessary as a practical matter.in the case of the church of scientology agreement,there are potentially tens,if not hundreds,of thousands of taxpayers who were not parties to the agreement and must be informed of the nature of the tax deductions available to them indeed,the irs,likely in recognition of that fact,has itself already disclosed some of the terms of this agreement,further confirming its adoption of the position that policymaking closing agreements can and must be disclosed.see letter from derome bratvold,chief,adjustments branch,irs,to petitioners michael and marla sklar,er the settlement agreement between the internal revenue service and the church of scientology allows individuals to claim,as charitable contributions,percent of the cast sic of qualified religious services.
third,where a closing agreement sets out a new policy and contains rules of general applicability to a class of taxpayers,disclosure of at least the relevant part of that agreement is required in the interest of public policy.that this is the irs understanding as well is demonstrated by the fact that public disclosure has been a requirement contained in at least two such policymaking closing agreements.the irs required publication of its closing agreement with hermann hospital of houston,texas,a entity,concluded following the hospital disclosure to the irs of certain physician recruitment practices which might have constituted prohibited transactions for a entity.john leggett,physician recruitment and retention by tax exempt hospitals the hermann hospital physician recruitment guidelines,health law,spring.under the closing agreement,the hospital was required to engage only in permissible physician recruitment activities,as detailed extensively in an attached set of guidelines.leggett at.public disclosure of the closing agreement put other hospitals on notice of the irs definition of permissible physician recruitment activities that such was the purpose of requiring publication is clear from the fact that the agreement included provisions that did not apply to hermann hospital,but that might in the future be applicable to other hospitals.leggett at.similarly,publication on the internet was required of the irs closing agreement with the kamehameha schools bishop estate,a educational trust in hawaii.the agreement was concluded after the irs threatened to revoke the trust status because the trustees had engaged in serious financial misconduct and.evelyn brody,a taxing time for the bishop estate what is the role in charity governance,haw.it required that the incumbent trustees be removed,that the estate pay a penalty of nine million dollars,and that future governance of the estate conform to the agreement provisions,including restrictions on who could become trustees and a requirement that the estate make its financial records publicly available.brody at.because the irs had not traditionally intervened to this extent in matters of estate governance,the publication of the closing agreement served to put the members of other trusts on notice that the failure to administer trusts along the lines that the irs required of the bishop estate might lead to loss of status here,there is a strong public interest in the disclosure of the contents of the irs agreement with the church of scientology,especially as the agreement establishes a new policy governing charitable contributions to a particular religious organization which,while the pertinent statute may be unclear,clearly contravenes a prior supreme court holding.
therefore,we reject the argument that the closing agreement made with the church of scientology,or at least the portion establishing rules or policies that are applicable to scientology members generally,is not subject to public disclosure.the irs is simply not free to enter into closing agreements with religious or other organizations governing the deductions that will be available to their members and to keep such provisions secret from the courts,the congress,and the public 
b.the constitutionality of the irs agreement with the church of scientology 
the supreme court has developed a framework for determining whether a statute grants an unconstitutional denominational preference.under that test,articulated in larson valente,d,the first inquiry is whether or not the law facially discriminates amongst religions.the second inquiry,should it be found that the law does so discriminate,is whether or not,applying strict scrutiny,that discrimination is justified by a compelling governmental interest.id.applying this test to the policy of the irs towards the church of scientology,the initial inquiry must be whether the policy facially discriminates amongst religions.clearly it does,as this tax deduction is available only to members of the church of scientology.
the second larson inquiry is whether or not the facially discriminatory policy is justified by a compelling governmental interest.at.although the irs does not concede that it is engaging in a denominational preference,it asserts in its brief that the terms of the settlement agreement can not be used as a basis to find an establishment clause violation because in order to settle a case,both parties are required to make compromises with respect to points on which they believe they are legally correct.this is the only interest that the irs proffers for the alleged policy.although it appears to be true that the irs has engaged in this particular preference in the interest of settling a long and litigious tax dispute with the church of scientology and as compelling as this interest might otherwise be,it does not rise to the level that would pass strict scrutiny.the benefits of settling a controversy with one religious organization can hardly outweigh the costs of engaging in a religious preference.even aside from the constitutional considerations,a contrary rule would create a procedure by which any denomination seeking a denominational preference could bypass congressional and irs rulemaking by engaging in voluminous tax litigation.such a procedure would likely encourage the proliferation of such litigation,not reduce it.larson,at.holding that even assuming arguendo that the government has a compelling governmental interest for a denominational preference,it must show that the rule is closely fitted to further the interest that it assertedly serves.because the facial preference for the church of scientology embodied in the irs policy regarding its members can not be justified by a compelling governmental interest,we would,if required to decide the case on the ground urged by the sklars,first determine that the irs policy constitutes an unconstitutional denominational preference under larson,at.
the sklars contend that because the irs has admitted that it permits members of the church of scientology to deduct their payments for religious instruction in order to avoid violating the first amendment,the irs must permit adherents of other faiths to deduct their payments for religious instruction.to the extent that the sklars claim that the establishment clause requires that we extend the scientology deduction to all religious organizations,they are in error for three reasons first,we would be reluctant ever to presume that congress or any agency of the government would intend that a general religious preference be adopted,by extension or otherwise,as such preferences raise the highly sensitive issue of state sponsorship of religion.in the absence of a clear expression of such intent,we would be unlikely to consider extending a policy favoring one religion where the effect of our action would be to create a policy favoring all.second,the supreme court has previously stated that a policy such as the sklars wish us to create would be of questionable constitutional validity under lemon,because the administration of the policy could require excessive government entanglement with religion.hernandez,at.see lemon,at.third,the policy the sklars seek would appear to violate section.see hernandez,at.to the extent that the sklars are also making an administrative inconsistency claim,we reject that claim on two grounds.first,in order to make an administrative inconsistency claim,a party must show that it is similarly situated to the group being treated differently by the agency.united states kaiser,d frankfurter,concurring the commissioner of the irs can not tax one and not tax another without some rational basis for the difference.and so,it can be an independent ground of decision that the commissioner has been inconsistent.we seriously doubt that the sklars are similarly situated to the persons who benefit from the scientology closing agreement because the religious education of the sklars children does not appear to be similar to the auditing,training or other qualified religious services conducted by the church of scientology.second,even if they were so situated,because the treatment they seek is of questionable statutory and constitutional validity under of the irc,under lemon,and under hernandez,we would not hold that the unlawful policy set forth in the closing agreement must be extended to all religious organizations.in the end,however,we need not decide the establishment clause claim or the administrative inconsistency claim as the sklars have failed to show that their tuition payments constitute a partially deductible dual payment under the tax code.
iii.the sklars tuition payments do not constitute partially deductible dual payments under the tax code 
a dual payment or quid pro quo payment under the tax code is a payment made in part in consideration for goods and services,and in part as a charitable contribution.for example,the purchase,for dollars,of an item worth five dollars at a charity auction would constitute a dual payment five dollars in consideration for goods,and seventy dollars as a charitable contribution.the irs permits a deduction under for the portion of a dual payment that consists of a charitable contribution,but not for the portion for which the taxpayer receives a benefit in return.although the sklars concede that they received a benefit for their tuition payments,in that their children received a secular education,they claim that part of the part attributable to their children religious be regarded as a charitable contribution because they received only an intangible religious benefit in return.leaving aside both the issue,discussed in section i,of whether the tax code does indeed treat payments for which a taxpayer receives an intangible religious benefit as a charitable contribution,as well as any constitutional considerations,we are left with the sklars contention that their tuition payment was a dual one in part in consideration for secular education,and in part as a charitable contribution.the sklars assert that because of their children school day was spent on secular education,and on religious education,they should receive a deduction for of their tuition payments.
on the record before this court,the sklars failed to satisfy the requirements for deducting part of a dual payment under the tax code.the supreme court discussed the deductibility of such payments in united states american bar endowment,d,and held that the taxpayer must establish that the dual payment exceeds the market value of the goods received in return.the facts of that case were as follows the american bar endowment abe,a corporation organized for charitable purposes and associated with the american bar association aba,raised money for its charitable work by providing group insurance policies to its members,all of whom were also members of the aba.abe negotiated premium rates with insurers,collected premiums from its members and passed those premiums on to the insurers.at.because the group policies purchased b
