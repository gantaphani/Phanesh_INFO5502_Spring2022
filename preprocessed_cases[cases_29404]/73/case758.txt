following jury trial,clifford marston was convicted on may,in the district court on nine counts of tax evasion,twelve counts of filing false tax documents,and four counts of assisting in the preparation of false returns or other documents,in order to prove the scienter necessary to convict marston under the three statutes,the government was required to show that he acted willfully in failing to report his own taxable income and the income distributed to his employees.during trial,marston chief argument was that he held a good faith belief that his domestically earned income was not taxable because it did not amount to a source of income under of the internal revenue code.marston contended that authorizes taxes only upon foreign sources of income,not domestic income.the issue at trial was not whether marston correctly interpreted the tax code,but whether he held a genuine belief that his interpretation was correct.he raises five issues on appeal that the government indicted him on a theory of the case that required proof of filing false tax returns,but the documents he filed with the irs did not meet the legal definition of a tax return that the district court erred when it permitted the government to reference the documents as tax returns that the district court erred when it allowed the government to introduce testimony relating to the bad tax conduct of other persons that the district court erred in refusing to admit into evidence a videotape explaining marston beliefs that the district court erred in issuing a willful blindness jury instruction and lastly,that the district court erred by imposing a sentence derived from the use of facts in violation of cunningham california,d,and by treating the advisory sentencing guidelines range as presumptively reasonable.we affirm.
clifford marston,a doctor of podiatry,practiced in springfield,missouri until,when his practice began to decline as big hospitals bought up patient pools in the area.to combat the decline,marston moved to mountain home,arkansas,where he opened a practice under his existing missouri corporation,sunshine foot clinic.sunshine experienced an initial boom period of robust growth before the arrival of a competing doctor slowed the practice development.when the practice failed to grow as marston expected,he began to experience considerable financial strain,causing marston to accrue approximately in credit card debt in addition to loan debt he incurred by taking salary advances from sunshine.
in january of,marston daughter exposed him to a website,which taught that an individual had no legal duty to pay taxes on domestically earned income.after reviewing the website and conducting his own review of the tax code,marston,according to his testimony at trial,allegedly came to the conviction that congress had not authorized the collection of taxes on domestic income.on december,marston acted upon this alleged belief and filed several amended employer quarterly tax return forms with the,revising to zero all previously reported wages paid by sunshine for the,and tax years,and requesting a refund of taxes previously paid in each corresponding year.marston filed additional forms on february,and march,revising to zero all of the employee wages paid by sunshine for the tax year.the rejected each of marston requests for a refund and described his position as having no legal basis.for the tax year,marston reported to the,on original forms,zero wages for the first two quarters and left blank all wage fields for the later two quarters.for the first quarter of,he again filed a form without any markings in any of the wage fields.
on april,marston and his wife filed a form with the,reporting that he received in total wages.this amount did not reflect any income earned by marston from sunshine,but reflected income received by marston wife that was reported to the government and income received from an investment account and reported by firstar mutual fund services,llc on a form.according to marston disclosure statement,he listed these sources as taxable income despite his conviction that they were not in order to avoid difficulties with the irs.on january,marston reported to the on a form that he had zero income in the tax year.he attached a supplementary disclosure statement,form,justifying his filing by stating that he had received no income from any of the sources listed in f.the replied to marston in a letter dated april,classifying his form as frivolous,describing his position as having no basis in law,and encouraging him to seek the advice of an attorney.on october,marston sent to the a tax return form for the tax year that listed zero income.
sunshine also supplied two employees,misty davis and loretta jelinek,with federal forms showing zero wages paid for the tax years and.davis and jelinek subsequently filed tax return forms for those years,reporting no wages earned from sunshine.davis and jelinek,in consultation with the,would eventually report their wages and pay the taxes owed on those wages,along with amounts due on those wages for contribution to the medicare and social security funds.
at trial,marston argued that he held a good faith belief that domestic sources of income were not taxable.in essence,he argued that the government failed to prove that he acted willfully in making false statements to the,in aiding or assisting jelinek or davis in filing false returns,or in evading the payment of income taxes.the jury convicted him of all counts.subsequently,the district court found that the applicable amount of potential tax loss attributable to marston conduct was.the district court sentenced marston to months imprisonment on each count,to run concurrently.
marston first argument presupposes an incorrect reading of the indictment against him.according to marston,the indictment describes him as having filed false tax returns and aiding and abetting other persons to file false tax returns.marston argues that none of the documents filed with the meet the legal definition of the phrase tax return.
we have given the phrase tax return a narrow and specific meaning when deciding whether a tax protester has violated of the internal revenue code,willful failure to file a tax return.a defendant can be guilty of failure to file a tax return even if he actually files a form with the if that form does not contain sufficient information from which the irs can calculate tax liability.united states grabinski,cir.applying this standard,courts have held that a return that contains only zeroes and no information regarding gross income or deductions claimed or only protest information is not considered a valid tax return,so that a person may be convicted for willfully failing to file a return.id.at stating the irs should not have to accept on faith the taxpayer assertions regarding taxable income or tax liability without knowledge of circumstances regarding,among other things,gross income received or deductions claimed.united states silkman,cir per curiam holding that form containing only constitutional objections to taxation is not a return united states mosel,cir per curium same united states rickman,cir holding that form listing income as zero was not an adequate return united states porth,cir holding that form listing income as zero and containing constitutional objection to the imposition of a tax,was not a return see also united states francisco,cir filing requirements were not satisfied by a return that contained no income information from which tax liability could be calculated.marston argues that the indictment refers to the documents that are the basis of the criminal charges as tax returns,although they do not provide sufficient information to calculate a tax liability,and therefore the government has necessarily failed to prove an essential element alleged.
contrary to marston reading of it,the indictment does not allege,as elements of the crimes,that he filed tax returns as they are legally defined for purposes.the indictment alleges that he filed a form an individual income tax return,an employer quarterly federal tax return,form,and advised his employees to file an individual income tax return form with the,containing false information reporting,in most instances,zero wages.by referring to the forms using their full descriptive titles,including the moniker form,the indictment is merely indicating which documents it is relying upon to form the basis of the crimes alleged.because these documents are tax return forms,that is how they were alleged in the indictment.whether those documents contain the necessary information to be tax returns,adequate to satisfy,is irrelevant because none of the relevant statutes are limited to tax returns.see attempt to evade a tax may be committed in any manner willfully making false statements in any return,statement,or other document under penalty of perjury is punishable emphasis added willfully aiding in the preparation or presentation of false returns,affidavits,claims or other documents is unlawful.the critical allegation in each count of the indictment is that marston filed,or assisted in filing,documents which the filer intended to be a tax return,which falsely stated the amount of income earned by marston or his employees.consequently,we hold that the language of the indictment does not require that the government prove these documents were tax returns.
in the alternative,marston argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by referring to the documents as tax returns during trial and that the district court committed error in allowing the prosecutor to do so.we review this argument for plain error because marston did not timely object to the prosecutor conduct.united states white,cir.in order to succeed under plain error review,marston must show that the district court committed a legal error that was obvious and affected his substantial rights.id.furthermore,our authority to correct a forfeited error is discretionary,and we will not exercise that discretion unless the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the defendant bears the burden of proving plain error.
marston argument fails.both he and his attorney referred to the documents as tax returns.even if we were to find that the reference to the documents as tax returns was error,we can not see how the fairness,integrity or reputation of the judicial proceedings are in any way diminished if we refused to notice an alleged error that the defendant and his counsel embraced at trial.
according to his testimony,marston formed the opinion that his income was from several sources,including the statements of thurston bell and larkin rose,individuals who once maintained separate internet websites advancing the defense,an argument that contends section of the internal revenue code permits taxation of only income derived from foreign sources.over marston objection the government was permitted to ask marston if he knew that rose had been convicted of willful failure to file a tax return and that bell had been enjoined from operating his website.marston admitted that he had learned these facts,but only after he had sent to the the documents referenced in the indictment.the government purpose for eliciting the evidence was to show that marston did not have a good faith belief that his domestically earned income from sunshine was nontaxable.on appeal,marston argues that his knowledge of the injunction and conviction was irrelevant because that knowledge was gained after the alleged acts for which his beliefs serve as a defense to the element of willfulness.we review the district court admission of the evidence for an abuse of discretion.see united states roenigk,cir.
although the acts of the offense occurred before marston learned of the indictment and injunction,he admitted that he continued to rely upon bell and rose as a basis for his beliefs long afterwards,even at trial.the fact that marston continued to espouse a belief that his income was not taxable,even though he knew its proponent had been convicted of tax evasion,reflects negatively on his credibility.because his defense at trial rested largely upon his own testimony that his beliefs were genuine,circumstantial evidence with regard to his credibility was relevant.cheek united states,d stating that while a good faith belief does not have to be reasonable,the more unreasonable the asserted beliefs or misunderstandings are,the more likely the jury will consider them to be nothing more than simple disagreement with known legal duties imposed by the tax laws and will find that the government has carried its burden of proving knowledge united states collorafi,cir p roof that a defendant continued a tax practice that already had been held unlawful by a federal judge is strong circumstantial evidence of wrongful intent.therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence.
next,marston argues that the district court erred in refusing to admit into evidence a video tape of larkin rose describing his teachings.marston admitted,during an in camera hearing regarding admission of the video,that the tape did not exist until.the alleged acts occurred between and,well before the video tape was created.before testimony began,the district court ruled that the tape would not be admitted because it was irrelevant to marston belief at the time of the allegedly illegal acts.later,during the government of marston,an issue was made of marston continued beliefs.marston did not renew his request to reintroduce the video tape.at the time the district court ruled the tape was irrelevant and marston waived his argument that it later became relevant by failing to renew the request.the district court evidentiary ruling was not an abuse of discretion.
marston also argues that he was prejudiced by inflammatory remarks made by the prosecutor during closing arguments.having conducted a review of the closing arguments,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the allegedly inflammatory remarks.
marston argument that the district court erred in giving the jury a willful ignorance instruction is foreclosed by circuit precedent,united states dykstra,cir holding that instruction on deliberate ignorance was proper where defendant was charged with filing false tax documents united states bussey,cir,that we are without the power to overrule.united states hessman,cir only the court en banc may overrule circuit precedent,cert.denied,d,wl.
marston argues that the district court erred by interpreting the law to require that it impose a reasonable sentence and by presuming reasonable a sentence within the advisory guidelines range.since the time of marston sentencing,the supreme court has issued three important decisions clarifying our review of a district court sentencing decisions.see rita united states,d gall united states,d kimbrough united states,d.pursuant to gall,we are directed to engage in a systematic sentencing review.see united states washington,cir,united states bolds,cir.first,we consider whether the district court committed a significant procedural error in reaching its sentence,such as failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range,treating the guidelines as mandatory,failing to consider the a factors,selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,or failing to adequately explain the chosen an explanation for any deviation from the guidelines range.gall.at.such errors are necessarily an abuse of discretion by the district court.see id.assuming that there was no significant procedural error,we engage in a deferential review of the sentence imposed for substantive reasonableness.id.marston argument focuses on how the district court reached its sentence,not whether the district court reached a reasonable sentence,and therefore it calls for us to engage in procedural review.
we apply the plain error standard to our review because marston did not object at sentencing that the district court interpretation of the law was incorrect see united states pirani,cir en banc.plain error review is governed by a test there must be error,it must be plain,and it must affect substantial rights only if all three conditions are met may an appellate
