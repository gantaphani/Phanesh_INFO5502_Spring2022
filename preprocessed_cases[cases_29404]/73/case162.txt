sarmiento and montoya have been married since before and live with their minor child.compl.both sarmiento and montoya work as independent contractors sarmiento as a taxi driver and montoya as a cleaner of commercial office space and were for many years unaware of their obligation to make estimated medicare and social security tax payments on their income.accordingly,by,sarmiento and montoya jointly owed the united states more than in unpaid tax liabilities pertaining to the,and tax years.
the internal revenue code authorizes the government to compromise any civil case arising under the internal revenue laws.a.accordingly,a taxpayer with outstanding tax liabilities may offer to settle and discharge those liabilities by paying part of what she owes to the irs.see id.c f establishing the process by which a taxpayer may offer to compromise her outstanding tax liabilities,as well as the standards by which the irs evaluates such offers.the irs provides a standard form form with which a taxpayer may make an offer in compromise to the irs.see compl.form includes a number of conditions that the taxpayer must certify that she has read,understands,and agrees to.see.among these conditions is the taxpayer agreement that 
as additional consideration beyond the amount of offer,the irs will keep any refund,including interest,due to because of overpayment of any tax or other liability,for tax periods extending through the calendar year in which the irs accepts the offer.

on november,sarmiento and montoya entered into separate oic agreements with the irs wherein they agreed to pay a total of each to compromise their approximately in outstanding tax liabilities.the letters from the irs accepting plaintiffs offers each reiterated that the conditions of the offer include the provision that as additional consideration for the offer,we will retain any refunds or credits that you may be entitled to receive for or for earlier tax years,including refunds you receive in for any overpayments you made toward tax year or toward earlier tax years.sarmiento and montoya both completed their payments to the irs in.id.at.
meanwhile,on february,congress enacted the economic stimulus act of,section of which granted recovery rebates for individuals in the form of tax credits.see.codified at.specifically,subsections a and b of esa grants eligible individuals a tax credit for the tax year in an amount equal to the lesser of net income tax liability,or,with a minimum rebate of.a b.further,in order to distribute this tax credit as soon as possible,subsection g of esa allows taxpayers to receive an advance refund of their tax credit.id.g.subsection g,entitled advance refunds and credits,states 
in general.each individual who was an eligible individual for such individual first taxable year beginning in shall be treated as having made a payment against the tax imposed for such first taxable year in an amount equal to the advance refund amount for such taxable year.
advance refund amount.for purposes of paragraph,the advance refund amount is the amount that would have been allowed as a credit under this section for such first taxable year if this section other than subsection f and this subsection had applied to such taxable year.
id.to the extent a taxpayer is eligible for an advance refund pursuant to subsection g,subsection f provides that the otherwise applicable tax credit shall be reduced but not below zero by that amount.id.f.to facilitate the rapid distribution of the stimulus payments,subsection g directs that any refund or credit should be made as rapidly as possible and that no refund or credit will be made after december.id.g.
in early,sarmiento and montoya filed a joint tax return for the tax year by means of an irs standard form,in which they reported no income tax liability and payroll taxes of.in addition,they claimed two refundable credits an eitc of and an actc of.accordingly,sarmiento and montoya requested a tax year refund of the difference between the sum of their eitc and actc credits and their reported tax liability.in addition,because they each had qualifying income over and a dependent qualifying child,sarmiento and montoya jointly claimed a tax refund under the esa.see b.the irs concluded,however,that the in tax refunds that plaintiffs requested constitute additional consideration under the terms of plaintiffs oic agreements with the irs,and therefore withheld payment of those funds 
on june,sarmiento and montoya filed an administrative claim with the irs under seeking to recover the withheld tax refunds.the irs denied plaintiffs claim by letter dated september.on march,sarmiento and montoya,with the assistance of the benjamin cardozo school of law tax clinic,filed suit in the district court to recover the withheld tax refunds,plus interest and costs.

the principal issue on appeal is whether specialized tax terms used in an oic agreement take their meaning from the internal revenue code or are afforded their ordinary plain english meaning.as is relevant here,the terms refund and overpayment are terms of art in the tax context,with meanings under the code that differ considerably from their ordinary dictionary meaning.specifically,under the code,the irs is authorized to credit any overpayment that a taxpayer makes on her federal taxes against that taxpayer liabilities,and refund any balance to the taxpayer.a.both the eitc and actc are classified in the code as refundable credits.d,b.however,taxpayers who are eligible for tax refunds based on eitc and actc tax credits do not actually overpay their income taxes,at least in the traditional sense of the word.instead,the eitc and actc refundable tax credit programs are structured to create the legal fiction that recipients make overpayments on their taxes,thereby entitling them to the resulting tax refunds,as a mechanism for achieving certain social policy goals.see sorenson sec y of treasury,the credit was enacted to reduce the disincentive to work caused by the imposition of social security taxes on earned income,to stimulate the economy,and to provide relief for families.to achieve these ends by means of the tax system,the code states that if a taxpayer is owed more in refundable credits than her tax liability after first reducing that liability by other credits,the amount in excess shall be considered an overpayment and the taxpayer is eligible for a refund in an amount corresponding to that constructive overpayment.b emphasis added.similarly,in order t o provide economic stimulus through recovery rebates to individuals,the esa credits eligible taxpayers with a constructive overpayment of their taxes,and deems the stimulus credit to be a refund of this constructive overpayment.see g.
as plaintiffs acknowledge,the tax credits at issue in this action are rightly considered overpayments under the code.see see also sorenson,at holding that eitc payments may be intercepted by the secretary of treasury under c,which authorizes the secretary to intercept overpayments of taxes from taxpayers who fail to meet their child support obligations accord israel united states,cir i f the eitc were not an overpayment,it would not be refundable.plaintiffs argue,however,that terms used in oic agreements should be afforded their plain english meaning rather than their meaning under the code,because the agreements are drafted in colloquial english and h ad the irs desired to give special meanings to any terms it placed into the oics,it was the irs duty to do so unequivocally.pls.br.at.as none of the tax credits at issue in this action result from an actual overpayment by plaintiffs to the irs that the irs is refunding,adopting a plain english reading of the oic agreements would mean that those credits do not constitute refund s due because of overpayment under the terms of the additional consideration provision.see rucker sec y of treasury,cir a refund of federal taxes is a repayment of money paid by the taxpayer in excess of the taxpayer liability.although the earned income credit is given effect through the income tax return,the credit is not a tax refund because eligibility for the credit is not contingent upon payment of any federal income tax,abrogated by sorenson.
it is true that a n oic is a contract between a taxpayer and the irs and so oic agreements are interpreted,under federal common law,using t raditional rules of contract law.begner united states,cir see also robinette comm r,cir united states lane,cir it has long been settled that an agreement compromising unpaid taxes is a contract and,consequently,that it is governed by the rules applicable to contracts generally.but contractual language must be considered from the viewpoint of one cognizant of the customs,practices,usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business,kerin postal,cir internal quotation marks omitted,and this includes contracts with the united states regarding a party federal tax obligations.see united states standard rice,see also williston on contracts ed.c ontractual language must be interpreted in light of existing law,the provisions of which are regarded as implied terms of the contract,regardless of whether the agreement refers to the governing law.footnote omitted.
any reasonable contracting party would understand the irs standardized form,which plaintiffs used to make their offer in compromise to the irs,as a specialized tax document whose terms and conditions take their meaning from the internal revenue code.as an initial matter,form makes numerous express references to the code,for example to c,which outlines the payments that are required under an oic agreement.see.similarly,form statement that the irs ask s for the information on this form to carry out the internal revenue laws of the united states,id.at,makes clear to the taxpayer that the oic process is a product of,and therefore ultimately governed by,the code.see authorizing the irs to compromise any civil or criminal case arising under the internal revenue laws setting standards by which the irs determines whether to accept an oic and providing the taxpayer with administrative review and appeal of an irs decision not to accept an oic.a reasonable taxpayer understands that when she enters into a contract with the irs to compromise her outstanding tax liabilities in exchange for,in part,foregoing her interest in any refund due to me because of overpayment for the current tax year,she does so against the backdrop of the definitions given to those terms in the code.
further,while the irs has intentionally sought to draft form in a colloquial manner,this is true of many irs documents that are intended for the use of ordinary taxpayers while also using specialized tax terms whose meaning is indisputably taken from the code.for example,the familiar irs standard form,which the plaintiffs used to file their tax returns for the tax year,generally adopts colloquial language while still describing refundable credits such as the eitc and actc as p ayments that create a fictional amount that a taxpayer overpaid and can therefore have refunded to her.accordingly,a reasonable taxpayer using form to file her taxes would understand the credits at issue in this action as creating constructive overpayments resulting in fictional refunds when they file their tax retur
