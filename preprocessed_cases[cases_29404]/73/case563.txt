every day can be a new deduction if you structure your life right,defendant daniel gleason promised potential customers of his tax toolbox.gleason aggressive tax strategies attracted the attention of the internal revenue service irs and prompted the district court to enjoin him,pursuant to and,from selling the tax toolbox,a collection of pamphlets,aids,a,and other information,and from providing services to tax toolbox customers.gleason appeals that permanent injunction on two grounds.first,he claims that the materials comprising the tax toolbox were never introduced into evidence at the hearing on the injunction.second,he argues that the bar on providing services to tax toolbox customers unduly restricts his ability to earn a living.because the record reflects more than ample evidence to support the district court findings,including relevant portions and descriptions of the tax toolbox,and because the injunction scope is appropriately tailored and does not unduly burden his livelihood,we affirm.
factual background 
for over fifteen years,gleason has provided tax preparation and representation services individually and through tax toolbox,and my tax man.in,gleason,the president and ceo of my tax man,created the tax toolbox that,in the charitable words of the district court,aggressively promoted tax saving through businesses.
in no more than a couple of minutes a day,gleason materials asserted,you transform your personal expenses into legal and business deductions by following his tax strategies.a new business can magically erase taxes by purportedly creating deductions for weddings,college,travel,meals,and golf,and cars and medical expenses,kids sic allowances,every day household expenses and much more.
according to gleason,executing the tax toolbox employment agreement between spouses and children eliminates many of life more expensive costs.to deduct medical expenses,a ll it takes is a business that you have,or can start,and a spouse who can become an employee medical expenses that are usually subject to a of income floor limitation are moved over to your business returns and become deductible get a head start on a college or wedding fund by turning a child weekly allowance into a pay check and it a business deduction for you.with the tax toolbox promissory agreement form,the children loan the money back to their parents without money actually changing hands.gleason called his methods and provided a accuracy guarantee that promised to pay any penalties or interest from our mistake,but not the underlying tax resulting from using the tax toolbox.
gleason misrepresentations about tax deductions rival his generous resume embellishments to induce purchases of the tax toolbox.his promotional materials boasted that he was an attorney when he was neither licensed to practice in any state nor a graduate of an accredited law school,that he was an enrolled agent with the irs when that status had lapsed,and that he was an adjunct professor of business law and federal taxation when he could not provide one name of a person to corroborate his claim.the district court found further fabrications from the tax expert 
falsely claiming to be an editor and a reviewer of articles for newsweek 
falsely claiming that all of his tax coaches were cpas and irs enrolled agents 
falsely claiming that he is such a good attorney that the government pays his fees,when he is not an attorney and has been awarded fees in only one case,for the relatively minor sum of 
falsely claiming that he has never lost a case in tax court when gleason admits that he has never even tried a case in tax court 
disingenuously claiming that he has never lost a tax court dispute to date and that he has a success record in tax court when gleason is referring to cases he has conceded and defines loss to mean that he has never had a client receive a decision that they did not agree to 
falsely claiming that over of his audits result in refunds,when this figure includes audits resulting in no changes to the taxpayer return 
falsely claiming that customers would have free form preparation,when in reality the cost to gleason customers varies based on the number of schedules attached to the return 
falsely presenting customer testimonials in promotional materials,including that of,who was not a customer but one of gleason own salespersons,alexander mandossian 
misleading customers by referring them to only certain irs publications,but not irs publication,which expressly warns taxpayers of the potential dangers of business scams,claiming he need not do so on the specious ground that this publication was not relevant to his business customers.

on april,the united states sued gleason individually and tax toolbox,and my tax man,seeking permanent injunctions under.in spite of gleason continuing assertions of the tax toolbox legitimacy,he stopped selling it in late.on february,pursuant to,the district court permanently enjoined him from misrepresenting his eligibility to practice before the irs and his experience or education as an income tax preparer,and from guaranteeing the payment of any tax refund or the allowance of any tax credit.gleason did not appeal that injunction.on june,the district court denied the government motion to enjoin gleason permanently from acting as a federal income tax preparer,stating that gleason primary business and livelihood is tax preparation and a total ban on his livelihood should not be undertaken lightly.the government has withdrawn its appeal of that denial.
on august,the district court issued a permanent injunction under,prohibiting gleason from selling or promoting the tax toolbox and from providing services to tax toolbox customers it is from this injunction that gleason now appeals.
