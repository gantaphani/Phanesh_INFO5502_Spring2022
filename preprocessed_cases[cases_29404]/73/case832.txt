the estate of melvin ballantyne and the executrix,jean ballantyne collectively the estate,appeal a decision from the united states tax court.we affirm.
background 
in,melvin and his brother russell formed an oral partnership called ballantyne brothers partnership bbp,which started out as a farming operation,but which grew into oil and gas exploration in the.when the oil and gas aspect of the partnership began to take off,russell was in charge of the farming operation in north dakota,while melvin was in charge of the oil and gas exploration in the united states and canada.in practice,and by mutual agreement,the brothers withdrew profits from the partnership that were attributable to each of their respective business pursuits and paid the expenses related to each of their respective activities.generally speaking then,melvin kept the oil and gas income and paid those expenses,while russell did the same with the farm income and expenses.however,for tax purposes,melvin and russell each reported fifty percent of bbp total income,gains,losses,deductions,and credits on their individual federal tax returns.for example,the farming operation kept only the income that it generated however,by virtue of the arrangement to pay of bbp taxes each year,in years where the oil business was more profitable,the farming business,in effect,paid some of the oil business vice versa for years when the oil business was less profitable.many of the assets used by bbp were not held in the partnership name,but were owned by the brothers jointly or individually.to further complicate matters,bbp did not maintain a balance sheet,ledger,sale or purchase journals,or individual capital accounts for the partners.
for taxable years through which encompasses the records which were before the tax court,bbp filed form tax returns,and the returns for these years reflected that the brothers each held a interest in the partnership profits.for the taxable year,bbp gross income from farming totaled,which was attributable to grain sales by bbp.the proper distribution of these grain sales are at the heart of the dispute in this case.on the schedule f profit or loss from farming form attached to the form,bbp reported depreciation and other farming expenses of,resulting in net farm income of.bbp reported additional income in of from oil revenues,resulting in a total taxable income of.
after melvin was diagnosed with cancer in late,melvin and russell divided some of the partnership assets between the families.when melvin died in march after a short battle with pancreatic cancer,the partnership automatically dissolved and family relations also took a turn for the worse.in april,jean,individually and in her capacity as executrix,filed suit against russell and others.the dispute centered around the estate view that russell embezzled the income from the farming operations.it appears that this was the first that melvin family knew of the partnership arrangement to split the tax burden evenly,but split the profit according to each partner respective business responsibilities.in fact,on its form,the estate reported a loss of.in other documents submitted to the irs,the estate alleged that russell embezzled its distribution from the farming income.
in august,the parties settled the estate lawsuit.as part of the settlement,russell agreed to transfer million to the estate,and to divide the interests in oil properties,bank and stock accounts equally between himself and the estate.the estate dropped its embezzlement claim against russell,and the parties stipulated that all grain,and the proceeds therefrom,held by bbp on or after november,belonged to russell.the parties also stipulated that all assets and liabilities of bbp held on or after march,would be the sole property of russell.
on june,the commissioner issued a notice of deficiency to the estate for tax years and in addition to other adjustments,the commissioner disallowed the estate claimed theft loss of in.the estate countered in its petition that the irs erred in increasing its income by because that amount was russell income and not taxable to the estate.prior to trial all issues were settled between the parties except the issue of how to allocate the grain sales.
tax court proceedings 
following trial,the tax court ruled in favor of the commissioner.in its memorandum,the tax court found that the grain sold in was bbp property and that the income from the grain sales was bbp thus,russell and the estate were each allocated gain from these sales.the court noted that it was not until the estate settled its lawsuit against russell that the grain became the sole property of russell,and taxpayers may not retroactively allocate between themselves tax obligations owed to the united states,citing united states little,cir.
the tax court further determined that the profits from the grain sales should be equally allocated between russell and the estate.in order to decide how much of the grain profit each partner should be allocated,the court determined each partner distributive share.the court noted that a partner must take into account his distributive share for each item of partnership income when determining his income tax,vecchio commissioner,wl,and each partner is taxed on his distributive share,regardless of whether the amount was actually distributed to them.united states basye,d.the distributive share is generally determined by the partnership agreement.a.however,even if the distributive shares are set by the partnership agreement,if those allocations do not have substantial economic effect they will be disregarded.because bbp was an oral partnership,the tax court had looked at all the facts and circumstances surrounding the formation and operation of the partnership to determine whether the oral agreement set the brothers respective distributive shares.
at trial,the estate argued that each partner distributive share should be determined by the underlying agreement between melvin and russell that each would be separately accountable for their own operations.in other words,the estate felt that melvin should receive both the benefits income,and the burdens tax liability of the oil and gas operations,while russell should receive the same treatment with regard to the farming operations.under this theory,russell alone would have been liable for the tax liability on the gain from the grain sales.
although it is not completely clear from the tax court order,the court found either that the oral partnership agreement did not provide a basis for determining each partner distributive shares,or that even if it did,the allocation provided for did not have substantial economic effect because no capital accounts were maintained by the partners or the partnership.see ogden commissioner,cir setting forth the necessity of capital accounts in order for the distributive share allocation to have substantial economic effect.thus,in order to adjudge who and how much should be taxed for the grain sales,the tax court had to decide that melvin and russell respective distributive shares would be calculated according to each partner interest in the partnership.b partner distributive share to be determined in accordance with partner interest in the partnership if agreement does not provide for this,or if the allocation in the agreement does not have substantial economic effect 
the tax court found that,based on the lack of written documentation,the record was insufficient to determine the partners relative capital contributions to the partnership.similarly,the tax court found that the record was also insufficient to establish the partners economic interests in the profits and losses of the partnership because the profits earned by the farming and the oil activities varied from year to year.melvin ran the oil operations,while russell was in charge of farming,and they each agreed to take yearly profits only from the income produced by the operations they managed.their profits were not years melvin earned more,and some years russell earned more.with regard to the third factor considered by the tax court in its distributive share analysis,the court noted that bbp records,or lac
