plaintiffs appellants leeds,lp leeds and fourth investment,lp fourth investment sometimes collectively,appellants brought quiet title actions challenging tax liens filed by the internal revenue service irs against certain commercial and residential properties located in san diego,california,to which appellants hold legal title.the tax liens arose from assessments against taxpayers susanne and don ballantyne,based on the irs claim that appellants held the relevant properties as nominees of the ballantynes on the assessment dates.after a bench trial,the district court denied appellants quiet title claims and upheld the validity of the tax liens.
appellants appeal,contending that california does not recognize nominee ownership.we reject this argument because california cases have unambiguously recognized the existence of nominee ownership.although california courts have not precisely specified the factors relevant to performing a nominee analysis,we predict that the california supreme court would evaluate nominee status in light of the criteria set forth in relevant federal cases.applying those criteria,the district court properly concluded that appellants held legal title to the san diego properties as nominees of the ballantynes.we also reject appellants assertion that the district court judgment should be vacated for failure to join the numerous shell entities utilized by the ballantynes as part of their complex tax evasion scheme.we affirm the decision of the district court.
factual and procedural background 
the ballantynes federal tax liabilities 
susanne susanne and don don ballantyne owe the irs substantial federal income taxes for tax years,and.in july,the ballantynes sought relief before the united states tax court,challenging income tax deficiencies claimed by the irs for tax years and,in the amounts of and,respectively totaling,collectively.the tax court conducted a trial in may,and in october,confirmed the deficiencies claimed by the irs.the decision of the tax court was later affirmed on appeal by our court,see ballantyne comm r,cir,and in june,the irs imposed an assessment of.
the ballantynes tax issues were not limited to those tried in the tax court.in january,the irs imposed an assessment of for alleged income tax deficiencies for tax year.in october,the irs imposed an assessment of based on alleged deficiencies for tax year.as a result of the referenced assessments,plus applicable interest and penalties,the irs recorded liens in the amount of on two properties in san diego,california a home located at mccall street the mccall property,and a commercial building located at fourth avenue the fourth property.on the dates of the second and third assessments,fee title to the mccall property was vested in leeds,and fee title to the fourth property was vested in fourth investment.the referenced tax lien identified leeds and fourth investment as nominees of the ballantynes.
transfer of the mccall and fourth properties to leeds and fourth investment 
with the specter of their tax trial looming in,susanne caused the ballantyne trust to transfer legal title to the mccall and fourth properties to leeds and fourth investment,and later to her and don children trusts,through a series of complex transactions involving shell entities created and controlled by the ballantynes.
a.the mccall property 
the mccall property is a single family residence,built by susanne parents.at some point in time,fee title to the mccall property was vested in a trust created by susanne mother,styled the susan cramer trust the cramer trust.in,after the death of susanne mother,and after susanne brother,ed,had received the distributions from the cramer trust to which he was entitled,susanne became the cramer trust sole beneficiary and trustee.in,susanne created the susanne ballantyne trust the ballantyne trust,a revocable intervivos trust,into which she placed substantially all of her assets,including the corpus of the cramer trust which included the mccall property.
in june,shortly after the ballantynes tax court trial,the cramer trust conveyed the mccall property to leeds,a newly created limited partnership,in exchange for a limited partnership interest in leeds.the title transfer documents in this transaction were not recorded until july,more than two years after the transfer.the cramer trust immediately transferred its interest in leeds to the ballantyne trust,with susanne executing all relevant documents on behalf of both trusts.the remaining interest in leeds was owned by a newly created entity,styled the rhodes investment corporation,which was wholly owned by the ballantyne trust.after these transactions concluded,susanne became the indirect owner of both the buyer and the seller of the mccall property.specifically,after the transfers,the ballantyne trust owned a limited partnership interest in leeds and rhodes,which was owned by the ballantyne trust,owned a general partnership interest in leeds.no evidence was introduced at trial indicating that leeds was created for any purpose other than to hold nominal title to the mccall property.
after the transfer to leeds,the ballantynes continued to maintain possession of the mccall property,purportedly as tenants of leeds.a lease agreement was signed by susanne on behalf of leeds,and by don on behalf of the ballantynes.the ballantynes did not begin paying rent to leeds until nearly a year after the lease was signed.when rent was paid,it was almost never paid on time,and was rarely paid in full.in fact,it appears that the rent leeds received was not rent at all,but rather payments made by the ballantynes to cover various property expenses as they arose.despite the ballantynes failure to pay rent on a timely basis or in the correct amount,leeds never demanded full payment or charged the late fee required in the lease agreement.
b.the fourth property 
the fourth property is a commercial property in which susanne originally owned a undivided interest,and from which she derived rental income under a triple net lease.in,susanne quitclaimed her undivided interest in the fourth property to the ballantyne trust.in june,shortly after the ballantynes tax court trial,the ballantyne trust conveyed the fourth property to fourth investment,a newly created limited partnership,in exchange for a limited partnership interest in fourth investment.the grant deed was not recorded until october,more than three months later.the remaining interest in fourth investment was owned by its general partner,rhodes,which in turn was owned by the ballantyne trust.
susanne indirectly owned and controlled both the buyer and the seller in the fourth property transfer.specifically,fourth investment limited partner was the ballantyne trust,and its general partner was rhodes owned by the ballantyne trust.no evidence was introduced at trial showing that fourth investment ever served any function other than nominally holding title to the fourth property.
susanne retained control over the fourth property income stream after the transfer of her interest to fourth investment because,pursuant to susanne instructions,the rental income derived from the fourth property continued to be paid to susanne brother,ed,to whom susanne owed a debt.tenant rent payments were not made to fourth investment until susanne notified her tenant to do so months after the ballantyne trust conveyed the fourth property to fourth investment.the record does not reflect whether the tenant of the fourth property was ever advised that the property ownership and,therefore,the tenant landlord had changed.
encumbrances on the mccall and fourth properties 
four days before the commencement of their tax court trial,the ballantynes entered into another dizzying series of transactions which made their assets including the mccall and fourth properties appear to be encumbered and nearly worthless.specifically,in may,susanne caused the ballantyne trust to file a ucc financing statement purporting to show that the ballantyne trust and its non real estate assets were encumbered by a personal property lien as security for a million debt that had allegedly been incurred in november,more than three years earlier.the million debt was owed to an entity named eastman investment,which in turn had procured loans totaling million from two banks.eastman investment was yet another entity,owned by the ballantyne trust and by another company,cramer investments.cramer investments,in turn,was owned in equal parts by susanne and her brother,ed.
in june,shortly after the conclusion of their tax court trial,susanne caused the ballantyne trust to record deeds of trust that purported to specifically encumber the mccall and fourth properties as further security for the eastman investment debt.although the mccall and fourth properties appeared to have been encumbered in connection with the eastman investment transaction,the ballantynes own valuation of leeds and fourth investment which then held title to the mccall and fourth properties did not show that leeds,fourth investment,or the real properties they owned,were encumbered by the liens of the referenced deeds of trust.
subsequently,in july,the ballantyne trust granted eastman investment a first security interest in rhodes the general partner of leeds and fourth investment,and tph investments,lp tph,another newly formed limited partnership,which was also owned and controlled by the ballantyne trust.susanne executed this transaction on behalf of both eastman investment and the ballantyne trust,but the ballantyne trust received no consideration for its granting of these additional security interests.
transfer of the mccall and fourth properties to the children trusts 
the ballantynes next created a plethora of new entities for the purpose of transferring the mccall and fourth properties to their children without realizing any taxable gain the principal vehicle used to effectuate these transfers was a limited partnership styled hemet c,which acquired the ballantyne trust limited partnership interest in leeds and fourth investment in a series of transactions that occurred between january and february.hemet c was structured such that a group of trusts owned by the ballantynes children the children trusts owned a limited partnership interest,and a company styled snow valley holdings,inc,whose shares were owned by the children trusts,was its general partner.the ballantynes and their children served as snow valley officers and directors.the ballantyne trust exchanged its limited partnership interest in leeds valued by the ballantynes at for a promissory note and an agreement by hemet c to assume a unsecured debt that don owed to a relative.susanne signed on behalf of the ballantyne trust,and don signed on behalf of hemet don testified that the ballantyne trust had previously assumed his familial debt,but he conceded that the assumption of debt was undocumented and not supported by consideration.
the leeds promissory note was immediately assigned to tph.shortly thereafter,the ballantyne trust deducted from the principal on the leeds note a nearly percent reduction to credit hemet c for accrued interest on various notes held by the children trusts.the notes,which were all in default,had purportedly been made several years earlier by companies owned by the ballantynes that had subsequently gone out of business.don testified that the defaulted notes had been guaranteed by the ballantyne trust when made,but there is no record of any guarantee,and at least four of the purported loans were made before the ballantyne trust even purchased the companies.
the ballantyne trust exchanged its limited partnership interest in fourth investment valued by the ballantynes at for a promissory note and an agreement by hemet c to assume in unsecured promissory notes owed to various companies and the children trusts.nearly of the in assumed notes arose from circular transfers of funds between the ballantyne trust and the children trusts.specifically,the ballantyne trust transferred to the children trusts in december,and borrowed from the children trusts contemporaneously.
like the leeds note,the fourth investment note was immediately assigned to tph,and was thereafter reduced by due to an alleged accounting error by susanne.the note was subsequently reduced by another to give hemet c credit for accrued interest on the assumed debts,despite the fact that hemet c had made no interest payments.the reduction of the promissory note was not supported by consideration.
hemet c apparently made some payments on the unsecured promissory notes,but,at most,only was distributed on the leeds note and on the fourth investment note,before hemet c its own notes from tph in the transaction described below.
foreclosure 
in october,the ballantynes figuratively,but intentionally,toppled the house of cards they had created by causing a foreclosure on secured debt involving several entities within their control,for the purpose of transferring the mccall and fourth properties to their children without consideration.to effectuate the foreclosure,the ballantyne trust ceased making payments on the million eastman investment debt,and eastman investment which was effectively controlled by made no effort to collect.the ballantyne trust then gave partnership interests in investment associates,lp,a limited partnership owned by the children trusts and controlled by don,to a newly created entity,fulton,also owned by the children trusts and controlled by don.in exchange,fulton agreed to make payments on the eastman investment note.but fulton made no payments.in a purported attempt to protect itself from an impending default,eastman investment then sold the eastman investment note to new horizon lighting,lc yet another entity owned by other entities and controlled by the children trusts.in exchange for the note,eastman investment received an identical note,thereby rendering the transfer wholly without substance.
new horizon subsequently foreclosed on its security interests to satisfy the eastman investment note.as a result,hemet c controlled by the children trusts acquired the ballantyne trust interests in tph,including the limited partnership interests in leeds and fourth.the children trusts also acquired the ballantyne trust interest in rhodes,the general partner of leeds and fourth.the foreclosure had no effect on the ballantynes as a practical matter,however,because new horizon chose not to foreclose on the mccall and fourth properties,or to take any of the ballantynes personal property that it had acquired as a result of the foreclosure.
present action 
in january,appellants filed these quiet title actions seeking to remove the federal tax liens encumbering the mccall and fourth properties.the district court concluded that appellants held bare legal title to the properties as nominees of the ballantynes.the district court looked to federal case law to supply the standards for evaluating the nominee doctrine under california law.the court determination was based on findings that the initial transfer of the properties to appellants in exchange for partnership units was undertaken as part of a larger scheme to transfer the properties to the children trusts without adequate consideration the ballantynes failed to show that the multiple transfers between and amongst the shell entities were effectuated for any purpose other than to evade substantial tax liabilities the ballantynes continued to maintain possession and control over the mccall property throughout the relevant time period,and retained the power to direct the distribution of income from the fourth property and few,if any,of the transactions discussed at trial were conducted at arms length.appellants timely appealed the judgment.we have jurisdiction under.

discussion 
the irs has broad powers to impose federal tax liens under.section provides that a lien may be imposed upon all property and rights to property belonging to a taxpayer who has failed to pay taxes owed after assessment and demand.the supreme court has interpreted section to apply to all property of a taxpayer,including property that is held by a third party as the taxpayer nominee or alter ego.leasing united states.
a nominee is one who holds bare legal title to property for the benefit of another.scoville united states,cir citations omitted.although the supreme court has clearly indicated that the irs may impose nominee tax liens,see leasing,at,it has provided only limited guidance concerning how such nominee determinations are to be made.however,the court has explained that application of the federal tax lien statutes involves questions of both state and federal law.see drye united states,u,see also united states craft.the federal tax lien statute itself creates no property rights but merely attaches consequences,federally defined,to rights created under state law.craft,at quoting united states bess.consequently,in making nominee determinations in a tax lien context,we must look initially to state law to determine what rights the taxpayer has in the property the government seeks to reach.drye,at see also united states bank of commerce,noting that state law controls in determining the nature of the legal interest which the taxpayer had in the property citations and internal quotations omitted.after determining that the taxpayer has a property interest under state law,we then look to federal law to determine whether the taxpayer rights qualify as property or rights to property within the compass of the federal tax lien legislation.drye,at.
the government contends that nominee doctrine should be governed by federal common law rather than state law.we reject this position,just as it has been uniformly rejected by our sister circuits and by nearly every federal court that has examined the issue 
the government correctly notes that under drye,the code and interpretive case law place under federal,not state,control the ultimate issue whether a taxpayer has a beneficial interest in any property subject to levy for unpaid federal taxes.drye,at.nevertheless,in reaching that ultimate issue,drye requires that we look initially to state law to determine the taxpayer ownership interest in the property.id.at see also mark segal,irs attacks asset transfers designed to thwart tax collections,practical tax strategies,noting that s tate law generally holds significance to the determination of whether a party is a nominee due to the recognition of the role of state law in determining property rights.
the government further urges that the federal common law must govern nominee determinations because the ability to collect taxes is a vital federal interest.the government position is predicated on a fear that state courts will construe their own nominee doctrines in such a way as to frustrate specific objectives of the federal government.united states kimbell foods.to date,however,this concern has proven to be unfounded,because state law nominee doctrine is typically so similar to its federal common law counterpart that the distinction is of little moment.shades ridge holding,united states,cir.the government concern that diverging state law nominee doctrines will undermine a nationally uniform body of law,kimbell foods,at,is similarly misplaced because courts across many jurisdictions a lmost universally utilize the same criteria in evaluating nominee relationships.dalton,at.
moreover,should a state ever adopt an interpretation of the nominee doctrine that frustrates federal objectives,or disrupts commercial relationships,recourse may be sought through the legislative or federal regulatory processes.see robert danforth,the role of federalism in administering a national system of taxation,tax law,suggesting that i n cases involving the federal tax lien,federal courts should respect state definitions of property and rights to property and that i f this approach leads to abuse or raises other tax policy concerns,the remedies should come from congress,not the courts see also teresa dondlinger trissell,a uniform standard for alter ego and nominee tax litigation,fed.law,advocating that congress or the irs,through federal regulations,establish a uniform standard for nominee determinations.because the state law abuses conjured by the government are merely theoretical at this point in time,we decline the government invitation to ignore state law in evaluating the validity of a tax lien in the nominee context.
accordingly,we adopt the interpretation of drye advanced by the reasoning of our sister circuits and hold that questions of nominee status require a inquiry prior to determining whether a nominee lien may lawfully be enforced as a matter of federal law.holman,at see also spotts,at b efore determining what,if any,federal tax consequences attach,we must first address the pertinent questions of state property law.
california law and nominee doctrine 
appellants assert that california does not recognize a nominee lien theory of ownership.they are mistaken.california cases unambiguously confirm the existence of nominee ownership.see lewis hankins,determining that the parcels were beneficially owned by defendant because such entities were mere agents or nominees of defendant emphasis added see also parkmerced city cnty.of,baldassari united states,baumann harrison.despite california longstanding recognition of nominee ownership,however,california courts have not yet specified the factors relevant to determining whether a person or entity holds title as a nominee.given the absence of a controlling california supreme court decision dictating the criteria relevant to a nominee analysis,we must predict how the california supreme court would decide the issue,using intermediate appellate court decisions,statutes,and decisions from other jurisdictions as interpretive aids.kairy supershuttle int l,cir quoting gravquick trible navigation int l,cir.
when california courts encounter a dearth of california appellate decisions on a particular legal question,they often look to decisions of california federal courts and cases in resolving the issue.august entm t,phila.indem.ins,d.the california supreme court specifically gives great weight to federal court decisions when they reflect a consensus.coral,city cnty.of,cal quoting barrett rosenthal,cal.applying these principles here,we predict that the california supreme court would likely find the federal court cases evaluating nominee ownership to be highly persuasive,for at least two reasons.first,the federal decisions reflect an almost universal consensus regarding the factors relevant to a nominee analysis.dalton,at.second,those factors have been adopted by federal courts in california see,united states bell,d.
the practice of grafting federal nominee doctrine onto an amorphous state law scheme is quite common.see stephanie hoffer,et,to pay or delay the nominee dilemma under collection due process,tul,explaining that d ue to the nonstatutory nature of nominee theory,courts have been faced with a dearth of state precedent and are thus frequently forced to canvass the law of other jurisdictions.indeed,federal courts evaluating nominee doctrines in alabama,maine,montana,nebraska,new jersey,and virginia,have looked to federal law to supply standards for evaluating that state nominee doctrine.may v.a parcel of land,d,see also dalton,at cody united states,d,baum hydraulics united states,d,libutti united states,towe antique ford found,dep t of treasury.
we thus confirm that california law recognizes a nominee theory of property ownership.we also predict that if the california supreme court had occasion to evaluate the factors relevant to determining nominee ownership under california law,it would adopt the uniform set of factors generally recognized by federal courts.see,spotts,at.
application of the nominee theory of ownership 
appellants assert that even if california recognizes nominee ownership,the district court erred in concluding that appellants hold title to the mccall and fourth properties as nominees of the ballantynes.
the district court properly evaluated appellants nominee status in light of the test set forth in spotts and other federal cases.those factors are
