respondent quality stores,and its affiliates collectively quality stores made severance payments to employees who were involuntarily terminated as part of quality stores chapter bankruptcy.payments which were made pursuant to plans that did not tie payments to the receipt of state unemployment insurance varied based on job seniority and time served.quality stores paid and withheld,inter alia,taxes required under the federal insurance contributions act fica,et.later believing that the payments should not have been taxed as wages under fica,quality stores sought a refund on behalf of itself and about former employees.when the internal revenue service irs did not allow or deny the refund,quality stores initiated proceedings in the bankruptcy court,which granted summary judgment in its favor.the district court and sixth circuit affirmed,concluding that severance payments are not wages under fica.

a fica defines wages broadly as all remuneration for employment.a.as a matter of plain meaning,severance payments fit this definition they are a form of remuneration made only to employees in consideration for employment.employment is any service performed by an employee for an employer.b.by varying according to a terminated employee function and seniority,the severance payments at issue confirm the principle that service mea ns not only work actually done but the entire relationship for which compensation is paid.social security bd.nierotko.this broad definition is reinforced by the specificity of fica lengthy list of exemptions.the exemption for severance payments made because of retirement for disability,a a,would be unnecessary were severance payments generally not considered wages.fica statutory history sheds further light on the definition.fica originally contained definitions of wages and employment identical in substance to the current ones,but in,congress excepted from wages d ismissal payments not legally required by the employer,stat.since that exception was repealed in,fica has contained no general exception for severance payments.
b the internal revenue code chapter governing withholding does not limit the meaning of wages for fica purposes.like fica definitional section,a has a broad definition of wages and contains a series of specific exemptions.section o instructs that supplemental unemployment compensation benefits or subs,which include severance payments,be treated as if they were wages.contrary to quality stores reading,this as if instruction does not mean that severance payments fall outside the definition of wages for withholding purposes and,in turn,are not covered by fica definition.nor can quality stores rely on o heading,which refers to certain payments other than wages.to the extent statutory headings are useful in resolving ambiguity,see ftc mandel brothers,o heading falls short of declaring that all the payments listed in o are other than wages.instead,o must be understood in terms of the regulatory background against which it was enacted.in the and,because some states provided unemployment benefits only to terminated employees not earning wages,irs rulings took the position that severance payments tied to the receipt of state benefits were not wages.to address the problem that severance payments were still considered taxable income,which could lead to large tax liability for terminated workers,congress enacted o,which treats both subs and severance payments the irs considered wages as if they were wages subject to withholding.by extending this treatment to all subs,congress avoided the practical problems that might arise if the irs later determined that subs besides severance payments linked to state benefits should be exempt from withholding.considering this regulatory background,the assumption that congress meant to exclude all subs from the definition of wages is unsustainable.that o does not narrow fica wages definition is also consistent with the major principle of rowan united states,that simplicity of administration and consistency of statutory interpretation instruct that the meaning of wages should be in general the same for withholding and for fica calculations.

united states,petitioner quality stores,et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 
justice kennedy delivered the opinion of the court.
this case presents the question whether severance made to employees terminated against their will are taxable wages under the federal insurance act fica,et.
the court of appeals for the sixth circuit held that the payments are not wages taxed by fica.to reach its holding,the court of appeals relied not on fica definition of wages but on o of the internal revenue code,a provision governing withholding.that conclusion,for the reasons to be discussed,was incorrect.
fica broad definition of wages includes the severance payments made here.and o does not alter that definition.section o instructs that any severance payment shall be treated as if it were a payment of wages.according to the court of appeals,o suggests that the definition of wages for withholding does not extend to severance payments and so,the argument continues,severance payments also must be beyond the terms of fica similar definition.but o is entirely compatible with the proposition that some or all payments do fall within the broad definition of the term wages.section o was enacted in response to a narrow,specific problem regarding withholding.in addition,were the court to rule that the severance payments made here are exempt from fica taxation but not from withholding under for,it would contravene the holding in rowan united states,which held there should be congruence in the rules for fica and withholding.
quality stores,an retailer,entered bankruptcy proceedings in.before and following the filing of an involuntary chapter bankruptcy petition,respondents quality stores and affiliated companies,all referred to here as quality stores,terminated thousands of employees.the employees received severance payments,which all parties to this case stipulate were the result of a reduction in work force or discontinuance of a plant or operation.the payments were made pursuant to one of two different termination plans.for reasons later to be explained,it should be noted that neither termination plan tied severance payments to the receipt of state unemployment compensation.
under the first plan,terminated employees received severance pay based on job grade and management level.the president and chief executive officer received months of severance pay,senior managers received months of severance pay,and other employees received one week of severance pay for each year of service.
the second plan was designed to facilitate quality stores postbankruptcy operations and encourage employees to put off their job searches.to receive severance pay,employees had to complete their last day of service as determined by the employer.officers received between and months of severance pay,and employees and employees paid by the hour received one week of severance pay for every year of service if the employees had been employed for at least two years,up to a stated maximum of severance pay.workers who had been employed for less than two years received a week of severance pay.
quality stores reported the severance payments as wages on tax forms,paid the employer required share of fica taxes,and withheld employees share of fica taxes.then quality stores asked former employees to allow it to file fica tax refund claims for them.about former employees agreed to allow stores to pursue fica refunds.on its own behalf and on behalf of the former employees,quality stores filed for a refund of in fica taxes.the internal revenue service neither allowed nor denied the claim.
quality stores initiated a proceeding in the bankruptcy court seeking a refund of the disputed amount.the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in its favor.the district court and court of appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed,concluding that severance payments are not wages under fica.see in re quality stores.other courts of appeals,however,have concluded that at least some severance payments do constitute wages subject to fica tax.see,csx united states,ca fed.university of pittsburgh united states,north dakota state united states.the united states,claiming that the fica taxes must be withheld,sought review here and certiorari was granted.
the first question is whether fica definition of wages encompasses severance payments.the beginning point is the relevant statutory text.mississippi ex rel.hood au optronics,slip,at.
to fund benefits provided by the social security act and medicare,fica taxes wages paid by an employer or by an employee with respect to employment.a,b,a,b.congress chose to define wages under fica broadly.mayo foundation for medical ed.and research united states,slip,at.fica defines wages as all remuneration for employment,including the cash value of all remuneration including benefits paid in any medium other than cash.a.the term employment encompasses any service,of whatever nature,performed by an employee for the person employing him.b.
under this definition,and as a matter of plain meaning,severance payments made to terminated employees are remuneration for employment.severance payments are,of course,remuneration,and common sense dictates that employees receive the payments for employment.severance payments are made to employees only.it would be contrary to common usage to describe as a severance payment remuneration provided to someone who has not worked for the employer.severance payments are made in consideration for employment for a service performed by an employee for the person employing him,per fica definition of the term employment.ibid.
in social security bd.nierotko,the court interpreted the term wages in the social security statutory context to have substantial breadth.in that case a worker,who had been wrongfully terminated,sought to have his backpay counted as taxable wages for the purpose of obtaining credits under the social security system.the court stated that the term service,used with respect to social security,means not only work actually done but the entire relationship for which compensation is paid to the employee by the employer.at.
as confirmation of that principle,severance payments often vary,as they did here,according to the function and seniority of the particular employee who is terminated.for example,under both termination plans,quality stores employees were given severance payments based on job grade and management level.and under the second termination plan,nonofficer employees who had served at least two years with their company received more in severance pay than nonofficer employees who had not a standard example of a company policy to reward employees for a greater length of good service and loyalty.
in this respect severance payments are like many other benefits employers offer to employees above and beyond salary payments.like health and retirement benefits,stock options,or bonuses,a competitive severance payment package can help attract talented employees.here,the terminations leading to the severance payments were triggered by the employer involuntary bankruptcy proceeding,a prospect against which employees may wish to protect themselves in an economy that is always subject to changing conditions.
severance payments,moreover,can be desirable from the perspective of the employer as an alternative or supplemental form of remuneration.in situations in which chapter bankruptcy reorganization is necessary,an employer may seek to retain goodwill by paying its terminated employees well,thus reinforcing its reputation as a worthy employer.employers who downsize in a period of slow business may wish to retain the ability to rehire employees who have been terminated.
a specific exemption under fica for certain payments reinforces the conclusion that the payments in question are well within the definition of wages.section a a exempts from taxable wages any severance payments made because of for disability.that exemption would be unnecessary were severance payments in general not within fica definition of wages.american bank trust dallas county,declining to read a statute in a manner that would cause specific exemptions to be superfluous fica definitional section,moreover,provides a lengthy list of specific exemptions from the definition of wages.for example,fica exempts from wages payments on account of disability caused by sickness or accident,cash payments made for domestic service in a private home under a certain amount,and cash tips less than a certain amount.see a a,b,b.the specificity of these exemptions reinforces the broad nature of fica definition of wages.
fica statutory history sheds further light on the text of,which defines the term wages.fica was originally enacted in title viii of the social security act,stat.in,title viii was transferred to the internal revenue code and became fica.stat.title viii contained,in substance,definitions of wages and employment identical to those fica now provides.see a,stat.b,ibid.with respect to the social security act,in the treasury department promulgated a regulation stating that the statutory definition of wages included dismissal pay.bureau of internal revenue,employees tax and the employers tax under title viii of the social security act,fed.reg.congress responded a few years later,in,by creating an exception from wages for d ismissal payments which the employer is not legally required to make.social security act amendments of,stat.codified at a ed.
in,however,congress repealed that exception.social security act amendments,a,stat.when congress acts to amend a statute,we presume it intends its amendment to have real and substantial effect.stone ins.congress has not revisited its amendment and since that time,fica has contained no exception for severance payments.
the next question is whether o of the internal revenue code relating to withholding is a limitation on the meaning of wages for fica purposes.section provides 
o extension of withholding to certain payments other than wages.
general rule 
for purposes of this chapter and so much of subtitle f as relates to this chapter 
a any supplemental unemployment compensation benefit paid to an individual,
shall be treated as if it were a payment of wages by an employer to an employee for a payroll period.
pursuant to stipulations by the parties,the court of appeals determined that the severance payments constitute supplemental unemployment compensation benefits,or subs.see o a.the court assumes,for purposes of this case,that this premise is correct.
quality stores argues that o instruction that subs be treated as if they were wages for purposes of withholding is an indirect means of stating that the definition of wages for withholding does not cover severance payments.it contends,further,that if the definition of wages for purposes of withholding does not encompass severance payments,then severance payments are not covered by fica similar definition of wages.
the court disagrees that o should be read as quality stores suggests.the chapter governing withholding has a broad definition of the term wages all remuneration for services performed by an employee for his employer,including the cash value of all remuneration including benefits paid in any medium other than cash.a.the definitional section for withholding,like the definitional section for fica,contains a series of specific exemptions that reinforce the broad scope of its definition of wages.the provision exempts from wages,for example,any remuneration paid for domestic service in a private home,f
