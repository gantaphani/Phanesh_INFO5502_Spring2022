this case raises the issue of the deductibility of legal fees paid for a defense against criminal charges as ordinary and necessary business expenses under internal revenue code a.the petitioners,a corporation and the sole shareholder of that corporation,were sent tax deficiency notices by the internal revenue service irs on april,in the sum of for the corporation and for the individual,plus penalties under.both of the deficiency notices stemmed from legal fees relating to the defense of a federal criminal indictment against kenneth guarino.the legal fees were paid and then deducted by the corporation,capital video corporation,and were not counted as income by guarino,the corporation sole shareholder.petitioners argue that the criminal conduct was so related to the operation of the corporation that the legal fees were a deductible corporate expense and properly not included in guarino gross income.the tax court disagreed,finding that the criminal charges were not sufficiently related to the operation of the corporation.we affirm the ruling of the tax court.
these facts are derived from the joint stipulated facts and from the exhibits,which were stipulated to be authentic the parties rested on only these facts and exhibits before the tax court.
in,kenneth guarino created and incorporated capital video corporation,located in cranston,rhode island guarino was the sole shareholder.capital video was a distributor of pornographic videotapes.guarino was associated with natale richichi,a capo in the gambino family of la cosa nostra,who dealt directly with the bosses of both the gambino and patriarca families and had influence with other factions of la cosa nostra.guarino was concerned that members of other organized crime families would extort money from,or take over,his multimillion dollar business.he also worried that organized crime would interfere with his other business ventures,including a show at the dunes hotel and casino in las vegas,called night dreams,and a precious metals business in the new england area.
guarino in began to pay tribute to richichi to fend off extortion attempts and to assist guarino with other business matters where richichi influence as a capo might benefit guarino.this included protection for the night dreams production and the precious metals business in new england,and for influence with various union officials.the payments averaged between eight and ten thousand dollars twice per month.the total amount of the payments is in dispute,but between july and september,guarino paid richichi at least in cash.
a substantial portion of richichi income came from guarino payments,and richichi was not otherwise lawfully employed.richichi worried that the irs would become aware of and attempt to tax his substantial income and assets.as a result,richichi and guarino made arrangements to conceal the tribute payments from the irs.the payments were always made in cash.while some of the funds were paid by capital video,these payments were kept off of its accounting books.some payments were hidden by skimming funds from the profits of capital video video booth and peep show machines capital video generated false forms so that it appeared that the skimmed profits were instead flowing to guarino and a nominee owner other funds from capital video were reported as loans and dividends to nominee owners capital video bookkeeper,guarino former,would write these loan and dividend checks and cash them herself.guarino also provided richichi with a capital video credit card,had capital video lease automobiles for him and for his daughter,and paid for health insurance coverage for richichi and his wife under capital video employee plan.
apart from helping to hide the tribute payments from the irs,guarino also helped richichi hide other assets.for instance,guarino advised richichi on the details of how to hide his ownership of property in the dominican republic by using a corporation and nominee owners.he also offered to help conceal richichi interest in property more directly,though there were no allegations that guarino actually served in anything more than an advisory capacity with regard to richichi other assets.
in october,guarino and richichi,along with another defendant,were indicted by a federal grand jury on one count of conspiring to bribe an official of the stagehands union in connection with guarino las vegas show.in august,guarino and richichi were indicted with three others in a superseding indictment.count one alleged a conspiracy to defraud the united states by impeding,impairing,obstructing,and defeating the lawful government functions of the irs in the ascertainment,computation,assessment,and collection of federal income taxes owed by richichi.count two reiterated the allegation of conspiracy to bribe a union official.finally,in august guarino and richichi were again indicted under a second superseding indictment for both of these counts,and they were also each separately indicted for several counts of interstate transportation of obscene material through the use of a common carrier,and aiding and abetting that crime under 
in january,guarino,as part of a plea agreement,pled guilty only to the charge of conspiracy to evade taxes.he was sentenced to sixteen months in prison,eleven of which were served in a halfway house,and fined.
capital video was a subchapter c corporation whose fiscal year began on march.on march,capital video elected to be treated instead as a subchapter s corporation.this change in status meant,among other things,that its fiscal year needed to match the calendar year.as a result,capital video first fiscal year as a subchapter s corporation was a short one,lasting from march to december.
during the calendar years and,capital video,out of its corporate funds,paid for all of the legal defense fees for guarino stemming from all of these criminal indictments.capital video paid in fees during calendar year and in fees during calendar year,for a total of.of that amount,capital video spent between march,and february,when it was a c corporation.for the c corporation fiscal year ending february,capital video deducted as ordinary and necessary business expenses the it had paid in legal fees for guarino.capital video spent the remaining between march and december,it deducted this amount for its subchapter s corporation short fiscal year.guarino failed to report the payment of these legal fees as income.
the irs sent notices of deficiency to both capital video and guarino.for capital video,the irs disallowed the full in legal fees that had been deducted as an ordinary and necessary business expense for the c corporation fiscal year ending february,for guarino,the irs assessed a tax deficiency for his taxes.the irs treated the entire paid by capital video when it was a subchapter c corporation as a constructive dividend to guarino.the irs later conceded that of those fees,though deducted in the corporate fiscal year ending february,were actually paid in they therefore could not be counted as personal income for guarino for.the remainder of the deducted amount,was spent in january and february of,part of the tax year for guarino personal tax purposes.for the legal fees paid by capital video once it elected s corporation status,the irs increased guarino taxable ordinary income by.
capital video and guarino sued in the tax court,arguing that the conspiracy to evade payment of taxes was directly related to the tribute payments,which were themselves made to protect and promote capital video business.therefore,they argued,the legal fees were properly deductible by capital video as ordinary and necessary business expenses and should not be included in guarino taxable income.the tax court ruled for the irs,finding that the petitioners had not established that the conspiracy charge was sufficiently related to the protection and promotion of capital video,though it refused to apply penalties.capital video comm r,wl,tax.memo lexis.this appeal timely followed.
