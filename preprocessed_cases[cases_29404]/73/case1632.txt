in particular,defendants challenge the validation action filed by fontana rda to validate a settlement agreement and a resolution to issue million in tax allocation bonds.code civ,et,and.defendants charge fontana rda has been paying most,if not all,its redevelopment tax increment revenues to a developer,rather than meeting its legal obligations under the community redevelopment law et to provide adequate affordable housing.defendants appeal from a judgment in favor of fontana rda,granting the validation action.
we decide the court erred in granting the validation action because the settlement agreement does not qualify as a contract under government code section and because the proposed million in tax allocation bonds would exceed fontana rda limitation on bonded debt secured by tax increment revenue for the jurupa hills redevelopment project.

to facilitate the jurupa hills redevelopment project,fontana rda entered into an owner participation agreement opa in with predecessor.the agreement provided fontana rda would remit tax increment revenue to the developer in exchange for the developer providing capital and construction financing to complete the public infrastructure improvements required for development of about housing units and related commercial and facilities.fontana rda obtained a validation judgment for the opa.
the opa was first amended in,raising the interest rate from percent to percent.in,the opa was amended again,with fontana rda pledging to pay all its tax increment revenues,with no provision for a percent to benefit affordable housing.the amendment included the statement that the debt is and shall be treated in all respects and at all times as a bonded or other indebtedness of the agency.again,fontana rda obtained a validation judgment.a third amendment was executed in and was validated.the third amendment of the opa established four categories of debt,including reserve debt for any amount over the secured bonded debt limitation of million.all debt shall be treated in all respects and at all times as a bonded or other indebtedness.the specifics of the third amendment are discussed later in this opinion.

in may,the state department of housing and community development department audited fontana rda programs,including its administration of the tax increment revenue required to promote affordable housing.in its findings,the draft audit concluded that fontana rda needed to reimburse the housing fund and the specific jurupa hills housing fund.as defendants interpret the record,the audit concluded fontana rda owed at least million to the housing fund and an additional million to the jurupa hills housing fund.
the draft audit also generally criticized fontana rda housing rehabilitation efforts,its planning for sufficient affordable housing,its submission of inaccurate information concerning housing,the transfer of unauthorized funds from the county housing authority to the housing fund,and the use of housing fund revenues for neighborhood beautification and general planning and administrative expenses.an additional units of affordable housing were deemed to be required.
the final audit report,issued in november,confirmed the department earlier findings.subsequently,in november,the department and fontana rda entered into a settlement agreement and general release directed at resolving the issues about affordable housing raised in the audit report.the settlement agreement provided fontana rda would pay million to the housing fund but no money to the specific jurupa hills housing fund.
