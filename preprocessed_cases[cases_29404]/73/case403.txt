this case presents two tax questions arising from the settlement of a property dispute between former spouses.the first is whether a transfer of land from a husband to his former wife constitutes a transfer incident to their divorce for purposes of the of gain rules.the second is whether the wife must include within her gross income the contingent fees paid directly to her attorneys from the proceeds of her subsequent sale of that land.we agree with the tax court holding that both questions must be answered in the affirmative.
louise young and john young married in and divorced in.the following year they entered into a mutual release and acknowledgment of settlement agreement settlement agreement to resolve their equitable distribution of property claim and all other claims arising out of the marital relationship.pursuant to this agreement,young delivered to young a promissory note for million,payable in five annual installments plus interest,which was secured by a deed of trust on acres of property that young received as part of the same settlement agreement.
in october,young defaulted on his obligations under the settlement agreement the next month young brought a collection action in state court in north carolina.on may,that court entered judgment for young,awarding her principal,interest,and reasonable attorneys fees.young paid only toward satisfaction of that judgment,thus prompting young to initiate steps to execute the judgment.before execution,however,and young entered into a settlement agreement and release agreement,which provided that young would transfer to young,in full settlement of his obligations,a tract of land of the acres that had collaterized his million note and acres adjoining that tract.pursuant to the agreement,young retained an option to repurchase the land for million before december.young assigned the option to a third party,who exercised the option and bought the land from young for million.
on her and federal income tax returns,young reported no capital gain from the sale of the property nor the portion of the million that went directly to pay her attorneys fees.at the same time,young did not report any gain from his transfer of property,in which he had a basis,to satisfy his then almost million obligation to young.thus,the appreciation of this property went untaxed despite the occurrence of a taxable event,the transfer or the sale.
the commissioner asserted deficiencies against both young and young.each then petitioned the tax court,which consolidated the two cases.after trial,the tax court ruled that the capital gain was properly taxable to young under a,which provides that n o gain or loss shall be recognized on a transfer of property to a former spouse,if the transfer is incident to the divorce.see young commissioner,wl.because the tax court held that the property transfer was incident to the divorce,it concluded that young realized no gain through his transfer of this property to his former spouse.id.rather,according to the tax court,young took young adjusted basis in the land and should have recognized a taxable gain upon the subsequent sale of that property.in addition,the tax court held that the portion of the proceeds from the sale,which was paid directly to her attorneys,must be included in young gross income.as a result of these holdings,the tax court ruled that louise young and her then husband,james ausman,owed in additional income tax in,and louise alone owed in additional income tax in.
young and james ausman appeal both rulings.the commissioner files a protective on the issue,urging that if we do not agree with the tax court conclusion that young and ausman realized taxable capital gains,we also reverse its holding with respect to young so that he is required to recognize the gain.
we first consider the tax court ruling involving,which provides that no taxable gain or loss results from a transfer of property to a former spouse if the transfer is incident to the divorce.a.section further provides that a transfer of property is incident to the divorce if it is related to the cessation of the marriage.c.the statute does not further define the term related to the cessation of the marriage,but temporary treasury regulations provide some guidance.those regulations extend a safe harbor to transfers made within six years of divorce if also pursuant to a divorce or separation instrument,as defined in b.temp.reg.b.section b defines a divorce or separation instrument as a decree of divorce or separate maintenance or a written instrument incident to such a decree.b.a property transfer not made pursuant to a divorce instrument is presumed to be not related to the cessation of the marriage.temp.reg.b.this presumption may be rebutted by showing that the transfer was made to effect the division of property owned by the former spouses at the time of the cessation of the marriage.id.
the tax court held that the transfer from young to young was related to the cessation of the marriage,thus neither party recognized a gain or loss on the transfer,and young took the same basis in the land that the couple had when they were married.young,at.the court applied the regulatory safe harbor provision,but also found that the transfer completed the division of marital property and,regardless of the safe harbor provision,it satisfied the statutory requirement that the transfer be related to the cessation of the marriage.id.we agree with the tax court that the land transfer was related to the cessation of the marriage,finding that it effect ed the division of marital property.temp.reg.b.
the factual underpinnings of this case are not questioned.it is undisputed that the parties formulated and entered into the settlement agreement to resolve their respective claims for equitable distribution of property and all other claims arising out of the marital relationship.the parties also agree that the agreement was to resolve disputes arising from that settlement agreement.in fact,an entire section of the agreement details the marital background of the dispute,beginning with the youngs divorce and subsequent execution of the settlement agreement,and expressly provides that the agreement was to fully settle all claims under the judgment and deed of trust that arose out of the settlement agreement.not surprisingly then,the tax court explicitly found that the transfer completed the division of marital property.young,at 
nonetheless,young challenges the tax court finding and argues that the transfer did not effect the division of marital property.in support of her contention,young notes that she was a judgment creditor when she entered into the agreement.but the only status relevant for purposes is spouse or former spouse.beyond her position as a former spouse,young status makes no difference when determining whether the transfer is taxable looks to the character of and reason for the transfer,not to the status of the transferee as a creditor,devisee,trust beneficiary,or otherwise indeed,in barnum commissioner,wl,although the former wife had obtained a judgment against her husband for alimony arrearage,the tax court found the resulting settlement to be incident to a divorce because,like the agreement in this case,it settled the dispute over obligations arising from a divorce decree.id.
additionally,young reliance on a private letter ruling issued to another taxpayer is misplaced,wl,in that case,the divorce decree contemplated a sale of the former marital house,in which each spouse owned a interest,to a third party.the irs ruled that the husband subsequent sale of his interest in the house to his former wife instead of a third party was an arm length transaction between two parties that happen to be former spouses,and thus did not effect the division of marital property pursuant to and its regulations.id.emphasis added.because the husband in the private letter ruling had no obligation stemming from the divorce decree to sell his half interest in the home to his wife,the fact that the parties were former spouses truly had no bearing on the sale except as the means of their association.in contrast,young transferred the acres to satisfy an obligation that originated from the dissolution of the youngs marriage.young transfer of this land was not an independent decision un related to the cessation of the marriage.and young did not just happen to be young former spouse.instead,the transaction occurred only because she was his former spouse enforcing her rights growing out of the dissolution of their marriage.
young argument based on state court jurisdiction is no more persuasive.she asserts that the agreement could not have effectuated the division of marital property,because the judgment that precipitated the agreement was rendered by a north carolina superior court,and not a north carolina district court,which is the proper division for the enforcement of separation or property settlement agreements between spouses,or recovery for the breach thereof.gen stat.whatever the merits of this argument as to the jurisdiction of north carolina courts,it can not be the basis for a decision as to the federal tax consequences of a transfer of property.the commissioner does not contend that the suit upon which the agreement was based was for recovery for the breach of a property settlement agreement under north carolina law,but only that the agreement completed the division of marital property under of the internal revenue code.
nor do we find young fairness argument compelling.she points out that under the settlement agreement she was to receive million plus interest,but if forced to pay the capital gains tax she will receive a lesser amount.for this reason,she argues that application of to the transfer would result in a radical and unfair of the young sic marital property.brief of appellant at.but,this argument overlooks the fact that young agreed to accept the acres in lieu of enforcing her judgment against young and receiving a cash payment.for whatever the record is silent as to young chose not to follow the latter route.in addition,if young had agreed to accept land in,as she ultimately did in,the resulting transfer would unquestionably have effect ed the division of marital property and been within.that the transfer occurred three years later does not alter its effect,or its treatment under.
the sole reason for the agreement was to resolve the disputes that arose from the youngs divorce and subsequent property settlement.had the youngs reached this settlement at the time of their divorce,there is no question that this transaction would have fallen under.there is no reason for the holding to differ here where the same result occurred through two transactions instead of one.
the policy animating is clear.congress has chosen to treat a husband and wife and former husband and wife acting incident to divorce as one economic unit,and to defer,but not eliminate,the recognition of any gain or loss on interspousal property transfers until the property is conveyed to a third party outside the economic unit.blatt commissioner,wl emphasis added see also,at,reprinted in.thus,no taxable event occurred and no gain was realized by either or young until young sold the acres to a third party.
indeed,holding otherwise would contradict the very purpose of.congress enacted that statute to correct the problems caused by united states davis,d,in which t he supreme court ha d ruled that a transfer of appreciated property to a spouse or former spouse in exchange for the release of marital claims results in the recognition of gain to the transferor,at,reprinted in.congress found this result inappropriate,and thus amended the tax code in to add.given this history,to impute a gain to young on his transfer of appreciated property in exchange for the release of young marital claims would abrogate clear congressional policy.id.
the dissent contention that the result we reach here is not supported by equitable considerations misses the point.congress has already weighed the equities and established a policy that no gain or loss will be recognized on a transfer between former spouses incident to their divorce.thus anytime former spouses transfer appreciated property incident to their divorce,the transferee spouse will bear the tax burden of the property appreciated value after selling it and receiving the proceeds.although this rule will undoubtedly work a hardship in some cases,the legislature has clearly set and codified this policy.we can not disregard that choice to satisfy our own notions of equity.
in so concluding,we do not suggest that the boundaries defining when a transfer is related to the cessation of the marriage or made to effect the division of marital property are always clear.we can not,however,on the facts of this case hold that young property transfer was a taxable event,when the purpose behind young transfer was to satisfy his obligations arising from the cessation of the marriage.to do so would,we believe,contravene the language,purpose,and policy of and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.
the commissioner also determined that to the extent young transfer of land to young discharged a debt to her for legal expenses,it should be included in her gross income.in the tax court,young contended that young owed the in attorneys fees directly to her attorneys,not to young herself,and so maintained that this amount should not be included in her gross income,regardless of.the tax court found to the contrary.on appeal,young does not challenge this factual finding but nonetheless maintains that the tax court erred when it concluded that this must be included within her gross income.young argues that,even if this amount was owed to her,she never realized this income and so it should for this reason not be included in her gross income.
resolution of this question centers on the meaning of gross income.the internal revenue code provides a very general definition e xcept as otherwise provided gross income means all income from whatever source derived.a.moreover,the supreme court has given a liberal construction to the term gross income in recognition of the intention of congress to tax all gains except those specifically exempted.james united states,d emphasis added see also commissioner glenshaw glass.
the court has long held that the assignment to another of income not yet received does not relieve the assignor of tax liability on that income.see lucas earl.in earl,justice holmes reasoned that the internal revenue code tax es salaries to those who earned them and does not allow a party to escape taxes through anticipatory arrangements and contracts however skillfully devised to prevent the salary from vesting even for a second in the man who earned it.id.at.similarly in helvering horst,the supreme court held that a father could not escape taxation on future interest income by assigning it to his son.in horst,the father owned negotiable bonds but detached their interest coupons,giving them to his son before they came due.the court held that the father gift was an anticipatory assignment of his income because he had earned and enjoyed the benefit of the coupons by directing them to his son.thus,the father was properly taxed even though the son ultimately collected the interest income.
under the reasoning of earl and horst,young anticipatory assignment of a portion of her settlement proceeds to her attorneys does not foreclose taxation of those proceeds,they are nonetheless includible within young gross income.young asks us,however,to adopt the contingent attorney fee exception to this rule established by the fifth circuit in cotnam commissioner,cir.
over judge wisdom dissent,the cotnam court held that,unlike the situation in earl,a contingent fee was not income to the client but rather income earned directly by her attorneys,because the client claim was uncertain to be paid at all and thus worthless without the aid of skillful attorneys.cotnam,at.applying this reasoning,the court ruled that the client did not assign income,but instead assigned to her attorneys forty per cent of the claim in order that she might collect the remaining sixty per cent.id.furthermore,the cotnam court found that in contrast to the father in horst,the only economic benefit to the client was an aid to the collection of a part of an otherwise worthless claim.id.at.the cotnam court also relied on the alabama code,which provided that attorneys have the same right and power over said suits,judgments and decrees,to enforce their liens,as their clients had or may have for the amount due thereon to them.id.at.because alabama attorneys have the same right over the suit as the client,the court reasoned,the client could never have realized the fee as income to her.
only one circuit has independently reached the same outcome as cotnam.see estate of clarks united states,cir in that case,the sixth circuit similarly reasoned that while the income at issue in earl and horst was already earned,vested and relatively certain to be paid to the assignor,a contingent fee is more similar to a division of property than an assignment of income,and the income should be charged to the one who earned it and received it,not to one who neither received it nor earned it.id.at.like cotnam,clarks also looked to state law.under the applicable michigan law,an attorney only had a lien on a judgment as opposed to the property right provided under the alabama law in cotnam,nonetheless,the clarks court concluded that a lthough the underlying claim was originally owned by the client,the client lost his right to receive payment for the lawyer portion of the judgment.id.at.
young urges us to follow cotnam and clarks.but to do so would permit a client to avoid taxation by skillfully devis ing the method for paying her attorneys fees,the precise danger the supreme court warned against in earl,at.if her attorneys charged an hourly rate,young would certainly have to include within her gross income any income used to pay her legal fees,whether the income came from the settlement proceeds or otherwise.we see no reason to allow her to escape taxation on a portion of the settlement proceeds simply because she arranged to compensate her attorneys directly from the proceeds through a contingent fee arrangement.indeed,the fifth circuit itself,although following cotnam on grounds of stare decisis,has recently recognized that a client with a contingent fee arrangement 
o ught not receive preferential tax treatment from the simple fortuity that he hired counsel on a contingent basis,for his attorney method of compensation did not meaningfully affect the gain he was able to enjoy from a favorable resolution of the litigation.
srivastava commissioner,cir footnote omitted.
in addition,cotnam holding that the contingent fee was income to the attorneys but not to the client was based in part on the notion that the client claim was worthless without the aid of skillful attorneys.cotnam,at.that rationale overlooks the fact that an attorney paid by the hour adds just as much worth to a claim as a contingent fee attorney.moreover,it is undisputed that satisfaction of young obligation to her attorneys provided her an economic benefit.see baylin united states.see also old colony trust commissioner.the discharge by a third person of an obligation to him is equivalent to receipt by the person taxed.that an assignment of income involves a contingent or undetermined amount does not exempt it from taxation to the assignor.see coady commissioner,cir baylin,at that the client assigned a portion of its recovery to its attorney before it knew the exact amount of the recovery does not mean that this amount never belonged to the client.
we also do not accept the suggestion in cotnam and clarks that a contingent fee arrangement gives an attorney a portion of a client cause of action,see cotnam,at,or property.see clarks,at.the client still controls the claim or property and ultimately decides to forego,pursue,or settle that claim.the attorney simply provides a service and receives compensation for that service,whether by an hourly rate or through a contingent fee.indeed,the idea that the attorney merely helps the client earn income from her claim is reinforced by the tax court holding in this case that young could deduct the portion of her legal fees that were allocable to the recovery of taxable income.young,at emphasis added citing kelly commissioner,wl,aff cir.
nor do we agree with cotnam and clarks and young reliance on state law to settle this federal tax issue.indeed,there is no relevant distinction between the state common law discussed in clarks and baylin,yet those courts reached opposite conclusions as the fifth circuit itself has now recognized,whether amounts paid directly to attorneys under a contingent fee agreement should be included within the client gross income should be resolved by proper application of federal income tax law,not the amount of control state law grants to an attorney over the client cause of action.see srivastava,at 
but,even if we adopted the contingent fee exception established in cotnam and the view that state law was we do carolina law is easily distinguishable from the alabama statute on which cotnam relied.the alabama statute gave the attorney the same right over the cause of action as the client,thus arguably providing a right over the claim.by contrast,the north carolina common law provides an attorney with a charging lien,which attaches only to a judgment,not to a cause of action.dillon consolidated delivery.consequently,an attorney right to contingent income matures at the same time the judgment is rendered or settlement,when the client income is earned.and justice holmes teaches us that a taxpayer can not escape taxation by prevent ing the income when paid from vesting even for a second in the man who earned it.earl,at.emphasis added.there is no indication that a north carolina attorney paid by contingent fee has acquired rights to the cause of action or a right equal to that of the client.until judgment,or in this case settlement,the attorney has the right to recover fees for services rendered,but not to obtain a share of the income produced by the client claim.see covington rhodes.the attorney does not,as young suggests,own the claim itself.
accordingly,we join the majority of those circuits to have addressed this issue and decline to adopt the cotnam exception.see coady commissioner,cir alexander irs,cir baylin united states,commissioner,wl,aff cir.see also bagley commissioner,wl holding,without mentioning cotnam,that settlement portion paid to attorneys pursuant to contingent fee was income to client,aff,cir.rather,the,although directly paid to young attorneys under a contingent fee agreement was,as the tax court held,properly includible in her gross income.
therefore,the tax court judgment is in all respects 
the majority affirms the determination of the tax court that the property transfer from john young to his former wife louise was incident to the young divorce and that louise must include as her income the contingent fees paid directly to her attorneys from the sale of the land transferred.i concur regarding the contingency fee issue but respectfully dissent regarding whether the property transfer was incident to the young divorce.i would conclude that a property transfer made between former spouses to satisfy a judgment is not made incident to the parties divorce merely because the lawsuit that produced the judgment was for default on a promissory note obtained in the parties divorce property settlement.
the issue in dispute here is which former spouse is responsible for paying capital gains taxes as a result of the substantial appreciation of the transferred property that occurred prior to the time john used the property to satisfy his debt to louise the answer to that question depends on whether the transfer was a taxable event.if it was,then john owed capital gains taxes and louise received a basis that reflected the fact that the property had appreciated substantially prior to her receiving it.if it was not,then john owed no capital gains taxes and louise took the property at john previous,much lower basis.i believe the applicable law demonstrates that the transfer was a taxable event and therefore capital gains taxes were due and payable by john as a result of this transaction.
the parties agree that the property transfer was a taxable event unless applies.that section
