california personal income tax law references its federal counterpart as the basis upon which to calculate a taxpayer state taxable income and,ultimately,the state income tax owed for a specified tax period.california law does so by recognizing the amount reported as taxable income in the taxpayer federal income tax return and then applying adjustments to that amount as required by state law.accordingly,in the majority of cases,a determination in an audit by the internal revenue service irs that a california taxpayer federal personal income tax liability is greater than reported in his or her federal income tax return also will effect an increase in the taxpayer state personal income tax liability.
in general,when a california taxpayer owes additional state personal income tax for a particular tax year,and unless another provision of the revenue and taxation code applies,section of that code requires that the california franchise tax board ftb provide notice to the taxpayer of any deficiency assessment within four years of the date on which the taxpayer filed his or her state income tax return for the tax year in question.in the specific circumstance in which a california taxpayer receives a final irs determination changing or correcting his or her federal personal income tax return for a particular tax year,revenue and taxation code section requires that within six months,the taxpayer report to the ftb any federal adjustment that will increase the taxpayer state tax payable for the same period when the taxpayer reports such an adjustment within six months,the ftb must provide notice of any related deficiency assessment within two years.when the taxpayer fails to report such an adjustment,the ftb may give notice of a deficiency assessment at any time.
in the present case,the irs audited the federal income tax return of the taxpayers,plaintiffs bayard ordlock and lois ordlock,for a particular tax year and eventually than four years after the date on which the taxpayers filed their federal and state income tax returns for that tax the taxpayers received greater taxable income than they reported and owed additional federal income taxes.although the change in federal taxable income had the effect of increasing the taxpayers state taxable income and income tax for the same period,they did not report the federal adjustments to the ftb pursuant to section.following their unsuccessful administrative appeal of the state eventual deficiency assessment and their payment of the assessed taxes,the taxpayers filed a civil action seeking a refund.the appellate court agreed with the taxpayers that,because the period prescribed by section for the ftb to provide notice of any deficiency assessment had expired prior to the final irs determination of the taxpayers additional federal tax liability,the taxpayers were not required to report the federal changes or pay the additional state taxes assessed.
we consider the correctness of the court of appeal holding.as we shall explain,in affording the ftb a period of limitations in which to notify a taxpayer of a state tax deficiency assessment,section by its terms does not establish an outermost time limit for notification by that agency in all circumstances.instead,an alternative period of limitation applies when,after the taxpayer files his or her tax return,the irs intervenes and finally determines that the taxpayer federal taxable income and tax liability are greater than reported in his or her federal return for a particular tax year,with resulting increases in state taxable income and the amount of state income tax calculated thereon for the same period.in the event of such irs intervention,section or section provides an alternative period during which the ftb may notify the taxpayer of a deficiency assessment,the duration of which depends upon when or whether the taxpayer reports to the ftb the final results of the federal authorities examination of the taxpayer return.
in the present case,the taxpayers failed entirely to report pursuant to section the federal changes that increased their state income tax liability.as a consequence,the ftb had an unlimited time in which to issue its notice of a deficiency assessment pursuant to section.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeal.
the material facts are not in dispute.having obtained an automatic extension,plaintiffs bayard and lois ordlock in may timely filed,as married,filing jointly,their federal and state personal income tax returns for the tax year.their federal income tax return reflected their having taken,as deductions,certain expenses related to three partnerships in which ordlock held minority interests.
thereafter,the irs commenced audits of the partnerships federal tax returns for and subsequent tax years.eventually,the irs offered and plaintiffs accepted a settlement with regard to their interests in two of the partnerships reported on their federal income tax return.in,the irs issued a report of tax examination changes reflecting disallowances of deductions attributable to those partnership interests.in,the irs issued a report of tax examination disallowances of deductions related to the third partnership interest,as well as a final report reflecting an increase in plaintiffs federal taxable income for the tax year.although the increase in their federal taxable income also caused an increase in their state taxable income and the state taxes calculated thereon for,plaintiffs did not notify defendant ftb of the interim or final irs audit reports of income tax changes.
in may,defendant mailed plaintiffs a notice of proposed assessment of additional state income tax for the tax year in the amount of,with accumulated interest in the amount of,based upon the increase in state taxable income resulting from the increase in federal taxable income determined in the irs tax audit.defendant notice advised plaintiffs that pursuant to section,they must report any federal changes resulting in increased state taxes payable for any year.
plaintiffs timely filed a tax protest,principally on the ground that,pursuant to section,defendant must provide notice of any deficiency assessment within four years from the date on which plaintiffs filed their income tax returns in may that this period had expired in may,well before the irs made its final determination adjusting plaintiffs federal income taxes.according to plaintiffs,because defendant was precluded by operation of section from assessing additional state taxes after may,the federal tax changes rendered by the irs more than years later did not,and could not,increase the amount of tax payable under this part as provided in section,subdivision a.plaintiffs asserted that this circumstance absolved them of any statutory duty to report the federal tax changes to defendant.in january,defendant denied plaintiffs tax protest.subsequently the state board of equalization sbe denied plaintiffs administrative appeal and petition for rehearing.
in january,defendant mailed plaintiffs a revised notice of state tax due for the tax year in the amount of,with accumulated interest in the amount of,totaling.plaintiffs paid the tax portion of the total amount under protest and filed with the sbe a claim for a refund,which was denied.
in july,plaintiffs filed in the superior court an action against defendant seeking a refund of the taxes paid under protest and alleging that defendant was precluded from issuing a notice of the proposed assessment for the tax year after the period of limitations provided by section had expired.after defendant filed an answer to the complaint,both parties moved for summary judgment.plaintiffs continued to assert that the expiration of the period of limitations set forth in section barred defendant from initiating any deficiency assessment,and thus relieved plaintiffs of any duty under section to report to defendant the subsequent irs changes to their federal tax liability that increased the state taxes they owed.defendant urged that,because plaintiffs failed to comply with section by reporting the increase in plaintiffs state taxes payable within six months of the final determinations by the irs in and that increased plaintiffs federal tax liability,section afforded defendant the opportunity to assess a deficiency for the tax year at any time.
the trial court denied plaintiffs motion and granted defendant motion for summary judgment.the court determined that section did not bar defendant from assessing additional state taxes for the tax year because,by its terms,section required plaintiffs to report to defendant corrections by the irs to plaintiffs federal tax return for any year that changed their federal tax liability and increased the state taxes they owed.because plaintiffs failed to report the changes to defendant,section applied,permitting defendant to mail a notice of deficiency assessment at any time.
the court of appeal concluded to the contrary that,by operation of section,defendant was precluded from assessing additional state tax for the tax year prior to the irs determination increasing plaintiffs federal tax liability for that period.reasoning that section did not act to revive or sustain defendant authority to impose additional taxes once the period of limitations set forth in section had expired in,the court of appeal reversed the judgment rendered by the trial court.we granted defendant petition for review.
as we have observed,california income tax law generally is based upon federal income tax law.witkin,summary of cal.law ed taxation.state law provides that subject to exceptions,gross income,adjusted gross income,and taxable income for state tax purposes are defined as their equivalents for federal tax purposes.see,subd.a.thus,an increase in the amount of a taxpayer federal taxable income generally will signify an increase in the amount of his or her state taxable income.
several years ago,the legislature amended revenue and taxation code,division to add part,administration of franchise and income tax laws,encompassing sections through and including the sections relevant in the present case.stats,ch.the former version of section,subdivision a,as enacted and also amended in that year,is the version operative here,as the parties agree stats,ch.until its further amendment in,section,subdivision a provided,as relevant to our discussion if the amount of gross income or deductions for any year of any taxpayer as returned to the united states treasury department is changed or corrected by the commissioner of internal revenue that taxpayer shall report the change or correction within six months after the final federal determination of the change or correction or as required by the franchise tax board,and shall concede the accuracy of the determination or state wherein it is erroneous.the changes or corrections need not be reported unless they increase the amount of tax payable under this part,subd.a as amended by stats,ch,italics added.as is clear,the last sentence refers to part 
in imposing a general duty upon a state taxpayer to report an adjustment in federal gross income or deductions engendered by,among several possible causes,an irs audit of the taxpayer federal tax return for a particular tax year,section,subdivision a specifically exempts the taxpayer from the duty to report whenever the federal adjustment does not increase the amount of his or her payable state tax.although in most instances federal changes will result in an increase in the amount of state tax,an increase does not occur,for example,when the amount of a taxpayer federal itemized deduction for state taxes paid is adjusted downward.although that adjustment will have the effect of increasing taxable income for federal tax purposes,it will not have any impact on state taxable income because,of course,there is no corresponding deduction on the state tax return.
as might be expected,defendant contends that the final sentence of section,subdivision a providing that federal changes or corrections need not be reported unless they increase the amount of tax payable under this part merely excludes those changes in federal tax liability that do not also effect an increase in the amount of state taxable income and state tax payable for the tax year in question,as in the example above.defendant observes that in plaintiffs case,the irs changes to their federal tax liability also increased their state tax liability,requiring them to report the federal changes.because plaintiffs failed to report the federal changes pursuant to section,subdivision a,defendant claims it could give them notice of the deficiency assessment at any time pursuant to section.
by contrast,plaintiffs assert and the court of appeal reasoned that the final sentence of section,subdivision a also could refer,and here does refer,to irs adjustments increasing federal taxable income and consequently to state taxable income that generates additional state income that has become payable because defendant has sent plaintiffs a notice of a proposed deficiency assessment.relying upon the limitations period provided by section,plaintiffs claim that by,defendant was precluded from issuing and enforcing a state income tax deficiency assessment of any kind for the tax year,regardless of the circumstance that the subsequent irs examination changed the taxpayers federal tax liability for that period.accordingly,section,subdivision a did not require plaintiffs to report,and they did not report,the federal changes.
at first blush,these diverse interpretations of the final sentence in section,subdivision a appear to warrant consideration not only of general principles of statutory construction see,lennane franchise tax bd.cal th,d,but also of rules that apply when statutory language fairly admitting of two reasonable constructions is deemed ambiguous.see,flannery prentice cal th,d,hoechst celanese franchise tax bd.cal th,d.in the latter event,defendant urges that we apply the rule that a court charged with interpreting an ambiguous statute must accord great weight to its administrative construction citing mudd mccolgan cal d,state bd.of equalization cal d,whereas plaintiffs emphasize,and the court of appeal cited,the principle that ambiguity in a tax statute must be resolved in favor of the taxpayer.agnew state bd.of equalization cal th,d,edison california stores mccolgan cal d.
on further consideration,however,we observe that plaintiffs construction of section,subdivision a is premised upon the applicability of section to foreclose defendant from giving notice to plaintiffs of any deficiency assessment after the expiration of the period,irrespective of the impetus for the assessment,and to render defendant notice of proposed assessment of no effect.if section does not apply in the present case,then the premise for plaintiffs interpretation of section,subdivision a disappears.we do not have any occasion to decide which is the most reasonable construction of section,subdivision a,based upon a perceived ambiguity in that statute,unless we determine that plaintiffs construction of the statute,premised upon the applicability of section,is reasonable.see flannery prentice,supra,cal th,d.accordingly,we first decide whether section,rather than another statute of limitations,actually does apply in the event the irs has made changes increasing federal tax liability more than four years after the date on which the taxpayers filed their corresponding state tax return.
section,subdivision a provides that except as otherwise expressly provided in this part,defendant must mail any notice to the taxpayer of a proposed deficiency assessment within the period following the filing of the state tax return.italics added.thus,by its express terms,section contemplates that in certain circumstances an alternate statute of limitations will apply to defendant mailing of a proposed deficiency assessment.the provisions that follow,sections and,make it clear that special limitations periods apply to defendant when the irs changes a taxpayer federal tax or not the taxpayer reports the change to defendant.
section sets forth the time period during which defendant may send notice to a taxpayer of a proposed deficiency assessment in the event the taxpayer timely reports a final federal determination of a change or correction.prior to its amendment in,section,subdivision a specified that if a taxpayer is required by section,subdivision a,to report a change or correction by the irs and does report the change or correction within six months after the final federal determination,a notice of proposed deficiency assessment resulting from those adjustments may be mailed to the taxpayer within two years from the date when the notice is filed with defendant by the taxpayer,or within the periods provided in section,or,whichever period expires later.italics added.
section sets forth the time periods during which defendant may notify the taxpayer of a proposed deficiency assessment in the event a taxpayer required by section to report does not timely report,or fails to report,a change or adjustment by the irs.prior to the amendment of section in,subdivision b provided that if a taxpayer reports to defendant a change by the irs later than six months following the final federal determination of a change as prescribed in section,defendant may mail a notice of proposed deficiency assessment within four years from the date the taxpayer notifies defendant of the federal change.subdivision a,of most relevance here,specified that if a taxpayer fails to report a federal change a notice of proposed deficiency assessment resulting from the adjustment may be mailed to the taxpayer at any time italics added.
as we shall explain,we agree with defendant that,in light of the circumstances of the present taxpayers who failed entirely to report a final federal determination that increased their federal tax liability and consequently increased their state taxes,subdivision a applied,permitting defendant at any time to mail plaintiffs notice of the proposed deficiency assessment based upon the additional state taxes payable for the tax year.
as we previously have stated,i n construing statutes,we must determine and effectuate legislative intent.citation.to ascertain intent,we look first to the words of the statutes citation,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.citation.lennane franchise tax,supra,cal th,d.it is evident that section,subdivision a,affording defendant four years to mail the taxpayer notice of a proposed deficiency from the date the taxpayer filed his or her return,is not intended to be the sole limitations period applicable to defendant in performing that task,but instead applies except as otherwise expressly provided in this part.the italicized phrase makes it incumbent upon us to consider the circumstances under which the alternative limitations statutes apply.
in addition,we are required to harmonize statutes by considering a particular clause or section in the context of the statutory scheme of which it is a part.dubois workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d.p rovisions relating to the same subject must be harmonized to the extent possible.lungren deukmejian cal d.in light of the similarity of the phrases employed,the entities referred to,and the subjects of sections,and,and other sections within that statutory sequence,it is evident that the phrase of exception provided in section refers to the applicability of one of those provisions 
it also is well settled that a general provision is controlled by one that is special,the latter being treated as an exception to the former.san francisco taxpayers board of supervisors cal th,d.section,subdivision a generally is applicable in the routine case in which,for example,a taxpayer files his or her federal and state income tax returns for a given tax year and the irs does not undertake a subsequent tax examination of the federal tax return for that year.sections and make it clear that special limitations periods apply when the irs has changed the taxpayer federal tax a limitations period when the taxpayer reports the changes within six months,establishing a limitations period when the taxpayer untimely reports the changes,and recognizing an absence of limitation when the taxpayer entirely fails to report.thus,those statutes,prescribing alternative periods of limitations when the federal government does choose to examine tax returns previously filed,create exceptions to the general statute that reflect the open status of those tax returns.
our view that,when changes to tax liability are effected by the irs,the general limitations period provided in section is replaced by a special limitations period provided in section or,is consistent with the interpretation given these statutes by the sbe.as we previously have explained,although we have the ultimate responsibility of construing these statutes,in general we accord significant weight and respect to a statutory in the form of a policy or a the agency charged with enforcement of the statute.agnew state bd.of equalization,supra,cal th,d,see in re dannenberg cal th,d,yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d.the sbe has concluded that when the irs has made changes to a taxpayer reported gross income or deductions,the limitations statute does not apply.see,appeal of eddlemon,sbe rptr.cch,appeal of magidow,sbe rptr.cch.in the latter case,the sbe stated section the predecessor of section is a general statute of limitations and it expressly provides for exceptions to the general rule.either of two exceptions applies when federal changes are made to a taxpayer gross income or deductions,depending on whether or not the taxpayer reports the changes to the franchise tax board in a timely fashion as required by section the predecessor of section of the revenue and tax code.id,at.
the sbe has explained that if the limitations period were to apply,defendant would be unable to employ the final federal adjustments as the basis for its assessments whenever such adjustments are substantially delayed because the taxpayers contested their federal assessment by pursuing administrative review with the irs or additional review in the federal court system.appeal of gebler,sbe rptr.cch.it is unlikely the legislature intended to afford such preferential treatment to litigious taxpayers or to depend to such an extent upon prompt action by the federal authorities.id.at.
moreover,under plaintiffs approach,any taxpayer who managed to prolong an audit of his or her federal tax return for a particular thus,to prolong the final federal determination of additional tax years or more from the date on which he or she filed the state tax return for that year,would avoid liability for additional state taxes otherwise payable as a result of the federal changes.it is equally unlikely that the legislature intended to reward a taxpayer gamesmanship,delay,and avoidance of legal obligations,and in effect to charge with payment of additional state taxes only those taxpayers who report federal audit changes.
in the present case,because plaintiffs federal tax return was corrected by the irs in a manner that increased their state tax liability for the corresponding period,section did not apply because plaintiffs failed to report the change to defendant,section,subdivision a instead applied.as we recognized earlier,plaintiffs assertion that section,subdivision a did not to apply to them because they did not suffer an increase in state tax payable,triggering a duty to report the federal change,is premised upon the asserted applicability of section.plaintiffs do not dispute that they received a final determination of changes to their federal tax liability resulting in an increase in their state tax liability for the same tax year.because section did not preclude defendant from notifying plaintiffs of a proposed state tax deficiency assessment,plaintiffs were required by section,subdivision a to report the federal changes increasing their state tax payable.
thus,defendant interpretation of section,subdivision a prevails.plaintiffs failure to comply with their duty under that statute to report the federal tax liability changes dictated the application of section,subdivision a,pursuant to which defendant was authorized to mail notice of the proposed deficiency assessment at any time.defendant properly notified plaintiffs of the proposed deficiency assessment following the final federal determinations of changes to plaintif
