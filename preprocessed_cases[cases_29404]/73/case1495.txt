article xiii a of the california constitution article xiii a,which the voters adopted in june as proposition,limits the ad valorem tax on real property to percent of the property full cash value,subd.a.as relevant here,section,subdivision a,of article xiii a sometimes hereafter section,subdivision a,defines full cash value as the assessed value of the property adjusted for inflation,or the appraised value of the property upon a change in ownership occurring after the assessment.the issue this case presents is whether a change in ownership occurred within the meaning of this section upon the death of a trust settlor who transferred her residence to a trust that was revocable during her life,who was the sole present beneficiary of that revocable trust,and who provided in the trust document that upon her death the trust would become irrevocable and her sister would have the right to occupy the residence during her lifetime.preliminarily,we must determine whether the settlor surviving sister properly filed this action to challenge an administrative determination that a change in ownership occurred.the court of appeal here held that the surviving sister properly filed the action and that no change in ownership occurred.for reasons set forth below,we reverse the court of appeal judgment.
during her lifetime,esther helfrick established a revocable trust,made herself trustee and sole present beneficiary of the trust,and transferred to herself as trustee her residence in sherman oaks,california.the trust became irrevocable upon helfrick death on march.at that time,under the terms of the trust,helfrick sister,plaintiff lorraine steinhart,received the right to occupy and use the residence for so long as she lives,provided she pay all taxes,insurance,and assessments on the property and the costs of utilities and any necessary repairs.upon steinhart death,the trustees of the trust were to sell the residence and disburse the net proceeds to those specified in the trust instrument,helfrick siblings still living at the time of steinhart death and the issue of any deceased siblings.
when helfrick died,the residence assessed value for tax purposes was,with total taxes due of.upon her death,defendant county of los angeles county reassessed the residence and increased its valuation for tax purposes to.it then issued a prorated supplemental tax bill for the tax year in the amount of.for the next three tax years,the county sent property tax bills of,respectively,and.pursuant to the terms of the trust,steinhart paid these bills.
on july,steinhart filed a claim with the los angeles county county auditor seeking a tax refund of in stating the reasons for her refund claim,she asserted that when she received a life estate interest in the residence,no change in ownership occurred within the meaning of section,subdivision a,to trigger reassessment.
steinhart later received five letters from the county auditor relating to the challenged tax bills,each dated march,and each stating the county has completed its review of your claim s for refund of taxes penalties you filed with us on december.your claim s was reviewed by the assessor.based on the documentation you submitted,they sic determined that your claim does not meet the provisions in the revenue and taxation code for granting a refund.for this reason,your claim s for refund is denied effective march.section of the state of california revenue and taxation code allows you six months from the effective date of denial of your claim s to commence an action in the superior court to seek judicial review of this denial.should you have any questions or need further assistance regarding this claim please contact the los angeles county property tax system at and press for the office of the assessor.steinhart also received a letter from the county assessor assessor dated march,stating that the reappraisal would stand because t he real property transfer is a change in ownership,as defined by law.the letter provided the name and telephone number of a person steinhart could contact i f she ha d questions.at the bottom,it also included the following notice this notice is your record of our action on your request for investigation.it is your responsibility to pay all billed tax installments.disputes involving the assessed value of your property should be formally addressed to the assessment appeals board at.if we have indicated that a correction is being made,you have days from the date of your corrected tax bill to file an appeal.
steinhart did not pursue the matter with the los angeles county assessment appeals board assessment appeals board.instead,on august,she filed an action against the county in superior court contesting the reassessment.she alleged that the county had erred in denying her refund claim because,under the terms of the trust,no change in ownership occurred upon helfrick death to trigger reassessment under section,subdivision a.by way of relief,steinhart sought recovery of the excess real property taxes she had paid on the residence for the years in question.she also requested a declaration that pursuant to the terms of the trust instrument,no change in ownership occurred as of the date of helfrick death,and hence,defendants were not legally authorized to tax the residence based on a reevaluation of the property as of the date of helfrick death.
the county responded by way of demurrer,asserting that the complaint failed to state a cause of action for the following reasons steinhart did not exhaust her administrative remedies before filing suit under revenue and taxation code section which defines a change in ownership as a transfer of a present interest in real property,including the beneficial use thereof,the value of which is substantially equal to the value of the fee interest,the transfer of a life estate to a third party constitutes a change in ownership under section,subdivision a and the court lacked power to issue the requested order for declaratory relief,because the requested order would,in violation of section,prevent or enjoin the collection of the tax.in opposition to the demurrer,steinhart argued the following because her claims present no issues of fact,and the reassessment is a nullity as a matter of law,she was not required to exhaust her administrative remedies the county is estopped from invoking the exhaustion doctrine,because the denial letters she received from the county led her to believe the next step in the review process was the filing of an action in superior court within six months of the county denial under pacific southwest realty county of los angeles cal th pacific southwest,no change in ownership occurred upon helfrick death and section is inapplicable because the complaint seeks a refund of paid taxes,not a prohibition against collection of future taxes.after hearing,the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,dismissed the complaint with prejudice,and ordered entry of judgment for the county 
on steinhart appeal,the court of appeal reversed.for two reasons,it first rejected the county reliance on the exhaustion doctrine steinhart claims present pure questions of law,not factual issues regarding the property valuation and the futility exception to the exhaustion requirement applies given the county unyielding position,both in the trial court and on appeal,that a change in ownership occurred the court next rejected the county reliance on section,finding the statute inapplicable because steinhart is seeking not to enjoin collection of future taxes,but to obtain a refund of taxes she has already paid.in other words,she is seeking a judicial declaration only in aid of obtaining a refund,a ruling from the court to the effect that no change in ownership occurred and therefore the county was not authorized to reassess the subject real property.on the merits,the court,relying on our decision in pacific southwest,found that no change in ownership occurred upon helfrick death.in reaching this conclusion,the court expressly disagreed with the decision in leckie county of orange th,which reached a different conclusion on analogous facts after finding the relevant discussion in pacific southwest to be dicta.
we then granted the county petition for review.
discussion 
as noted above,the county raises both procedural and substantive issues in opposition to plaintiff refund claim.we begin with the procedural issues whether plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies and,if so,whether that failure bars her action.
exhaustion of administrative remedies 
article xiii of the california constitution article xiii,which addresses taxation,specifies that t he county board of supervisors,or one or more assessment appeals boards created by the county board of supervisors,shall constitute the county board of equalization for a county.art.xiii.it further provides,with exceptions not applicable here,that the county board of equalization shall equalize the values of all property on the local assessment roll by adjusting individual assessments.ibid.as our courts have observed,in view of these provisions,a county board of equalization is a constitutional agency exercising powers.citation.international medication systems,assessment appeals bd.th,see also maples kern county assessment appeals bd.th,as a board of equalization,county assessment appeals board is a constitutional agency exercising powers delegated to it by the california constitution shell western e p,county of lake d,while sitting as a board of equalization,county board of supervisors is a constitutional agency exercising powers delegated to the agency by the constitution.
article xiii also specifies that t he legislature shall pass all laws necessary to carry out article xiii provisions.art.xiii.pursuant to this constitutional command,the legislature has statutorily established a process for handling challenges to property tax assessments and refund requests.the first step is the filing of an application for assessment reduction under section,subdivision a,which provides a reduction in an assessment on the local roll shall not be made unless the party affected or his or her agent makes and files with the county board of equalization a verified,written application showing the facts claimed to require the reduction and the applicant opinion of the full value of the property.the second step,which occurs after payment of the tax,is the filing of an administrative refund claim under section,subdivision a,which provides in relevant part that n o order for a refund shall be made except on the timely filing of a verified claim for refund.by statute,an application for assessment reduction filed under section also constitute s a sufficient claim for refund under section if it states that it is intended to constitute a claim for refund.if it does not so state,the applicant may thereafter and within the specified time period file a separate claim for refund of taxes extended on the assessment which the applicant applied to have reduced pursuant to s ection,subd.b.the third and final step in the process is the filing of an action in superior court pursuant to section,which provides that a person who paid the property tax may bring an action in superior court against a county or a city to recover a tax which the board of supervisors of the county or the city council of the city has refused to refund on a claim filed pursuant to article commencing with section of this chapter.a court action may not be commenced or maintained unless a claim for refund has first been filed pursuant to article commencing with section,subd.a.
as our prior decisions establish,the general rule in california is that a taxpayer seeking judicial relief from an erroneous assessment must exhaust his remedies before the administrative body empowered initially to correct the error.citations.nat.bk.county of cal d,holding that failure to apply to board of equalization for correction of allegedly erroneous assessment precludes action for recovery of taxes.in the property tax context,application of the exhaustion principle means that a taxpayer ordinarily may not file or pursue a court action for a tax refund without first applying to the local board of equalization for assessment reduction under section and filing an administrative tax refund claim under section.stenocord city of san francisco cal d,stenocord georgiev county of santa clara th.
our prior decisions also establish that,for purposes of the exhaustion requirement,the filing of a refund claim under section generally does not excuse a taxpayer failure first to file with the local board of equalization an application for assessment reduction under section for example,in stenocord,after receiving a notice of tax deficiency and demands for payment,the plaintiff,without applying to the local board of equalization for review,paid the taxes,filed a refund claim with the board of supervisors and,upon the claim rejection,filed a court action for recovery of the taxes paid.stenocord,supra,cal d at.applying the general rule that a taxpayer seeking relief from an erroneous assessment must exhaust available administrative remedies before resorting to the courts id.at,we held that the plaintiff failure to seek review before the board of equalization barred the plaintiff refund action id.at.in reaching this conclusion,we rejected the plaintiff contention that its filing of a refund claim with the board of supervisors satisfied the exhaustion requirement.id.at see also plaza hollister.partnership county of san benito th,refund process is distinct from the process of seeking a reduced assessment by filing an application for equalization sunrise retirement villa dear th,failure to file application will usually result in the dismissal of the refund suit for failure to exhaust an available administrative remedy osco drug,county of orange d,discussing distinction between the reduction in a value pursuant to and a right to a refund of taxes.
in this case,it is undisputed that steinhart skipped step one of the statutory process,she did not file an application for assessment reduction under section,subdivision a,with the assessment appeals board,which acts as the county board of equalization.instead,she went straight to step two,filing a refund claim with the county.she argues,however,that for three reasons she may proceed with her lawsuit notwithstanding her failure to apply for assessment reduction.relying on stenocord and foods,quinn cal d,she first asserts that because her claim involves no disputed facts regarding valuation and presents a pure question of law whether there was a change in ownership within the meaning of section,subdivision a exhaustion of administrative remedies was unnecessary.she next invokes the futility exception to the exhaustion principle,arguing that applying for assessment reduction in this case would have been futile given the county steadfast and unyielding position a t the trial court level,before the court of appeal,and before this court,that a change in ownership occurred here.third,and finally,she argues that the county failure to indicate in any of its correspondence that she had to apply for assessment reduction before seeking judicial relief estops the county from relying on her failure to exhaust administrative remedies.as explained below,none of these arguments has merit.
under the governing statutes,steinhart had to apply for assessment reduction even though her claim presents a pure question of law.
as noted above,in arguing that exhaustion was unnecessary because her claim presents a pure question of law,steinhart relies on stenocord and.in the latter,the county assessor,in assessing the taxpayer leasehold interests,refused to apply a statute requiring certain deductions,believing that the statute was unconstitutional,supra,cal d at.without applying for assessment reduction,the taxpayer petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandate ordering the assessor to cancel the assessments and reassess the leasehold interests in accordance with the statute.ibid.in disagreeing that the taxpayer failure to apply for assessment reduction precluded its court action,we first noted that assessment reduction applications had not been required in certain cases where the facts were undisputed and the property assessed was citations,outside the jurisdiction citation,or nonexistent citations.id.at.we next explained the necessity of an application for assessment reduction is properly determined by the nature of the issues in dispute,and not by whether an assessment is attacked in part or in toto.citations.the only substantive issue in the present case is whether section is unconstitutional on its face.as in cases involving only the question whether property is taxable,there is no question of valuation that the local board of equalization had special competence to decide.there is no dispute as to the facts and no possibility that action by the board might avoid the necessity of deciding the constitutional issue or modify its nature.citation.under the circumstances,therefore,recourse to the local board of equalization was not required before seeking a judicial determination of the constitutionality of section.id.at.although rejecting the exhaustion claim,we nevertheless held that mandate relief was unavailable because the taxpayer had a plain,speedy,and adequate remedy at law paying its taxes under protest and suing for recovery thereof id.at.
ten years later,in stenocord,we held that a taxpayer failure to apply for assessment reduction barred the taxpayer court action for a tax refund,in which the taxpayer alleged that the assessor had improperly found an understatement in the taxpayer cost of goods.stenocord,supra,cal d at.in reaching our conclusion,we noted that a n exception to the exhaustion requirement is made when the assessment is a nullity as a matter of law because,for example,the property is tax exempt,nonexistent or outside the jurisdiction citations,and no factual questions exist regarding the valuation of the property which,upon review by the board of equalization,might be resolved in the taxpayer favor,thereby making further litigation unnecessary citations.id.at.we found,however,that the exception was inapplicable,notwithstanding the taxpayer assertion that the assessor lacked statutory authority to reassess the property and that the reassessment was arbitrary and unconstitutional.ibid.we explained the fact that the assessor erroneously overvalues property which is otherwise subject to tax does not render the assessment a nullity under the foregoing rule,for disputes regarding valuation are within the special competence of the board of equalization.citations.if any question of valuation exists,it would be irrelevant that plaintiff also challenges the assessment as arbitrary or void on constitutional grounds.citations.if prior recourse to the board on the question of valuation might have avoided the necessity of deciding the constitutional issue,or modified its nature,plaintiff action was properly dismissed.citation.it is evident from the face of the complaint that the dispute herein involved a question of valuation which,if submitted to the board of equalization,might have obviated the taxpayer action.id.at.
steinhart argues that under and stenocord,exhaustion was unnecessary here because the assessment is a nullity as a matter of law and there is no question of valuation the assessment appeals board has special competence to decide,no dispute as to the relevant facts,and no possibility that the assessment appeals board action might avoid the necessity of a court having to decide the interpretation issue,whether a change in ownership occurred.the county responds that under stenocord,because the property here is not tax exempt,nonexistent,or outside the jurisdiction,the assessment is not a nullity as a matter of law and the exception to the exhaustion rule does not apply.
we need not choose between these divergent interpretations of our precedents because,as the county alternatively argues,since we issued the cited decisions,the legislature has expressly and definitively settled the exhaustion question insofar as it involves a challenge to a change in ownership determination.in,the legislature enacted what is now section,subdivision a,which provides in relevant part the county board of equalization shall hear applications for a reduction in an assessment in cases in which the issue is whether or not property has been subject to a change in ownership,as defined in chapter commencing with section of part added by stats,ch,italics added.in detailing the purpose of this section,the relevant legislative history explained the law is currently unclear if taxpayers can appeal the issue of whether or not there has been a change in ownership to either a county board of equalization or an assessment appeals board.this provision requires county boards of equalization and assessment appeals boards to hear change in ownership issues.assem.com.on,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.thus,section,subdivision a,expressly vests county boards with jurisdiction to adjudicate change in ownership disputes between assessors and taxpayers and contemplates that such disputes will be resolved by the local appeals board before resort is made to the courts.sunrise retirement villa dear,supra,th at.
subsequent legislative developments make crystal clear the legislature intent to bar taxpayers from challenging change in ownership determinations in court if they fail first to apply to their local board of equalization for assessment reduction,even if their challenge presents a pure question of law involving undisputed facts.in,a bill was introduced in the legislature that would have conditioned the requirement that a local board of equalization hear a change in ownership dispute upon a request by an applicant for assessment reduction bill reg.sess.as introduced,and would have specified that,to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to such disputes,taxpayers must merely file a refund claim and need not apply for assessment reduction.according to the legislative history,the bill proponents argued that change in ownership issues,often being issues of law,are not appropriately handled by assessment appeals boards.tax,analysis of bill reg.sess.counties objected to the bill,complaining that taxpayers should not be able to jump over the assessment appeals board and go directly to court if they thought it would maximize their chances of prevailing.id.at.the bill did not pass.
instead,the next year,the legislature passed a new provision expressly confirming the requirement that a taxpayer apply for assessment reduction in order to exhaust administrative remedies,but specifying that the filing with the county board of equalization of a stipulation by the taxpayer and the county assessor stating that issues in dispute do not involve valuation questions,and the board acceptance of the stipulation with or without conducting a hearing,shall be deemed compliance with this requirement,subd.b,as added by stats,ch.at the same time,the legislature specified that n othing in the new provision shall be construed to deprive the county board of equalization of jurisdiction over nonvaluation issues in the absence of a contrary stipulation,subd.c,as added by stats,ch.these statutes and their legislative history show that the legislature has made an express and considered decision not to eliminate the requirement that taxpayers wanting to contest change in ownership determinations first apply for assessment reduction to exhaust their administrative remedies.accordingly,we need not consider whether a judicially declared exception to the exhaustion requirement is warranted under or stenocord,which predated the relevant statutes.a contrary conclusion would improperly negate the carefully crafted statutory scheme the legislature has,within its constitutional authority,put in place.thus,by failing to apply for assessment reduction,steinhart failed to exhaust her administrative remedies 
b.the futility exception to the exhaustion requirement is inapplicable.
steinhart alternatively argues that the futility exception to the exhaustion requirement applies given the legal position the county has steadfastly asserted a t the trial court level,before the court of appeal,and before this court.in this regard,she echoes the analysis of the court of appeal,which explained a t the trial court level and on appeal,the county continues to assert that as a matter of law,the transfer of a life estate from her late sister constitutes a change in ownership.in view of the county unyielding position on this legal issue,an administrative challenge by steinhart certainly would have been futile.
on the record here,the futility exception is inapplicable.as we have explained,f utility is a narrow exception to the general rule requiring exhaustion of remedies.sea sage audubon society,planning com.cal d.the exception applies only if the party invoking it can positively state that the administrative agency has declared what its ruling will be in a particular case.ibid.applying these principles,in george arakelian farms,agricultural labor relations bd.cal d,we refused to apply the futility exception where nothing in the record indicated that,at the time that a request for administrative review would have been timely,the administrative agency had predetermined its position as to the issue in question.similarly,nothing in the record here indicates that,at the time an application for assessment reduction would have been timely,the county assessment appeals board had predetermined its position as to whether a change in ownership had occurred contrary to steinhart argument and the court of appeal analysis,the position the county took in the subsequent court action steinhart filed is insufficient alone to invoke the futility exception thus,the futility exception does not apply to excuse steinhart failure to file an application for assessment reduction.
c.the county is not estopped from relying on steinhart failure to exhaust remedies.
reviving an argument the court of appeal did not address,steinhart argues that the notices she received from the county regarding her refund claim estop the county from relying on her failure to exhaust her administrative remedies by applying to the assessment appeals board for assessment reduction.she relies principally on the five notices from the county auditor,all dated march,march notices,which stated in relevant part the county has completed its review of your claim s for refund of taxes penalties you filed with us on december.your claim s was reviewed by the assessor.based on the documentation you submitted,they sic determined that your claim does not meet the provisions in the revenue and taxation code for granting a refund.for this reason,your claim s for refund is denied effective march.section of the state of california revenue and taxation code allows you six months from the effective date of denial of your claim s to commence an action in the superior court to seek judicial review of this denial.from this language,steinhart argues,i t appeared that the county had spoken,and its word was that her claim had been denied,and pursuant to the applicable claim for refund statutory scheme,she had six months in which to commence an action in the superior court.moreover,steinhart asserts,nothing in these notices or in the notice from the county assessor dated march,march notice advised her that she should have proceeded by a request for equalization under section rather than a claim for refund under section,or that prior to filing her action in the superior court within six months of the denial of her refund claim,she must first seek equalization by the assessment appeals board.estoppel applies,steinhart contends,because in filing her civil action without first applying for assessment reduction,she relied on the advice given by the county in these notices.
as we have explained,t he doctrine of equitable estoppel is founded on concepts of equity and fair dealing.strong county of santa cruz cal d.the essence of an estoppel is that the party to be estopped has by false language or conduct led another to do that which he or she would not otherwise have done and as a result thereof that he or she has suffered injury.citation.state compensation ins.fund workers comp.appeals bd.cal d.the doctrine ordinarily will not apply against a governmental body except in unusual instances when necessary to avoid grave injustice and when the result will not defeat a strong public policy.citations.hughes board of architectural examiners cal th.
on the undisputed facts here,steinhart estoppel argument fails as a matter of law.see cal.cigarette concessions city of cal d,when the facts are undisputed,the existence of an estoppel is a question of law.as we long ago explained in mckeen naughton cal,in order to work an estoppel,a representation must generally be a statement of fact.it can rarely happen that the statement of a proposition of law will conclude the party making it from denying its correctness,except when it is understood to mean nothing but a simple statement of fact.citation.in mckeen,we applied this principle to reject the claim that a party opposition to a motion to dismiss an appeal for lack of jurisdiction estopped the party from later arguing that the judgment rendered upon that appeal was void for lack of jurisdiction.we explained every fact in connection with the attempted taking of the appeal was within the knowledge of the party who moved for the appeal dismissal,and being chargeable with a knowledge of the law,neither he nor the appellant here,who stands in his place,can be heard to say that he was deceived by any contention of the party who opposed the appeal dismissal in the earlier action,as to the law governing appeals from justices courts,and involved in the decision of that motion.ibid.similarly,in this case,every fact in connection with steinhart challenge to the county reassessment was within steinhart knowledge.indeed,steinhart does not identify any fact that was unknown to her instead,she asserts she was ignorant of the law that required her to apply to the assessment appeals board for assessment reduction before filing a refund action in court,and she claims the county letters misled her regarding this legal requirement.
it is also significant that steinhart,in filing and pursuing her tax refund claim,was represented by counsel in general,the law particularly disfavors estoppels where the party attempting to raise the estoppel is represented by an attorney at law.kunstman mirizzi d.for purposes of analyzing estoppel claims,attorneys are charged with knowledge of the law in california.tubbs southern cal.rapid transit dist.cal d,rejecting claim of estoppel to assert statute of limitations.moreover,steinhart counsel concedes that before filing this action in court on steinhart behalf,he actually read the applicable claim for refund statutory scheme.then,as now,that statutory scheme included section,subdivision b,which,as already explained,expressly references the requirement that the taxpayer appl y for reduction under chapter commencing with section of part in order to exhaust administrative remedies.steinhart counsel also concedes that before filing this action,he read our decision in pacific southwest.there,in recounting that litigation procedural history,we explained plaintiff paid tax bills pursuant to the increased valuation but applied for a reduction of the assessment,which it later amended into a claim for refund under revenue and taxation code section,subdivision b.pacific southwest,supra,cal th at,italics added.as already explained,section,subdivision b,provides a taxpayer with two ways to file a proper refund claim stating in an application for a reduction in an assessment filed pursuant to section that the application is intended to constitute a claim for refund or after applying for assessment reduction,fil ing a separate claim for refund of taxes extended on the assessment which applicant applied to have reduced pursuant to section or section.under the circumstances,steinhart is clearly chargeable with the knowledge that the law required her to apply to the assessment appeals board for assessment reduction before filing a refund action in court.and,as we long ago explained,one who acts with full knowledge of plain provisions of law and their probable effect on facts within his or her knowledge,especially where represented by counsel,may claim neither ignorance of the true facts nor detrimental reliance on the conduct of the person claimed to be estopped,two of the essential elements of equitable estoppel.cal.cigarette,supra,cal d at.
finally,it is significant that the notices on which steinhart bases her estoppel claim were,at most,ambiguous and confusing regarding steinhart need to apply to the assessment appeals board for assessment reduction.it is true,as steinhart observes,that the march notices,after advising that the county auditor had rejected her refund claims,stated section of the state of california revenue and taxation code allows you six months from the effective date of denial of your claim s to commence an action in the superior court to seek judicial review of this denial.however,neither this statement,which simply advised steinhart of the applicable statute of limitations,nor anything else in the march notices affirmatively represented that there were no other prerequisites to filing a court action or that steinhart had met all other prerequisites.at best,this is but one possible interpretation that arguably could be read into the accurate advisement regarding the applicable statute of limitations.see honig san francisco planning th,no estoppel where notice that referred only to statutory filing requirement,and was silent regarding statutory service requirements,did not indicate that timely filing of a petition would be sufficient to obtain judicial review,did not purport to address the requirements for serving the petition,and did not state that failure to comply with any service requirements would be excused beresford neighborhood city of san mateo d,same.it is also true,as steinhart observes,that the county assessor march notice,after advising that d isputes involving the assessed value of your property should be formally addressed to the assessment appeals board,stated if we have indicated that a correction is being made,you have days from the date of your corrected tax bill to file an appeal.however,like her reading of the march notices,steinhart reading of these the latter specified the only factual circumstances under which review by the assessment appeals board was required,and the former was not relevant because no correction was being but one possible interpretation that arguably could be adopted.it is at least equally,if not more,plausible to read the former statement as a general advisement that all disputes involving the assessed value of property must be brought before the assessment appeals board,and the latter statement as addressing only one kind of dispute subject to this requirement.of course,steinhart disagreement with the county assessor determination clearly qualified as a d ispute involving the assessed value of the property.that the notices did not clearly indicate steinhart could file a court action without first taking her dispute to the assessment appeals board weighs against a finding of estoppel.as we have explained,where a party asserts estoppel,the facts proved must be such that an estoppel is clearly deducible from them citation.the representation,whether by word or act,to justify a prudent man in acting upon it,must be plain,not doubtful or matter of questionable inference.certainty is essential to all estoppels.citation.wheaton insurance cal.
taking all of the circumstances into consideration,we conclude that steinhart estoppel claim fails as a matter of law.
ii.there was a change in ownership within the meaning of article xiii a,section,subdivision a.
in the past,we have elected to address the merits of issues that raised important questions of public policy,despite a party failure to exhaust administrative remedies.lindeleaf agricultural labor relations bd.cal d.here,the county asks us to reach the change in ownership issue notwithstanding steinhart failure to exhaust administrative remedies,and both the parties and numerous amici curiae have fully briefed the issue.given these circumstances and the importance of the question presented to taxing agencies,state and local governments,and those whose property interests may be subject to taxation,we now address the merits of the substantive issue the parties raise,despite steinhart failure to exhaust her administrative remedies.connolly county of orange cal th,addressing merits of issue,notwithstanding procedural obstacles,b ecause of the importance of the questions presented in this matter to taxing agencies,local government,and school districts,and the individual and institutions whose property interests may be subject to taxation.
regarding that issue,our task is to effectuate the voters intent in adopting article xiii citations.city and county of san francisco county of san mateo cal th.in performing this task,we look first to the words of the provision in question,giving them their natural and ordinary meaning,unless it appears they were used in some technical sense.ibid see also thompson department of corrections cal th,itt world communications,city and county of san francisco cal d,board of supervisors lonergan cal d.the words used in a constitutional provision must be taken in the ordinary and common acceptation,because they are presumed to have been so understood by the framers and by the people who adopted the provision.kaiser hopkins cal d.
as noted above,the constitutional provision here in xiii a,section,subdivision a provides in relevant part that,in applying the percent limit on ad valorem taxes,a property full cash value means the county assessor valuation of real property as shown on the tax bill under full cash value or,thereafter,the appraised value of real property when a change in ownership has occurred after the assessment.thus,the substantive question before us is whether a change in ownership within the meaning of this provision occurred upon helfrick death.for reasons that follow,we hold it did.
the starting point for our conclusion lies in the fact that,during her lifetime,helfrick transferred the residence to a trust of which she was the sole present beneficiary and as to which she held the power to revoke.under general principles of trust law,trust beneficiaries hold the equitable estate or beneficial interest in property held in trust and are regarded as the real owner s of that property.title ins.trust duffill cal,duffill.the trustee is merely the depositary of the legal title to the property ibid.the legal estate the trustee holds is no more than the shadow following the equitable estate,at.moreover,p roperty transferred to,or held in,a revocable inter vivos trust is deemed the property of the settlor zanelli mcgrath th,italics added see also arluk medical center industrial group,dobler th,a settlor with the power to revoke a living trust effectively retains full ownership and control over any property transferred to the trust.any interest that beneficiaries of a revocable trust have in trust property is merely potential and can evaporate in a moment at the whim of the settlor.johnson kotyck th,see also nat.bank of los angeles wellslager d,settlor with revocation power retain s the power and control of the trust estate and can with a stroke of the pen divest the beneficiaries of their interest.thus,although transferring legal title to the residence to herself as trustee,helfrick,as sole trust beneficiary and holder of the revocation power,continued to hold the entire equitable estate personally and effectively retained full ownership of the residence any interest steinhart or her siblings or their issue had in the residence under the terms of the trust was merely potential,and could have evaporated in a moment at helfrick whim.under these circumstances,it can not be said that the transfer of bare legal title to helfrick as trustee constituted a change in ownership within the meaning of article xiii a,and no one contends otherwise.
upon helfrick death,the trust became irrevocable and the entire equitable estate in the residence,which helfrick had personally held during her lifetime,transferred from helfrick to steinhart and her siblings or their issue as beneficiaries of the irrevocable trust.see empire properties county of los angeles th,upon settlor death,revocable trust became irrevocable and the full beneficial interests in the property transferred to the residual beneficiaries of the trust.it is true that,under the terms of the trust,the beneficial estate in the residence was divided among steinhart,who,as life tenant,held the right to immediate possession,and steinhart siblings or their issue,who held only a remainder interest in any net proceeds that might someday be realized from sale of the residence after steinhart death.but that circumstance does not alter the fact that,upon helfrick death,the entire equitable estate in the residence was transferred from helfrick to,collectively,steinhart and her siblings or their issue as beneficiaries of the irrevocable trust.in other words,upon helfrick death,real ownership of the,as explained above,follows the equitable from helfrick to steinhart and her siblings or their issue as beneficiaries of the irrevocable trust.for purposes of section,subdivision a,this transfer constituted a change in ownership within the common and ordinary understanding of that phrase 
to the extent the constitutional language,as applied to the facts of this case,is ambiguous,the conclusion that a change in ownership occurred here under section,subdivision a,is consistent with the interpretive aids we use to resolve ambiguities in article xiii a language the proposition ballot materials the voters received and contemporaneous constructions by the legislature and administrative agencies charged with article xiii a implementation.amador valley joint union high school dist.state bd.of equalization cal d,amador see also city and county of san francisco county of san mateo,supra,cal th at.regarding the former,in the ballot pamphlet for proposition,the legislative analyst explained that under the measure,a property assessed value could be increased by no more than percent per year as long as the same taxpayer continued to own the property.ballot,primary june,analysis of by legis.analyst,italics added.here,upon helfrick death,when all of the beneficial estate in her residence was transferred,helfrick unquestionably did not continue to own the property.ibid.thus,the explanation the voters received regarding article xiii a effect fully supports the conclusion that a change in ownership occurred here under section,subdivision a,such that the assessed value of the residence could be increased by more than percent.
likewise supporting this conclusion is the contemporaneous construction of article xiii a by the legislature and administrative agencies charged with the article implementation.as our prior decisions explain,the year after article xiii a passage,the legislature adopted a statutory framework for implementing it.see pacific southwest,supra,cal th at.that framework includes section,which provides the following overarching definition pacific southwest,supra,at of change in ownership under section,subdivision a a transfer of a present interest in real property,including the beneficial use thereof,the value of which is substantially equal to the value of the fee interest.section then elaborates on this definition by setting forth a list of specific transfers that constitute a change in ownership,as defined in section,e xcept as otherwise provided in section.as here relevant,section,subdivision h,provides that change in ownership,as defined in section,includes a ny interests in real property that vest in persons other than the trustor or,pursuant to section,his or her spouse when a revocable trust becomes irrevocable.complementing this provision,section,subdivision d,provides that a c hange in ownership shall not include a ny transfer by the trustor into a trust for so long as the transferor is the present beneficiary of the trust,or the trust is revocable the legislature adopted these provisions upon the recommendation of a task force it specially created to study and implement article xiii a change in ownership provision,section,subdivision a.pacific southwest,supra,at.in proposing these provisions,the task force explained revocable living trusts are merely a substitute for a will.the gifts over to persons other than the trustor are contingent the trust can be revoked or those beneficiaries may predecease the trustor.transfers into trust are not changes in ownership if either a the trust is revocable,or b the creator of the trust is its sole beneficiary during his lifetime.if the trust is revocable it is excluded because the rights conferred are contingent.if the trustor is the sole beneficiary during his lifetime,his retained interest is considered to be substantially equivalent in value to the fee interest in any real property covered by the trust.he is therefore the true owner and the change in ownership does not occur until the property passes to the remaindermen on the trustor death.assem.tax,task force on prop.tax administration,task force report.
the state board of equalization,through an implementing regulation,has also expressly addressed section,subdivision a application to transactions involving trusts.that regulation begins by stating a g eneral r ule that,for purposes of section,subdivision a,t he transfer by the trustor of real property into a trust is a change in ownership at the time of the transfer,tit,subd.a.the regulation then specifies a list of e xceptions to the general transfers involving trusts that do not constitute changes in ownership including,as here relevant t he transfer of real property by the trustor to a trust in which the is the sole present beneficiary of the trust,subd.b a and t he transfer of real property by the trustor to a trust which is revocable by the trustor,subd.b regarding revocable trusts,the regulation further provides that a change in ownership does occur at the time the revocable trust becomes irrevocable unless the remains or becomes the sole present beneficiary or unless otherwise excluded from change in ownership,subd.b.
we generally accord great weight to the statutes the legislature has passed and the regulations the state board of equalization has promulgated to implement article xiii amador,supra,cal d at.under both the express language of,and the underlying justification for,section,subdivision h,section,subdivision d,and the administrative regulation discussed above,it is clear that upon helfrick death,a change in ownership under section,subdivision a,occurred in this case.notably,steinhart does not even argue otherwise,conceding in her brief that under a literal application of section,subdivision h language,a change in ownership occurred when helfrick died,the revocable trust became irrevocable,and her steinhart life estate vested.
instead,steinhart argues,and the court of appeal held,that insofar as these provisions define a change in ownership to include the transfer that occurred upon helfrick death,they are in conflict with,and therefore trumped by,section superseding general definition of change in ownership.in making this argument,steinhart relies on our conclusion in pacific southwest,supra,cal th at page,that the examples sections and set forth were intended to be derivative or explanatory,and not to conflict with section general rule,and that courts are constrained to avoid constructions of those sections that would render meaningless section preeminent command.she also relies on our discussion in pacific southwest,supra,at page,of whether a change in ownership occurs under section,subdivision a,upon the conveyance of fee simple from parent to child subject to the reservation of a life estate.after noting that the legislature had expressly included such transfers in section list of examples of exempt transfers via section,subdivision e we stated but even if the legislature had not done so,reassessment would be barred under the carefully drafted basic test of section,not only because the beneficial use would not have transferred,but also because the value of each divided interest in the estate would not approach that of a fee.a purchaser of the reserved estate would be buying a life estate per autre freehold estate,to be sure,but an estate of questionable value because subject to complete defeasance at an unknown time.rare is the mortgagee willing to lend
