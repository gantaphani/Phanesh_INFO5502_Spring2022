charles behm has been a lawyer in this state since.he is currently suspended from the practice of law as a result of professional misconduct in another bar discipline case the referee in this case recommends that behm be found guilty of professional misconduct related to trust account violations and failure to file income tax returns since the time he became a lawyer 
as a lawyer admitted to the practice of law by this court,behm earned money from the practice of law.behm asserts,however,that he is not required to pay federal income taxes because his time was his life capital and,in practicing law,he was trading his life capital for an hourly fee,both of equal value.this argument is devoid of merit and lacks any basis in established law.
with regard to behm failure to file income tax returns from to the present,our recent admonition in another bar discipline case resounds here no doubt there are millions of americans who would prefer not to have to deal with filing and paying their federal income taxes each april,but have no choice under the law.as guardians of the law,lawyers have a special obligation to honor the law themselves,including the tax laws.bar del pino,so d.
we approve the referee recommendations of guilt but disapprove the recommendation of a suspension because it is far too lenient.behm continuing disregard for the laws requiring 
id.emphasis added see also lonsdale united states,cir listing arguments that are completely lacking in legal merit and patently frivolous,including the arguments that wages are not income,that the income tax is voluntary,that the term income as used in the tax statutes is unconstitutionally vague and indefinite,and that no statutory authority exists for imposing an income tax on individuals.
hyslep and lonsdale were both decided well before behm stopped filing returns and paying income taxes.as a member of the bar trained in legal research,behm could have and should have researched the law in this area rather than adopting unsupported and discredited theories.
behm argument that he may refuse to comply with an obligation imposed by law upon a good faith belief that no valid obligation exists without violating rule has its limits.where the claim asserted has been decisively rejected by the courts,the attorney can no longer maintain that his assertion of the claim is made in good faith and is not frivolous.in florida bar committe,so d,we stated 
neither the bar nor this court wishes to stifle innovative claims by attorneys.nevertheless,under the rules of professional conduct,the pursuit of imaginative claims is not without limit.the standard embodied in rule,requiring a argument for the extension,modification,or reversal of existing law,is broad enough to encompass those cases where the claims are the result of innovative theories rather than,as here,an obsessive attempt to relitigate an issue that has failed decisively numerous times.the federal court in this case specifically found this claim to be frivolous and malicious.
id.at quoting.bar richardson,so d,see also.bar bailey,so d,stating that an attorney is not permitted to ignore and refuse to follow a court order based upon his personal belief in the invalidity of that order and that to countenance that course would be to court pandemonium and a breakdown of the judicial system.
finally,the internal revenue code contains provisions that allow a taxpayer who disputes his legal obligation to file or pay taxes to do so through alternate means.see,supp.to the extent behm truly believed that the money he earned through the practice of law was not income,he could have used these alternate procedures to obtain a definitive ruling.
accordingly,we reject behm argument that he can not be found guilty of violating the rules regulating the florida bar because he has or had a good faith belief that he was not obligated to file federal tax returns or pay federal income taxes.
the recommendations of guilt 
in this case,the referee recommends that behm be found guilty of violating rules and c.rule provides,in pertinent part,that the commission by a lawyer of any act that is unlawful or contrary to honesty and justice,whether the act is committed in the course of the attorney relations as an attorney or otherwise,whether committed within or outside the state of florida,and whether or not the act is a felony or misdemeanor,may constitute a cause for discipline.emphasis added.rule c prohibits an attorney from engag ing in conduct involving dishonesty,fraud,deceit,or misrepresentation.emphasis added.
the recommendations of guilt are adequately supported by the referee findings in this case.the referee expressly found that behm failure to file either personal or business federal income tax returns from through was unlawful and that his failure to pay federal income taxes,either personal or business,was unlawful.the referee noted that behm has not been charged with any crime relating to his failure to pay income taxes or to file income tax returns,but that his failures to file and pay were nevertheless unlawful.the fact that behm was not charged or prosecuted for his conduct is not inconsistent with the referee finding that behm conduct was unlawful and his recommendations that behm be found guilty of violating rules and c.
we reject behm argument that he can not be prosecuted by the florida bar for violations of the rules regulating the florida bar because he has not been prosecuted criminally for tax fraud or evasion.rule expressly allows the bar to initiate disciplinary action regardless of whether the respondent has been tried,acquitted,or convicted in a court for the alleged criminal offense.this language makes it clear that a disciplinary violation premised on a violation of law is separate from the initiation or outcome of criminal proceedings based on the same conduct.
behm argument that he can not be found to have violated the rules at issue without an express finding of intent is also without merit.while this court has held that in order to sustain a violation of rule c,the bar must prove intent,this court has also stated that the intent element can be satisfied merely by showing that the conduct was deliberate or knowing.bar brown,so d,see also.bar riggs,so d,holding intent,as an element for disciplining an attorney for engaging in conduct involving dishonesty,fraud,deceit,or misrepresentation,is proven by establishing that the conduct was deliberate or knowing.bar barley,so d,same.bar fredericks,so d,same.
there is no question that behm deliberately and knowingly decided not to file income tax returns or to pay income taxes during the years in question.
this is sufficient to satisfy the intent element of these rules.
the sanction 
neither behm nor the bar petitioned for review of the referee recommended sanction however,in reviewing a referee recommended discipline,this court scope of review is broader than that afforded to the referee findings of fact because ultimately it is this court responsibility to order the appropriate sanction.see.bar anderson,so d,see also art.v.const.
after reviewing the record in this case,the referee report,and the briefs before this court,the court determined that the recommended sanction of what would amount to a suspension appeared too lenient and,accordingly,requested responses from both behm and the bar as to whether the sanction imposed against behm should be significantly increased up to and including disbarment.because of the seriousness of the misconduct,the court scheduled oral argument,specifically directing behm to appear.the court issued a second order to show cause after oral argument,directing the bar and behm to show cause as to why behm should not be permanently disbarred.in deciding the appropriate sanction in this case,we have considered all responses filed by the bar and behm.
a s a starting point,we look to the florida standards for imposing lawyer sanctions this court must also review existing case law to determine whether there is a basis for the recommended discipline.brown,so d at.standard of the florida standards for imposing lawyer sanctions provides that disbarment is appropriate when a lawyer engages in intentional conduct involving dishonesty,fraud,deceit,or misrepresentation that seriously adversely reflects on the lawyer fitness to practice.standard provides that disbarment is appropriate when a lawyer intentionally engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed as a professional with the intent to obtain a benefit for the lawyer or another,and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a client,the public,or the legal system.both of these standards clearly apply to behm misconduct.
we have also reviewed our prior cases involving failure to file income tax returns.in florida bar del pino,the most recent case with a somewhat similar fact pattern,we imposed a suspension on a respondent who was convicted of two felonies.so d at.one of the respondent convictions was for filing a false motion for extension to file and pay taxes in which she swore that she believed she owed no tax when she had earned significant income in the applicable year.id.at.the respondent testified that she filed the false motion so she would not have to deal with it.id.we agreed with the referee that this was a selfish motive.id.we expressly noted that but for the significant mitigation in that case,the sanction would have been disbarment.id.at.we also noted that we have frequently disciplined attorneys for failing to live up to the duty of every citizen to pay federal income taxes.id.at citing.bar smith,so d,suspending an attorney for three years for tax evasion and other misconduct where the attorney had underreported his income due to financial pressures and an inability to pay the full tax owed,but recognizing that the court will not hesitate to disbar attorneys who knowingly and willfully engage in the felonious conduct of filing or assisting in filing fraudulent income tax returns.bar nedick,so d,disbarring an attorney based on a conviction for attempting to evade or defeat tax in violation of federal law see also.bar weed,so d,suspending an attorney for three years for,among other things,failing to file income tax returns for four years,and recognizing that a failure to file tax returns amounts to engaging in illegal conduct involving moral turpitude.bar hosner,so d,disbarring an attorney after he was convicted of mail fraud and felony charges of assisting in the preparation of false income tax returns.
here,behm has engaged in a lengthy course of conduct to impede and obstruct the collection of income taxes on his own income,for his own personal gain.in this instance,however,our prior cases sanctioning lawyers for failing to file income tax returns or to pay income taxes provide only limited guidance because we are,for the first time,presented with a lawyer who declared at oral argument before this court that he fully intends to maintain his current course of conduct,he will continue to not file federal income tax returns and to not pay federal income taxes on money he earns in his law practice,apparently until someone shows him a more definitive law or united states supreme court opinion that disabuses him of his faulty beliefs such a stance is anathema to an attorney ethical obligation to respect and obey the law.
in fact,in his response to the court order for additional briefing on the appropriate sanction for the misconduct,behm stated 
lawyers are sworn to protect the constitution and to uphold the law.any ethical lawyer is obligated to question that which appears to be a transgression of the law,the misapplication of a law,or the lack of liability for a duty presumed imposed under a law.a lawyer has an ethical obligation to assist in improving the legal system.thus,a lawyer has not only a right,but a duty to advocate and advance arguments of law that are unique or unconventional so long as there is a reasonable basis for the argument.behm has done just this.he has cited to specific sections of the internal revenue code and to united states supreme court cases that have never been overturned or modified to show that behm position has both a reasonable and a very sound basis in the law.
however,the state of the law in this area could not,in our opinion,be any clearer.it is completely unacceptable for a member of the florida bar to continue to assert legal theories that have been repeatedly rejected and discredited and to use them as an excuse for engaging in unlawful conduct 
while a lawyer,on behalf of a client or even on his own behalf,may raise any legal argument that he deems supported by law,he may not use his own unsupported interpretation of the laws to place himself above the law.we view behm actions to be a violation of his basic ethical obligation as a lawyer and his intentional actions to be flagrant violations of the rules regulating the florida bar.
we have considered whether there is any mitigation that would alter our decision as to a sanction.the referee found that behm had personal or emotional problems based on the fact that multiple members of behm family were killed in a traffic accident in which behm was also involved.the referee also found physical disability or impairment based on the fact that behm sustained multiple injuries in this traffic accident.in reviewing the basis for these findings in the record,we note that behm included a transcript in his appendix to one of his briefs from the personal injury case in which he mentions that he had to bury his family.he introduced the of a physician stating that he was treating behm for depression.there was no testimony by behm correlating his losses from this traffic accident to his tax behavior.we do not consider this mitigation evidence which behm does not even argue on review sufficient to alter our assessment of the severity of the misconduct in this case.
furthermore,in determining a proper sanction,the court also takes the three purposes of lawyer discipline into consideration.
first,the judgment must be fair to society,both in terms of protecting the public from unethical conduct and at the same time not denying the public the services of a qualified lawyer as a result of undue harshness in imposing penalty.second,the judgment must be fair to the respondent,being sufficient to punish a breach of ethics and at the same time encourage reformation and rehabilitation.third,the judgment must be severe enough to deter others who might be prone or tempted to become involved in like violations.

behm began his practice as a lawyer as an assistant state attorney and from that point in time proceeded to violate the law by failing to file income tax returns.he also has a history of discipline,including a public reprimand in as a result of conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in a probate matter and a suspension from the practice of law for his conduct in a guardianship proceeding that raised serious issues concerning his fitness to practice law.see supra note.in that case,florida bar behm,case no,behm filed a guardianship petition alleging that his client elderly mother was incompetent.behm improper behavior extended to allowing the taping of a telephone conversation between his client and his client elderly mother during which behm coached his client concerning which questions to ask and engaged in conduct that the referee termed inappropriate and reprehensible.the referee further found that behm allowed his client to obtain the mother signature on a durable power of attorney even as he was arguing that the mother was incompetent.the referee also found that behm engaged in improper and harassing conduct toward opposing counsel.
in the case currently under consideration,he has openly declared his intention at oral argument to persist in refusing to file income tax returns u nless the law changes or unless someone can show me a law that makes me clearly liable for income tax,for federal income tax.see supra note.by his own voluntary actions,behm has forfeited his privilege to practice law.
the only appropriate sanction under these misconduct and a persistent course of unrepentant permanent disbarment from the practice of law.
conclusion 
we approve the referee
