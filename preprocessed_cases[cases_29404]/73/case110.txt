defendant antonio roselli pleaded guilty to tax fraud.at sentencing,the district court declined to determine the exact amount of the tax loss,and the offense level that would result from such a determination,ruling that such a finding would not affect the sentence.the court then departed downward from the sentencing guidelines based on roselli extraordinary family circumstances.the government now appeals both the failure to specify an amount of tax loss and the decision to depart.although we agree that the failure to specify an amount of tax loss and the related offense level was an error,we find that error harmless,and we affirm 
in,antonio roselli began working as a partner in an accounting firm where he provided tax services.in and,roselli prepared tax returns on behalf of his clients that included false deductions for charitable contributions and business expenses.he charged his clients approximately for each false return.roselli also amended tax returns from prior years,adding false deductions in an effort to procure retroactive refunds.for each amended return he charged approximately one third of the expected refund.the government contends that,all told,roselli prepared more than false tax returns,accounting for in tax loss to the united states treasury.
on august,roselli pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to aid,assist,and abet in the filing of materially false tax returns in violation of.in the plea agreement,the government stated its belief that the tax loss was,indicating a base offense level of pursuant to section of the sentencing guidelines the government argued that the appropriate total offense level,after several adjustments,was the government agreed to recommend a sentence of twelve months incarceration,a fine,a special assessment,and three years of supervised release.roselli asserted that the tax loss was not readily ascertainable and,in any event,was far less than.although he asserted that the proper total offense level was,he nevertheless agreed to recommend the same sentence as the prosecution,except that he would seek home detention for the twelve month period rather than incarceration 
at the sentencing hearings,roselli asserted that the tax loss was between and.he offered several examples,though not an exhaustive list,of tax returns that he alleged should not have been included in the government loss calculation.these examples amounted to an alleged overstatement of,bringing the tax loss down to no more than.nevertheless,roselli reiterated that he would accept the government recommendation of a total offense level of so long as the court did not make a finding that the tax loss was or more.the government argued that the court must make a specific finding as to the tax loss and calculate the offense level based on that finding.
during the sentencing hearing,roselli counsel explained that a tax loss finding could have harmful collateral consequences in a subsequent deportation proceeding.although roselli has lived in the united states for approximately years,he is a citizen of the united kingdom and may be subject to deportation if he is convicted of an aggravated felony.a a iii.the violation of is not specifically listed as an aggravated felony,but the definition of aggravated felony includes any offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds.a m i if the court made an explicit finding that the tax loss was greater than,such a finding might be preclusive in any subsequent deportation proceeding.see,hammer ins,cir findings made during a denaturalization proceeding have preclusive effect in a subsequent deportation proceeding.roselli would then be subject to deportation if the court found that a violation of fit the parameters outlined in a m i.
after receiving supplemental briefs on the issue of the tax loss finding,the court declined to determine whether the tax loss was as suggested by the government,between and as suggested by roselli,or somewhere between those two figures.the court reasoned that if it accepted roselli assertion that the tax loss was between and,the resulting total offense level would be,corresponding to a guideline range of to months and a fine of between and.if the court accepted the government contention that the tax loss was,the total offense level would be,corresponding to a guideline range of to months and a fine of to.thus,there was a point of overlap in guideline ranges that corresponded precisely with the government sentencing recommendation months of incarceration and a fine of to the court then stated its conclusion on the tax loss finding issue 
i confronted with,i think,a realistic prospect that the tax loss could be disputed.and the process of resolving that dispute would be not quite the equivalent of the trial itself,but would be a quite demanding claim upon the court resources.here,i would have to,i think,hear from a witness.i have to examine a variety of different tax returns to determine the tax loss.and there seems to me to be no particular benefit to doing that when we dealing with overlapping guidelines.and,of course,it particularly the case that the government in its plea agreement has committed itself to making a recommendation at that point of overlap under the guidelines.
having determined that the appropriate guidelines sentence corresponded to a point of overlap in the two guideline sentencing ranges suggested by the parties,the court ruled that a finding as to the exact amount of the tax loss would not affect sentencing and was therefore unnecessary.i b the court made only the general finding that the tax loss was not less than.
the court then considered roselli request for a downward departure from the guidelines sentence based on the harm that his incarceration would cause to his family.because two of his four children suffer from cystic fibrosis cf,and because his wife suffers from several illnesses,roselli argued that his family members would suffer extraordinary harm if he were incarcerated and unable to care for them.to support this contention,he submitted letters from a doctor,two nurses,and a social worker familiar with his children condition and the integral role of parental care in battling he also submitted letters from his wife,kara,his wife doctor,and his outlining their daily home life,kara illnesses,and the inability of other friends and relatives to adequately replace the services and care that roselli provides to both his wife and children.the government offered no evidence to rebut roselli description of the facts.rather,it argued that the evidence offered by roselli,even if true,did not meet the standard for a downward departure based on extraordinary family circumstances.
the district court disagreed,finding that roselli was irreplaceable to his family.it granted a downward departure,stating 
the focus,obviously,is on the family,not the offender.and it would understate to say that this family will be devastated in a way that is truly extraordinary the capacity for living that the children have depends upon,i think,roselli presence.it is exacerbated by the physical challenges that roselli faces.and i believe that,while discouraged,this ground of departure is meant to address this extraordinary family circumstance.
the court stated that it would depart to a probationary sentence,but did not specify the extent of the departure,saying only that it would depart whether the total offense level is a or.the court then sentenced roselli to a three year term of probation,months to be served in home confinement,a fine,and a special assessment of 
the government now appeals.it first argues that the district court was required to determine the tax loss amount and the related offense level.it then argues that the downward departure was unwarranted because roselli failed to meet the standards necessary to justify a departure for family circumstances.we address these arguments in turn.
we review de novo the district court conclusion that it was not required to determine the amount of tax loss and the related offense level.see,united states mateo,cir w e scrutinize the district court legal determinations including its application of the sentencing guidelines de novo.
a district court does not have to determine the exact offense level where such a determination would not affect the court sentencing decision under the guidelines.see united states carrozza,cir to be sure,a district court has inherent power not to decide disputes that are immaterial or irrelevant to the ultimate sentence.see also united states concemi,cir stating in dicta that any error resulting in a reduction of the offense level,but not moving the district court sentence outside the relevant guideline range,would be harmless.under certain circumstances,the choice between two potentially applicable offense levels does not affect a court sentencing decision.a sentencing court need not choose between two overlapping guideline ranges when the same sentence would have been imposed under either range.carrozza,at.see also united states bermingham,cir d isputes about applicable guidelines need not be resolved where the sentence falls within either of two arguably applicable guideline ranges and the same sentence would have been imposed under either guideline range.however,a court may not pick a particular sentence solely to avoid the necessity of determining the guideline sentencing range.united states ortiz,cir.thus,if the district court settled on a sentence that happened to fall at the point of overlap in the two potential guideline ranges,it did not have to determine which offense level,and thus which guideline range,applied to roselli.
prior to considering roselli request for a departure,the district court adopted the government position that the appropriate sentence under the guidelines was months incarceration and a fine.the court did not explicitly reach this sentence prior to considering whether there was an overlap in the sentencing ranges indicated by a total offense level of and a total offense level of.nevertheless,both the government and roselli suggested to the court that months was the appropriate sentence under the guidelines.thus,it appears that the court settled on that sentence because of the parties mutual suggestion,not because it fell at a point of overlap in the two potential sentencing ranges.
the government nevertheless argues that the district court refusal to make an exact tax loss finding was improperly motivated by the desire to prevent roselli from facing deportation.see united states maung,cir holding that a district court may not depart solely to minimize the effects of a conviction on immigration proceedings.although the record indicates that the court was aware of the potential collateral effects that a tax loss finding might have in a subsequent deportation proceeding,it explicitly stated that a tax loss finding would not affect its sentencing decision and would waste judicial resources with unnecessary and burdensome.we reject the government challenge to the authenticity of the court explanation.moreover,the court was not required to spend its resources sorting through disputed facts merely because a tax loss finding might prove beneficial to the government in a subsequent deportation proceeding.
if the district court had ended its analysis after refusing to make the tax loss finding,and had sentenced roselli to months imprisonment and a fine,our analysis on appeal would be complete.however,the district court subsequent decision to depart from the sentencing ranges indicated by the guidelines poses a potential problem appropriately noted by the government.because the district court did not make a tax loss finding,and thus did not determine roselli exact offense level,it could not specify the degree of its departure.the government contends that the court failure to specify the degree of departure was erroneous.
we agree with the government that,in most cases,a district court must determine the defendant total offense level prior to departure so that it can specify the degree of departure.to determine the defendant offense level,the district court must first undertake the largely mechanical process of applying the guidelines to a variety of objective factors.in a tax fraud case,one of the objective factors necessary to determine the proper offense level will be the amount of tax loss.see.the offense level contributes to the determination of a sentencing range,and a court shall impose a sentence of the kind,and within the range,indicated by the guidelines unless the court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind,or to a degree,not adequately taken into consideration by the sentencing commission.b.thus,to carry out this analysis,a court must first determine the proper sentencing range under the guidelines before it can determine whether that range is inappropriate because of factors the commission did not adequately account for in establishing the guidelines.
although we agree with the government that the district court erred in failing to make a tax loss finding,we find that the error was harmless in this case.first,the error did not affect the sentence imposed by the district court.see williams united states,d o nce the court of appeals has decided that the district court misapplied the guidelines,a remand is appropriate unless the reviewing court concludes on the record as a whole that the error was harmless,that the error did not affect the district court selection of the sentence imposed.the district court explicitly stated that it would impose the same sentence whether the total offense level is a or,indicating its intention to depart to a probationary sentence regardless of the amount of the tax loss.there is no reason to remand the case so that the district court can make a factual determination that would have no effect on its sentencing decision.
while the failure to make a tax loss finding did not affect the court sentencing decision,it did prevent the court from specifying the offense level and the degree of its departure.pursuant to e c,we are required to review whether the district court sentence departs to an unreasonable degree from the applicable guidelines range.see also united states bogdan,cir stating that review of a district court decision to depart from the guidelines includes a review of the extent of that departure.ordinarily,we can not perform this appellate function if the district court does not specify the degree of departure.requiring the court to determine the total offense level prior to a departure decision establishes a basis for the specification of a degree of departure.thus,in most cases,the district court must make the findings determining the offense establish the degree of departure.united states roberson,cir whether the court incorrectly determined the recommended range is relevant to our review of a departure because a sentence that exceeds the guidelines may look reasonable when compared to one recommended range,but unreasonable when compared to another.
this case,however,presents an unusual circumstance because the sentence imposed allows us to determine what the total offense level and the maximum degree of departure must have been,and hence we can review the departure decision.after departing,the court sentenced roselli to months of probation served under a condition of home detention.combined with roselli criminal history category of i,an offense level of indicates a sentencing range of months of imprisonment,which falls with zone b of the sentencing table.pursuant to c,if the sentencing range falls within zone b the court may order the defendant to serve the required term as probation with a condition of home detention rather than as a term of imprisonment.thus,roselli sentence after departure is consistent with the maximum term allowed by an offense level of,served as probation with a condition of home detention pursuant to c.
roselli sentence after departure is not consistent with an offense level of less than.an offense level of indicates a sentencing range of only months.offense levels of less than carry a maximum term of six months.thus,roselli sentence of months of home detention exceeds the sentencing guideline range authorized by any offense level below.
similarly,roselli sentence after departure is not consistent with an offense level of greater than.the sentencing ranges indicated by offense levels of or fall into zone pursuant to d,a defendant whose offense level places him in zone c must serve at least half of his term in prison sentencing ranges indicated by offense levels of or greater fall into zone defendants in zone d,pursuant to f,must serve their entire term in prison.roselli sentence of months of probation with the condition of home detention would not be available under any offense level that indicated a sentencing range in zone c or 
the district court imposed a sentence that is consistent only with an offense level of.we can therefore narrow our inquiry regarding the degree of departure.if the district court had decided the tax loss question,and had agreed with the government contention that the tax loss was equal to,it would have applied to roselli a total offense level of.the government did not argue,and there is no evidence in the record to suggest,that the tax loss was greater than.therefore,the maximum offense level that the district court could have applied to roselli was.because the court departed to a sentence that is consistent only with an offense level of,the maximum level of departure in this case was three levels,from an offense level of to an offense level of.
the government correctly points out that,if the district court had made a finding as to the tax loss,it might have found that the correct tax loss figure was somewhere between and.thus,the court might have determined that the correct total offense level was or,necessitating a departure of only or levels to achieve an offense level of.indeed,if the district court had agreed with roselli contention that the tax loss was less than,it could have sentenced roselli in accordance with an offense level of without making any departure 
under different circumstances,this uncertainty about the level of departure might prevent us from properly reviewing the extent of the departure and require us to remand the case to the district court.in this case,however,the district court imposed a sentence that is consistent only with an offense level of.we can therefore determine that the maximum degree of departure is three levels.obviously,if the record justifies a three level downward departure for extraordinary family circumstances,it would also justify a lesser departure therefore,we turn to the merits of the departure for extraordinary family circumstances.
we apply a three part analysis to review of departures we determine whether the stated ground for departure is theoretically permissible under the guidelines if so,we examine the record to assess whether there is adequate factual support and we determine the appropriateness of the degree of departure.bogdan,at.we review part one of the test de novo.united states bradstreet,cir.pursuant to the protect act,stat,we review part two of this test de novo for all appeals pending on or filed after april.see united states thurston,cir.the protect act did not alter our review of the extent of departures,and we therefore continue to review part three of the test only for abuse of discretion.id.at see also koon united states,d.
a court must impose a sentence within the range prescribed by the guidelines unless the court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind,or to a degree,not adequately taken into consideration by the sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.b.to warrant a departure,a circumstance must render the case atypical and take it out of the heartland for which the applicable guideline was designed.united states,cir.among potential factors justifying a departure,a discouraged factor is one not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range.united states mejia,cir quoting,part h,intro.cmt.the sentencing guidelines deem family circumstances a discouraged ground for departure,and a district court may depart on the basis of a discouraged ground only in an exceptional case.united states louis,cir see also united states pereira,cir.
we have affirmed departures for exceptional family circumstances only on rare occasions,noting that family responsibilities,by themselves,are not sufficient to take a case out of the heartland.pereira,at.in united states carr,cir,we reversed a downward departure based on family circumstances because,even though carr and her husband both faced prison terms,their child could be cared for by carr mother during their incarceration.in united states chestna,cir,we found that incarcerating a single mother of four young children aged thirteen,eleven,four,and less than one would not cause the exceptional family hardship required to depart from the guidelines because single mother status is not an idiosyncratic circumstance id.at internal quotation marks omitted.in pereira,we vacated a departure based on the defendant role in caring for his elderly parents because the defendant did not provide specialized care,his siblings were available to help with the parents care,and home nursing services provided an adequate alternative during the period of the defendant incarceration.at.see also united states sweeting,cir departure not appropriate for a single mother of five children,one of whom had tourette syndrome,where the care provided by the mother was to engage in daily exercise with the child,to help him keep his school and home tasks organized,to administer his medicine when necessary,and to remove certain foods from his diet.
nevertheless,we have upheld departures in limited circumstances where a defendant was so irreplaceable that incarceration would cause exceptional hardship to his family.in united states sclamo,cir,we affirmed a departure where the defendant stepson,who suffered from a psychiatric disorder and had a long history of aggressive and disruptive behavior,was making dramatic progress largely because of the support and care of the defendant.in that circumstance,the defendant important role could not practically have been filled by any other person.in united states rivera,cir,we ruled that the district court might justifiably depart on remand where defendant was the single mother of three young children,received income only from welfare,and had virtually no contact with or support from other family members.this combination of factors might be enough,on a closer review of the facts,to render the defendant irreplaceable to her young children.see also united states haversat,cir upholding departure because defendant wife suffered from a severe psychiatric disorder and defendant was needed to identify the beginning of any regression and to seek out immediate treatment to avoid a serious situation.
a downward departure for extraordinary family circumstances may be appropriate where the care provided by the defendant is irreplaceable or otherwise extraordinary.pereira,at.this standard requires the district court to determine whether there are feasible alternatives of care that are relatively comparable to what the defendant provides.id.emphasis added.thus,a downward departure is appropriate if the defendant role is so different in kind or degree from the many kinds of support that can be important in the family relationship that it makes the family ties and responsibilities factor exceptional.louis,at.
