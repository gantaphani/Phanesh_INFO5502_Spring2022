donna holman filed this quiet title action against the united states after the irs filed a tax lien on real property in centerville,utah,to which she and a friend of her husband kenneth holman held legal title.the irs lien arose out of assessments against holman for unpaid employment taxes.holman asserted that she and her husband friend,hyrum smith,held the centerville property free and clear of the tax lien.the irs responded by filing a counterclaim alleging that both holman and smith held the property as nominees for holman and seeking to enforce the lien.
the district court ruled that holman held an undivided in the property in her own right,not as a nominee for holman but smith held an undivided interest in the centerville property as a nominee of holman.the court based the former ruling on the fact that holman had never transferred legal title to the property to holman.as a result,the district court concluded,the federal tax lien was enforceable only as to the held by smith.
the irs now appeals the district court ruling that a transfer of legal title was required to enforce the nominee lien.holman has filed a,maintaining that the district court erred in characterizing smith interest in the property.according to holman,smith held title to the centerville property as her nominee,not as holman nominee.
with regard to the irs appeal,we agree that a formal transfer of legal title from holman to holman is not required in order to enforce the lien.however,we further conclude that the irs must establish that holman held an interest in the property under utah law.because the district court did not undertake this inquiry,we vacate its decision and remand for further proceedings.as for holman,we also conclude that further proceedings are warranted.
background 
kenneth holman is a utah real estate developer whose businesses became delinquent in paying federal employment taxes.in april,the irs determined that holman was liable for under for willfully failing to pay income and social security taxes withheld from the wages of his employees from through.in october,the irs determined that holman was liable under for an additional,representing unpaid employment taxes for the second quarter of.the irs provided holman with notice and a demand for payment of these assessments.
in,the holmans moved into a house located at west north in centerville,utah,after an apartment that they were renting was subjected to foreclosure.the centerville property was owned by hyrum smith and his wife,but,by,smith was interested in moving to a smaller residence.holman realized that because of the tax assessments that had been filed against him and because holman had no income of her own,they could not qualify for a loan to purchase the centerville property.smith agreed that,in exchange for providing an apartment to him and paying an additional in rent,the holmans and their children could live there.
in,the holmans agreed to purchase the centerville property from smith.smith and his wife executed a warranty deed transferring title to holman.the smiths and holman also executed a trust deed that identified holman as the trustor and the smiths as beneficiaries.the trust deed stated that it was to secure the payment of for the purchase price of the property.the smiths remained indebted to crossland mortgage on a first mortgage on the property.
in,crossland mortgage discovered the trust deed between holman and the smiths.the mortgage company concluded that the deed triggered a clause in the smiths loan agreement.holman and smith then arrived at a new agreement under which smith and holman would become a of the centerville property and smith would a new loan.accordingly,on october,holman transferred the property by quitclaim deed to herself and smith as tenants in common.on the same day,holman and smith jointly executed a trust deed in favor of utah mortgage corporation,granting it a mortgage on the property to secure repayment of the new loan.
at the bench trial before the district court,smith gave testimony as to the reasons for the transaction he said that he wanted to assist the holmans in their efforts to refinance the property.he explained that he discussed this transaction with holman but not with holman.smith also stated that he had no genuine interest in the property.
throughout the,the holmans made the mortgage payments on the centerville property.the irs sought to collect employment taxes from holman but was not successful.finally,in april,with the unpaid balance of the assessments,with accrued interest,equaling,the irs filed a lien on the centerville property.
holman then brought the instant action seeking to quiet title to the house free and clear of the tax lien asserted by the irs.the irs filed a counterclaim against holman.the irs asserted that holman and smith held the centerville property only as nominees of holman.as a result,the irs contended,it was entitled to enforce the tax lien on the property.
six days after holman filed the quiet title action,the irs filed a separate action in the district of utah.the irs sought to reduce the unpaid balance of the tax assessments against holman to judgment.in march,the district court entered judgment for the united states and against holman for,plus interest.holman has not appealed that judgment.
in this quiet title action,holman argued that she was not her husband nominee and that,as a result,the federal tax lien could not be enforced against the centerville property.in contrast,the government argued that requisite factors were present to establish that smith and holman held title to the property as holman nominees,and that the property was therefore subject to the federal tax lien.the irs relied on the following factors to establish that holman was merely a nominee of holman holman exercised dominion and control over the property holman paid little or no consideration for the property holman orchestrated the transaction to place the property in holman name only after a federal tax lien had attached to the property there was a close relationship between the holmans and holman continued to enjoy the benefits of the property.after the bench trial,the district court reached contrasting results with respect to the irs liens asserted against the interests held by smith and holman.
as to holman interest in the property,the court concluded that she was not holman nominee but rather held the property in her own right.the court acknowledged that there was considerable evidence supporting the irs theory that holman held title as holman nominee.in particular,holman had provided the vast majority of funds used to pay the mortgage and household expenses.he received the benefit of the mortgage interest deduction by claiming the interest paid on the mortgage against the holmans joint income,which for nine of eleven years consisted of holman earnings only.holman paid in closing costs for the refinancing,and,in applying for several loans,he indicated that the centerville property was his asset.
nevertheless,the court concluded that because holman had never transferred legal title to the centerville property to holman,she could not be considered his nominee.thus,the court found that and holman owned the centerville property as tenants in common each with a undivided interest in the whole.
in contrast,as to smith interest in the property,the court observed that on august,both the united states and smith signed and filed a stipulated request for judgment that hyrum smith owned title to the subject property solely as a nominee for kenneth holman.aplt app.vol i,at.the court concluded that smith is a record title holder merely as a nominee for holman and thus holman has at least a undivided interest in the subject property.id.
finally,the court held that the irs request for foreclosure and sale was premature.the court explained that the new mortgage holder from the refinancing had a security interest in the property and that it was not clear that the irs had complied with a section of the foreclosure statute requiring notice to lienholders.see b stating that a ll persons having liens upon or claiming any interest in the property involved in such action shall be made parties thereto.the court denied the irs motion to reconsider.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,the irs argues that the district court erred in concluding that,in order to establish that holman held title to the centerville house as holman nominee,it was required to prove that holman transferred the property to holman.according to the irs,the district court requirement of a transfer of property is at odds with the decisions of several courts of appeals including this one that have enforced nominee liens absent a formal transfer of property from the delinquent taxpayer to a third party.
in response,holman defends the district court reliance on the lack of a transfer to defeat the irs lien.additionally,in a,she argues that the district court erred in finding that smith was holman nominee rather than her nominee.
we begin our analysis with the issue raised by the irs in its appeal.then,we turn to holman cross appeal.most of the relevant facts are undisputed,and the parties arguments raise legal issues that we examine de novo.see united states harms,cir.
a.the irs appeal 
transfers of title to property 
the district court held that because a transfer of the subject property from holman to holman has not occurred,aplt app.vol.i,at,she could not be considered his nominee.the irs now challenges that ruling,arguing that it is unprecedented,and is at odds with the decisions of several courts of appeals that have enforced a nominee tax lien where there was no transfer of property from the taxpayer to his nominee.aplt br.at.
we agree.under the internal revenue code,the irs may satisfy a tax deficiency by imposing a lien on any property or rights to property belonging to the taxpayer.drye united states,d quoting.the statutory language is broad and reveals on its face that congress meant to reach every interest in property that a taxpayer might have.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
accordingly,property and rights to property may include not only property and rights to property owned by the taxpayer but also property held by a third party if it is determined that the third party is holding the property as a nominee of the delinquent taxpayer.spotts united states,cir see,macklin united states,cir in the case of a nominee lien,the irs proceeds against an alter ego or nominee of a delinquent taxpayer for purposes of satisfying the taxpayer obligations.internal quotation marks omitted.the nominee theory focuses upon the taxpayer relationship to a particular piece of property.oxford capital united states,cir.the ultimate inquiry is whether the taxpayer has engaged in a legal fiction by placing legal title to property in the hands of a third party while actually retaining some or all of the benefits of true ownership 
although in many instances the delinquent taxpayer will have transferred legal title to a third party,an actual transfer of legal title is not essential to the imposition of a nominee lien.a delinquent taxpayer who has never held legal title to a piece of property but who transfers money to a third party and directs the third party to purchase property and place legal title in the third party name may well enjoy the same benefits of ownership of the property as a taxpayer who has held legal title.in both instances,the third party may be the taxpayer nominee.
thus,as the irs argues,this court has recognized that a tax lien may be enforced when the taxpayer has never held legal title to the property but has directed that title be placed in a third party name.see united states miller.const,cir holding that a lien could be enforced against property when the taxpayer had directed that legal title be placed in a third party name and observing that the fact taxpayer exerted dominion and control over the land from until his death in is indicative of ownership.other courts have reached the same conclusion.see,scoville united states,cir holding that a wife was a delinquent taxpayer nominee and that the taxpayer retained a beneficial interest in a farm and an insurance policy even though the wife held legal title to the farm and the wife was listed as the insured on the policy.
in arguing in support of the district court conclusion that a transfer of property is required,holman relies primarily on the second circuit decision in libutti united states,cir.however,we do not read libutti to support holman position.
in libutti,the daughter of a delinquent taxpayer filed a wrongful levy action against the irs seeking to prevent the enforcement of a lien against a racehorse to which the taxpayer daughter held title.the district court refused to enforce the lien because the irs had failed to establish that the taxpayer had ever transferred the horse to his daughter.on appeal,the second circuit concluded that the district court could have drawn adverse inferences from the fact that the taxpayer,who was not a party to the daughter wrongful levy action,had invoked his fifth amendment rights and had refused to answer questions about ownership of the horse.see libutti,at stating that the circumstances of this case compel the admissibility and consideration by the trial court of the taxpayer refusals to answer the questions addressed to him that struck directly at the only issue before the he or his daughter was the effective owner.
in reaching that conclusion,the second circuit did state that proof of transfer would be an essential concern.id.at.however,the court subsequently explained that proof of transfer could be accomplished by finding that the taxpayer funded the acquisition and reacquisition of the horse,without a transfer of legal title.id.at emphasis added.thus,the court said,i t is not necessary,therefore,to find that the racehorse was transferred from the taxpayer to his daughter it is sufficient for nominee and constructive trust purposes if it is found,with the aid of the requisite adverse inference,that the taxpayer transferred his money to his daughter for the purchase of the racehorse.id.emphasis added.in our view,that reasoning indicates that a third party may hold property as a taxpayer nominee if the taxpayer pays for the property and enjoys the benefits of ownership,even though the third party holds legal title and the taxpayer has never held legal title himself.
moreover,we disagree with the district court and holman with regard to second circuit reference to the aid of the requisite adverse inference.id.that phrase does not indicate that the irs may only seek to enforce a nominee lien against property to which the taxpayer lacks legal title when the taxpayer has refused to answer questions about ownership of property,as the taxpayer did in libutti.instead,the second circuit decision demonstrates only that,on the facts before it,an adverse inference about ownership of the property was warranted there was no direct proof that the monies the daughter used to purchase and subsequently,repurchase the racehorse came from her father,but t he record was replete with evidence of the taxpayer use of his daughter and a company for secreting his assets and as the conduits for his horse dealings.id.at.in other circumstances,the enforcement of a nominee lien may be warranted even if there is no indication that the taxpayer has refused to answer questions about ownership of the property.
we therefore conclude that the district court erred in holding that,standing alone,the lack of a transfer of legal title to the centerville property from holman to holman is sufficient as a matter of law to defeat enforcement of the nominee lien asserted by the irs.
enforcement of the nominee lien against holman 
because it is not required to establish that holman transferred legal title to the centerville property,the irs contends that it is now entitled to enforce the nominee lien under.application of the nominee doctrine involves questions of both state and federal law.we look initially to state law to determine what rights the taxpayer has in the property the irs seeks to reach.drye,at.see also spotts,at stating that a federal tax lien does not arise or attach to property in which a person has no interest under state law and that before determini
