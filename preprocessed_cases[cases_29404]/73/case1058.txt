the issue in this case is the effect of a conversion from chapter to chapter bankruptcy proceedings on the priority status of a postpetition,preconversion administrative expense claim.the fowlers appeal the district court order reversing the bankruptcy court,and determining that d requires that federal employment taxes,incurred as administrative expenses in operating their nursing home business after the fowlers filed for chapter bankruptcy protection,but before they converted to chapter,retain their priority status as administrative expenses under b.we affirm the district court and hold that such a claim retains its administrative expense priority upon conversion.
in may,chelcey and lynda fowler filed for chapter bankruptcy protection.while in chapter,the fowlers continued the operation of their adult care facility,causing the bankruptcy estate to incur additional federal insurance contribution act and federal unemployment tax act employment tax liabilities and attendant penalties and interest on those debts.in december,the internal revenue service irs filed a request for payment of this new debt as administrative expenses of the estate under a b and a the chapter estate continued to accrue employment tax liabilities through the fourth quarter of.during this same period,the irs amended the request to reflect increases to the accumulating debt.the fowlers did not file an objection to these requests.
in may,the fowlers moved to convert their bankruptcy estate from chapter to chapter.they stated that they no longer operated their care facility and were now employed by others,and thus met chapter eligibility requirements.the bankruptcy court granted their conversion to chapter.in june,after conversion but prior to confirmation of the chapter plan,the irs filed an amendment to the december request for payment the amended request,to reflect additional interest and penalties which had accrued while the estate was still proceeding under chapter.the amendment did not reflect any tax liability accruing after the conversion.
the fowlers argued that the debt evidenced by the amended request should no longer be treated as an administrative claim,but as a prepetition unsecured priority claim under,a special chapter provision.the bankruptcy court agreed and held that a tax claim filed during the pendency of a chapter petition must be prioritized as if the claim had arisen prepetition because b states that claims for taxes filed under a are allowed or disallowed the same as if such claim had arisen before the date of filing of the petition.the bankruptcy court noted that filing a proof of claim under is voluntary,and therefore the irs could have avoided application of by not filing a claim after the conversion.
the district court reversed and held that such a claim continued to be an administrative expense because d specifically exempts administrative expenses from prepetition treatment in a conversion.the district court found that d is the only section that addresses the issue of administrative expenses in a conversion from one chapter to another and that did not apply.the fowlers subsequently filed a motion for rehearing under fed,which the district court denied.they now appeal both the reversal of the bankruptcy court ruling on the appropriate priority of the tax liability and the denial of the motion for reconsideration.
as a threshold matter,we must establish that jurisdiction over the fowlers appeal is proper.under a,we have jurisdiction to hear appeals from final judgments,order,and decrees entered by a district court on appeal from a bankruptcy court.because of the unique nature of bankruptcy proceedings,this court applies a pragmatic approach to determining finality.saxman educational credit mgmt.in re saxman,cir dawson.mutual bank in re dawson,cir.
two tests have developed in the ninth circuit to address the question of finality for bankruptcy proceedings.see in re olshan,cir.under vylene,naugles,in re vylene,cir,we apply a test that considers the need to avoid piecemeal litigation judicial efficiency the systemic interest in preserving the bankruptcy court role as the finder of fact and whether delaying review would cause either party irreparable harm.in re olshan,at internal citation omitted.under bonner mall bancorp mortgage in re bonner mall,cir,we consider whether the central issue raised on appeal is legal in nature and its resolution either could dispose of the case or proceedings and obviate the need for factfinding or would materially aid the bankruptcy court in reaching its disposition on remand.in re olshan,at quoting in re bonner mall,at.
under either test,the district court order here is sufficiently final for our jurisdiction over this appeal to be proper.there are no facts in dispute and the remand requires only that the chapter plan conform to the legal determination on priority.deciding the legal question now would be judicially efficient,would not interfere with the bankruptcy court fact finding role,and would avoid additional harm to the fowlers and their creditors due to the delay in closing the bankruptcy proceedings.see in re vylene,at.the bankruptcy proceedings will be controlled by the question of law before us regarding the priority of the irs claim and deciding the issue now would materially aid the bankruptcy court.see in re bonner mall,at see also in re olshan,at accepting jurisdiction where the appeal concerned primarily a question of law and resolution of the question would materially aid the bankruptcy court determination of the extent to which a claim should be allowed.we therefore hold that we have jurisdiction over the fowlers appeal.
we review de novo the district court decision on appeal from a bankruptcy court.in re saxman,at.the bankruptcy court conclusions of law,including interpretations of the bankruptcy code,are reviewed de novo and its factual findings are reviewed for clear error.see bagel smith in re bce west,cir.there are no factual questions before us.the fowlers do not challenge classification of the employment tax debt as an administrative expense incurred by the estate prior to the filing for conversion to a chapter bankruptcy.the question before us is whether the debt lost its administrative expense status upon conversion.
the question of status is important because it affects the priority of the debt in the bankruptcy proceeding.first priority is granted,inter alia,to administrative expenses of the bankruptcy estate.see a.postpetition tax debt may constitute an administrative expense if it relates to any tax incurred by the estate,except certain defined taxes not applicable here.b b i.the first priority accorded to administrative expense taxes also extends to interest and penalties that accrue on that debt.see towers united states in re trading,cir see also united states ledlin in re mark anthony,cir.a chapter confirmation plan must provide that administrative expenses,including penalties and interest,be paid in full as priority claims.see a see also in re mark anthony,at.
in contrast,a tax which is prepetition and unsecured is generally given eighth priority.a.these eighth priority tax claims are also paid in full over the term of the chapter plan but without interest.see generally a see also in re dorf,finding that a does not require payment of interest in re smith,finding that a does not require the payment of postpetition interest.therefore,the most important distinction between administrative expense tax claims and unsecured priority tax claims in chapter is that the irs can not recover interest on prepetition unsecured priority tax claims.
the district court relied on d to hold that postpetition,preconversion administrative expenses retain their status.section d provides that 
a claim against the estate or the debtor that arises after the order for relief but before conversion in a case that is converted under section,other than a claim specified in section b of this title,shall be treated for all purposes as if such claim had arisen immediately before the date of the filing of the petition.
d emphasis added.a conversion under includes conversions from chapter to chapters,or.a and d.
