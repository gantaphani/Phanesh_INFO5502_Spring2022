the commissioner of internal revenue the commissioner or irs assessed deficiencies against the taxpayer haffner service stations,the company or the taxpayer for the three subject years,disallowing the deduction of certain bonuses and imposing the accumulated earnings tax.the tax court agreed with the commissioner,haffner serv.stations,comm r,cch,wl,and the company has now appealed to this court.
the background facts are undisputed.the taxpayer is a close corporation that sells oil and gas in massachusetts and new hampshire through its own service stations and by delivery.throughout the tax years in question,louise haffner held all of the voting shares of the company,and together with her husband emile fournier a significant minority of the nonvoting shares.the remaining nonvoting shares were held by their children,and by two trusts of which louise was the trustee emile was of one and their children the beneficiaries.
in,two of louise and emile five children susan and richard filed suit against them in state court,alleging breach of fiduciary duty arising from a transfer of voting shares from one of the trusts to louise.in july,louise and emile offered to settle richard suit for,including a redemption of richard shares in the corporation.richard countered that his shares were worth at least million,and no settlement occurred.in,a third child joline joined the suit.in,a state court ruled that a breach had occurred,and that the transfer of shares had to be rescinded and an independent trustee appointed.after the rescission,louise still held about percent of all voting shares.haffner,cch at.
during each subject year,louise,emile and their sons haff and richard,were employees of the company louise,emile and haff also constituted the board of directors.haff was the president of the company and made most major business decisions.for the three subject years,haff received compensation of approximately including a bonus of,and,respectively.richard was the vice president of the company,responsible for monitoring station condition and collecting money from three of the stations.his compensation was approximately in each subject year.haffner,cch at.
louise was the treasurer of the company,and emile the assistant treasurer and secretary.louise and emile performed various office duties,such as answering the telephone and signing checks but they also discussed many of the business decisions with haff.their salaries were never higher than per year and there is no evidence that they received substantial bonuses in prior years.for the subject years,louise and emile received identical bonuses of,and.the company allocated from each of their bonuses to a related corporate entity,and deducted the rest on its tax return.the irs disallowed the company deductions as unreasonable.haffner,cch at.
the company has never paid a dividend.in,its accountant recommended a in reserves in contemplation of a share redemption in connection with the family litigation.at the end of,the company unappropriated retained earnings were roughly million this figure rose to million,million,and million,respectively,at the end of each subject year.in,the irs notified the taxpayer that it would impose the accumulated earnings tax on the increase in retained earnings for the three years in question.see a.the company argued in the tax court that the accumulation was reasonable for various business purposes,including the redemption of the shares of dissenting shareholders.
the tax court rendered a detailed opinion,sustaining the commissioner deficiency assessments but striking down the commissioner imposition of penalties.haffner,cch at.the taxpayer has now appealed to challenge both the disallowance of the bonuses and the imposition of the accumulated earnings tax.we review questions of law de novo but fact findings of the tax court only for clear error.a.medchem,comm r,cir.clear error exists if,on the entire record,the court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.mitchell united states,cir.
compensation.under current law,both dividends and wages are treated as ordinary income to the recipient and taxed at the same rate.but for the corporation that makes the payments,wages are deductible while dividends are not.in close corporations,there is an obvious incentive to disguise dividend distributions as compensation expenses.see b.the opportunity exists because leading shareholders are also often managers of the company,and the benefit is obvious by reducing corporate taxes,more accrues to the shareholders.see generally,mertens law of federal income taxation,mertens.
the internal revenue code limits deductibility to reasonable compensation,a,which serves in part as a safeguard against conversion of dividends into salary.treasury are binding on us unless inconsistent with the statute,see boeing united states,d require reasonableness to be based on all circumstances.b.what subsidiary factors are considered in this test of reasonableness is apparently a question of first impression in this circuit.
other circuits and the tax court have employed tests,the factors ranging from a handful to almost two dozen in various formulations.see bittker lokken,federal taxation of income,estate and gifts ed collecting cases and discussing factors mertens,same.by and large,longer lists include elements that,in shorter ones,are grouped together.the second circuit offers a typical example of a short collection the employee role,payments by comparable companies,nature and condition of the company,earnings,incentives to distort,and consistency of compensation within the company.dexsil comm r,cir.
the seventh circuit,in exacto spring commissioner,cir,has vividly criticized the existing tests as unpredictable.id.at.the company reads the decision as laying down a test which asks whether an independent investor would approve the disputed compensation as a reasonable reward for the manager performance.it asks us to adopt the test for this circuit.but in exacto judge posner conceded that the independent investor test was not an exclusive answer to the problem,id.at,and exacto emphasis on the company profits reflected in part the character of that case 
there is always a balance to be struck between simplifying doctrine and accuracy of result,and for the present we think that multiple factors often may be relevant.exacto remains a useful reminder that reasonableness under section a is not a moral concern or a matter of fairness the inquiry aims at what an arm length owner would pay an employee for his work.the problem is that the actual a good expression of market value in a competitive not decisively answer this question where the employee controls the company and can benefit by as compensation what would otherwise accrue to him as dividends.
turning to the principal pertinent factors,the one nominally most helpful to the taxpayer here is its general performance and,in particular,the return on equity roe,which averaged percent during the period as compared with percent for peer companies.the tax court said that the data underlying the comparison were unreliable,haffner,cch at and as support the irs notes that the average pertained to the period rather than the subject years and that the roe and net income both declined substantially during the subject years.
certainly the roe for the longer period looks impressive and other factors growth in revenues and profits show an upward curve over that period.but the decline in roe and net income during the subject years,accompanied by a spike in bonuses,does raise substantial questions as to whether the increase was for performance,whether the performance merited the compensation,and whether,in any case,any successful performance can be properly attributed to louise and emile.
comparability of compensation is another common gauge,see b,operating in two quite different dimensions.one is with pay for similar jobs at like companies the other is a comparison with others within the same company,especially employees,making the appropriate adjustment for differing responsibilities.here,the tax court found that the comparability evidence either affirmat
