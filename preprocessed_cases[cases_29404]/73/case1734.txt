on june,the upland city council adopted ordinances and.ordinance amended the existing town center redevelopment plan by deleting acres from the redevelopment area.ordinance approved a new redevelopment plan,designated project.project contained the parcel,as well as other noncontiguous parcels.
plaintiffs william graber and the county of san bernardino county filed separate validation actions to challenge the two ordinances.the actions generally contend that the ordinances are invalid because the city of upland city failed to comply with provisions of the community redevelopment law health,et the actions were subsequently consolidated for all purposes.code civ.
graber complaint alleged that the parcel had been unlawfully merged with the new redevelopment area,in violation of section.he also alleged that project did not meet statutory requirements because at least percent of the area included in project was not urbanized,nonblighted property had been improperly included in the project area,subds.d,and noncontiguous property had been improperly included in the project area,subd.a,subd.d.graber also alleged that the city finding of blight was not supported by the evidence,in violation of sections,and.other causes of action were also alleged.
the county alleged that ordinance was invalid because it violated article xvi,section of the california constitution and statutory provisions relating to tax increment financing.the county alleged that ordinance was invalid because the project area described in that resolution did not meet the statutory definitions of a blighted area,and the project area was not predominately urbanized.the county also asserted several other causes of action.
the trial court agreed with the challengers and invalidated ordinances and.the city appeals.
the trial court decision 
the trial court found that ordinance violated the constitutional provision relating to tax increment financing,as well as various statutes.although the ordinance provides that the city was amending the original redevelopment plan for the town center redevelopment project,the trial court noted that the ordinance specifically states t he sole purpose of the amendment is to reassign certain parcels from within the territory included in the original project area to the area included within the proposed upland redevelopment project.
section specifically provides that redevelopment plans may be amended to exclude land from the project area.however,the trial court agreed with the county argument that the purpose of the reassignment was to obtain a new base tax year for the parcel,and that such a purpose was an improper purpose under the constitution and the intent of the crl.the trial court therefore voided ordinance.
the trial court also found that ordinance violated several statutory provisions.first,the trial court found that the project area was not predominantly urbanized,as required by sections,subdivision b and.the trial court focused on subarea o,an area which the city counted as urbanized because it claimed that the property had previously been developed for urban uses.the court rejected the argument that the former uses of the property as a rock mine and dump were urban uses.considering the evidence in the record on this issue,the trial court found a lack of evidence that subarea o had been previously developed for urban use.with the exclusion of that subarea,the remaining area was less than percent urbanized.the project area therefore was not predominantly urbanized under the definition of section,subdivision b.
second,the trial court found that the physical evidence did not support the city contention that the various subareas were blighted within the meaning of sections and,subdivision b a.in doing so,it found that the record was similar to the record in our case of county of riverside city of murrieta th,d although the report speaks in the statutory language used to define blight,the report offers little concrete evidence of actual conditions of blight.
third,the trial court found that substantial evidence did not support the city conclusion that there was physical blight consisting of unsafe or unhealthy buildings within the meaning of section,subdivision a.in doing so,it relied on friends of mammoth town of mammoth lakes redevelopment agency th,d.specifically,it found that in this case,as in mammoth,t he breadth of the definition used in the building survey prevented the town council from determining whether the project area could truly be characterized as containing buildings unsafe for human occupancy due to their deteriorated or dilapidated condition.id.at,d.
fourth,the trial court found a lack of substantial evidence of factors preventing an economically viable use of the subarea properties,as required by section,subdivision a.in doing so,it again relied on the discussion in the mammoth case and found that n one of the conclusions drawn by the city are supported by economic data as to any parcel within the subarea s.with regard to subarea o,the trial court found that it was being developed for a master planned community and that the alleged delimiting site preparation factors had no bearing on the economically viable use of the site.
the trial court thus found a lack of substantial evidence of blight in the project area,there is no substantial evidence to support the city redevelopment project project area as predominantly urbanized and suffering from at least one of the statutory physical blight conditions.it therefore voided ordinance.
issues and standard of review 
the first issue presented for decision is whether the trial court was correct in voiding ordinance on grounds that it violated the constitutional and statutory provisions relating to tax increment financing.the parties agree that this is a legal issue subject to an independent review.redevelopment agency county of los angeles th,d.
the second issue is whether the trial court correctly found a lack of substantial evidence to support the city findings of blight under section,subdivision d.the parties do not discuss the subtleties of this determination in a case in which the trial court disagrees with the city findings.
we discussed the issue at length in murrieta.in that case,the city had approved the project on a number of grounds.the county of riverside challenged the city approval of the project.the trial court found in favor of the county on the grounds that the record did not contain substantial evidence to support the city findings that the project area is a predominantly urbanized area which is a blighted area.citation.county of riverside city of murrieta,supra,th,d.applying the substantial evidence test in this situation,we noted that t he distinction is somewhat elusive between whether substantial evidence supports the city determination or whether substantial evidence supports the trial court finding that there is no substantial evidence to support the city determination.ibid.
after discussing several cases,we concluded by saying that the proper standard of review requires us to decide whether substantial evidence supports the judgment of the trial court regarding the city two ultimate determinations in this case that the project area is predominantly urbanized,and that the project area is blighted.county of riverside city of murrieta,supra,th,d.finding no substantial evidence of urbanization or blight in the administrative record,we agreed with the trial court determination that no substantial evidence supported the city determination of urbanization and blight,and we therefore affirmed the judgment.
our supreme court discussed the substantial evidence rule in redevelopment cases in in re redevelopment plan for bunker hill cal d.in that case,the trial court applied the substantial evidence standard of review and declined to exercise its independent judgment on the issues,including the issue of blight.the supreme court upheld the trial court determination,holding that the trial court was correct in its refusal to reweigh the evidence and in confining itself to determining whether the findings and determinations of the inferior bodies were supported by substantial evidence.citation.id.at.
we therefore review the administrative record to determine whether we agree with the trial court determination that the city findings of urbanization and blight are not supported by substantial evidence.of course,we independently determine the law applicable to the facts in the administrative record the community redevelopment law has established factors to be considered in determining whether an area is blighted,and it is the court role to ensure those factors are taken into account.in short,the courts are required to be more than rubber stamps for local governments.emmington solano county redevelopment agency d.
accordingly,the community redevelopment law requires substantial evidence in the administrative record demonstrating the existence of specific characteristics of urbanization and blight.health.in some instances,the statute requires a finding of a nexus,to borrow a term from takings jurisprudence,between a particular characteristic being reviewed and the actual condition being caused.if the specific finding required by the community redevelopment law can not be made from the evidence in the administrative record,the evidence is not substantial proof of the essentials which the law requires and the finding is not supported by substantial evidence.citation.friends of mammoth town of mammoth lakes redevelopment agency,supra,th,d.
as noted above,the trial court found that the deletion of the parcel from the existing town center redevelopment project was invalid because it was done for an improper purpose,to change the base year value of the parcel.
california constitution,article xvi,section,provides that the legislature may provide that a redevelopment plan may contain a provision for dividing the property taxes attributable to the property in the project area between various taxing agencies.the legislature has implemented the provision by enacting a nearly identical statute,section.
increment revenue,which is the primary source of funding for redevelopment projects,consists of the increased property tax revenue resulting from rises in the assessed valuation of property in a redevelopment project area.taxing agencies continue to receive the amount of revenue they would have received under the assessed valuation existing at the time the project was approved,while the additional revenue attributable to the project is placed in a special fund of the redevelopment agency for repayment of indebtedness incurred in financing the project.citation.county of santa clara redevelopment agency th,d.
the property placed in a redevelopment project area is thus frozen at its assessed value upon the last equalized assessment roll before the adoption of the ordinance establishing the project,and further increases in the assessed value produce tax revenues which are used to pay off the loans which were used for the improvements which produced the increased assessed values.tax.code,et.see,redevelopment agency county of los angeles,supra,th,d,and redevelopment agency county of san bernardino cal d.
in this case,however,the properties in the town center redevelopment project lost value after being placed in the project area with the result that there were no tax increment funds available to pay for improvements.thus,the project was effectively stalled.to remedy the situation,the city redevelopment consultants recommended the deletion of the lowest assessed value properties from the project and their reassignment to a new project area.it was intended that this maneuver would result in new base year values which would reflect the decline in assessed values.accordingly,more tax increment would be generated to pay for redevelopment conversely,the county would lose tax revenues because of the lower base year values.as noted above,the county contends this is a subterfuge and improper purpose which invalidates the ordinance.the trial court agreed.
the city maintains its actions were proper because section expressly allows it to delete properties from a redevelopment area and nothing in the redevelopment law prevents it from designating those properties for inclusion in a new project area if they meet the statutory criteria in other words,the city contends that the fact that a property was once in a project area does not forever preclude it from being designated as part of another project area so long as blight exists.if the practical effect of the deletion and reassignment is unfair to the county,the city contends that the issue is a question for the legislature,and it should not have been the concern of the trial court.the city cites redevelopment agency county of los angeles,supra,th,d,which emphasizes that fairness issues connected with tax increment financing should be addressed to the legislature.id.at,d.
the city also argues that the trial court holding is based on the erroneous premise that the assessed base year value applies to all parcels in the project area for the life of the redevelopment project.the city claims the premise is erroneous because properties may be deleted from the project area and,in that event,the base year value would no longer be applied.it gives examples of subsequent changes that support the conclusion that the assessed value of property in the redevelopment area must be recalculated under certain circumstances.see,redevelopment agency county of san bernardino,supra,cal d.
the county argues that the trial court properly voided ordinance because the city purpose was improper.under the constitution,the equalized assessment roll must be used to determine the base year value.the purpose of the amendment was to change the base year value for the properties in the parcel to a more current base year,in alleged violation of the constitutional provision and the applicable statutes.the county is also concerned that such reassignment could be used to evade the statutory time limits on redevelopment activities because the property would begin a new redevelopment period in the new redevelopment area.it concludes the net effect would be to allow redevelopment agencies to ignore the requirement that they receive only tax revenues which are greater than those generated prior to the time the agencies instituted redevelopment activities.
in short,the county concedes that the ordinances were based on the law,but contends that ordinance is invalid because its stated purpose was an improper one.it analogizes the situation to the termination of an employee.although such an employee may be terminated,the termination may not be for an improper reason.gantt sentry insurance cal th,d,overruled on other grounds in green ralee engineering cal th,fn,d.as gantt notes,while an employee may be terminated for no reason,or for an arbitrary or irrational reason,there can be no right to terminate for an unlawful reason or a purpose that contravenes fundamental public policy.gantt,supra,at,d.
although the issue is a close one,the city candid statement of its reasons for adopting ordinance makes it clear to us that the sole purpose of the ordinance was to avoid the base year limitations for the parcel.we agree with the trial court that this is an improper purpose which conflicts with the statutory scheme.
initially,we disagree with the city characterization of the trial court decision as including an implied finding that the county was entitled to the original base year assessed values for the life of the project.the trial court did not so find.it merely found that the city purpose was improper and,for that reason,it voided the ordinance.
the base year assessed values can be changed in some circumstances,such as when a public agency condemns and acquires property in the redevelopment area.redevelopment agency county of san bernardino,supra,cal d.in the san bernardino case,our supreme court held that in such a situation,the term taxable property as used in article xvi,section means currently taxable property,and the assessed values are redetermined accordingly.thus,if the parcel had simply been deleted from the project area,we assume,without deciding,that it would have been appropriate to redetermine the assessed values of the total remaining property accordingly.
but the road the city took was not just a simple deletion.instead,it did what was legally permitted for an improper reason.as the trial court found,the reason was improper because the city was attempting to do indirectly what it could not do directly,change the base year assessment of the subject parcel and the time it was in redevelopment.such a change would certainly upset the tax distribution balance between the redevelopment agency and other taxing jurisdictions.for example,the legislature enacted section in to prevent redevelopment agreements with school districts and redevelopment projects in areas which were not truly blighted.stats,ch.it thus continued to fine tune the distribution of tax funds.see also this balance would be upset if the city were able to unilaterally change the base year assessed value of properties in a redevelopment area by simply deleting them from the area and reassigning them to a new area.similarly,we agree with the county that the reforms enacted by sb in could be easily circumvented if we sanctioned the reassignment procedure here.
we therefore agree with the county that the attempted reassignment of properties from one project area to another was an improper attempt by the city to do indirectly what it could not do directly.the trial court therefore acted properly in voiding ordinance.
the city contends that the deletion of the acres accomplished by ordinance section should stand if we uphold the invalidation of ordinance.it contends that a simple deletion is clearly authorized by the statute,and the parcel should remain deleted from the town center redevelopment area even if we prevent its reassignment to project area.
we disagree.as discussed above,the trial court voided ordinance because its purpose was improper.we have agreed with this determination.since the purpose was improper,the ordinance can not stand.however,this does not mean that the city could not now act to delete the parcel from the town center redevelopment area for good and sufficient reasons.
ordinance finds that the project area is predominantly urbanized and blighted.graber and the county contend that the ordinance must be invalidated because there is a lack of substantial evidence in the record to support these conclusions.
the community redevelopment law is aimed at the elimination of blight.a blighted area is defined as one which is predominantly urbanized and is an area in which the combination of conditions set forth in section is so prevalent and so substantial that it causes a reduction of,or lack of,proper utilization of the area to such an extent that it constitutes a serious physical and economic burden on the community which can not reasonably be expected to be reversed or alleviated by private enterprise or governmental action,or both,without redevelopment,subd.b.
since the trial court found a lack of substantial evidence on the issues of whether the project area is predominantly urbanized and blighted within the meaning of section,we examine each issue seriatim.
predominantly urbanized.in order to qualify as a redevelopment project area,section requires that the project area be predominantly urbanized,which in turn means that percent of the land must be developed for urban uses.county of riverside city of murrieta,supra,th,d,fn.omitted.the term predominantly urbanized includes land which h as been or is developed for urban uses,subd.b.
as we held in the county of riverside case,the meaning of urban is not fixed,objective,or easily ascertainable.county of riverside city of murrieta,supra,th,d.in that case,we found that,even without a precise definition of the term,there was a paucity of evidence in the administrative record to support a determination that the project area is predominantly urbanized.ibid.
in friends of mammoth town of mammoth lakes redevelopment agency,supra,th,d,the court discussed the issue further urban is defined as of,relating to,characteristic of,or taking place in a city constituting or including and centered on a city of,relating to,or concerned with an urban and specifically a densely populated area belonging or having relation to buildings that are characteristic of cities citations.citation.the term urban thus refers more to the location and varying characteristics of a use than to the type of use.citation.for example,a residential dwelling can exist either in an urban area or in a rural area.in either locale,the dwelling can be large or small and,in this era,will likely be served by many public utilities.the fact that it is a developed dwelling does not make the dwelling an urban use.rather,it is the location and characteristics of the dwelling and its environs that may make the use an urban use.id.at,d.
upland is not mammoth lakes.the city emphasizes that it is bounded by development on all sides,that it is unquestionably part of an urban area,and that it is almost entirely built out.it thus argues that these factors must be considered in making an urbanization determination for any particular parcel.it cites mammoth,but the cited page emphasizes that the legislature attempted to ensure a parcel line would not be used to allow vacant nonblighted lands to be included in redevelopment project areas.friends of mammoth town of mammoth lakes redevelopment agency,supra,th,d.thus,the city of mammoth misused its redevelopment power by including in its project area undeveloped and obviously nonblighted land which is planned and approved for extensive private development.ibid.
the primary dispute between the parties relates to subarea o.as the city concedes because subarea o is acres in size,and therefore constitutes more than percent of the land in the project area citation,whether subarea o is urbanized determines the issue of whether the entire project area is predominantly urbanized.
subarea o was the site of a mining operation,pacific rock,which requested and was granted cancellation of its permits with the san bernardino county flood control district office in.since that time,with the exception of one industrial user on a lot,no investment or development has occurred on the site.investment and development have been impaired in subarea o due to the high cost to develop the property.a dump area and a silt basin cover a large portion of the site requiring the excavation of potentially toxic and organic materials the subarea is now being considered for residential development.
applying the friends of mammoth definition,the city finds that the rock mining site and the dump site are urban uses because they are located in an urban area.it contends that flood control and the dumping of trash and organic materials are part and parcel of the city urban infrastructure.in other words,it argues that we should not evaluate whether a particular subarea is predominantly urbanized without first recognizing the characteristics of the larger,surrounding geographic area.
the april preliminary report to the city council by its redevelopment consultant contains a brief discussion of the predominantly urbanized requirement.although subarea o is essentially vacant,the preliminary report states that it was previously urbanized,subd.b.it finds that acres of the project area were previously urbanized because they were used for a mining operation and a dump site.the may final report to the city council omitted this discussion,and contains no discussion of the predominantly urbanized requirement.nevertheless,ordinance recites a finding of urbanization,based upon the agency report to the city council we therefore examine the rationale of the preliminary report more closely.
one of graber specific objections to the redevelopment plan concerned the omission of the predominantly urban discussion from the final report in its official response to this objection,the city said that the discussion was omitted because it was not required under section.with regard to substance,it said that the report found that percent of the project was found to be predominantly urbanized under the urban use test of section,subdivision b.with regard to subarea o,it said that acres of that parcel were considered to be urbanized
