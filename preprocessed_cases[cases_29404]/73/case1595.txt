this is a challenge to the constitutionality of the mental health services act,added by california voters through an initiative measure,proposition,at the november,general election proposition.proposition expands funding for mental health services for all californians by imposing an additional tax of percent on annual income in excess of million.proposition also prevents future state funding for mental health services from falling below the amounts allocated for these services in.welf.
we find no constitutional infirmity in the challenged portions of proposition.an income tax may be rationally based on a taxpayer income level and ability to pay,and there is no need to show that a particular taxpayer personally benefits from a tax assessed for the public good.taxpayers earning more than million annually do not comprise a suspect class requiring a strict scrutiny constitutional analysis.further,proposition is valid even if it is not a constitutional amendment.
craig and sally jensen the taxpayers sued the franchise tax board ftb to recover part of their california state income tax.the tax was imposed by revenue and taxation code section on income that exceeded million.the taxpayers remitted the tax under protest and filed a claim for refund with the ftb.the ftb took no action on the taxpayers claim for a refund.
the taxpayers allege that they are victims of arbitrary discrimination,in violation of the federal and state equal protection clauses.in their view,wealthy individuals are singled out to bear the burden of a public expense,while others are excused from that burden.the taxpayers reason that the wealth of a taxpayer is not a rational basis for a tax assessed for a specific purpose,such as mental health services.
the taxpayers also challenge the requirement in welfare and institutions code section that the state maintain funding for mental health services at levels.they claim that this is an unconstitutional suspension of state budgetary powers,so that the budgets for mental health services are cast in stone,and are not subject to reduction by either the legislature or the governor without a statutory change.the taxpayers allege that making this change in the creation of the state budget required an amendment to the state constitution.proposition is not a constitutional amendment.
the ftb demurred to the taxpayers complaint.the trial court declined to strike down a generally applicable tax scheme based on income,noting that states have great leeway in making classifications that produce reasonable systems of taxation.the court also refused to strike down proposition simply because it was not presented as a constitutional amendment.the court sustained the ftb demurrers without leave to amend and dismissed the taxpayers lawsuit.

overview of proposition 
the text of proposition articulates the purpose or policy motivating enactment of the mental health services act.the measure findings and declarations acknowledge that m ental illnesses are extremely common they affect almost every family in california.failure to provide timely treatment can destroy individuals and families,and untreated mental illness is the leading cause of disability and suicide and imposes high costs on state and local government.untreated children are unable to learn,and untreated adults lose their ability to work and be independent,often becoming homeless and subject to frequent hospitalizations or incarceration,costing billions of dollars annually.california has developed effective models of providing a full range of integrated services for individuals with serious mental illness,with the goal of for people who may otherwise face homelessness or dependence on the state for years to come.the programs include early diagnosis and treatment to prevent disability and thereby save lives and money.
proposition elaborates the mechanism for funding these mental health programs.to provide an equitable way to fund these expanded services while protecting other vital state services from being cut,very individuals should pay an additional percent of that portion of their annual income that exceeds one million dollars.about of percent of californians have incomes in excess of one million dollars.they have average income of nearly five million dollars.the additional tax paid pursuant to this represents only a small fraction of the amount of tax reduction they are realizing through recent changes in the federal income tax law and only a small portion of what they save on property taxes by living in california as compared to the property taxes they would be paying on dollar homes in other states.
constitutionality of revenue and taxation code section 
the taxpayers challenge revenue and taxation code section on the grounds that it violates the equal protection clause the equal protection clause compel s recognition of the proposition that persons similarly situated with respect to the legitimate purpose of the law receive like treatment.darces woods cal d.state taxation statutes are subject to equal protection challenges.western southern bd.of equalization,d.statutes must be upheld unless they are clearly,positively and unmistakably unconstitutional.voters for responsible retirement board of supervisors cal th,d.
wealthy individuals are not part of a suspect class requiring strict scrutiny 
the taxpayers argue that a strict scrutiny constitutional analysis applies.classifications that disadvantage a suspect class or impinge upon the exercise of a fundamental right are subject to strict scrutiny this requires the state to demonstrate that its classification has been precisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.plyler doe,d darces woods,supra,cal d at.the taxpayers maintain that wealth is a suspect classification and the tax imposed by proposition affects only the class of wealthy persons.
we are unaware of any case authority holding that wealthy individuals form a suspect class deserving of a heightened degree of scrutiny.suspect classifications include race,gender,national origin or illegitimacy.wealth generally confers benefits,and does not require the special protections afforded to suspect classes.wealth has none of the traditional indicia of suspectness the class is not saddled with such disabilities,or subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treatment,or relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.san antonio school district rodriguez,d.the supreme court has never heretofore held that wealth discrimination alone provides an adequate basis for invoking strict scrutiny.id.at.punitive require a jury to consider the financial condition of the tortfeasor do not violate the equal protection clause even though they have a disproportionate impact on wealthy defendants.germanio goodyear tire rubber,we are unaware of any cases which suggest that a heightened degree of scrutiny for the wealthy is appropriate.
the taxpayers rely on serrano priest cal d,serrano,in which the supreme court struck down a public school financing system based on local real property assessed valuations,because an educational system which produces disparities of opportunity based upon district wealth violates principles of equal protection.id.at.in serrano,the court afforded constitutional protection to students from poor districts because state law diminished that group fundamental right to an education equal to that of wealthy districts.id.at.see hartzell connell cal d.serrano is inapposite because it does not purport to identify the wealthy as a protected class 
in sum,there is no basis for holding that a heightened degree of scrutiny is appropriate for tax legislation merely because it impacts taxpayers who have an income of more than million annually.
b.a rational basis analysis applies to the review of taxation systems 
a tax should be sustained if we find that its classification is rationally related to achievement of a legitimate state purpose.western southern bd.of equalization,supra,at.so long as a system of taxation is supported by a rational basis,and is not palpably arbitrary,it will be upheld despite the absence of a precise,scientific uniformity of taxation.amador valley joint union high sch.dist.state bd.of equalization cal d,kahn shevin,fn,d.the legislature is not bound to tax every member of a class or none.it may make distinctions of degree having a rational basis,and when subjected to judicial scrutiny they must be presumed to rest on that basis if there is any conceivable state of facts which would support it.carmichael southern coal.carmichael.
in a rational basis analysis,any conceivable state purpose or policy may be considered by the courts.nordlinger hahn,d heller doe,d.the state has no obligation to produce evidence to sustain the rationality of a statutory classification,which may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data.heller doe,supra,at.the party challenging the constitutionality of a state law must negative every conceivable basis which might support it.ibid.a classification does not fail review because it is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.id.at.the burden of demonstrating the invalidity of a challenged classification rests squarely upon the party who assails it.board of medical examiners cal d.
c.there is a rational basis for taxing incomes over million 
the supreme court has long held that w here taxation is concerned and no specific federal right,apart from equal protection,is imperiled,the states have large leeway in making classifications and drawing lines which in their judgment produce reasonable systems of taxation.kahn shevin,supra,at.amador valley joint union high sch.dist.state bd.of equalization,supra,cal d at.the taxpayers argue that in arriving at a reasonable system of taxation,a state may not arbitrarily single out a specific group to bear the burden while excusing members.they maintain that there must be a rational connection between the group being taxed and the problem being addressed by the tax.
the taxpayers are mistaken in thinking that taxpayers in a particular tax bracket can not be singled out for an income tax to benefit society at large.
the supreme court has repeatedly held that inequalities which result from a singling out of one particular class for taxation or exemption,infringe no constitutional limitation.carmichael,supra,at.indeed,n othing is more familiar in taxation than the imposition of a tax upon a class or upon individuals who enjoy no direct benefit from its expenditure,and who are not responsible for the condition to be remedied.id.at.knox city of orland cal th,d,silicon valley taxpayers,santa clara county open space authority cal th,d,bay area cellular telephone city of union city th,d.a taxpayer can not object to a tax devoted to a public purpose,that the benefits paid and the persons to whom they are paid are unrelated to the persons taxed and the amount of the tax which they short,that those who pay the tax may not have contributed to the problem addressed by the tax and may not be benefited by the expenditure.carmichael,supra,at.
a tax is not an assessment of benefits.it is,as we have said,a means of distributing the burden of the cost of government.the only benefit to which the taxpayer is constitutionally entitled is that derived from his enjoyment of the privileges of living in an organized society,established and safeguarded by the devotion of taxes to public purposes.citation.any other view would preclude the levying of taxes except as they are used to compensate for the burden on those who pay them,and would involve the abandonment of the most fundamental principle of it exists primarily to provide for the common good.carmichael,supra,at.thomas gay.commonwealth edison montana,d.
in this instance,the taxpayers object that individuals with high incomes do not have a particular need or use for the mental health services funded by proposition,there is no connection between the group being assessed and the use of the funds collected.the argument fails,because there is no need to contrive a link between the taxpayer and the services being funded.for example,a corporation can not object to the use of the taxes which it pays for the maintenance of schools because it has no children.carmichael,supra,at.in short,the taxpayers can not resist the payment of the tax because it is not expended for purposes which are peculiarly beneficial to them.ibid.
the taxpayers assert that the tax imposed by proposition on individuals is arbitrary and capricious.a classification among taxpayers is arbitrary,oppressive or capricious if made to depend upon differences of color,race,nativity,religious opinions,political affiliations or other considerations having no possible connection with the duties of citizens as taxpayers,because exemptions from taxation based on such irrelevant classifications would be pure favoritism american sugar refining louisiana.amounting to c lear and hostile discriminations against particular persons and classes.magoun illinois trust savings bank.the taxpayers in this appeal do not fall into any forbidden category having no possible connection with the duty to pay taxes rather,the classification drawn here is based on the of income level.
taxpayer income is a valid basis for drawing distinctions between taxpayers,even if the result is an unequal burden among all taxpayers.the federal constitution imposes no restraints on the state in regard to unequal taxation.magoun illinois trust savings bank,supra,at.indeed,this whole argument of a right under the federal constitution to challenge the tax law on the ground of inequality in the burdens resulting from the operation of the law has been put at rest.id.at.the fourteenth amendment was not intended to compel the state to adopt an iron rule of equal taxation.id.at.
the tax imposed by proposition is not arbitrary merely because a person earning is subject to the tax,while a person earning is exempt.the government has leeway in drawing lines below which individuals are exempt from a tax.kahn shevin,supra,at.williams vermont,d.drawing a line,for purposes of taxation,is the type of distinction which the law is often called upon to make it separates large incomes which are taxed from the smaller ones which are exempt,as it marks here the difference between the proprietors of larger businesses who are taxed and the proprietors of smaller businesses who are not.carmichael,supra,at.upholding the imposition of an unemployment compensation tax on businesses with eight or more employees while exempting businesses with seven or fewer.
a tax will be upheld if it operates equally and uniformly upon all persons in similar circumstances.magoun illinois trust and savings bank,supra,at.the tax imposed by proposition operates equally and uniformly on all taxpayers who have an income in excess of million.
the taxpayers perceive themselves as victims of a populist movement to soak the rich.the desire of the majority of the electorate to
