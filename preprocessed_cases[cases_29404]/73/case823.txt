this is a case about the taxability of business and entertainment expenses spent on a canadian fishing trip.after the internal revenue service determined that the cost of townsend industries annual fishing trip was wages,it assessed deficiencies against the company for the and tax years.townsend paid a portion of the deficiency and filed a suit seeking a refund.after a bench trial,the district court found in favor of the government,held that the expenses involved in the trips were employee wages within the meaning of the internal revenue code,and ruled that a portion of these wages should have been withheld for income tax and social security and medicare taxes.townsend appeals that decision,and we reverse.
townsend industries,based in altoona,iowa,manufactures the,a product that allows offset printers to produce documents in a single pass through the printing press.for the last forty years,townsend has gathered its salespeople for an annual,meeting at its headquarters involving its corporate staff and some factory workers.following that meeting,the company has sponsored a fishing trip to a resort in ontario,canada two of the four days spent traveling the resort on a bus.aside from a dinner at which the company owner,robert townsend,and its ceo,john jorgenson,spoke about the state of the company,the employees and salespeople spent their time largely as they wished though the vast majority fished.nevertheless,business discussions were conducted on an basis during the trip.
we apply the same standards of review that we apply in other cases when we review a district court decision in a taxpayer suit to reclaim taxes paid.see united states boyle,d.accordingly,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.boles trucking,united states,cir citing boyle,at.the district court holding that townsend failed to establish that its trips had a business purpose is a legal conclusion that we review de novo.boyle,at.explaining that presence of elements constituting reasonable cause is a question of law.
the question of whether the cost of the trips amounted to taxable wages and whether townsend should have withheld a portion of these costs turns on whether each employee could have deducted these costs as business expenses.a taxpayer may exclude certain fringe benefits from his or her gross income and thereby avoid paying income tax on these benefits.section d of the internal revenue code excludes working condition fringe benefits from an individual wages and provides that working condition fringe means any property or services provided to an employee of the employer to the extent that,if the employee paid for such property or services,such payment would be allowable as a deduction under section or.d.
in turn,a allows a deduction for traveling expenses including amounts expended for meals and lodging other than amounts which are lavish or extravagant under the circumstances while away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business.a.any deduction for travel and entertainment is substantially limited by,which disallows deductions for certain expenses and provides heightened reporting requirements.section a a disallows deduction for entertainment expenses 
with respect to an activity which is of a type generally considered to constitute entertainment,amusement,or recreation,unless the taxpayer establishes that the item was directly related to,or,in the case of an item directly preceding or following a substantial and bona fide business discussion including business meetings at a convention or otherwise,that such item was associated with,the active conduct of the taxpayer trade or business.
a a emphasis added.section d adds an important substantiation requirement and forbids deductions for entertainment expenses 
unless the taxpayer substantiates by adequate records or by sufficient evidence corroborating the taxpayer own statement a the amount of such expense or other item,b the time and place of the travel,entertainment,amusement,recreation,or use of the facility or property,or the date and description of the gift,c the business purpose of the expense or other item,and d the business relationship to the taxpayer of persons entertained,using the facility or property,or receiving the gift.
the treasury department has promulgated regulations that provide a further gloss on the internal revenue code and that govern whether working condition fringe benefits and travel and entertainment expenses are deductible.for purposes of this case,which governs working condition fringes,adds nothing.section,which deals with traveling expenses,adds some important requirements to the deductibility of travel expenses and a provides that o nly such traveling expenses as are reasonable and necessary in the conduct of the taxpayer business and directly attributable to it may be deducted.a emphasis added.the regulation then explains that where personal and business travel are mixed,travel expenses may only be deducted if the trip is related primarily to the taxpayer trade or business.b.however,even if the trip is not primarily,expenses which are properly allocable to the taxpayer trade or business may still be deducted.id.
the regulations governing of the internal revenue code add additional requirements for this section directly related to and substantiation requirements.section c add four requirements that the taxpayer must meet in order to deduct entertainment and travel expenses.the expense will only be considered directly related to,or associated with,the active conduct of business if 
i the taxpayer had more than a general expectation of deriving some income or other specific trade or business benefit 
ii the taxpayer actively engaged in a business meeting,negotiation,discussion,or other bona fide business transaction,other than entertainment,for the purpose of obtaining such income or other specific trade or business benefit 
iii in light of all the facts and circumstances of the case,the principal character or aspect of the combined business and entertainment was the active conduct of the taxpayer trade or business it is not necessary that more time be devoted to business than to entertainment to meet this requirement.the active conduct of trade or business is considered not to be the principal character or aspect of combined business and entertainment activity on hunting or fishing trips unless the taxpayer clearly establishes to the contrary.
iv the expenditure was allocable to the taxpayer and a person or persons with whom the taxpayer engaged in the active conduct of trade or business during the entertainment 
c i iv.temporary regulations govern the adequate records requirement in d and explain that in the absence of written,contemporaneous records,the taxpayer must establish the business nature of the expense b y his own statement,whether written or oral,containing specific information in detail and b y other corroborative evidence sufficient to establish the business nature of the expense.id.c i a b.
what these many statutes and regulations boil down to is a requirement that townsend prove that its fishing trips were reasonable and necessary business expenses that were directly related to,or associated with,the active conduct of townsend business.further,townsend must demonstrate its business purpose by showing that it had more than a general expectation of deriving some income or other trade or business benefit from the trip that its employees actively engaged in business meetings,negotiations,discussions,or other bona fide business transactions and that the principal character of the combined business and entertainment was the active conduct of townsend trade or business.finally,townsend faces an evidentiary hurdle and must prove the business nature of its expenses by adequate records,by its own statements,or by other corroborative evidence.
the district court determined that townsend failed to establish a business purpose and ruled in favor of the government.the district court first determined that the fishing trips were not an ordinary and necessary business expense in light of the lax attendance policy for the trip,and the disconnect between the sales meeting and the fishing trip.order at.notwithstanding townsend unusual,inclusive business philosophy,the district court determined that there was only a brief business meeting held during each of the trips and that it could not say that a voluntary,fishing trip with one brief business meeting was an ordinary and necessary business expense.id.at.nor,the district court ruled,could townsend have met the test set out in c i iv.the district court concluded that each trip was not an integral part of townsend employees ability to perform their jobs,it was not a part or a continuation of a sales meeting,but rather was a relaxed and fun event where business was discussed as part of the background to the primary fishing endeavor.id.at.further,townsend general expectation to derive uncertain future benefits,particularly in the way of improved comradery sic and relations among its employees and sales personnel,is not enough to allow the trips to qualify as directly related under section a.id.further still,the district court concluded that townsend could not establish that its trips were associated with the active conduct of its business because the trips were not conducted before or after a business discussion and,therefore,the business discussions that occurred in iowa on monday and tuesday were too far distanced temporally from the fishing trip that took place the following four days for this court to find the associated with test met.id.at.finally,the district court concluded that,in any event,townsend failed to meet the substantiation requirements insofar as the witnesses recollections of fishing trips from different years ran together and the trial testimony lacked the necessary specificity about townsend business purpose.id.at.we disagree with the district court holding that the evidence presented at trial failed to establish a business purpose for townsend and trips.
simply put,the testimony elicited at trial clearly established that the and trips were business trips and that townsend properly excluded the trip expenses from its employees gross income.although the amount of contemporaneous,written evidence was negligible,townsend and the government provided sufficient statement s containing specific information in detail to establish the business nature of the trips.c i 
in the first place,we can not agree that district court conclusion that the voluntary nature of the trips rendered them an undeductible business expense.although the trips were voluntary,nearly all of the townsend employees who testified felt an obligation to attend and some felt that it was part of their job.moreover,robert townsend,the owner,testified that while he felt it would be antithetical to his business philosophy to make the trips mandatory,he and other senior management definitely encourage employees to attend and that w hat we want to do is to get them to go,and we do lean on them.trial tr.at.john jorgensen,the ceo,testified that i encourage them to go.i visit with them about the fishing trip,about the activities.i definitely encourage everyone to go.id.at.jorgensen further testified about specific attempts he made to encourage different employees to attend the event dean evans,the chief engineer,added that he felt a responsibility to attend and that,for his part,he did not even look forward to the event 
i like the environment up there.it very beautiful,but it actually the culmination of a year worth of work,because the fishing trip is where we launch products,introduce it to our staff,and so it a pretty tough time.usually we been at it pretty hard to get it done at that particular date,so it trying times.
trial tr.at.in short,the record leaves us with little doubt but that the townsend employees viewed the annual trip as part of their regular course of business.
more so than the voluntary or involuntary nature of the trip,the real crux of the matter for townsend is the extent to which it could prove the trips were a reasonable and necessary business trip whether they were directly related to,or associated with,the active conduct of townsend business and whether the principal character of the events was the active conduct of business.our review of the entire record convinces us that the business nature of the trip was well established by the witnesses who testified both for and against townsend.although some witnesses did admit that the annual trips ran together,more witnesses agreed that specific business was conducted during the and trips and that certain activities were always conducted.
for instance,a number of witnesses testified that in many discussions focused on the need to introduce a new model to compete with the ryobi press and that in,the new anniversary edition ae press was introduced.dean evans described the genesis of the ae press saying 
in,the fishing trip in,there was some competition for our product.it was called a ryobi,and it was beating us up pretty good,so a lot of people wanted us to come up with something more user friendly that would compete directly and enhance the product enough that people would look our way rather than to the ryobi,and that was probably the initiation of the ae,because that was what we tried to develop,something to compete directly with the.
trial tr.at.for his part,russell brock,an independent distributor,testified that there would have been a tremendous amount of discussion about the new press at the fishing trip.id.at.he further testified,during the government,that i think the purpose of the sales meeting fishing trip was to launch the ae anniversary edition press and that townsend intended to show it to us at the sales meeting.we would then have any discussions that we needed to on the fishing trip as a carryover.id.at.the testimony of david dejoode,edward kalupa,and roger perin regarding the conception and birth of the ae press was to the same effect.
in addition to testimony about the anniversary edition press,many witnesses testified about discussions regarding the complexity of the press and problems that customers,employees,and salespeople who also repaired the machine had with its parts.for example,edward kalupa and russell brock independent salespeople both testified that they had discussions with several townsend employees regarding the cylinder problems in townsend model.id.at,see also id.at,problems with the model in,problems with model in.many witnesses also testified that the fishing trips were a unique opportunity for the national sales team to interact with the townsend employees who manufacture and assemble the intricate parts and those who send out replacement parts.this interaction was important,they stated,because small changes in the attention that the factory workers paid to their work such as removing all the burrs on metal parts had a major impact on the amount of repair work the sales force had to do and decreased the number and frequency of repairs.see,id.at.thus,the opportunity for one of the independent salespeople to tell a townsend employee in person about his mile round trip to repair a press damaged by too many burrs left on a gear made a major impression.more generally,factory employees and sales people stated that they gained a better understanding of townsend business at these events.see,id.at.
further,replacement parts are a major part of townsend business and both the sales staff and the townsend employees involved in parts distribution indicated that improvements such as new parts codes and increased accuracy in the parts sent were conceived on the trips.id.at.in fact,such was the pace of life at the townsend plant that one employee in the parts department indicated that the fishing trip was one rare opportunity that he had to have a reasoned conversation with his supervisor about their work.id.at see also id.at supervisor confirms conversation.
another particularly telling piece of evidence that buttresses our conclusion that townsend met its burden and established a bona fide business purpose for its trips is the fact that townsend stopped including its plastics division in the annual trip in,three years before townsend sold the divis
