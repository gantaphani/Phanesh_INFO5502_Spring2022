this is a tax dispute brought by two unmarried of real property,bruce voss and charles sophy.for the and tax years,voss and sophy each claimed a home mortgage interest deduction under h of the internal revenue code,which allows taxpayers to deduct interest on up to million of home acquisition debt and of home equity debt.after an audit,the irs determined that voss and sophy were jointly subject to h million and debt limits and thus disallowed a substantial portion of their claimed deductions.voss and sophy challenged the irs assessment in tax court,arguing that the statute debt limits apply per taxpayer such that they were entitled to deduct interest on up to million of home debt each.the tax court agreed with the irs.
we are now called upon to decide how h debt limit provisions apply when two or more unmarried of a residence claim the home mortgage interest deduction.although the statute is silent as to unmarried,we infer from the statute treatment of married individuals filing separate returns that h debt limits apply to unmarried on a basis.we accordingly reverse the decision of the tax court and remand for a recalculation of petitioners tax liability.
section of the internal revenue code governs the deductibility of interest on a taxpayer indebtedness.this section of the tax code,like much of the code,is complex it requires attention to definitions within definitions and exceptions upon exceptions.to assist the reader,we begin with a brief overview of the section relevant provisions.
section begins with the general rule that interest on indebtedness is deductible.see a.subsection h,however,provides that,i n the case of a taxpayer other than a corporation,personal interest is not deductible.see id.h in the case of a taxpayer other than a corporation,no deduction shall be allowed under this chapter for personal interest paid or accrued during the taxable year.nevertheless,personal interest is defined rather technically as any interest allowable as a deduction other than certain specified categories of interest.see id.h.one of those categories is any qualified residence interest within the meaning of paragraph.id.h d.
section h thus provides that interest on a qualified residence is not personal interest and,accordingly,may be deducted by taxpayers who are not corporations.the code defines qualified residence as the taxpayer principal residence and other residence of the taxpayer which is selected by the taxpayer for purposes of this subsection for the taxable year and which is used by the taxpayer as a residence.id.h a i.
qualified residence interest encompasses interest payments on two types of debt acquisition indebtedness and home equity indebtedness.id.h a.acquisition indebtedness generally means debt incurred in,or that results from the refinancing of debt incurred in,acquiring,constructing,or substantially improving a qualified residence.id.h b i.home equity indebtedness generally means indebtedness,other than acquisition indebtedness,that is secured by a qualified residence and that does not exceed the difference between the amount of acquisition indebtedness and the home fair market value.id.h c i.a home equity line of credit is a typical example of home equity indebtedness.so,for example,if a taxpayer has a purchase money mortgage or the refinancing of such a mortgage on both a primary home and a summer home,she can deduct interest payments on both mortgages.she may also deduct the interest on any home equity line of credit on both residences.
significantly,the statute does not allow taxpayers to deduct interest payments on an unlimited amount of acquisition and home equity indebtedness.instead,the statute limits t he aggregate amount treated as acquisition indebtedness for any period to and t he aggregate amount treated as home equity indebtedness for any period to.id.h b ii,c ii.i n the case of a married individual filing a separate return,however,the statute reduces the debt limits to and.id.we shall refer to these provisions as the debt limit provisions.
if a taxpayer total mortgage debt exceeds the debt limits,a treasury regulation,provides the method for calculating qualified residence interest.subsection e of that regulation sets out the usual method qualified residence interest is calculated by multiplying the total interest paid by the ratio of the applicable debt limit over the total debt.see id.e.for example,if a single individual has a million mortgage and a home equity line of credit,the ratio is million the total applicable debt limit under the statute over million the total debt.thus,the taxpayer is entitled to deduct of whatever interest is paid or accrued during her taxable year 
in sum,under and the applicable treasury regulation,a taxpayer may deduct the interest paid on a mortgage or home equity line of credit for a principal residence and a second home.for taxpayers other than married individuals filing a separate return,the deduction is limited to interest paid on million of mortgage debt and of home equity debt.if the taxpayer home indebtedness exceeds million,then she is entitled to deduct a portion of her interest,determined by the ratio of the statutory debt limit divided by her total actual debt.if the taxpayer is married filing a separate return,the debt limit is.
although the statute is specific with respect to a married taxpayer filing a separate return,the code does not specify whether,in the case of residence who are not married,the debt limits apply per residence or per taxpayer.that is,is the million debt limit the limit on the qualified residence,irrespective of the number of owners,or is it the limit on the debt that can be claimed by any individual taxpayer that gap in the code is the source of the present controversy.
bruce voss and charles sophy are domestic partners registered with the state of california.they two homes as joint tenants one in rancho mirage,california and the other,their primary residence,in beverly hills,california.
when voss and sophy purchased the rancho mirage home in,they took out a mortgage,secured by the property.two years later,they refinanced that mortgage and obtained a new mortgage,also secured by the property,in the amount of.voss and sophy are jointly and severally liable for the refinanced rancho mirage mortgage.
voss and sophy purchased the beverly hills home in.they financed the purchase of the beverly hills home with a mortgage,secured by the beverly hills property.about a year later,they refinanced the mortgage by obtaining a new loan in the amount of.voss and sophy are jointly and severally liable for the refinanced beverly hills mortgage,which,like the original mortgage,is secured by the beverly hills property.at the same time as they refinanced the beverly hills mortgage,voss and sophy also obtained a home equity line of credit of for the beverly hills home.voss and sophy are jointly and severally liable for the home equity line of credit as well.
the total average balance of the two mortgages and the line of credit in and the two taxable years at issue was about million in and in.thus,whether h debt limit provisions are interpreted as applying per taxpayer such that voss and sophy can deduct interest on up to million of debt or per residence such that voss and sophy can deduct interest on up to million of debt,it is in either event clear that voss and sophy debt exceeds the statutory debt limits.
voss and sophy each filed separate federal income tax returns for taxable years and.in their respective returns,voss and sophy each claimed home mortgage interest deductions for interest paid on the two mortgages and the home equity line of credit.the parties agree on the amounts of interest voss and sophy each paid for those years voss paid in and in,and sophy paid in and in.the total interest paid was in and in.
on their respective returns,voss and sophy each claimed a home mortgage interest deduction of,for a total of.voss and sophy now agree that this was at least too much because voss and sophy together only paid in interest that year.the additional amount represents interest that voss paid on december,and was thus not deductible by either voss or sophy for taxable year.for taxable year,voss and sophy claimed less mortgage interest than they actually paid voss claimed a deduction of,and sophy claimed a deduction of.
the irs audited the and returns and,in,assessed notices of deficiency to voss and sophy.the irs calculated each petitioner mortgage interest deduction by applying a limitation ratio to the total amount of mortgage interest that each petitioner paid in each taxable year.the limitation ratio was the same for both voss and sophy million million of home acquisition debt plus of home equity debt over the entire average balance,for each taxable year,on the beverly hills mortgage,the beverly hills home equity line of credit,and the rancho mirage mortgage.
using that method,the irs concluded that voss was allowed to deduct in and in.the irs thus disallowed of voss claimed deduction in and of his claimed deduction in.the irs also found sophy returns deficient.the irs concluded that sophy was allowed to deduct in and in.the irs thus disallowed of sophy claimed deduction in and of his claimed deduction in.
voss and sophy each filed a petition with the tax court,and the two cases were consolidated for joint consideration.the tax court granted the parties joint motion to submit the cases for decision without trial and on the basis of stipulated facts and exhibits,and directed the parties to submit proposed computations for entry of decision.
based on the stipulated facts,exhibits,and proposed computations submitted by the parties,the tax court reached a decision and issued an opinion in the irs favor.the tax court framed the question presented as whether the statutory limitations on the amount of acquisition and home equity indebtedness with respect to which interest is deductible under section h are properly applied on a or basis when residence are not married to each other.sophy comm r.
the tax court began its analysis by looking to the definitions of acquisition indebtedness and home equity indebtedness in h b i and c i id.at.the tax court noted that the term any indebtedness in both definitions is not qualified by language relating to an individual taxpayer as in any indebtedness of the taxpayer.id.the tax court also pointed out that the phrase of the taxpayer in the definition of acquisition indebtedness is used only in relation to the qualified residence as in qualified residence of the taxpayer,not the indebtedness.id.
the tax court then examined the definition of qualified residence interest id.the tax court noted that the phrase with respect to any qualified residence in that definition appeared to be superfluous,as acquisition indebtedness and home equity indebtedness were already defined in relation to a qualified residence.id.at.the tax court nevertheless found that the phrase was not superfluous because,in its view,congress used these repeated references to emphasize the point that qualified residence interest and the related indebtedness limitations are residence focused rather than taxpayer focused.id.at.
the tax court further reasoned that the parentheticals were consistent with its interpretation,as the parentheticals made clear that married couples whether filing separately or jointly are,as a couple,limited to deducting interest on million of acquisition indebtedness and of home equity indebtedness.id.the purpose of the parentheticals,the tax court explained,was simply 
to set out a specific allocation of the limitation amounts that must be used by married couples filing separate tax returns,thus implying that who are not married to one another may choose to allocate limitation amounts among themselves in some other manner,such as according to percentage of ownership.
noting that nothing in the legislative history of h suggested any contrary intention,the tax court concluded that the limitations in section h b ii and c ii on the amounts that may be treated as acquisition and home equity indebtedness with respect to a qualified residence are properly applied on a basis.id.
we have jurisdiction to review the decisions of the tax court in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions tried without a jury.a.accordingly,we review the tax court factual findings for clear error,and we review the tax court conclusions of law including its interpretation of the internal revenue code de novo.suzy zoo comm r,cir.
we are asked to decide an issue of first impression when multiple unmarried taxpayers a qualifying residence,do the debt limit provisions found in h b ii and c ii apply per taxpayer or per residence we conclude that h debt limits apply per taxpayer 
we begin with the text of the key provisions at issue h debt limit provisions.they provide 
b acquisition indebtedness.
ii limitation.the aggregate amount treated as acquisition indebtedness for any period shall not exceed in the case of a married individual filing a separate return.
c home equity indebtedness.
ii limitation.the aggregate amount treated as acquisition indebtedness for any period shall not exceed in the case of a separate return by a married individual.
id.h b ii,c ii.
the parties dispute whether the million and debt limits in these provisions apply per taxpayer or per residence.if they apply per taxpayer,then voss and sophy are each entitled to a million debt limit,such that together they can deduct interest payments on up to million of acquisition and home equity debt.if the debt limit provisions apply per residence,as the tax court held,then the million and debt limits must be divided up in some way between voss and sophy.
discerning an answer from h requires considerable effort on our part because the statute is silent as to how the debt limits should apply in situations both provisions limit t he aggregate amount treated as acquisition or home equity debt,but neither says to whom or what the limits apply.had congress wanted to make clear that the debt limits apply per taxpayer,it could have drafted the provisions to limit the aggregate amount each taxpayer may treat as acquisition or home equity debt.but it did not.or,had congress wanted to make clear that the debt limits apply per residence,it could have provided that the debt limits must be divided or allocated in the event that two or more unmarried individuals a qualified residence.a c if two or more individuals who are not married purchase a principal residence,the amount of the homebuyer credit allowed shall be allocated among such individuals in such manner as the secretary may prescribe,except that the total amount of the credits allowed to all such individuals shall not exceed.but,again,it did not.
although congress did neither of these things,we are not altogether without textual guidance.the statute is mostly silent about how to deal with situations,but it is not entirely silent.both debt limit provisions contain a parenthetical that speaks to one common situation of married individuals filing separate returns.see id.h b ii,c ii.the parentheticals provide debt limits in the case of a married individual filing a separate return.id congress use of the phrase in the case of is important.it suggests,first,that the parentheticals contain an exception to the general debt limit set out in the main clause,not an illustration of how that general debt limit should be applied.at the same time,the phrase in the case of also suggests a certain parallelism between the parenthetical and the main clause of each provision other than the debt limit amount,which differs,we can expect that in all respects the case of a married individual filing a separate return should be treated like any other case.it is thus appropriate to look to the parentheticals when interpreting the main clauses general debt limit provisions.these parentheticals offer us at least three useful insights.
first,the parentheticals clearly speak in terms the limit on acquisition indebtedness is in the case of a married individual filing a separate return,id.h b ii emphasis added,and the limit on home equity indebtedness is in the case of a separate return by a married individual,id.h c ii emphasis added.and they speak in such terms even though married individuals commonly and perhaps usually their homes and are jointly and severally liable on any mortgage debt.had congress wanted to draft the parentheticals in terms,doing so would not have been particularly difficult.congress could have written,in the case of any qualified residence of a married individual filing a separate return.yet,once again,congress did not draft the statute in that way.the wording of the parentheticals,considered in light of the parentheticals use of the phrase in the case of,thus suggests that the wording of the main clause in particular,the phrase aggregate amount treated should likewise be understood in a manner.
second,the parentheticals do just speak in terms they operate in a manner.the parentheticals give each separately filing spouse a separate debt limit of so that,together,the two spouses are effectively entitled to a million debt limit the normal limit for single taxpayers.they do not subject both spouses jointly to the debt limit specified in the statute.were the parentheticals to work in that way,the result would be quite anomalous.rather than ensuring that a married couple filing separate returns is treated the same as a couple filing a joint return,the parentheticals,under a reading,would result in disparate treatment of married couples filing separate returns.the separately filing couple would have a debt limit,whereas the jointly filing couple,and even the single individual,would have a million debt limit 
this is surely not what the statute intended,and we do understand the tax court or the irs to say otherwise.quite to the contrary,both acknowledge that the parentheticals lower limits apply per spouse which is just another way of saying per taxpayer.see sophy,at interpreting the parentheticals to mean that married taxpayers who file separate returns are limited to acquisition indebtedness of each and to home equity indebtedness of each emphasis added see also bronstein comm r,t he parenthetical indebtedness limitations of section h b ii and c ii are for each spouse filing a separate return.emphasis added.and if the debt limits for spouses filing separately apply per spouse,we see no reason in the statute why the debt limits for unmarried individuals should not apply per unmarried individual the operation of the debt limits for married individuals filing separately thus suggests that the general debt limits also operate per taxpayer.
third,and finally,the very inclusion of the parentheticals suggests that the debt limits apply per taxpayer.it is a rule of statutory construction that courts should not interpret statutes in a way that renders a provision superfluous.chubb custom ins.space loral,cir,cert.denied.if the million debt limit truly applied per residence,as the tax court held it does,the parentheticals would be superfluous,as there would be no need to provide that two spouses filing separately get each.if the million debt limit applies per taxpayer,by contrast,the parentheticals actually do something they give each separately filing spouse half the debt limit so that the separately filing couple is,as a unit,subject to the same debt limit as a jointly filing couple.
the tax court interpreted the parentheticals differently.the purpose of the parentheticals,according to the tax court,is not to lower the debt limits for spouses filing separate returns the spouses are already jointly subject to the million debt limit.rather,the tax court explained,
this language simply appears to set out a specific allocation of the limitation amounts that must be used by married couples filing separate tax returns,thus implying that who are not married to one another may choose to allocate the limitation amounts among themselves in some other manner,such as according to percentage of ownership.
sophy,at emphasis added.
we find this interpretation unpersuasive.in particular,we think it unlikely that congress would go out of its way to prevent spouses and only spouses from allocating h debt limit amounts,especially when in most cases spouses presumably own their home as equal partners.the much more likely intent of the parentheticals,we think,is to ensure that married couples filing a separate return are treated the same,for purposes of h,as married couples filing a joint return in other words,to ensure that all married couples,not just joint filers,are treated as though they were a single taxpayer.
section h is not the only provision in the tax code that does this.congress has on a number of occasions provided deductions,credits,or limits for separately filing spouses.see,c a providing an initial credit of to a qualifying married couple filing jointly and in the case of a married individual filing a separate return,id.b providing that,for purposes of the code exclusion for gain from certain small business stock,the million limitation on eligible gain is reduced to million i n the case of a separate return by a married individual,id.b limiting allowable net capital losses to in the case of a married individual filing a separate return.
the purpose of these provisions is obvious.in each provision,each taxpayer gets some tax benefit a credit,an exclusion up to some limit,allowable losses up to some limit,or,here,a deduction on interest on home debt up to some limit.congress,knowing that joint filers are treated as a single taxpayer and that separate filers are treated as two separate taxpayers,wants to ensure that the separately filing spouses do get double the benefit that jointly filing couples get.and so,in each of these provisions,congress provides that separately filing spouses each get half the benefit.the intent of these provisions is not to prevent separately filing spouses from allocating the benefit it is to ensure that the separately filing spouses do get double the credit,the exclusion,the losses,or the debt limit that the jointly filing couple gets 
if congress wants to go further and ensure that two or more unmarried taxpayers are treated as a single taxpayer for purposes of a particular deduction or credit,it can do that too.and it has.take of the tax code,for example.that section sets an limit on the homebuyer credit but adds two caveats.see id.b.the first caveat is very similar to and,indeed,has much of the same language as the limitation provisions here.the statute states,in the case of a married individual filing a separate return,subparagraph a the provision containing the cap shall be applied by substituting for.id.b b.but,unlike the limitation provisions here,does not stop there.it has an additional provision the second caveat which states 
if two or more individuals who are not married purchase a principal residence,the amount of the credit allowed shall be allocated among such individuals in such manner as the secretary may prescribe,except that the total amount of the credits allowed to all such individuals shall not exceed.
id.b c emphasis added.
as makes clear,congress knows how to treat a group of unmarried taxpayers as a single taxpayer for purposes of a particular tax benefit or burden.congress could have done so here,but tellingly it did not.instead,congress did what it has done many times before,using the same language it has used before it eliminated what would otherwise be a significant discrepancy between separately filing and jointly filing married couples by expressly reducing the debt limits for spouses filing separately.
in sum,the parentheticals language,purpose,and operation all strongly suggest that h debt limit provisions apply per taxpayer,not per residence.absent some contrary indication in the statute,then,we shall read the debt limit provisions as applying on a basis.
the tax court rejected a reading of the debt limit provisions because it discerned in h a general focus on the qualified residence,sophy,at,and a conspicuous absen ce of any reference to an individual taxpayer,id.at.because the debt limit provisions do not speak directly to the situation of unmarried,it was reasonable for the tax court to look beyond those provisions in an effort to understand how the provisions should be applied.ultimately,however,these other provisions of the statute do not sway us.
the tax court focused on three provisions in the statute,all definitions first,the definition of qualified residence interest as any interest which is paid or accrued during the taxable year on acquisition or home equity indebtedness with respect to any qualified residence of the taxpayer,h a emphasis added second,the,definition of acquisition indebtedness as any indebtedness which is incurred in acquiring,constructing,or substantially improving any qualified residence of the taxpayer,id.h b i emphasis added and third,the definition of home equity indebtedness as any indebtedness other than acquisition indebtedness secured by a qualified residence,id.h c i emphasis added.sophy,at.in each definition,the tax court highlighted the reference to the qualified residence and noted that the taxpayer was only ever mentioned with respect to the residence,not with respect to the indebtedness.id.
we,however,do not find the statute focus on the residence or lack of focus on the taxpayer particularly compelling.as for the repeated references to the residence,it is only natural that a statute providing a deduction on qualified residence interest will focus on indebtedness with respect to a qualified residence.indeed,for the most part,the statute references to the qualified residence are entirely necessary take those references out,and the statute would change meaning or make little sense.
the tax court did identify a few instances where a prepositional phrase involving the residence such as with respect to any qualified residence could have been safely omitted and was thus arguably superfluous,id.at,but the same could be said of other prepositional phrases involving the taxpayer such as of the taxpayer in all likelihood,these phrases,though technically unnecessary,were included simply to ease the reader understanding of a complex tax statute full of technical definitions.we certainly appreciate their inclusion.and,in any case,if there is a plausible inference to be drawn from those few stray prepositional phrases,it is overcome by the clear implications of the parentheticals discussed above.thus,in our view the statute focus on the residence says little about how the debt limit provisions should be applied.
nor do we find the occasional omission of the word taxpayer particularly telling.to begin with,two of the three definitions identified by the tax court do refer to the taxpayer,and all three depend on the definition of qualified residence,which itself refers to the taxpayer for more on the definition of qualified residence,see the next section below.setting to the side those references to the taxpayer,it is true that the three definitions identified by the tax court just like the debt limit provisions in h b ii and c ii do not specify who paid the interest,who incurred the indebtedness,and whose indebtedness was secured by a qualified residence.but when we look at the rest of and,we suspect,the rest of the tax code,the omission of the word taxpayer is anything but conspicuous.note,for example,how the word taxpayer is missing from the first line of,which states,there shall be allowed as a deduction all interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on indebtedness.id.a.there is no need for the sentence to say,there shall be allowed as a deduction to the taxpayer all interest paid by the taxpayer within the taxpayer taxable year on the taxpayer indebtedness.any reasonable reader would understand that the statute is speaking of a taxpayer.
or take the first line of h.it states that no deduction shall be allowed under this chapter for personal interest paid or accrued during the taxable year.id.h.again,the reader easily intuits that the statute refers to a taxpayer deduction,a taxpayer personal interest payments,and a taxpayer taxable year.indeed,there can be no doubt that is what h means because the statement just quoted follows the phrase,in the case of a taxpayer other than a corporation.id.emphasis added.
thus,although we do not fault the tax court for looking to other provisions in the statute for guidance,we would place little weight on the statute general focus on the residence or its repeated omission of reference to the taxpayer.if anything,these other provisions reinforce our reading they reveal that the debt limit provisions omission of the word taxpayer is actually quite ordinary in the context of the broader statute.
not only does nothing in the statute compel the tax court reading several of the statute provisions point the other way.we have already noted one example by speaking and operating in a manner,the parentheticals suggest that the general debt limits also apply per taxpayer.two other provisions also warrant attention.
first,we are guided by the statute repeated references to a single taxable year.section h begins by stating that no deduction shall be allowed under this chapter for personal interest paid or accrued during the taxable year.id.h emphasis added.likewise,h begins by defining qualified residence interest as any interest on acquisition or home equity debt which is paid or accrued during the taxable year.id.h a.indeed,the very provisions at issue,the debt limit provisions,cap the allowable amount of home debt for any period the word period clearly referring to the taxable year mentioned earlier in h.id.h b ii,c ii.
residences do not have taxable years only taxpayers do.and,importantly,taxpayers can have different taxable years.see b providing that a taxpayer taxable year may vary depending on the taxpayer annual accounting period.yet h speaks in terms of a single taxable year,thus implying that the debt limits apply per taxpayer.if congress truly intended to imply that h debt limits apply per residence by broadly focusing on the residence and consistently ignoring the taxpayer,it seems unlikely to us that it would at the same time define qualified residence interest with respect to a single taxable year.
moreover,it is unclear how with different taxable years could even determine t he aggregate amount treated as acquisition indebtedness for any period under a approach.does one tax period control or do the have to figure out some way of accounting for both tax periods keep in mind that mortgage balances usually change monthly.these difficult questions go away,however,when the debt limits are read to apply per taxpayer.each simply determines the interest paid and the average mortgage debt during his or her own tax period.
the tax court reading is also hard to square with the statute definition of qualified residence.somewhat,the term qualified residence can include one or two residences the principal residence within the meaning of section of the taxpayer,and other residence of the taxpayer which is selected by the taxpayer for purposes of this subsection for the taxable year and which is used by the taxpayer as a residence within the meaning of section d.id.h a i.contrary to the tax court reading of the statute,the term qualified residence clearly focuses on the taxpayer.the term includes the principal residence of the taxpayer and one other residence of the taxpayer that is used by the taxpayer as a residence and is selected by the taxpayer.id.the term also specifies that the taxpayer may select the secondary residence for the taxable year,suggesting that a taxpayer who owns multiple secondary residences can change his or her other residence from one tax year to the next.
more than just focusing on the taxpayer,the term qualified residence also highlights the impracticality of the tax court approach.as the term qualified residence is defined,it is entirely possible that two residence might each have a different qualified residence.for example,two individuals might each have a separate primary residence but go in together on a vacation home in maui.for such,filing tax returns under the tax court approach would be like running a race.the are tied together for one home but not the other.this would mean that the two or it could be three or four would have to coordinate their tax returns to ensure that the aggregate amount of acquisition debt for each taxpayer qualified residence does not exceed million.it would also mean that one deduction might depend on the size of another mortgage on a home in which the first has no interest.under a approach,by contrast,determining the amount of acquisition debt is free of such difficulties.each taxpayer can calculate the deduction with reference to his or her respective two residences.
these provisions the parentheticals,the repeated references to the single taxable year,and the definition of qualified residence are at odds with the tax court reading of h.each provision focuses on the individual taxpayer,and the impracticality of applying the provisions under a approach suggests that congress never intended that approach.we thus conclude that a reading of the statute debt limit provisions is most consistent with h as a whole 
the irs argues that applying h debt limit provisions on a basis creates a marriage penalty.we agree that it does,but we do not believe the marriage penalty is as significant a concern as the irs urges.
congress may have had perfectly legitimate reasons for distinguishing between married and unmarried taxpayers.married individuals,unlike unmarried individuals,have the option under the tax code of filing a joint return.this option offers significant benefits in particular,lower tax rates at various levels of income.but it not all honeymoon filing jointly also comes with certain drawbacks.a couple filing a joint return might,for example,receive one tax credit where the same couple filing separate tax returns might receive two credits.it would appear that,in congress view,the home mortgage interest deduction is one such drawback.if two individuals who are engaged to be married each own their own house and each have their own million mortgage,both get to deduct all of their interest.but if they get married and file a joint return,they are treated as one taxpayer and can then only deduct half of their interest.see pau,cch at.this is a marriage penalty,but congress presumably allows the marriage penalty because the couple also receives offsetting benefits available only to married couples filing a joint return.
of course,a married couple filing separate returns does not receive the benefits of filing a joint return.is it unfair,then,that they are treated as a single taxpayer while the unmarried couple is not perhaps not,for the married couple,unlike the unmarried couple,can usually elect to file a joint return.and perhaps congress did not want separately filing married couples to have a significant advantage over jointly filing married couples.
we have already explained that the apparent purpose of the parentheticals is to ensure that married couples are treated as a single taxpayer for purposes of the home mortgage interest deduction regardless of whether they file separately or jointly.and the same purpose is evident in other provisions as well.for example,the statute provides that married couples filing separate returns generally shall be treated as taxpayer for purposes of the definition of qualified residence.h a ii i.like the debt limit provisions,this provision does not explicitly say whether the same is true of married couples filing a joint return,but we can reasonably infer that congress also intended to treat jointly filing couples as a single taxpayer.see irs field service advisory,opining,that a lthough h a does not specifically state that a married couple filing jointly is treated as one taxpayer for purposes of determining their mortgage interest deductions,we assume that congress did not intend to treat married couples filing jointly differently than married couples filing separately.
we thus agree that the debt limit provisions of h result in a marriage penalty but we are not particularly troubled.congress may very well have good reasons for allowing that result,and,in any event,congress clearly singled out married couples for specific treatment when it explicitly provided lower debt limits for married couples yet,for whatever reason,did not similarly provide lower debt limits for unmarried.
the dissent urges us to defer to the irs interpretation of the statute in a chief counsel advice memorandum.dissent at.the memorandum,like the tax court below,adopts a interpretation of h debt limit provisions.its statutory analysis consists of one paragraph,which reads 
under h b i,acquisition indebtedness is defined,in relevant part,as indebtedness incurred in acquiring a qualified residence of the taxpayer not as indebtedness incurred in acquiring a taxpayer portion of a qualified residence.the entire amount of indebtedness incurred in acquiring the qualified residence constitutes acquisition indebtedness under h a i u nder h b ii,the amount treated as acquisition indebtedness for purposes of the qualified residence interest deduction is limited to of total,aggregate acquisition indebtedness.this is evident from the parenthetical in h b ii which limits the aggregate treated as acquisition indebtedness to for a married taxpayer filing a separate return.
irs chief counsel advice,at.
as the dissent acknowledges,the irs chief counsel advice is only entitled to the measure of deference proportional to the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade.christopher smithkline beecham,quoting united states mead,see also christensen harris,interpretations such as those in policy statements,agency manuals,and enforcement guidelines,all of which lack the force of not warrant chevron style deference.
a review of these factors suggests the chief counsel advice should be given limited weight.to start,the chief counsel advice is hardly thorough or exhaustive its analysis interpreting how the statute should apply to unmarried consists of just one paragraph.it treats the question as one governed by the plain language of the statute,irs chief counsel advice,at,yet as our exchange,the briefs of the parties,the tax court decision,and the statute itself demonstrate,it is anything but plain.the chief counsel advice does not grapple with the statute definition of qualified residence or repeated references to a taxpayer taxable year,nor does it explain how the parenthetical is anything but surplusage under a reading of the statute.
as for consistency,the situation here is a far cry from that in hall united states,a case the dissent cites.see dissent at.in hall,the supreme court s aw no reason to depart from those established understandings of bankruptcy courts,bankruptcy commentators,and the irs consistent position for over a decade in an irs chief counsel advice memorandum,the internal revenue manual,and an irs litigation guideline memorandum.see hall.at.here,by contrast,there is no comparable consensus.aside from the irs litigation position in this case,it appears that the chief counsel advice which is just six years old is the irs only pronouncement addressing how h debt limits apply to unmarried the agency guidance is closer to a mere litigating position than to an agency interpretation of longstanding duration.dissent at quoting alaska dep t of envtl.conservation epa.
even putting all that aside,we are not persuaded by the reasoning in the irs guidance.the chief counsel advice reasons that acquisition indebtedness is defined in the statute as indebtedness incurred in acquiring a qualified residence of the taxpayer not as indebtedness incurred in acquiring a taxpayer portion of a qualified residence,and concludes that unmarried are limited to of total,aggregate acquisition indebtedness.irs chief counsel advice,at.but this begs the question.as we have explained,although the statute limits t he aggregate amount treated as acquisition or home equity debt,it does not say to whom or what the limits apply.
indeed,we are not convinced the dissent is fully persuaded by the chief counsel advice either.although the dissent extols the irs reasonable and persuasive position,dissent at,the dissent only briefly discusses the chief counsel actual reasoning.and as for the irs arguments on appeal,the dissent shies away from the irs principal argument,that the focus of the statute is on the residence,not on the taxpayer.we have explained in part why this argument fails,yet the dissent offers no response.
what is more,in one important respect,the dissent rejects the irs interpretation.according to the dissent,the parenthetical is not superfluous because it imposes a statutory penalty on married individuals who decide to file separately.id.at.under this view,two unmarried are entitled to a total debt limit of million,a married couple filing jointly is entitled to a total debt limit of million,and even a single individual is entitled to a total debt limit of million but a married couple filing separately is entitled to a total debt limit of.see id.at.
to our knowledge,however,neither the irs nor the tax court has ever adopted the dissent interpretation.as the irs explained in its brief on appeal,the parenthetical language in the acquisition indebtedness limitation in h b ii provides that married taxpayers who file separate returns are limited to acquisition indebtedness of each.emphasis added.accord sophy,at m arried taxpayers who file separate returns are limited to acquisition indebtedness of each emphasis added bronstein,at t he parenthetical indebtedness limitations are for each spouse filing a separate return.emphasis added irs chief counsel advice,at explaining that the operation of the million limit on acquisition indebtedness is evident from the parenthetical,thus implying that each separately filing spouse gets a separate aggregate debt limit.on this issue there is a consensus,and the dissent is on the wrong side.
at bottom,although an irs chief counsel advice statement is helpful in determining the position of the irs,it is an internal irs memorandum prepared by an individual irs attorney.wells fargo united states,fed.cl.the document itself cautions that it may not be used or cited as precedent.irs chief counsel advice,at.indeed,the irs could issue a memorandum taking the opposite position tomorrow,apparently without revoking the earlier guidance.wells fargo,fed.cl.at.
every factor the dissent says we should consider suggests that the irs interpretation should not be given significant weight.having considered the irs reasoning as set out in the chief counsel advice and the irs briefs on appeal,we decline to adopt its interpretation.
we hold that h debt limit provisions apply on a basis to unmarried of a qualified residence.we infer this conclusion from the text of the statute by expressly providing that married individuals filing separate returns are entitled to deduct interest on up to of home debt each,congress implied that unmarried filing separate returns are entitled to deduct interest on up to million of home debt each.we accordingly reverse the tax court decision and remand for the limited purpose of allowing the parties to determine,in a manner consistent with this opinion,the proper amount of qualified residence interest that petitioners are entitled to deduct,as well as the proper amount of any remaining deficiency.
reversed and remanded.
today the majority interprets the tax code to allow unmarried taxpayers who buy an expensive residence together to deduct twice the amount of interest paid on the debt secured by their residence than spouses would be allowed to deduct.while the language of the relevant statute is ambiguous,the irs has offered an interpretation that limits unmarried taxpayers in this situation to deducting the same amount as married taxpayers filing jointly.because we should defer to this reasonable interpretation by the irs,i dissent.
the internal revenue code provides that interest paid or accrued on indebtedness shall generally be allowed as a federal tax deduction.a.deductions for personal interest paid or accrued are generally disallowed.id.h.congress made an exception from this disallowance for qualified residence interest within the meaning of h.id.h.qualified residence interest is defined in h as follows 
qualified residence interest for purposes of this subsection 
a in general.the term qualified residence interest means any interest which is paid or accrued during the taxable year on 
i acquisition indebtedness with respect to any qualified residence of the taxpayer,or 
ii home equity indebtedness with respect to any qualified residence of the taxpayer.
the statute defines qualified residence as the principal residence of a taxpayer and one other selected home used as a residence.id.h a i.the term acquisition indebtedness,is defined as debt incurred in acquiring,constructing,or substantially improving any qualified residence of the taxpayer,and which is secured by such residence.id.h b.but not all such debt counts as acquisition indebtedness.rather,t he aggregate amount treated as acquisition indebtedness for any period shall not exceed in the case of a married individual filing a separate return.id.h b ii.similarly,the term home equity indebtedness is defined as indebtedness other than acquisition indebtedness secured by a qualified residence id.h c i.but again,not all the debt secured by the qualified residence counts as home equity indebtedness.like the case of acquisition indebtedness,t he aggregate amount treated as home equity indebtedness for any period shall not exceed in the case of a separate return by a married individual.id.h c ii.
the irs has adopted a straightforward application of this statute when there is a single taxpayer or a married couple filing jointly.if a qualified residence serves as security for debt that is more than the specified million,only the interest payments on the allowed million of the debt are deductible.in the case of an individual taxpayer,the irs calculates the proportion of the taxpayer total interest payments that is deductible by dividing the million of debt by the total amount of debt secured by the qualified residence.see e chief couns.advice,irs cca,wl so if the qualified residence is security for million in debt,the taxpayer can calculate the proportion of interest payments that is deductible by dividing million the total aggregate debt allowed by the statute by million the total amount of debt secured by the qualified residence.the result is that the taxpayer can deduct one half of the interest the taxpayer paid on the total debt.
similarly,spouses filing jointly are subject to the limit on acquisition indebtedness and the limit on home equity indebtedness.see pau comm r,cch,wl,at.this approach is consistent with the tax code typical treatment of a married couple filing jointly as one taxpayer,who together have an aggregate debt and together are subject to the statutory limit on how much interest they may deduct.see,b i a husband and wife who file a joint income tax return are treated as one taxpayer in determining the amount of the dollar limitation under this section.j s pouses filing a joint return for a taxable year shall be treated for such year as one taxpayer for purposes of section.
the irs has also explained how this methodology applies when there are unmarried of a qualified residence.see chief couns.advice,irs cca,wl.under the irs interpretation,regardless of the number of unmarried taxpayers who have an ownership interest in a qualified residence,only interest payments on million of the debt encumbering that qualified residence are deductible.therefore,the irs applies its formula as follows each who has an ownership interest in the qualified residence may deduct a percentage of the interest payments the paid or accrued,in proportion to the total aggregate debt allowed by the statute million divided by the total amount of debt secured by the qualified residence.in other words,if a taxpayer has an ownership interest in a qualified residence that is security for million of debt,the taxpayer can deduct one half of the interest payments that the taxpayer made on that debt million debt allowed by statute divided by million debt secured by the qualified residence.the other can do the same.
bruce voss and charles sophy argue that we should reject the irs interpretation of h and allow them double the deductible interest that an individual taxpayer or married couple filing jointly would get.voss and sophy are an unmarried couple who both claim the same qualified residence,which is comprised of two houses.in order to purchase their primary home in beverly hills,california,they took out a loan.they also borrowed another home equity line of credit secured by the beverly hills home.in order to purchase their second home in rancho mirage,california,they took out a loan.voss and sophy purchased these houses as joint tenants,meaning that each had an undivided interest in the house.they also agreed to be jointly and severally liable on all loans.
voss and sophy filed separate tax returns for tax years and.the average balance on the two mortgages and home equity line of credit was approximately million in tax years and.nevertheless,both voss and sophy claimed deductions for the full amount of interest each had paid on the loans on their qualified residence 
the irs issued notices of deficiency because voss and sophy had claimed deductions that exceeded the limits allowed by the internal revenue code.according to the irs,voss and sophy could claim deductions for interest they had paid on the first million of the million debt,pursuant to h,and were not entitled to claim deductions for interest paid on the entire million of the debt.the tax court agreed.
on appeal,voss and sophy argue for a different interpretation of h and therefore a different application of the irs formula.voss and sophy claim that the million aggregate amount of debt that can be treated as acquisition and home equity indebtedness for purposes of h b does not relate to the total amount of debt encumbering a qualified residence.instead,if the total amount of debt encumbering a qualified residence exceeds million,the may effectively divide that total amount of debt between themselves and each deduct interest payments on up to million of their portion of the total debt.for example,if a million debt is secured by a qualified residence owned by two,voss and sophy claim that the can divide the debt equally between themselves.under this theory,co owner could deduct interest payments made on million of debt,percent of co owner interest payments,and of course,co owner could do the same thing.as a result,the could deduct interest payments on million of debt secured by their qualified residence,even though a married couple filing jointly or a single taxpayer could deduct interest on only million of debt.
applying their interpretation,voss argues that,because he and sophy each have an equal share of the mortgage,he and sophy have divided the million debt between themselves on a basis.therefore,voss can deduct interest payments made on million of his million portion of the debt secured by his qualified residence.dividing million the total aggregate debt allowed by the statute by million voss amount of debt secured by the qualified residence,this means about percent of his interest payments is deductible.and,the argument goes,sophy can do the same thing.as a result,voss and sophy claim they can deduct percent of the interest paid on million,the total indebtedness on their qualified residence,rather than deducting percent of the interest paid on that debt had they been a married couple.
voss and sophy approach to h should be rejected because it is contrary to the irs reasonable and persuasive interpretation of the statute.voss and sophy can not claim that the plain language of h compels their interpretation rather,the statute gives no indication that multiple may each treat million of debt as acquisition indebtedness or home equity indebtedness for purposes of an interest deduction.in these circumstances,we can afford respect to an agency interpretation of a statute,whether it is offered in an opinion letter,policy statement,agency manual,or even a legal brief.see christensen harris,citing skidmore swift,see also christopher smithkline beecham.an agency interpretation of a statute is entitled to a measure of deference proportional to the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade.christopher.at quoting united states mead,quoting skidmore,at.we also consider the specialized and technical expertise of the agency,see skidmore,at noting that the rulings,interpretations and opinions of an agency constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance,as well as whether the agency guidance is longstanding or merely a litigating position.see alaska of envtl.conservation epa,u,we normally accord particular deference to an agency interpretation of longstanding duration quoting barnhart walton.
here,the irs position,expressed in its legal brief on appeal and in its chief counsel advice statement,is both reasonable and persuasive.first,it is consistent with the text of the statute the language of h is reasonably read to establish that the debt limit of million per qualified residence applies regardless whether there is one owner or two.the fact that acquisition indebtedness is defined as debt secured by a qualified residence suggests that congress also contemplated that the aggregate amount treated as acquisition indebtedness was also defined with respect to a qualified residence.h b.
and the irs interpretation is more persuasive than voss and sophy interpretation,which would result in a windfall to unmarried taxpayers.see tablada thomas,cir holding that the bureau of prisons method for calculating good time credits was a reasonable interpretation of the statute,in part because the plaintiff contrary method would result in a windfall to prisoners that congress did not intend.there is no basis to infer that congress intended to allow unmarried of a qualified residence filing separately to deduct interest on up to million of debt,while limiting married of a qualified residence to deduct interest on only half that only up to million of debt.a more logical inference is that the deduction was aimed at promoting home ownership for ordinary folks,not to help wealthy individuals purchase mansions that are encumbered with more than million of debt.
third,the irs has applied its expert interpretation of h consistently for many years.see id.at noting that the bureau of prisons had calculated good time credits by a consistent methodology for at least sixteen years.the irs first set forth a methodology for determining what proportion of a taxpayer interest payments is deductible in,when it promulgated regulation e.it explained how this method applied to of a qualified residence in its chief counsel advice statement in.irs cca,wl.there is no dispute that the irs approach for calculating the deductibility of interest payments under h b is not merely an agency convenient litigating position.bowen georgetown.under these circumstances,it is appropriate to defer to the irs specialized expertise and understanding of what best effectuates the purpose of the statute 
in response to the irs reasonable interpretation of h b,voss and sophy look for help in a separate section of the tax code governing apportioning gain based on the sale of a residence,and its accompanying regulation.section allows a taxpayer who sells a residence to exclude up to of gain from gross income.u.b.the regulations clarify that i f taxpayers jointly own a principal residence but file separate returns,each taxpayer may exclude from gross income up to of gain that is attributable to each taxpayer interest in the property a.voss and sophy argue that because h for the definition of a qualified residence,the methodology set forth in a should also apply to h.accordingly,they argue,because they jointly own a qualified residence,and file separate returns,they should likewise be able to deduct the amount of interest each paid on million of debt out of each equal share of the mortgage.but section provides voss and sophy no support because it has nothing to do with h.other than the use of for the definition of qualified residence,there is no indication that either congress or the irs contemplated that the methodology in a should be used to determine the method of determining which interest is deduc
