we must decide whether the united states forest service complied with federal environmental law in its management of the bitterroot national forest.
in order to effectuate its management role over the national forests,the national forest management act nfma,et,requires the united states forest service forest service to develop and to maintain forest resource management plans.id.a.such plans must,among other things,provide for diversity of plant and animal communities based on the suitability and capability of the specific land area.id.g b.additionally,the healthy forests restoration act hfra,et,directs the forest service to take action to reduce wildfire risk and enhance efforts to protect watersheds and address threats to forest and rangeland health.id.specifically,the forest service is required a s soon as practicable to implement an authorized hazardous fuel reduction project on federal land where the existence of an epidemic of disease or insects,or the presence of such an epidemic on immediately adjacent land and the imminent risk it will spread,poses a significant threat to an ecosystem component,or forest or rangeland resource.id.a.
in satisfying its hfra obligations,the forest service must also comply with the national environmental policy act nepa,et.see a.thus,the forest service must prepare an environmental impact statement eis when formulating a hazardous fuels reduction project,which identifies alternatives to its proposed action.id.b c.such requirement forces the agency to take a hard look at its proposed action,and it must be prepared early enough in the process so that it can serve practically as an important contribution and will not be used to rationalize or justify decisions already made.metcalf daley,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the forest service is prohibited from irreversibl y and irretrievabl y committing resources before making its final decision.f see also metcalf,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the forest service must also give public notice of its decisionmaking process and allow for public collaboration.see e g d.for example,hfra requires that the forest service hold a public meeting at an appropriate location proximate to the administrative unit of the federal land on which the authorized hazardous fuel reduction project will be conducted and provide advance notice of such.e.likewise,the forest service must give the public an opportunity to comment on its proposed action,and it must assess and consider both individually and collectively such comments in preparing its final eis.a.specifically,the forest service must disclose and respond to any responsible opposing view which was not adequately discussed in the draft statement ctr.for biological diversity forest,cir quoting b.
in the summer of,the bitterroot national forest in montana suffered severe damage caused by wildfires.the fires affected more than acres and the entire middle east fork community was evacuated.although the middle east fork community was spared,many unburned fuels remain in the area,making it a area for future wildfires.additionally,the region is in the midst of a bark beetle epidemic,which is contributing significantly to the existing fuel levels.as a result of these conditions,the forest service developed the middle east fork hazardous fuel reduction project the project.
the project was developed under hfra.the stated purposes for the project are to reduce wildland fire threats to the middle east fork community,restore ecosystems in the middle east fork landscape,and restore stands affected by the bark beetle epidemic by treating infested areas and lands at risk.to determine how best to accomplish these goals,the forest service was required to study,develop,and describe the proposed agency action the alternative of no action and an additional action alternative,if that alternative is proposed during scoping or the collaborative process and meets the purpose and need of the project.c.thus,here the forest service considered a alternative alternative its preferred alternative alternative and an alternative proposed by the ecology center and native forest network now known as the wildwest institute,friends of the bitterroot,and the national forest protection alliance alternative.
the following significant events occurred during the analysis and development of the project.the forest service held at least twelve public meetings in the aftermath of the fires.thereafter,the forest service began developing a vegetation treatment plan for the middle east fork area.on march,a meeting was held in sula,montana to discuss the results of the analysis and the initial recommendations of implementing fuel reduction,addressing the bark beetle problem,and addressing timber harvest.notice of the meeting was published in the ravalli republic newspaper,as well as through a press release.another public meeting was held in sula on september.a letter of invitation was mailed to approximately individuals,organizations,and other agencies.
in november,the forest service published a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement in the federal register.the draft eis analyzed the three alternatives discussed above and was made available to the public through the bitterroot website.it was also mailed to members of the mailing list maintained by the forest service.the notice of availability was published in the federal register on april,thereby starting the comment period.public comments were received and incorporated into the final eis,which was released in september.during the comment process,the forest service responded to seventeen freedom of information act requests and provided over pages of information.
when the final eis was released,forest supervisor dave bull held a press conference to announce the final decision.certain vocal opponents of the project were excluded from the press conference,including jim miller,president of the friends of the bitterroot.thereafter,supervisor bull publicly apologized for holding a closed press conference.
in march,the forest service published its record of decision rod,which detailed its decision to implement a modified version of alternative.alternative called for treating acres in the middle east fork area,with approximately of all such treatments acres involving commercial treatments.the forest service made a number of changes to its original proposed alternative during the time between its publication of the final eis and the rod in response to objections raised by wildwest.first,the forest service decided not to treat old growth habitat.second,the modified plan would not treat units with greater than detrimental soil reliance or units or portions of units projected to possibly have greater than disturbance after the treatments.third,the modified plan did not call for performing summer tractor harvest operations because the units could have greater than disturbance after such treatments.finally,the modified plan would not treat stands where it has been determined that further field review is needed to corroborate the determination by the soil scientist of evidence of past harvest.overall,the forest service dropped acres from its proposed treatment plans in response to wildwest objections.
after the forest service final decision to implement the project,wildwest filed suit in the united states district court for the district of montana,asserting that the forest service decisionmaking process,as well as its substantive decision,violated nepa,nfma,and hfra.specifically,wildwest asserts the forest service committed procedural violations by irretrievably committing resources in favor of its preferred alternative before making its final decision,failing to engage in adequate public collaboration,and ignoring competing scientific views.substantively,wildwest challenges the project impact on soil productivity,old growth habitat,species viability,and watershed sedimentation.
along with its complaint,wildwest moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction,primarily relying on its three procedural claims.the district court denied the motion,concluding in part that wildwest had made an insufficient showing that it was likely to prevail on the merits of such claims.we affirmed.wildwest inst.bull,cir.
thereafter,the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the forest service defendants on all of wildwest claims.the district court ruled against wildwest on the merits of its claims,but it also held that the procedural claims were waived as wildwest only summarize d those arguments as necessary to preserve them for appeal because such claims were previously raised at the preliminary injunction stage.wildwest inst.bull,d,internal quotation marks omitted.
after the district court summary judgment ruling,wildwest moved for an emergency injunction pending appeal in the district court,which was denied.order denying motion to stay.wildwest then made a similar motion in this court,which we also denied.order of february.wildwest now appeals the district court summary judgment ruling.
before issuing its final decision,the forest service is prohibited from taking any action that limit s its choice of reasonable alternatives identified in the process.a.such prohibition extends to commit ting resources which would prejudice the forest service selection of alternatives.id.f.construing a related regulation,we have held that a premature irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources violates nepa.metcalf,at quoting conner burford,cir.as the fourth circuit has explained the proper inquiry in a nepa case is not whether an agency has focused on its preferred alternative,but instead whether it has gone too far in doing so,reaching the point where it actually has l imit ed the choice of reasonable alternatives.audubon soc y dep t of the navy,cir alteration in original quoting a.
here,wildwest argues the forest service prematurely and irretrievably committed financial resources in favor of its preferred alternative by marking trees in preparation for logging during the public comment period.our cases have focused on the commitment of natural resources,not necessarily the agency financial resources.for example,in friends of southeast future morrison,cir,we determined that there was no nepa violation because the forest service had not irreversibly and irretrievably committed the resources of ushk bay to logging.id.at emphasis added.although the government had developed a tentative schedule designating certain forest areas for harvest,we emphasized that the schedule ma de no commitment of any part of the national forests because the government retain ed absolute authority to decide whether any such activities will ever take place on the lands.id.at internal punctuation and citation omitted.
conversely,in conner,we held that the government did prematurely commit resources in violation of nepa where it sold gas and oil leases on national forest land without reserv ing the absolute right to prevent all activity.at see also metcalf,at holding that irretrievable commitment occurred when the government agreed to assist an indian tribe in resuming whaling without conditioning such agreement upon a nepa determination that the whaling proposal would not significantly affect the environment.we specifically distinguished,however,similar leases that make no commitment of any part of the national forests to activities by the lessees because the government retains absolute authority to decide whether any such activities will ever take place on the leased lands.conner,at first emphasis added.
wildwest is correct that a financial commitment can,in some instances,constitute an irretrievable commitment.for example,if an agency spent most or all of its limited budget on preparations useful for only one alternative,it may well have taken action l imit ing the choice of reasonable alternatives.a.in the instant case,the forest service expenditure of to trees was clearly not so substantial an investment that it limited such choice.
thus,on the current record,the forest service of trees did not irretrievably commit it to a particular course of action.although the forest service undertook preparatory actions in favor of logging,it clearly retained the authority to change course or to alter the plan it was considering implementing.such is clearly demonstrated by the fact that it excluded acres of timber from the modified plan it ultimately adopted.see friends of southeast future,at holding the government did not irretrievably commit forest resources where it retained the authority to change the amount of timber ultimately harvested see also headwaters forsgren,d,the record does not show that by trees,the forest service made such an irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources to effectively foreclose other alternative actions.the forest service actions here easily support this assertion.thus,we conclude the forest service decision to trees for cutting did not prematurely commit it to a specific course of action in violation of nepa.
wildwest also argues the forest service failed to facilitate sufficient public collaboration.specifically,wildwest asserts the forest service provided insufficient notice of the sula,montana,meeting by removing conservation proponents from the notice mailing list and by failing to announce that a hfra project would be discussed failed to indicate in its final eis that it received over public comments opposing its proposed action and failed to give notice of when its final eis would be issued and improperly excluding conservation proponents from the press conference announcing such decision.
nepa dictates that federal agencies shall to the fullest extent possible e ncourage and facilitate public involvement in decisions which affect the quality of the human environment.d.as mentioned above,hfra also sets forth a specific public participation scheme.see e g.however,in its reply brief,wildwest clearly asserts that it is not alleging the forest service violated hfra.thus,we proceed to analyze its public collaboration claims solely under nepa.
as we have previously noted,the regulations governing public involvement adopted pursuant to nepa are general in approach.bering strait citizens for responsible res.dev.army corps of eng rs,cir.there are few specific requirements.see.
if an agency holds a public meeting,nepa requires that it provide notice of such.b.the particular form such notice must take,however,is not specified envtl.coal.of ojai brown,cir.here,the forest service held two public meetings,and,before doing so,published an announcement in a local newspaper,issued a news release,and sent individual notices to interested members of the public identified on a mailing list.in any event,the record suggests wildwest did in fact receive notice from the forest service mailing through its predecessor,the ecology center.we also reject wildwest claim that the forest service announcement was incomplete because it did not state that the meeting would address a hfra hazardous fuel reduction project.the forest service specifically stated that the meeting would allow the public an opportunity to discuss its recommendations concerning fuel reduction,thinning,bark beatles,and timber harvest.
the forest service is required to assess and consider both individually and collectively the public comments received during the nepa process and to respond to such in its final eis.a.again,however,the regulations do not mandate the form such response must take,instead providing a list of options including modifying the agency proposed action,developing or evaluating additional alternatives,supplementing its analyses,making factual corrections,or explaining why the comments do not warrant further agency response.
wildwest argues that the forest service violated nepa by failing to identify in the final eis the number of opposing comments it received.we disagree.there is no requirement that the forest service identify the number of public comments it received.see b.further,the final eis responds appropriately to the public comments.the forest service summarized the nature of the comments it had received and the primary concerns that were raised.it also provided specific substantive responses to such concerns and included a six and a half page list of the commenters.
finally,wildwest contends that the forest service violated nepa by failing to announce when it would make its final decision and by excluding individuals who opposed its decision from the press conference announcing such.again,nepa does not require that federal agencies give notice of when it will announce its final decision or that it make such announcement a public event.thus,even though the forest service decision to hold a closed press conference was perhaps unfortunate,it was not a violation of nepa.
wildwest contends that the forest service violated nfma substantive soil productivity requirement relatedly,it argues that the forest service violated nepa by disregarding the data and opinions of its own soils expert,ken mcbride mcbride.
in addition to their general obligation to respond to public comments under a,federal agencies must specifically discuss at appropriate points in the final eis any responsible opposing view which was not adequately discussed in the draft eis and indicate the agency response to the issues raised.ctr.for biological diversity,at quoting b.a failure to do so is itself a nepa violation.id.at.an agency must also insure the professional integrity,including scientific integrity,of the discussions and analyses included in its eis.
the forest service draft eis incorporated mcbride soil analysis report,but mcbride indicated that his report had been edited,resulting in a deliberate removal of information that accurately portrayed the conditions of the soils and the prescriptions and mitigations needed to address those degraded soil conditions.thereafter,the forest service formed a peer review group to check for consistency and repeatability and compare its results to mcbride.
the peer review group performed a sample analysis of some of the units previously analyzed by mcbride.the group used a modified howes methodology,which allows soil to be classified under six different categories but does not assume that all soil disturbance is detrimental.mcbride,on the other hand,used the rapid method for determining soil disturbance,under which only areas that are unchanged from natural conditions are recorded as non detrimental disturbance.though the peer group identified a comparable amount of disturbance,it found a lesser degree of detrimental disturbance and it concluded all of the sample areas satisfied soil quality guidelines.the group further indicated that its chosen methodology was more appropriate in assessing the threshold for an activity unit,whereas mcbride methodology should be used to flag project areas that may depart from the soil quality guidelines for more accurate and intensive assessment at the project level.
in its final eis,the forest service adopted the peer review group findings,concluding that mcbride methodology overestimate d the amount of detrimental soil damage.emphasis added.it further discounted mcbride survey as primarily ocular with any measurements being used to verify what was being observed.contrary to wildwest assertion,however,the forest service did not completely disregard mcbride findings.rather,the final eis states that even though mcbride methodology illustrate s a conservative approach to estimating soil condition,his findings regarding the level of disturbance are used in the direct,indirect,and cumulative effects discussions.in fact,the forest service modified the project in its rod,providing that it would not treat any units with or greater soil disturbance or units or portions of units projected to possibly have or greater detrimental disturbance after proposed treatments,resulting in postponed action on numerous units.
wildwest also argues that the forest service removed from its analysis all of mcbride findings regarding cumulative soil impacts.however,the final eis contains a detailed analysis of the cumulative impact caused by logging and other historical activities,and specifically acknowledges mcbride concern that t ime periods of years may be required to improve the surface layer.the final eis also includes an analysis of the soil disturbance in each subwatershed.that the forest service reordered the format of its cumulative impact analysis from the draft eis to the final eis does not support wildwest contention that it failed to address such issue.see parks conservation ass dep t of,cir explaining that w e review the eis as a whole.
under nfma,the forest service may harvest timber from national forests only where soil,slope,or other watershed conditions will not be irreversibly damaged.g e i.further,nfma directs the forest service to evaluate the effects of its management plans on the productivity of the land based on continuous monitoring and assessment in the field.id.g c.the bitterroot national forest plan does not provide specific numeric soil quality standards.therefore,the forest service applied its region one soil quality standards,which provide that activities should not result in a cumulative detrimental impact of more than of the activity area.wildwest makes two arguments related to this substantive requirement.first,it argues that the are facially unreliable.second,it argues that the forest service failed to properly consider cumulative impacts in determining whether the project satisfied such standard.
wildwest failed to raise its facial challenge in the district court.generally,an issue raised for the first time on appeal is deemed waived.cold mountain garber,cir.we have discretion,however,to consider a newly raised issue in the exceptional case where review is necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice or to preserve the integrity of the judicial process,when the issue arises while on appeal because of a change in the law,or when the issue is purely one of law and either does not depend on the factual record developed below,or the pertinent record has been fully developed.id.citation omitted.
wildwest did not address these discretionary factors in its briefing,instead baldly asserting that this case presents an appropriate fact situation for this court to pass on the adequacy of the.however,on our own review of such factors,we conclude it is not appropriate to consider wildwest newly raised argument in the first instance.the first two factors do not apply here,and we conclude that the current record is not sufficiently developed as to the issue wildwest seeks to raise.
wildwest also contends the forest service violated nfma by failing properly to consider cumulative impacts on soil productivity wildwest analogizes this case to lands council powell,cir,where we held that the final eis violated nepa because it contained no discussion of the connection between individual harvests and the prior environmental harms from those harvests that the forest service now acknowledges.id.at.as discussed above,however,the record shows that the forest service took a hard look at cumulative impacts from past timber harvests,as well as other historical activities and events,and concluded that these past activities did not reduce soil or site productivity in violation of the soil quality standards.
wildwest also argues the forest service erred by narrowing its soil conditions analysis to particular proposed harvesting units instead of taking a broader landscape view.agencies have discretion to determine the physical scope used for measuring environmental impacts so long as they do not act arbitrarily and their choice of analysis scale represent s a reasoned decision.idaho sporting,rittenhouse,cir.
here,although the final eis included broader subwatershed data as background,the forest service explained that such analysis is unreliable because it can not be correlated to impacts under the.specifically,it determined that such correlation is impossible because of the variability in soil texture,the amount of organic matter and ground cover,soil response to past projects,and the intensity of past projects.on this record,we can not conclude that such reasoning is arbitrary.
wildwest makes several arguments with respect to the forest service management of old growth habitats.nfma requires that the forest
