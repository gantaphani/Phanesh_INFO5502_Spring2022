amended opinion 
this case presents the question of whether federal law preempts california appliance regulations requiring appliance manufacturers to submit data about their appliances to california energy resources conservation and development commission commission,mark their appliances with basic information such as brand name and energy performance,and be subjected to related compliance and enforcement rules.we conclude that federal law does not preempt california regulations.we therefore reverse the district court decision finding the regulations preempted and permanently enjoining the commission from enforcing these regulations,vacate the injunction,and remand.
california boasts an extensive and laudable appliance efficiency program.as part of california program,the commission has,since,required manufacturers to submit data to it.the data collected by the commission pursuant to section of title of the california code of regulations is maintained in an electronic database,which contains information on over appliance models.the commission database provided the foundation of information for the environmental protection agency energy star program and is used frequently by consumers,energy consultants,contractors,researchers,utility program managers,manufacturers,and other governmental agencies.as part of california appliance program,the commission also requires manufacturers to put basic as the manufacturer brand name and the appliance size and energy their appliances.regs.tit,b d.the commission enforces the data submittal and marking requirements it places on manufacturers under section.regs.tit.
four major trade organizations representing appliance manufacturers nationwide trade associations,claim that these california regulations are preempted by the energy policy and conservation act,pub.law,stat.epca,specifically by a and a b.after these regulations were adopted but before they went into effect,trade associations filed suit for declaratory and injunctive relief in the united states district court for the eastern district of california.the district court held that the california regulations are preempted.the court,first preliminarily and then permanently,enjoined the commission from enforcing the regulations.the commission timely appealed.
we review the district court decision regarding preemption de novo,chamber of commerce lockyer,cir,and the district court grant of permanent injunction for abuse of discretion,ting v.at t,cir.
preemption can occur in one of three ways express by statute,occupation of the field,or conflict between state and federal regulation.english general,d.all parties agree that this case presents a question of express preemption.thus,this case boils down to the interpretation of the statutory provision that allegedly preempts state law.medtronic,lohr,d cipollone liggett group,d.
to determine whether california regulations are by epca,we are instructed to first identify the domain expressly by that language.medtronic,at.quoting cipollone,at.since claims turn on congress intent,we begin as we do in any exercise of statutory construction with the text of the provision in question,and move on,as need be,to the structure and purpose of the act in which it occurs.new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d internal citations omitted.
our interpretation of the federal statute is informed by two presumptions about the nature of preemption.medtronic,at.first,we address claims of preemption with the starting presumption that congress did not intend to supplant state law.id.where,as is the case here,the state regulates in an area where there is no history of significant federal presence,united states locke,d we assume that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.id.quoting rice santa fe elevator.this presumption against preemption leads us to the principle that express preemption statutory provisions should be given a narrow interpretation.cipollone,at.
second,our analysis of the scope of the statute preemption is guided by the supreme court comment that the purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone in every case.medtronic,at.internal quotations marks omitted.as a result,any understanding of the scope of a statute must rest primarily on a fair understanding of congressional purpose.id.at.quoting cipollone,at.emphasis omitted.
also relevant to our interpretation of the scope of the statute preemption are the structure and purpose of the statute as a whole,as revealed not only in the text,but through our reasoned understanding of the way in which congress intended the statute and its surrounding regulatory scheme to affect business,consumers,and the law.id.at.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
thus,we turn to the language of the express preemption provision at issue.provides,in relevant part 
a preemption of testing and labeling requirements 
effective on march,this part supersedes any state regulation insofar as such state regulation provides at any time for the disclosure of information with respect to any measure of energy consumption or water use of any covered product if 
a such state regulation requires testing or the use of any measure of energy consumption,water use,or energy descriptor in any manner other than that provided under section of this title or 
b such state regulation requires disclosure of information with respect to the energy use,energy efficiency,or water use of any covered product other than information required under section of this title.
data submittal regulations 
the first california regulation that a arguably preempts is regs.tit,which requires appliance manufacturers to submit specified information to the commission for each appliance for sale or sold in california.such information includes the name of the manufacturer,the brand name,the model number,and data produced during tests the manufacturer is required to perform under regs.tit.see regs.tit,a,table 
to determine whether a preempts the data submittal requirements of regs.tit,we look to the text of a.section a preempts any state regulation that provides at any time for the disclosure of information with respect to any measure of energy consumption or water use of any covered product if such state regulation requires disclosure of information with respect to the energy use,energy efficiency,or water use of any covered product other than information required under section.the district court found the text of a,in particular the meaning of the phrase disclosure of information,ambiguous,and so do we.
beginning with the presumption that congress did not intend to supplant state law,we must narrowly interpret a in general,and the phrase disclosure of information in particular.see medtronic,at.a narrow interpretation is consistent with our direction to find preemption when preemption is the clear and manifest purpose of congress.id.the narrow interpretation the commission advances is supported by the statutory text and is consistent with congress purpose.applying a narrow interpretation of a,we hold that it does not preempt the data submittal requirements contained in regs.tit.
the rules of statutory construction support the narrow interpretation of disclosure of information.one rule of statutory construction is that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.commissioner of internal revenue lundy,d internal citations and quotation marks omitted.the phrase disclosure of information is used twice in a and should be given the same meaning in both instances.in a,disclosure of information concerns information with respect to any measure of energy consumption or water use.in a b,disclosure of information requires manufacturers to place certain information on product labels,as required by.see.in both instances,disclosure of information may be interpreted to generally refer to the disclosure of information on labels directed to consumers at point of sale or use.thus,a narrow interpretation of a is supported by the statutory text,and this interpretation should be applied.
furthermore,the statute as a whole compels a narrow interpretation of disclosure of information.congress did not use the phrase disclosure of information in epca when it referenced manufacturers providing data to the department of energy doe instead,congress used the phrase submit information or reports.d.d allows the doe to require appliance manufacturers to provide the doe with information about energy efficiency.
d provides,in relevant part,the secretary may require each manufacturer of a covered product to submit information or reports to the secretary.id.d emphasis added.when congress referred to the submittal of data to a government entity in epca,it used the phrase submit information or reports,not disclosure of information.the statute as a whole does not support a broad interpretation of disclosure of information.on the contrary,it suggests that disclosure of information only pertains to labeling directed to consumers at point of sale or use 
in addition,the narrow interpretation of disclosure of information rests on a fair understanding of congressional purpose as evidenced by the relevant legislative history.medtronic,at.quoting cipollone,at.internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted.the original version of the current labeling and testing provision was first enacted in the epca,pub.law,stat.its purpose appears to be unchanged since then.
congress enacted epca in,in the aftermath of the oil embargo imposed against the united states by certain countries in the years prior.natural res.def.council herrington.the oil embargo called attention to the serious economic and national security problems associated with our nation continued reliance on foreign energy resources.id.in response,president ford called for the strongest and most energy conservation program we have ever had.id.quoting weekly comp.doc,internal quotation marks omitted.subsequently,congress enacted epca,and in doing so,established a comprehensive energy policy.id.
epca was designed,in part,to reduce the united states domestic energy consumption through the operation of specific voluntary and mandatory energy conservation programs,at,reprinted in.part of epca energy conservation program was to r equire energy labeling of major home appliances and certain other consumer products,and authorize energy efficiency standards for major appliances.id.at.congress believed that better informed consumers and voluntary efforts by manufacturers would make energy efficiency standards unnecessary,at,reprinted in.therefore,congress required manufacturers to label their appliances and provided that the secretary of the federal energy administration should utilize energy efficiency standards if the labeling program proved ineffective.id.at.as a result,epca express preemption provisions dealt primarily with the possibility that states would adopt different test procedures or consumer labeling requirements.see pub.law,stat.epca preempted state regulations insofar as they were other than the applicable federal rules for testing and labeling.id.a,stat.at.epca,however,allowed state regulations that differed from the federal regulations if the state regulations were justified by a substantial state or local need,did not interfere with interstate commerce,and were more stringent than the federal standard.id.b,stat.at.
the national energy conservation and policy act,stat.necpa,amended portions of epca preemption provisions.states were still allowed to adopt regulations identical to federal regulations.see epca a,stat.at.states were allowed to prescribe regulations more stringent than federal,if there was no federal regulation,a state could implement its own if the secretary found there was a significant state or local interest to justify the state regulation and the regulation would not unduly burden interstate commerce.necpa a,stat.at.necpa did not amend epca preemption provisions regarding testing or labeling.id.
on a larger scale,necpa created a nationwide conservation program for appliances and required the doe to prescribe minimum energy efficiency standards for thirteen covered products.herrington,at see,at.however,instead of adopting energy efficiency standards,the doe concluded in that establishing minimum energy efficiency standards for the relevant appliances would not result in significant energy conservation and would not be economically justified,at.thus,the doe determined no efficiency standards were required under necpa.id.while doe adopted its policy of the standards,it also initiated a general policy of granting petitions from states requesting waivers from preemption.as a result,a system of separate state appliance standards ha d begun to emerge and the trend was growing,at.the circuit held that the doe erroneously concluded that nostandard standards was appropriate and instructed the doe to adopt federal efficiency standards.herrington,at.
because the doe could not establish federal appliance efficiency standards immediately,major manufacturer trade associations and the natural resources defense council negotiated a compromise solution,which congress enacted as the national appliance energy conservation act of,stat.naeca,codified at,at,at,reprinted in.naeca established federal energy efficiency standards for residential appliances doe action was not required to set these standards.naeca,stat.at.
naeca also amended necpa preemption provisions.naeca provided that states could no longer adopt energy efficiency standards that were identical to the federal standards.c.naeca also made it more difficult for states to obtain waivers of preemption for more stringent state efficiency standards in order to obtain a waiver,naeca required states to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that state regulation was justified by unusual and compelling state or local interests.d b c see,at.the reason for the broader preemption standards was to counteract the systems of separate state appliance standards that had emerged as a result of the doe general policy of granting petitions from states requesting waivers from preemption,which caused appliance manufacturers to be confronted with a growing patchwork of differing state regulations which would increasingly complicate their design,production and marketing plans,at.as for the preemption provisions regarding testing and labeling,naeca,essentially restate d existing law,and provide d that the act supersedes state and local regulations regarding testing and labeling in certain cases.id.at.
the latest legislation amending epca is the energy policy act of,stat.epact,codified at,which expanded the federal appliance program to include energy efficiency standards for commercial and industrial appliances.j k.epact incorporated the preemption provisions of,with a few subtle distinctions,which are not relevant to this case.a b.epact legislative history is silent on preemption.
in sum,the legislative history of the relevant acts supports a narrow interpretation of the preemption provision.there is no indication that congress,in the preemption provision of epca as amended by subsequent acts,intended to preempt state regulations requiring the submission of data to state government agencies.the legislative history instead demonstrates that congress intended to preempt state energy efficiency standards,testing procedures,and consumer labeling requirements.we therefore conclude that because disclosure of information only refers to labeling at point of sale or use,regs.tit,is not preempted by a 
marking regulations 
the second set of california regulations the trade associations argue is preempted by federal law are the requirements of sections b,c,d,and d of title of the california code of regulations.
section b and c of title of the california code of require appliances to be labeled with the manufacturer name,brand name,or trademark the appliance model number and date of not preempted by federal law because the subsections do not provide at any time for the disclosure of information with respect to any measure of energy consumption or water use of any covered product.a the information required to be placed on appliances under section b and c is not information with respect to any measure of energy consumption or water use unless one expansively interprets with respect to and measure of energy consumption,a.in accordance with the presumptions informing our interpretation of express preemption provisions,we interpret these terms narrowly as such an interpretation is consistent with the statutory text.
measure of energy consumption is defined as energy use,energy efficiency,estimated annual operating cost,or other measure of energy consumption.emphasis added.we decline to interpret other measure of energy consumption,the only relevant term left undefined in the statute,so broadly that it encompasses the information required to be placed on appliances under california sections b and c.under the maxim of statutory interpretation known as ejusdem generis,or other measure of energy consumption embraces only objects similar in nature to those enumerated by the preceding specific words.circuit city stores,adams,d.or other measure of energy consumption must be construed to give effect to the terms preceding the phrase and must be defined by reference to the terms preceding it.id.at.therefore,or other measure of energy consumption does not broaden the meaning of measure of energy consumption,which is defined,in part,as the quantity of energy directly consumed by a consumer product at point of use,the ratio of the useful output of services from a consumer product to the energy use of such product,id.and the aggregate retail cost of the energy which is likely to be consumed annually,id.as such,measure of energy consumption does not encompass the information california requires manufacturers to place on their appliances,such as the manufacturer name and the appliance model number and date of manufacture.
the issue then becomes how to interpret with respect to.the interpretation of the phrase relates to instructs us on how to interpret the phrase with respect to,as both phrases are similar in scope and meaning.the supreme court has stated that the term relate to can not be taken to extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminancy,or else for all practical purposes would never run its course.egelhoff egelhoff,d quoting travelers,at.the court has also cautioned against an uncritical literalism that would make turn on infinite connections.id.at.quoting travelers,at.as justice scalia observed,e verything is related to everything else.cal.div.of labor standards enforcement dillingham,d scalia,concurring.the issue is whether the relation is indirect,remote,and tenuous or not.californians for safe competitive dump truck transp.mendonca,cir.the relation between placing a manufacturer name,the model name,and the date of manufacture on an appliance and measures of energy consumption,as defined in epca,is indirect,remote,and tenuous.
therefore,we conclude that the marking requirements contained in sections b and c of title of the california code of regulations are not preempted by epca.
we also hold that section d of the california regulations is not preempted by epca,as the section only requires compliance with federal marking requirements and,therefore,does not require the disclosure of information that is other than information required under federal law.a.as the fourth circuit has stated,if state law adopts or imposes a labeling requirement that is the same as the federal standard,even if the state law provides compensation or other remedies for a violation,so long as congress chooses not to explicitly preempt the consistent law,it will not be said to be in conflict with federal law.worm american cyanamid,cir.this reasoning is supported by medtronic,in which the supreme court stated that t he presence of a state damages remedy does not amount to the additional or different requirement that is necessary under the federal statute rather,it merely provides another reason for manufacturers to comply with identical existing requirements under federal law.at.because regs.tit,d merely provides appliance manufacturers another reason to comply with existing requirements under federal law,the california regulation is not preempted.
the final marking regulation trade associations argues is preempted by federal law,regs.tit,d also does not require the disclosure of information other than information required under federal law,and is thus not preempted.section d requires commercial and industrial equipment to be marked with information.the relevant preemption provision is located at a b,which was enacted as part of epact.
california regulation section d is not because there are no federal labeling rules for the equipment that are subject to california marking requirements where epact authorizes the doe to take action that would preempt inconsistent state regulations,the doe inaction,without more,fails to preempt relevant state regulations.
sections a and b preempt any state regulation insofar as such state regulation provides at any time for the disclosure of information with respect to any measure of energy consumption or water use if such state regulation requires disclosure of information of any covered product other than information required under federal law.a emphasis added.thus,state regulations are preempted at any time if they require the disclosure of information other than what is required under federal law.
the doe inaction alone can not preempt state regulations.see puerto rico dep t of consumer affairs isla petroleum,d.when a comprehensive federal scheme intentionally leaves a portion of the regulated field without controls,then the inference can be from federal inaction alone,but from inaction joined with action.id.under epact,the doe must prescribe labeling rules for classes of covered equipment for which the doe has exercised its discretion to prescribe test procedures.a.the doe has not prescribed test procedures for most classes of covered equipment,and therefore has not reached the decision of whether to prescribe labeling rules.there is no indication that the doe inaction was a conscious and express decision under h to not promulgate labeling rules for equipment.i t is essential that an agency declare,at a high degree of specificity,its intention that its in action preempt state law before we may assume such a desire and give it legal effect.baltimore ohio oberly,cir.as the doe has not done so,we can not hold that regs.tit,d is preempted because it requires something other than what federal law does.
compliance and enforcement regulations 
lastly,trade associations argue that california procedural regulations,found at regs.tit,that enforce the previously discussed substantive regulations are preempted because they impermissibly enforce federal requirements.if the commission substantive regulations,as we have found,are not preempted by federal law,then the commission relevant compliance and enforcement provisions are also not preempted.the power to regulate must include the complementary power to enforce those regulations.california compliance and enforcement provisions are not preempted by federal law.
for these reasons,we agree with the commission that the relevant california regulations which require manufacturers to submit data about their appliances,mark their appliances,and be subjected to related compliance and enforcement rules are not preempted by federal law.we therefore reverse the district court decision finding these regulations preempted,vacate the injunction preventing the commission from applying these regulations,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
reversed,vacated,and remanded.
the statutes at issue,inferentially the result of negotiation and compromise,deliberately spell out what is preempted by federal law.state regulations preempted are those that require disclosure of information with respect to the energy use,energy efficiency or water use other than the information required under section of this title.a b.where federal regulations do not require disclosure of such information to the federal government,a state is expressly prohibited from requiring such disclosure to consumers or to a state authority.
