this court generally reviews an agency interpretations of the statutes it administers under the deferential standard set forth in chevron nrdc,d.but a recent dissenting supreme court opinion has called into question whether chevron deference is appropriate when addressing questions of preemption.in watters wachovia bank,d stevens,dissenting joined by roberts,and scalia,the dissent argued that u nlike congress,administrative agencies are clearly not designed to represent the interests of the states as a result,the dissent reasoned that when an agency purports to decide the scope of federal preemption,a healthy respect for state sovereignty calls for something less than chevron deference.id.
we have in the past rejected the argument that wherever a federal agency exercise of authority will preempt state power,chevron deference is inappropriate.oklahoma natural gas ferc.we reasoned that,with the exception of negative exercises of federal authority,all agency legal interpretations have some preemptive effect id.hence,we rejected the application of a principle because it would have to be applied almost universally,overturning chevron.id.the context,to be sure,involved an scope of the agency only implicitly was of preemptive effect,not,as here,an express issue of whether undisputed ferc authority has preemptive effect.oklahoma natural gas company also of course left open the question of whether or not an agency decision that avoids preemption of a state is the case with ferc decision still deserving of chevron deference.
ultimately,this case does require us to resolve the applicability of chevron to agency preemption decisions,as we would vacate ferc interpretation even under the more deferential chevron standard.port authority of new york and new jersey dep t of.in short,we will assume in favor of ferc that its conclusion is entitled to chevron deference.
another framing issue is the familiar presumption against preemption.see,geier american honda motor,aff,d.but this presumption may be overcome if,as we hold today,the court finds that the preemptive purpose of congress was clear and manifest.geier,at citing medtronic,lohr,d.
we start with ferc counsel concession at oral argument that under f ferc itself could not impose charges for headwater benefits other than interest,maintenance,and depreciation.oral argument rec.the concession was surely inevitable.as the certainty of other costs was as plain as plain could be,congress express provision for three types could hardly leave room for a ferc mandate of reimbursement of,say,the operational costs in dispute here.the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius has its limits,but we need not plumb them here.
ferc position,then,must be that although congress would not allow it to mandate collection of other types of costs,it meant to allow the states to do so freely.neither the overall function of the fpa,nor the sense of f,allows us to infer such a meaning.
the supreme court has extensively analyzed the circumstances which culminated in the passage of the federal water power act in.first iowa.coop.fed.power comm n.it found that the act was the outgrowth of a widely supported effort of the conservationists to secure enactment of a complete scheme of national regulation which would promote the comprehensive development of the water resources of the nation.id.emphases added.congress intent was not merely to prevent obstructions to navigation,but rather to secure enactment of a comprehensive development of national resources through control over the engineering,economic and financial soundness of hydropower projects.id.at.it proceeded to find iowa licensing scheme preempted 
a dual final authority,with a duplicate system of state permits and federal licenses required for each project,would be unworkable.compliance with the requirements of such a duplicated system of licensing would be nearly as bad.
id.at.internal quotations omitted.given the commitment to comprehensive federal regulation,and preclusion of dual licensing authority,it is hard to imagine why congress would have countenanced disparate state reimbursement schemes,calculated on different bases and potentially imposing severe costs on hydropower firms in other states,downstream of the enacting jurisdiction.this seems like precisely the sort of heterogeneity and conflict that a complete and comprehensive scheme would be expected to prevent.
of course this does not mean that the fpa precludes every state exercise of power marginally related to federal hydropower licensees.california ferc,d.thus,we must still examine the specific language and legislative history of f to determine if there is clear evidence that congress intended to preempt headwater benefits charges for costs not covered by f.id.
as we mentioned earlier,ferc discerned from the text and legislative history of f a single federal interest,namely the interest in ensuring the participation of downstream project owners in the financial burden incident to the construction of power and storage facilities of a river basin.order,ferc,at p.if that federal interest were the only one,it would make sense to understand f as leaving states free to load up the downstream operators with costs outside the three specified categories.
but if assuring such a contribution to upstream owners burdens had been congress sole intent,it is hard to see why congress would have limited ferc own authority to interest,maintenance,and depreciation,as ferc own concession and the sound application of expressio unius make clear it did.ferc advances no argument for why ferc would be less well suited than the states to determine equitable operating expenses,as opposed to interest,maintenance,and depreciation charges.nor does ferc offer any reason congress would be concerned that ferc set only charges it deemed equitable,yet would leave states free to collect charges regardless of whether they met ferc judgment of their equity.
ferc approach here manifests an interpretative error of long standing,one that apparently will never die to treat a statute primary or precipitating object as its sole object.as the supreme court said in rodriguez united states,d,
but no legislation pursues its purposes at all costs.deciding what competing values will or will not be sacrificed to the achievement of a particular objective is the very essence of legislative it frustrates rather than effectuates legislative intent simplistically to assume that whatever furthers the statute primary objective must be the law.
id.at.emphasis in original.see also bd.of governors of the fed.reserve dimension fin,d vencor,physicians mut.
the text of f clearly reflects just such congressional balancing.the limitation on the types of costs recoverable,and the insistence that such costs be deemed equitable by ferc,manifest a deliberate congressional decision to balance the goal of compensating upstream owners and thus encouraging their investment and that of protecting downstream ones and thus encouraging their investment.ferc itself,in its own provision for reimbursement under f,invokes the word equitable to support its limitation of headwater benefits charges to percent of the value of the energy gains.b.see also order.at,regs.preambles ferc stat.regs.at addressing issue of whether the cap provided downstream operators with adequate incentives,proposed regs.ferc stat.regs.at explaining that the purpose of a cap on total charges was to avoid the inequitable result of charges larger than the value of the gains for a project for an individual year.
the legislative history of f is consistent with this interpretation.several representatives speaking in support of f stressed that f was meant to provide for limited reimbursement.representative dill,speaking in favor of the f amendment,explained 
take the columbia river power sites and the power sites on the streams that flow into it.if a dam is built to establish a reservoir for water to furnish power on one of these streams,it furnishes water for all dams below it and whoever may happen to build a dam on a power site below should contribute to the cost of the reservoir dam in proportion to the benefits received.this amendment provides that very thing,and i most earnestly hope it will be adopted.
cong.rec.emphases added.representative raker,also speaking in support of the amendment,stated that f would require downstream licensees to contribute to the cost of an upstream project to the expense sic extent that the subsequent works are benefited by virtue of the original work.id.
ferc reasoning in its orders here observed none of these signs of careful congressional balancing.rather,the commission simply stated that the legislative history of section f is sparse and does not otherwise reveal congress reasons for limiting reimbursable costs to interest,maintenance and depreciation.order,ferc at p.consequently,ferc could see no reason to prevent the district from collecting for charges other than interest,maintenance,and depreciation,since preventing that collection would,it thought,be disruptive to the district current assessment scheme.id.at p.ferc emphasized that the district has expenses that do not fall within the categories specified by section f,and if it were unable to assess such costs the district would have difficulty administering a storage project that affects a variety of downstream uses within that state.id.
ferc evidently believes that the legislative history failure to mention disruption of the sort it espies here renders its interpretation of f reasonable.but it is simply not the law that a statute can have no effects which are not explicitly mentioned in its legislative history.pittston coal group sebben,d.moreover,the relative importance to the state of its own law is not material when there is a conflict with a valid federal law,for the framers of our constitution provided that the federal law must prevail.arizona bowsher,quoting fidelity federal savings loan ass de la cuesta,d.
though ferc found that the district was assessing charges for headwater benefits,order on rehearing,ferc at p,it repeatedly stressed the unusual nature of the situation here,in which an upstream storage reservoir is owned by a state and is dependent on assessments to cover its operations costs,id.at p.see also order,ferc at p order on rehearing,ferc at p.but f by its terms applies whenever any licensee hereunder is directly benefited thus in all cases when licensees receive headwater benefits from the construction efforts of upstream licensees.the commission attempted distinction between public and private ownership is thus irrelevant to the question of whether or not f preempts state laws mandating compensation for headwater benefits.if f preempts state charges for headwater benefits,then it does so for both private and public actors equally.
besides disrupting congress intended balance between provider and recipient interests,the commission understanding of f would generate complex issues of meshing state charges with ones.ferc,in the absence of agreement between the parties,uses its headwater benefits energy gains model to allocate the interest,maintenance,and depreciation to downstream beneficiaries in proportion to the value of the energy gains each beneficiary enjoys,calculated as the cost of obtaining an equivalent amount of electricity from the most likely alternative source,and of course subject to the cap of of that value.b.
the district methodology is rather different.using a benefits study under which hydropower owners pay for of the district costs,it appears to apportion them among hydropower project owners on the basis of a mixture of private settlement agreements with west and a pro rata charge based on the amount of head at the individual downstream property as a percentage of the total head on the waterway.answer of hudson river regulating district to compl.by fourth branch associates mechanicville,filed,joint appendix.
as ferc acknowledged,there is no doubt that these differences between the assessment schemes exist.order on rehearing,ferc at p.even in light of these differences,however,ferc argued that because the new york scheme assesses charges for other expenses,based on a different method of determining benefits,the administration of both the new york law and f would not be problematic.id.at p.
but such a dual authority over headwater assessments,especially ones based on different methodologies,would result in a morass of issues that would undermine the congressional intent to create a comprehensive scheme of hydropower development.two such issues are worth discussing here.first,ferc is quite naive in its assumption that because states would purportedly charge only for other costs,costs other than interest,maintenance,and depreciation there could be no conflict with ferc authority.states could use different methods of accounting for costs,arbitrarily minimizing any characterization of costs as interest,maintenance,or depreciation.this would invite either duplicate collection from downstream owners or the creation of an accounting mess that some or a have to sort out.this case illustrates precisely such a problem.after ferc initial order was handed down,the district adopted a resolution to apply funds it received from erie for the west project against the district full costs for interest,maintenance,and depreciation.resolution to establish an accounting policy for the application of west water fees.as a result,as the district sees it,all assessments to albany are now for costs other than interest,maintenance and depreciation.id.at.the resolution further provides that this change shall have no financial or economic impact on cost apportionment to albany and others.id.at.thus,even though albany currently pays the exact same amount as it did before this change in district policy,it will have to take on the expense of proving that the district charges are at least in part really for interest,maintenance,and depreciation given the potential elasticity of in such a context,the burden would likely be beyond anything one can suppose congress might have approved.
second,even if the cost characterization issue could be easily resolved,ferc interpretation of f would allow states to apportion costs between downstream operators in a manner that results in charges far in excess of the actual benefits received not to mention the cap.albany argues that this issue is present in this case as well.a report from concluded that the mechanicville project receives only of the benefits of the district operations.report of gomez and sullivan engineers.yet,the district continues to assess mechanicville at a rate of approximately of the district budget.hudson river regulating district annual assessments of statutory beneficiaries for the fiscal years,parcel entries.
regardless of whether one accepts the findings of the report,the point remains that ferc holding would enable states to charge operators in excess of the benefits received,and thus necessarily in excess of ferc cap.possibly ferc might respond creatively by reducing the equitable charge for interest,maintenance,and depreciation charges in response to state action.but there might well be instances where reduction to zero was not enough to hold the charge below of benefits.even where ferc could thus meet the statutory requirement that the charge be one deemed equitable by ferc,the exercise would entail costly dispute resolution.
thus,ferc holding would undermine congress clear intent to limit the total amount of charges imposed on downstream operators.breach of that limit,combined with the issues and perhaps others,leads to the conclusion that ferc interpretation of f would conflict with the fpa purpose to provide for a comprehensive legislative scheme to govern the nation hydropower development.
we do not reach ferc decision to neither order refunds for albany past payments to the district nor convene a settlement conference.ferc reasoned that f does not grant it the authority to address independent actions taken by an upstream licensee to collect charges under color of state law absent a headwater benefits investigation.order on rehearing,ferc at p.and,though ferc plainly had authority to order a settlement conference,it reasoned that such a conference would be more productive in the context of a headwater benefits investigation.id.at p.
our holding that f preempts all state headwater benefits assessments materially changes the context for ferc consideration of both these issues.whereas ferc and the district formerly believed that the district was free to assess charges for certain costs under the authority of state law,our holding makes clear that the district never had such authority to exact any compensation from albany for headwater benefits.albany incentives to seek a headwater benefits investigation,the cost of which is shared among all parties,id.at p,are materially increased by our holding,since the district can no longer avoid or offset an adverse outcome by classifying costs as operational.furthermore,ferc based its decision not to order a settlement conference in part on the district opposition to such a proceeding.id.at p.but just as albany incentives are changed by our preemption holding,so too are the district,as it can no longer expect to recover its operating costs from albany,with or without a headwater benefits investigation.in light of these changed circumstances,we find it appropriate to remand to ferc to consider the scope of its authority to craft appropriate remedies.see,the commission may convene a conference of the participants in a proceeding at any time for any purpose related to the conduct or disposition of the proceeding fpa,the commission shall have power to perform any and all acts,and to prescribe,issue,make,amend,and rescind such orders,rules,and regulations as it may find necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this chapter.
our separately concurring colleague argues that ferc intended its remedies determination to be independent from its preemption determination,and as a result,for purposes of judicial economy we need not decide the scope of preemption.concurring op.at.the concurrence bases this conclusion on a topic sentence in ferc order in which ferc stated that even to the extent that it is preempted by section f,we have no authority over the district actions.order on rehearing,ferc at p.the very next sentence,however,illustrates that ferc could not have meant that it had literally no authority,as ferc goes on to detail what it might require the district to do.id.the concurrence observes that ferc claim that it has no authority would,if read literally,be obviously ridiculous.concurring op.at.
further,ferc asserted that f does not give us authority to address independent actions taken by an upstream licensee to collect charges under color of state law,even if we determine that the law is,in part,preempted by the fpa.order on rehearing,ferc at p emphasis added.this language would seem to leave open the possibility that where charges may not be made under color of state law,because state law is in fact preempted in its entirety,f ma
