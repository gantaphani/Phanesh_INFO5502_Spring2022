the wilderness society tws or the society filed suit in the united states district court for the district of columbia.the complaint alleges that the national park service nps or the park service has chronically failed to undertake various legal obligations with respect to the identification and management of wilderness in the national park system.tws seeks judicial redress to compel the agency to take actions that allegedly have been unlawfully withheld and unreasonably delayed.on january,the district court granted relief with respect to five of the society claims,but dismissed the remaining counts alleged in tws complaint.tws appealed the dismissals.the government did not file a.
at issue here are tws claims that nps has failed to comply with certain statutory mandates and deadlines and also failed to adhere to certain management policies.we dismiss the majority of tws claims for want of article iii standing.and we deny tws claims resting on nps alleged failure to develop wilderness management plans,because they are predicated on unenforceable agency statements of policy.
background 
on january,tws filed suit against gale norton in her official capacity as secretary of the interior and fran mainella in her official capacity as director of nps.specifically,tws allege d a widespread disregard by nps of its statutory and regulatory duties to take specific actions to review and protect lands in the national park system,in violation of the wilderness act,the national park service organic act,national park service policies and directives,and the administrative procedure act.wilderness soc y norton,ca,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,emphases omitted.
the facts surrounding tws allegations are discussed at length in the district court memorandum opinion,so we will not repeat the full statement of facts here.suffice it to say that the wilderness society filed a,complaint against the nps for alleged failures to conduct wilderness assessments,forward wilderness recommendations to the president,prepare wilderness management plans,revisit wilderness assessments,and otherwise to take required measures to protect wilderness resources in this country,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.in alleging that nps has failed to prepare wilderness management plans,tws relies on internal agency policies found in national park service,department of interior,nps,management policies management policies or policies,available at http.see also director order and nps reference manual,available at http.tws suit is based upon of the administrative procedure act apa,which permits a court to compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.wilderness soc y,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
on july,nps filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,see fed.civ.c,arguing,inter alia,that the society lacks article iii standing that tws claims regarding certain statutory deadlines are and that the management policies cited by tws embodies nonbinding declarations of policy issued solely to guide nps managers and staff in their duties.on january,the district court granted the government motion for judgment on the pleadings as to all but five counts.wilderness soc y,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the district court dismissed the counts under the wilderness act and the specific enabling statutes as pursuant to a,the statute of limitations for civil actions brought against the united states.wilderness soc y,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the remaining claims were rejected for want of merit under.id.at,dist.lexis,at.tws filed a timely notice of appeal,challenging the district court dismissal of its statutory claims and denial of relief on the bulk of its claims arising under the management policies.the government did not the orders covering the five claims on which relief was granted to tws.and at oral argument before this court,the government acknowledged that nps is presently complying with the district court orders relating to these five claims and conceded that no review was properly sought on these matters.
ii.analysis 
statute of limitations 
the district court dismissed tws claims under the wilderness act and the specific enabling statutes as under a.section a provides that every civil action commenced against the united states shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues.the district court ruled that the society claims based on violations of the wilderness act,c,the big cypress national preserve addition act,the glen canyon national recreation area enabling act,and the california wilderness act,title vi,stat,were untimely,because each claim was brought more than six years after nps failed to meet its statutory deadline to perform wilderness reviews or file and complete legal boundary maps.
the society appeals this ruling on the grounds that the statute of limitations has not run,because nps is in continuous violation of its statutory obligations.tws also points out that this court has never applied a in situations comparable to this case in which a claimant has filed for mandamus to compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.the government offers no response and,noticeably,it does not attempt to defend the district court decision.
although we need not reach a final determination on this issue because we find tws lacks standing as to its statutory claims,the society appears to be right in its contention that the district court erred in dismissing the counts under the wilderness act and the specific enabling statutes as under a.this court has repeatedly refused to hold that actions seeking relief under to compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed are if initiated more than six years after an agency fails to meet a statutory deadline.for example,in in re united mine workers of america international union,the petitioner sought a writ of mandamus to compel a division of the department of labor to issue final regulations.the statute required the secretary of labor to promulgate final regulations,or explain her decision not to promulgate them,within days of a specified date.id.at.the suit was brought eight years after the agency failed to meet its deadline.id.the court nonetheless rejected the agency contention that the suit was.the court ruled that,b ecause the union does not complain about what the agency has done but rather about what the agency has yet to do,we reject the suggestion that its petition is untimely.id.at.
the decision in in re bluewater network,is to the same effect.there the court noted that the statute command ed the coast guard to establish compliance standards.there are none.id.at.the court also noted that it was faced with a clear statutory mandate,a deadline ignored,and an agency that has admitted its continuing recalcitrance.id.at.notwithstanding that the statutory deadline had been missed by nine years,the court found the petition was timely.id.at.
tws claims that nps has chronically failed to undertake various legal obligations with respect to the identification and management of wilderness in the national park system.the society complaint alleges continuing violations by the government.it does not complain about what the agency has done but rather about what the agency has yet to do,united mine workers,at.under these circumstances,it is unlikely that tws complaint would be held by this court to be by a.
tws standing 
we can not address the merits of tws claims,however,unless we are assured that the society has article iii standing.see am.library ass fcc,merits reviewed.tws may bring suit in a representational capacity on behalf of its members if 
at least one of its members has standing to sue in his or her own right,the interests the association seeks to protect are germane to its purpose,and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of an individual member in the lawsuit.
id.on the record here,tws has failed to satisfy the first standard with respect to all but its claims resting on nps alleged failure to develop wilderness management plans.
the court in lujan defenders of wildlife,d,explained that 
the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements.first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.third,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
id.at.internal citations,alterations,and quotation marks omitted.in order to establish standing,tws must demonstrate,as to each of its claims,that at least one member meets the requirements of lujan.it has failed to do this with respect to all but its claims resting on nps alleged failure to develop wilderness management plans.
the government argues that the affidavits and declarations filed by tws fail to establish injury in fact.the majority,they argue,offer nothing more than conclusory assertions that nps failure to comply with its wilderness mandates injures the member because it results in degradation of the wilderness areas he or she frequents.the remaining declarations,according to the government,are insufficiently specific in their pleadings.the government argues further that,even assuming injury in fact,the society can not establish that its members injuries are fairly traceable to nps alleged failures to act,or that compelling nps to take the actions tws requests would redress these injuries.we agree that,as to all but its claims resting on nps alleged failure to develop wilderness management plans,tws has failed to demonstrate injury in fact or redressability.
harms to aesthetic and recreational enjoyment of parks may suffice to create injury for article iii purposes.see sierra club morton,d.but the injury in fact test requires more than an injury to a cognizable interest.it requires that the party seeking review be himself among the injured.id.at.the declarations submitted by tws do not,in most instances,demonstrate particularized and concrete injuries necessary to establish article iii standing.
for example,one such declaration states 
i want the undeveloped land assessed for wilderness suitability in chaco culture national historical park to prevent future uses of the land that would be incompatible with my enjoyment of the park and the nps mandate to preserve lands it manages unimpaired for the use and enjoyment of future generations.among such potential impairments could be proposals for power line,transmission towers for communication sites,and new roads.i will suffer imminent and irreparable harm if the nps does not comply with its duty.

not all of the declarations submitted by the society are infirm in their allegations of concrete and particularized injury.this does not help tws,however.even when injury in fact is demonstrated and the alleged injuries are fairly traceable to nps failure to comply with its statutory obligations,tws has failed to show that it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injur ies will be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan,at.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
the redressability inquiry poses a simple question i f plaintiffs secured the relief they sought,would it redress their injury mountain states legal found.glickman.tws seeks three types of relief with respect to which it can not show redressability.first,in relation to two parks,glen canyon national recreation area and lake mead national recreation area,tws asks the court to order nps to forward its completed wilderness recommendations to the president second,the society asks for an order compelling the park service to complete a legal description and wilderness boundary map of designated wilderness in death valley national park.third,tws seeks an order to compel the agency to complete wilderness suitability assessments for parks.because tws is required to demonstrate standing separately for each form of relief sought,friends of the earth,at,we consider its standing in relation to each of these requests in turn,focusing specifically on the question of redressability.and,as to each claim,we hold that appellant lacks standing for want of redressability.
nps alleged failure to forward reports to the president 
tws seeks an order requiring nps to forward to the president the agency completed wilderness recommendations for glen canyon national recreation area and lake mead national recreation area.there is no good reason to believe that such an order will redress tws injuries.no legal consequences flow from the recommendations.even if this court were to order nps to forward its recommendations to the president,it would still be up to congress to decide whether to designate the cited lands as wilderness.see c wilderness act glen canyon national recreation area reporting provision.
congress has no obligation to consider the president recommendations,should he offer any,let alone act upon them.and no order from this court requiring nps to submit recommendations to the president in the hope that he will in turn forward them to congress will change this situation.see guerrero clinton,cir holding where reports to congress themselves trigger no legal consequences,any injury allegedly incurred by the absence of reporting is not redressable.in short,the judicial order that tws requests will not afford it the redress it seeks.
nps alleged failure to complete a legal description and boundary map for death valley national park 
tws similarly can not establish redressability with respect to its request for an order compelling nps to complete a legal description and boundary map of designated wilderness in death valley national park.in other words,the member injuries cited by tws will not be redressed by the relief requested.
tws submitted the declaration of wold,which asserts that she is a member of tws and that she spends significant time in death valley national park.ex.f,wold decl.the declaration states further that,in december,wold and her family had planned five park adventures for the coming year.id.the declaration identifies the particular parts of the park that wold has frequented in the past,as well as the areas that she plans to frequent over the next year.id.wold then asserts the following purported injuries 
i want the park service to fulfill its obligations to complete final boundary maps and wilderness legal descriptions for death valley national park in order to prevent uses of the land that are incompatible with my enjoyment of the park.vehicle orv ingress is a constant threat to the park.a toyota vehicle was abandoned in butte valley,located in the park,the last time we were hiking in the area.abandoned vehicles and vehicle parts have violated the beauty of park areas like surprise canyon an area of death valley she has frequented,and its delicate riparian area.
nps failure to comply with its wilderness responsibilities harms my ability to use and enjoy death valley national park as wilderness because most citizens do not realize that of the park was designated as wilderness on october.without maps,to most people with vehicles,a dirt tract is a road to be travel it they will.
it simply defies reason to think that a court order compelling nps to issue final boundary maps and legal descriptions of death valley national park will reduce vehicle abuses of the wilderness.indeed,of the park already has been designated wilderness,so the identification of protected areas is hardly an issue of any moment.there is no reason to believe and tws cites none that maps and descriptions of the park will curb vehicle abuses.tws has thus failed to show that it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injuries cited by wold will be redressed by a favorable decision on this issue.lujan,at.intern
