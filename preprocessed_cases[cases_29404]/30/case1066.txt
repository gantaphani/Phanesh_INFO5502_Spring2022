the metropolitan transportation commission plans,coordinates,and finances regional transportation in the san francisco bay area.over the past twenty five years,mtc has been one of several government agencies responsible for preparing and implementing programs to attain federal air quality standards in the bay area in order to comply with the clean air act.one component of a plan initially adopted in was called transportation control measure,or,in the tradition of acronyms which infects both government and environmental regulation,tcm.tcm was designed to reduce air pollutants by increasing the use of public transit.the reductions in emissions estimated to result from tcm were predicated on a target ridership increase of over ridership levels.in this legal action,plaintiffs bayview hunters point community advocates and others collectively bayview contend that tcm imposed an enforceable obligation upon mtc to increase ridership by over levels,and that mtc failure to achieve such an increase constitutes a violation of tcm.
the district court granted summary judgment in bayview favor and issued an injunction requiring mtc to achieve a increase in ridership over levels.see bayview hunters point cmty.advocates metropolitan transp.comm n,d bayview i bayview hunters point cmty.advocates metropolitan transp.comm n,d bayview ii.on appeal,mtc argues that the district court erred in concluding that tcm constitutes a binding commitment to achieve a increase in public transit ridership.
the language and logic of tcm lead us to conclude that tcm does not impose an enforceable obligation on mtc to increase public transit ridership.we therefore reverse the district court judgment and injunction.
background 
regulatory framework 
the clean air act caa requires the environmental protection agency epa to promulgate standards for certain pollutants,including hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides which produce ground level ozone,also known as smog.these standards are called the national ambient air quality standards naaqs.a,b.each state is required under the caa to adopt a state implementation plan sip to satisfy the naaqs requirements.a.specifically,each state is mandated under a of the act,a,to adopt a plan which provides for implementation,maintenance,and enforcement of the ambient air quality standards and to submit its sip to the epa for approval.each sip must include enforceable emission limitations and other control measures necessary to attain the naaqs,as well as timetables for compliance.a a.a sip is subject to approval by the epa to see that it meets the criteria specified in.
a sip,once adopted by a state and approved by the epa,becomes controlling and must be carried out by the state.friends of the earth carey,cir,cert.denied,d.approved sips are enforceable by either the state,the epa,or via citizen suits brought under section a of the caa.see baughman bradford coal,cir a.
a state may elect to include emission reduction strategies called transportation control measures tcms as part of its sip.n.a tcm is any measure contained in a sip whose purpose is to reduce air pollutants from transportation sources,cars by reducing vehicle use or changing traffic flow or congestion conditions.see.
factual summary 
mtc,the bay area air quality management district,and the association of bay area governments served as agencies responsible for the preparation and implementation of the bay area air quality plan sip.the sip set forth an approximate time schedule for adopting and implementing the control programs necessary to attain the federal air quality standards for ozone and carbon monoxide by the deadline specified by the clean air act.it contained three categories of minimum control measures as defined by epa,one of which was reasonably available transportation control measures.the epa approved the sip in its entirety.
the sip contained ten tcms that were to be implemented to reduce both hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions.as one of several measures involving public transportation,tcm dealt with ridership levels.tcm was contained on a single page and provided,in its entirety,as follows 
tcm support improvements identified in transit operator plans,after consultation with the operators adopt ridership increase target for.

mtc subsequently adopted the estimate as the actual target for the ridership increase.but despite the implementation of tcm,by transit ridership had increased by only above the levels,rather than the that was set as the target.
the overall emission reduction estimates set in the sip were not met,either.in,two for a better environment and the sierra suit against mtc and related state transit agencies to implement the contingency plan provisions of the sip in light of the shortfall in emissions reduction.see citizens for a better env t deukmejian.cbe i citizens for a better env t deukmejian.cbe ii and citizens for a better env t wilson.cbe iii consolidated actions.the district court determined that mtc was liable for failing to implement the transportation contingency plan,and in turn ordered mtc to adopt sufficient transportation control measures within six months of september,to bring the region back within the reasonable further progress line.cbe.at.in february of,mtc adopted contingency tcms.
air quality monitoring indicated that the bay area region satisfied the ozone standards from to.see.may.in mtc,the bay area air quality management district,and the association of bay area governments proposed to replace the sip with a maintenance sip,which the epa approved on may.see.may.when the bay area later fell out of attainment of the ozone naaqs,mtc and its agencies prepared a number of revised ozone attainment plan,the proposed ozone attainment plan,and the revised ozone attainment at getting back into compliance with the ozone standard.
tcm has remained a part of each subsequently revised bay area sip.though mtc in preparing its ozone attainment plan suggested to the epa that tcm and other older tcms be removed from the sip,the epa rejected this suggestion on the grounds that tcm and the other tcms clearly have emissions reductions in the sip and that mtc had failed to propose new measures to provide the equivalent or greater emissions reductions.a increase in ridership over the baseline period has never been achieved,however.in the last complete fiscal year for which there are ridership statistics in the record,fy,transit ridership had increased about over the baseline.
bayview filed a caa citizen suit under a against mtc,the city and county of san francisco as the legal representative of the city local public transit agency,the san francisco municipal railway,or muni,and the costa transit district which serves the east bay communities in february.bayview alleged that the parties were in violation of tcm as they had failed to achieve a increase in public transit ridership above levels,and sought injunctive relief and an award of civil penalties.the costa transit district settled with bayview at the outset of the case.
in ruling on for summary judgment,the district court interpreted tcm to impose five separate requirements 
that the region six major transit operators,including muni,adopt plans for 
that mtc consults with the operators on ridership targets and subsequently adopts a target for increased regional transit ridership for 
that mtc seeks to ensure that the operators plans are implemented via the implementation of the tip transportation improvement plan and allocation of sufficient funding 
that mtc monitors ridership gains through annual rfp reasonable further progress reports and 
that mtc and the region six major transit operators achieve a regional transit ridership increase of over levels.
bayview i,d at.
there is no dispute concerning the first four requirements.mtc acknowledged that it was required under tcm to implement those specific strategies,sometimes described as a implementation schedule.id.at.as to those four requirements,though,the district court concluded either that mtc was not liable for failing to fulfill those commitments or that its failure was inconsequential.id.at.
the current controversy concerns the fifth requirement,that a increase in ridership be achieved.defendants argued that tcm did not establish such a requirement,but merely an unenforceable target.the district court disagreed.id.at.it concluded that actual achievement of the ridership increase was a separate requirement of tcm.id.at.as a result,the district court found both mtc and muni liable for violating requirement,and granted summary judgment on that issue to bayview.muni thereafter settled with bayview,leaving mtc as the sole remaining defendant.
the district court granted bayview subsequent motion for injunctive relief and issued a permanent injunction against mtc in july.bayview ii,d at.the permanent injunction requires mtc to increase public transit ridership to the target increase level over the baseline.id.at.the requirement was computed to be million annual transit boardings.that level must be achieved within five years after the decision in bayview i,meaning by november.id.the injunction also requires mtc to amend its regional transportation plan to include a section specifying how it will achieve full implementation of tcm.after slightly modifying the injunction,the district court entered final judgment.mtc appeals the injunction and final judgment.
ii.discussion 
a.the plain language of tcm 
we start with the plain language of tcm.a regulation should be construed to give effect to the natural and plain meaning of its words.crown pacific occupational safety health review comm n,cir citation and quotation marks omitted.no provision within tcm actually stated that mtc was required to increase ridership by any specific amount.tcm required mtc to undertake the implementation strategies,including s upport improvements identified in the transit operator plans and adopt a ridership increase target for.the expected ridership increase was never described as anything more than a target,however.the district court itself acknowledged as much,twice,observing that tcm does not,on its face,require a ridership increase of,and that nothing in the language of tcm explicitly requires that the increase be achieved.bayview i,d at.
agreeing to establish a ridership target is simply not the same as promising to attain that target.a fundamental principle of contract formation is that a promise must be distinguished from a statement of opinion or a mere prediction of future events.restatement second of contracts cmt.f.similarly,predictions as to future events are ordinarily expressions of opinion under basic principles of the tort of fraudulent misrepresentation.in re jogert,cir quoting richard vista del mar child care,d.
that by its plain language tcm does not establish a mandatory requirement to increase transit ridership by a specified percentage weighs heavily against the conclusion that such an obligation can be imposed based upon tcm.as laudatory as the goal of reducing the ozone level is,an obligation can not be imposed based upon a sip if that obligation was not actually undertaken in the sip.
the underlying problem appears to be that the increases in productivity did not result in the projected increase in ridership.significantly,the district court did not find that mtc failed to take the actions specified in tcm that were more reasonably within its more explicitly spelled out as commitments in tcm as to s upport improvements identified in transit operator plans.moreover,the district court expressed sympathy for defendants argument that outside example,changing work patterns or individual preferences in choosing to ride or not to ride public prevent the region from achieving a or,indeed,any other increase in transit ridership.bayview i,d at.the district court concluded,however,that this argument was irrelevant.id.at we disagree.
it would have been apparent at the time that tcm was adopted that it might not be possible to achieve a increase purely through productivity increases.predicting human behavior is an inexact science at best.honig doe,d.indeed,that is probably why tcm contained the word target.unable to be certain that implementation of the specific steps spelled out in tcm would result in a specified level of ridership,the drafters of tcm were careful enough not to characterize any given increase in ridership as an obligation.interpreting tcm otherwise would imply the implausible proposition that mtc drafted and proposed a tcm even though its compliance would be contingent upon a number of uncontrollable external factors.see griffin oceanic contractors,d it is true that interpretations of a statute which would produce absurd results are to be avoided if alternative interpretations consistent with the legislative purpose are available.black law dictionary ed.lex non cogit ad impossibilia the law does not compel the doing of impossibilities.
there was logic behind the language that was used in tcm.in the face of that language and logic,the conclusion that tcm established a binding obligation on the part of mtc to achieve a specific increase in public transit ridership can not be sustained.
b.other portions of tcm 
the injunction sought by bayview and entered by the district court does not state how mtc is to increase ridership.it simply requires mtc to amend the regional transportation plan to include a section addressing specifically how mtc will achieve the target increase and provide the court with regular reports describing its efforts towards achieving compliance,including interim ridership statistics.bayview ii,d at.
tcm was not silent on that subject,though.it explicitly stated that the ridership increase would be achieved by improvements in productivity without costing much more money.tcm cost section identified the costs of tcm essentially as the c osts of maintaining the existing level of services.it went on to explain that r idership increases would come from productivity improvements,thus additional costs would be moderate.the description of control measure section of tcm explicitly stated that s ince federal funds for transit purposes are being cut back,many of the improvements identified in the transit operators year plans deal with increased productivity.thus,while the size of the transit system may not grow significantly,the ridership is expected to increase.presumably,that meant that substantial additional funds,notably for capital investments to expand the transit system,would not be required in order to reach the target.
if tcm is read to impose an obligation binding on mtc to achieve a ridership increase,then those other parts of tcm must be read to be part of that obligation,too.a basic rule of statutory construction is that one provision should not be interpreted in a way which is internally contradictory or that renders other provisions of the same statute inconsistent or meaningless.hughes air public utilities comm n,cir see also united states,cir citing ratzlaf united states,d noting that this court avoid s a statutory construction that would render another part of the same statute superfluous.this principle is also fundamental in contract interpretation.see,ins.of state of pennsylvania associated intern.ins,cir noting the principle under california law that t he whole of a contract is to be taken together,so as to give effect to every part,if reasonably practicable,each clause helping to interpret the other.quoting c.civ.code west.
assuming for discussion that it required mtc to achieve a increase in ridership,tcm,read in full,also required that mtc attain the increase through productivity increases not requiring the expenditure of substantially more funds.but that is not what the injunction says.nor,it turns out,is it how mtc is expected to satisfy the injunction.mtc later submission to the district court regarding its compliance with the july injunctive order demonstrates that its current efforts to increase transit ridership depend not on productivity improvements,but rather on system expansions,such as increasing the size of the transit fleet,growth in revenue hours of service,and growth in the size of transit operating budgets.mtc submission of regional transportation plan amendment in compliance with july,order,attach.at filed january.mtc has specifically identified a number of new transit projects intended to increase ridership,including the purchase of new buses,extension of the bay area rapid transit subway system with new lines and stations,and,over the long term,the implementation of a major new transit expansion program for the bay area.see id.at.mtc submits that its regional transportation plan,which allocates of total transit expenditures to transit expansion,provides the foundation for achieving the percent ridership increase.id.at.that program is not what was provided for in tcm.a requirement that mtc attain a increase in ridership,no matter how and without regard to the cost,can be inferred from tcm only by disregarding parts of tcm itself.that measure was not a blank check on mtc account and can not properly be read that way.
enforceable sip strategies and unenforceable sip goals 
in giving effect to tcm provisions outlining its productivity improvements strategy,we recognize the rule that courts may only enforce specific sip strategies,and may not enforce a sip overall objectives or aspirational goals.see,trustees for alaska fink,cir noting that tcms in a sip must be submitted to the epa in an enforceable form and that a sip is not enforceable apart from specific tcm strategies citations omitted action for rational transit west side highway,cir aims and goals of the sip are not enforceable apart from the specific measures designed to achieve them.tcm clearly designated implementation of the productivity improvements outlined in the transit operators five year plans as a specific sip strategy to increase ridership,where ridership increases serve as a proxy for emissions reductions accordingly,the target was an unenforceable estimate or goal that was directly correlative to the general objectives that inhere in attainment of the naaqs.
this is further supported by reading tcm against the backdrop of tcm,which reaffirms a measure from the air quality plan that was intended to improve transit service and increase ridership.see campesinos unidos dep t of labor,cir o ur task is to interpret the regulation as a whole,in light of the overall statutory and regulatory scheme,and not to give force to one phrase in isolation.tcm stated that it was basically an extension of tcm.according to the text of tcm,the provision reaffirms the commitment to the strategy,which sought to improve transit service based upon the transit operators five year plans.this strategy was expected to increase transit ridership by between and.emphasis added 
while the district court found that tcm reaffirmation of the strategy implied an enforceable,general sip strategy of increasing ridership,the entire text of tcm actually supports the view that ridership increase targets are unenforceable sip goals.tcm explicitly stated that ridership increases were to be accomplished through the enforceable strategy of improv ing transit service based upon the transit operators plans.as tcm was basically an extension of tcm it similarly had an enforceable strategy of improving transit services,specifically through the productivity improvements outlined in the transit operators plans.
d.the absence of a ridership increase requirement does not render tcm virtually meaningless 
bayview argues,and the district court agreed,that failure to infer an increase ridership obligation would render tcm virtually meaningless.bayview i,d at.if the target is perceived as only a voluntary objective,mtc could perpetually engage in wishful thinking regarding emissions reductions.
that disregards the larger regulatory scheme of which tcm was a part.the existence of the sip contingency plan control measures and the availability of sip revisions render unnecessary the inference of an enforceable ridership increase.mtc failure to achieve a increase in ridership does not imply its noncompliance with tcm rather,it implies the failure of tcm productivity improvement strategy to increase ridership and therefore reduce emissions.similarly,mtc failure to achieve the target does not imply its noncompliance with the caa.indeed,mtc attainment of the naaqs through the implementation of contingency measures in the early,while it failed to obtain the target,demonstrates that the target was not a mandated condition precedent to naaqs attainment 
it is on this point that the dissent misconstrues tcm statement that r idership gains are monitored through annual reasonable further progress reports as meaningful only if tcm ridership target is perceived as an enforceable strategy of the sip.where a state agency fails to make reasonable further progress rfp,which is nothing more than a measure of the progress of control measures in reducing emissions deemed necessary to attain naaqs,it may resort to contingency measures.the purpose of the monitoring requirement was to demonstrate the ongoing feasibility of rfp under tcm,not to ensure that mtc was in compliance with tcm.given that tcm expected ridership gains were intended to be correlative to its expected emissions reductions,the unexpectedly low ridership levels described in the rfp monitoring reports indicated that tcm was not achieving adequate emissions reductions to make rfp.quite sensibly,the sip specifically provided that i f a determination is made that rfp is not being met for the transportation sector,mtc will adopt additional tcms within months of the determination.
this is exactly what happened in the case at hand,as the early cbe i,ii,and iii litigation demonstrates.the failure to achieve the estimated emission reductions under the sip resulted in the adoption of a number of contingency tcms to make up the emissions reduction shortfall.the history of the sip establishes that the ridership target,a mechanism for calculating corresponding emission reduction estimates under tcm,was essentially an overly optimistic assessment of the effect that mtc productivity improvements strategy was to have on ridership levels.
the relevant solution to the emissions shortfall has been,and continues to be,sip revisions that incorporate new tcms bayview citizen suit represents an inappropriate attempt to alter tcm explicit provisions.parties may not,through a citizen suit,obtain modification of an sip to conform with their own notion of proper environmental policy.wilder thomas,cir,cert.denied,d quotation marks and citations omitted.citizen suits may only be brought to enforce specific measures,strategies,or commitments designed to ensure compliance with the naaqs.conservation law,busey,cir emphasis added.the sole aspects of tcm that were designed to reduce emissions and achieve naaqs attainment were the productivity improvements of the transit operators plans,not the ridership target.the only appropriate basis for bayview citizen suit would thus be that mtc has failed to implement the transit operators plans.as the district court found mtc not liable with respec
