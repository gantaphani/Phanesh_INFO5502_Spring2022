klamath siskiyou wildlands center,umpqua watersheds,and cascadia wildlands project collectively,ks wild appeal the district court finding that the bureau of land management blm and annual species review decisions regarding the red tree vole were lawful.ks wild also appeals the district court finding that the cow catcher and cottonsnake timber sales were valid and should be permitted to go forward.the district court determined that blm decisions did not violate the federal land policy management act flpma or the national environmental policy act nepa.we reverse the judgment of the district court and direct the entry of an injunction enjoining the cow catcher and cottonsnake timber sales from going forward.
factual procedural history 
in,the federal government adopted a comprehensive forest management plan known as the northwest forest plan nwfp.the nwfp amended the resource management plans for many blm districts,including the roseburg and medford districts at issue in this case,by allocating lands amongst several administrative categories throughout million acres in the pacific northwest.
in addition to the land allocations,the nwfp also established survey and manage requirements to provide additional protections for species that might not be adequately protected by the land allocations.the nwfp survey and manage requirements protected over species of amphibians,mammals,bryophytes,mollusks,vascular plants,fungi,lichens,and arthropods within the northern spotted owl range.the red tree vole was one of the protected species.
in,blm and the forest service amended the nwfp by issuing the record of decision for amendments to the northwest forest plan rod.the agencies prepared a final supplemental environmental impact statement fseis providing evidentiary support and extensive scientific analysis for the rod.
the rod made two significant changes to the nwfp pertinent to this case.first,it modified the survey and manage species protections by expanding from a to a classification system.it assigned the red tree vole to category c,which requires management of sites,surveys,and strategic surveys prior to any agency action that would disturb the species habitat.second,the rod created the annual species review asr process,which requires blm to acquire,evaluate,and apply new information to implement changes or refinements to the survey and manage classifications.
on june,after completing its first asr regarding the red tree vole,blm issued a memorandum downgrading the red tree vole survey and manage classification from category c to category d the asr decision in contrast to the protections afforded species listed under category c,blm is not required to conduct surveys for species listed under category on december,blm issued a second memorandum removing the vole survey and manage designation entirely the asr decision 
on june,blm issued an environmental assessment ea for the cow catcher timber sale.in accordance with its asr decision downgrading the vole to category d,blm did not conduct surveys for the vole.on august,blm issued a finding of no significant impact fonsi for the cow catcher sale,which was ultimately awarded to johnson lumber,the in this case.
also in june,blm released an ea for the cottonsnake timber sale in which blm acknowledged that if any vole nests existed within the units to be harvested they would likely be destroyed.on august,blm issued a fonsi for the cottonsnake sale,which has not yet been awarded.
on december,ks wild filed a complaint,seeking to enjoin the cow catcher and cottonsnake timber sales,and to invalidate the asr decisions on the grounds that they violated flpma,they were invalid under nepa,and they were the product of arbitrary and capricious agency action.the district court issued a preliminary injunction,and both parties moved for summary judgment.on june,magistrate judge cooney issued his findings and recommendations regarding the parties for summary judgment,and on february,the district court issued a final order,adopting the findings and recommendations in part,and denying relief on ks wild flpma,nepa,and arbitrary and capricious claims.in light of these findings,the court also found no basis upon which to enjoin blm or johnson from going forward with the timber sales.ks wild timely appealed to this court.
we conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of blm.the and asr decisions are invalid under both flpma and nepa,and because we set the decisions aside on these grounds,we need not reach ks wild arbitrary and capricious claim.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.native ecosystems council forest,cir.agency decisions that allegedly violate nepa and flpma are reviewed under the administrative procedure act apa,and may be set aside if they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.id.quoting a.
iii.estoppel 
we must first decide whether two of the appellants,klamath siskiyou wildlands center and umpqua watersheds,should be estopped from bringing this appeal johnson an argument not joined by should be estopped on grounds of judicial estoppel and laches.we reject both arguments.
judicial estoppel 
judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine that precludes a party from gaining an advantage by asserting one position,and then later seeking an advantage by taking a clearly inconsistent position.hamilton state farm fire cas,cir.thus,an inconsistent factual or legal position is a threshold requirement of the doctrine.united states lence,cir.
johnson argues that in a previous action,northwest ecosystem alliance rey,wl,successfully invalidated a record of decision rod,which temporarily replaced the rod on the basis that the rod should remain in effect.johnson alleges should be estopped from arguing in the instant case that the and asr decisions are unlawful.johnson argument is without merit.
in rey,sought to preserve the asr process,arguing that additional time was needed to give the process a chance to work.however,in the instant case,ks wild is challenging the asr decisions regarding the red tree vole,not the entire asr process.argued in rey that the rod,which completely eliminated the survey and manage strategy,was not supported by a thorough,reasoned analysis regarding the likely impacts of the decision.see rey,wl,at.asserting that the rod is an effective forest management strategy is quite different than arguing that all agency actions ostensibly taken pursuant to that strategy are lawful.moreover,the only reasonable relief that could seek under the administrative procedure act in rey was to have the district court reinstate the rod.paulsen daniels,cir the effect of invalidating an agency rule is to reinstate the rule previously in force.
in rey supported the rod and the asr process only insofar as they sought to invalidate the rod.therefore,the record indicates that have not taken a clearly inconsistent position in this action,and judicial estoppel does not apply.
johnson laches argument also fails.to demonstrate laches,a party must establish lack of diligence by the party against whom the defense is asserted,and prejudice to the party asserting the defense.apache survival coalition united states,cir.johnson has established neither requirement.
johnson alleges that showed lack of diligence by abandoning an earlier action,oregon natural resource council fund veneman,civ,in which they challenged the rod.however,veneman was dismissed without prejudice on december,and ks wild filed its complaint in the instant case on december.this does not show a lack of diligence.
moreover,johnson alleges it has been prejudiced by the delay because it has needed the timber from the cow catcher sale throughout the pendency of this litigation.this is not the type of irreversible harm that is properly considered in a laches analysis.neighbors of cuddy mountain forest,cir we know of no case in which a private company economic loss was considered pertinent to the analysis of a laches defense.apache survival coalition,at holding that prejudice must be what congress defines as prejudice.the primary concern is whether the harm that congress sought to prevent is now irreversible.internal quotations omitted.furthermore,laches is disfavored in environmental cases because the public,and not just the plaintiffs,will be harmed by environmental damage.id.at.therefore,laches does not estop from bringing this appeal.
iv.the flpma claim 
the federal land policy management act flpma,establishes requirements for land use planning on public land,including the land covered by the nwfp.flpma requires that blm,under the secretary of the interior,develop,maintain,and when appropriate,revise land use plans to ensure that land management be conducted on the basis of multiple use and sustained yield.a,a see also kern bureau of land,cir holding that flpma requires the blm to prepare resource management plans for the various districts under its control.the process for developing,maintaining,and revising resource management plans is controlled by federal regulations at.
under flpma,if blm wishes to change a resource management plan,it can only do so by formally amending the plan pursuant to.section states,in pertinent part 
an amendment shall be initiated by the need to consider monitoring and evaluation findings,new data,new or revised policy,a change in circumstances or a proposed action that may result in a change in the scope of resource uses or a change in the terms,conditions and decisions of the approved plan.an amendment shall be made through an environmental assessment of the proposed change,or an environmental impact statement,if necessary,public involvement as prescribed in of this title,interagency coordination and consistency determination as prescribed in of this title and any other data or analysis that may be appropriate 
id.thus,blm must amend a management plan when an action is proposed that changes either the scope of resource uses or the terms,conditions and decisions of the plan.
not all changes to a plan,however,require formal amendment.blm may take steps to maintain plans under,which permits maintenance 
as necessary to reflect minor changes in data.such maintenance is limited to further refining or documenting a previously approved decision incorporated in the plan.maintenance shall not result in expansion in the scope of resource uses or restrictions,or change the terms,conditions,and decisions of the approved plan.maintenance is not considered a plan amendment and shall not require the formal public involvement and interagency coordination process described under and of this title or the preparation of an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement.maintenance shall be documented in plans and supporting records.
blm concedes it did not take formal steps to amend the rod.instead,blm asserts the asr decisions maintain the rod in accordance with,and that the requirements of are inapposite.accordingly,blm argues it was not required to formally amend the resource management plans,nor was it required to comply with the environmental assessment,environmental impact statement,public disclosure,and interagency coordination requirements in.
we disagree.it is clear the and asr decisions amended the resource management plans.they resulted from the need to consider new information regarding the red tree vole and they changed the terms and conditions of the plans without complying with.therefore,the asr decisions violated flpma.
as explained in part ii,supra,the asr decision downgraded the red tree vole survey and manage designation from category c to category d,and the decision removed the red tree vole from survey and manage protection entirely.the asr decisions can not reasonably be defined as plan maintenance under flpma because the if made pursuant to the asr nothing short of amend the resource management plans.
first,defining plan maintenance actions and defining plan amendments are not equal in scope the former is more narrow.section limits plan maintenance to actions that reflect minor changes in data and are limited to further refining or documenting a previously approved decision incorporated in the plan.in contrast,requires plan amendments whenever there is a need to consider monitoring and evaluation findings,new data,new or revised policy,or a change in circumstances.
blm states the asr decisions were based on data of which was new.it is plainly unreasonable to assert that this qualifies as a minor change in data under.moreover,by comparing with,it is evident the latter captures a wider spectrum of agency action.these provisions were created as complements,and taken together they ensure that whenever resource management plans are changed in any meaningful way,the changes must be made via amendment,supported by scientific environmental analysis and public disclosure.this is consistent with flpma requirement that blm ensure the views of the general public and participation are adequately incorporated into the land planning process.see a.this interpretation is also supported by provisions of flpma that require blm to manage public lands in accordance with resource management plans once they have been established.see a a see also norton utah wilderness alliance,d observing that the statutory directive in a prevent s blm from taking actions inconsistent with the provisions of a land use plan.
second,clearly requires a formal plan amendment anytime a proposed action changes a term,condition,or decision of a resource management plan.blm argues that the survey and manage designations created by the rod were not intended as a rigid set of requirements that would remain the same over the life of the resource management plans,and that the asr decisions did not change the terms of the rod because shifting species between survey and manage designations was expected.
blm is partly correct the rod contemplated that moving a species from one survey strategy to another or dropping survey and manage protection for any species whose status is determined to be more secure than originally projected could occur under the plan.however,merely because the rod contemplated this type of change,it does not necessarily follow that all contemplated changes fall under the narrow definition of plan maintenance in.if that were the law,blm could circumvent the mandates of,requiring environmental assessments and impact statements,public disclosure,by merely designing a management plan that contemplates a wide swath of future changes.not only would such a strategy flip the regulatory scheme created by and on its head by defining plan maintenance broadly and plan amendments narrowly,it would render nugatory the provisions of flpma requiring blm to act in accordance with established resource management plans.a.
it is readily apparent that the asr decisions altered the terms and conditions of the roseburg and medford districts resource management plans.prior to the decisions,blm was required to manage red tree vole sites,conduct surveys to discover additional sites,and create a buffer zone around each known site for every proposed timber sale.in contrast,after the decisions,blm is not required to take steps to discover vole sites within a proposed harvest area.when it announced the cottonsnake timber sale,blm even recognized that vole surveys were no longer required prior to logging,and if any undiscovered vole nests occurred within the units to be logged,they would likely be destroyed.
if blm can modify the protection afforded a species under a resource management plan as dramatically as it has complying with could ultimately remove all the survey and manage designations without ever conducting another ea or eis,and without providing public disclosure.such steps would undoubtedly run contrary to both the goals and language of flpma.
ks wild urges us to also hold that the asr decisions violate because changing the vole survey and manage status resulted in a change in the scope of resource uses.because the asr decisions potentially increased the amount of timber to be harvested measured as the probable sale quantity psq,ks wild argues that the asr decisions should be deemed amendments on this basis alone.
we disagree.the psq is only a rough approximation of annual avera
