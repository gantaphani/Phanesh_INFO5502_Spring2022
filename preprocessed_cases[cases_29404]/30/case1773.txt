on transfer to this court from the appellate division of the san diego county superior court,the people of the state of california appeal an order of the trial court granting defendant bounh maikhio penal code section motion to suppress evidence in its case against him for two misdemeanor fishing offenses.on appeal,the people contend the trial court erred by granting the motion to suppress because fish and game code sections and authorized the state of california department of fish and game dfg warden to stop maikhio vehicle to conduct an inspection and that stop was reasonable under the fourth amendment to the united states constitution even if he had no reasonable suspicion maikhio was involved in criminal activity and,alternatively,the warden had reasonable suspicion under the fourth amendment that maikhio was involved in criminal activity and therefore could lawfully stop maikhio vehicle.we conclude the dfg warden did not have either the statutory or constitutional authority to stop maikhio vehicle in the circumstances of this case.
factual and procedural background 
at about on august,dfg warden erik fleet issued a citation to maikhio for possession of a california spiny lobster during closed season in violation of california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision a,and for failure to exhibit his catch on demand in violation of section.after the people filed a misdemeanor complaint case no.against maikhio,he was arraigned and pleaded not guilty.maikhio subsequently moved to suppress evidence pursuant to penal code section.
on december,the trial court heard maikhio motion to suppress,together with motions to suppress made by two other defendants in similar cases at the hearing,fleet testified that at about on august,he was on duty and observed activities on the ocean beach pier by using a spotting telescope mounted on his truck,which was parked on narragansett street.fleet saw maikhio fishing on the pier,using a method called.maikhio was accompanied by a woman and an infant.fleet saw maikhio catch something and place it in a black bag next to him.fleet could not see what maikhio had caught and placed in the bag.fleet watched as maikhio and the other two persons left the pier,entered the parking lot,and drove away from the parking lot in maikhio vehicle.fleet then stopped maikhio vehicle because he wanted to make sure that he maikhio was in compliance with the california fishing laws and regulations.fleet testified that he did n ot necessarily suspect at the time of the stop that maikhio had broken the law.
after stopping maikhio vehicle,fleet,who was in uniform,approached maikhio and introduced himself as a dfg warden.fleet asked maikhio if he had any fish or lobsters in his vehicle.maikhio answered,no.fleet then searched the vehicle pursuant to section and found the black bag in the rear passenger area under the woman feet.he looked inside the bag and found a california spiny lobster.fleet placed maikhio in handcuffs for his fleet safety,sat maikhio on the curb,and continued his search of the vehicle which revealed nothing more.maikhio eventually admitted the lobster was his.
fleet issued a citation to maikhio for possessing a lobster during closed season,tit,subd.a and for failing to exhibit his catch on demand.fleet testified that,pursuant to his training as a dfg warden,he waited to stop maikhio vehicle until after maikhio left the pier and parking lot so that fleet would not blow his cover at the pier and therefore could continue to effectively work the pier and catch other possible law violators that night.on direct examination by the prosecutor,fleet described the method of fishing 
they were fishing on the pier in a method we call hand lining,which is commonly used to catch lobsters.it an illegal method of catching lobsters,but it very productive and it basically a person holds a fishing line in their hand,either the fishing line goes back to their fishing rod and reel or they hold it in their hand and they jerk the fishing line which generally has a treble hook on the bottom of it with the weight on it and squid is usually used for bait.and it gives them a better feel of the bottom because a lobster does strike the bait,it will actually climb onto the bait and they lift the line up when they feel weight on it,they jerk it which causes the hook to penetrate the lobster and they bring it up.it very common and that what drew my attention to maikhio.
however,on,fleet admitted that can also be used for regular fishing.following arguments of counsel,the trial court granted maikhio motion to suppress evidence.
on appeal,the appellate division of the san diego county superior court initially reversed the trial court order granting maikhio motion to suppress and,after a rehearing,again reversed trial court order.the appellate division concluded fleet lawfully stopped maikhio under sections and to conduct a compliance inspection.in addition,it concluded fleet had reasonable suspicion to believe maikhio was in possession of an illegally caught lobster,based on his observation of maikhio using the method to catch something,because that method of fishing is commonly used to catch lobsters.
maikhio filed an application for certification for transfer of the case to this court pursuant to california rules of court,rule.on may,the appellate division issued an order granting maikhio application for certification for transfer,stating t ransfer is necessary to settle the following important question of law whether fish and game code sections and authorize vehicle stops without reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct.
on may,we issued an order transferring the case to this court for hearing and decision.we requested briefing by the parties on the following issues whether fish and game code sections and authorize vehicle stops without reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct and whether the warden in this case had reasonable suspicion to believe maikhio was engaged in illegal lobster fishing.the parties have submitted,and we have considered,briefs on those issues.
discussion 
ivehicle stops pursuant to sections and without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity 
the people contend fleet lawfully stopped maikhio vehicle pursuant to sections and without reasonable suspicion that he committed any crime.they argue fleet authority to stop maikhio vehicle must be implied as necessary to carry out express powers granted to the dfg by sections and,and the stop was reasonable under the fourth amendment.the parties do not cite,and we are unaware of,any case addressing this question,which we believe is one of first impression.
in interpreting a statute,we first examine the actual language of the statute and give the statute words their ordinary,everyday meaning unless the statute gives them a special meaning.halbert lumber,lucky stores,th.if the meaning of a statute language is certain and unambiguous,then its language controls.id.at.however,if the meaning of a statute words is not clear,we review the statute legislative history.ibid.in the event a statute language and legislative history do not reveal a clear meaning,we then apply reason,practicality,and common sense to its language to,if possible,interpret the statute words to make them workable and reasonable.id.at.finally,i f a statute is susceptible of two constructions,one of which will render it constitutional and the other unconstitutional in whole or in part,or raise serious and doubtful constitutional questions,the court will adopt the construction which,without doing violence to the reasonable meaning of the language used,will render it valid in its entirety,or free from doubt as to its constitutionality,even though the other construction is equally reasonable.citations.the basis of this rule is the presumption that the legislature intended,not to violate the constitution,but to enact a valid statute within the scope of its constitutional powers.miller municipal court cal d.
section provides 
the department the dfg may inspect the following 
a all boats,markets,stores and other buildings,except dwellings,and all receptacles,except the clothing actually worn by a person at the time of inspection,where birds,mammals,fish,reptiles,or amphibia may be stored,placed,or held for sale or storage 
section provides 
all licenses,tags,and the birds,mammals,fish,reptiles,or amphibians taken or otherwise dealt with under this code,and any device or apparatus designed to be,and capable of being,used to take birds,mammals,fish,reptiles,or amphibians shall be exhibited upon demand to any person authorized by the department to enforce this code or any law relating to the protection and conservation of birds,mammals,fish,reptiles,or amphibians.
we conclude,as maikhio asserts and the people apparently concede,the language of section does not provide for the inspection of vehicles by the dfg.the words used in section do not include the word vehicle,and its other words can not be reasonably construed to include inspection of vehicles.we conclude the ordinary,everyday meaning of the word receptacles does not include vehicles.in interpreting virtually identical language contained in section predecessor,former section the california attorney general in addressed this precise question and concluded 
t here is nothing in former section which commands the search or inspection of automobiles.as used in that section the word receptacles can not be extended to connote motor vehicles.the sentence in which the word is contained was added to section of the political code by stats,page,and a reading of the whole indicates that the legislature did not intend to include automobiles by implication in the enumeration of places and things that shall be inspected.moreover,it must be borne in mind that in automobiles were not as extensively used as they are today and the probability of transporting contraband game in cars was not as likely then as it is now.former s ection,therefore,confers no authority on the commission or its officers to inspect or search automobiles,supra,italics added.
in,the legislature repealed former section and reenacted it as section without substantial modification to the dfg inspection authority.stats,ch.in,the legislature amended section,but only added reptiles to the list of animals.stats,ch.because we presume the legislature was aware of the attorney general opinion when it enacted and subsequently amended section,we presume the legislature approved of the attorney general construction of section as not including vehicles within the dfg inspection authority.orange county employees county of orange th,henderson board of education d.had the legislature disagreed with the attorney general interpretation of former section,it presumably would have expressly included the word vehicles on enacting or subsequently amending section.had the legislature intended to authorize the dfg and its wardens to inspect vehicles,it could have expressly so provided by simply adding the word vehicles to section list of items that may be inspected.we therefore conclude the legislature intended the dfg section inspection authority to not extend or apply to vehicles.because the plain meaning of the words of section and its legislative history show section inspection authority does not include inspection of vehicles,we need not address the remaining rules of statutory construction.in any event,we conclude reason,practicality,and common sense support our interpretation of section.our interpretation also avoids any potential constitutionality issues were section interpreted as granting the dfg and its wardens broad authority to inspect vehicles.miller municipal court,supra,cal d at.
apparently conceding section does not expressly authorize the dfg or its wardens to inspect vehicles,the people assert the dfg authority to stop and inspect vehicles must be implied as necessary to carry out express powers granted it under sections and.in people perez th,the court noted the general rule that g overnment officials may exercise such powers as are necessary to carry out the powers granted by statute or that may be fairly implied from the statute.citation.id.at see also dickey raisin proration zone cal d,betchart department of fish game d.pursuant to the powers expressly granted to the dfg by section to inspect boats and receptacles in which fish may be stored and by section to demand that a person exhibit his or her catch,we agree with the people assertion that there are certain additional powers that may be fairly implied as necessary to carry out those express powers.for example,it may be fairly implied from sections and that a dfg warden generally has the implied power to stop people who are fishing on a pier to demand they exhibit their catch and to inspect their receptacles,tackle boxes,pails,in which fish may be stored.however,contrary to the people conclusory assertion,it can not be fairly implied from the dfg express statutory powers that its wardens have the power to stop a specific vehicle on a public street and detain its occupants to make a section demand and conduct a section inspection.unlike the dfg hunting checkpoint held constitutionally reasonable in perez,the circumstances in this case involve a traffic stop of a specific vehicle,maikhio vehicle by a dfg warden.people perez,supra,at.neither perez nor any of the other cases cited by the people persuade us that it may be fairly implied from sections and that it is necessary for the dfg to conduct traffic stops and inspections of specific vehicles on public streets to accomplish the express powers granted to it by to those statutes.
we further conclude,contrary to the people assertion,that fleet stop of maikhio vehicle was not a reasonable regulatory or other seizure under the fourth amendment and therefore required reasonable suspicion maikhio was involved in criminal activity.the fourth amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.maikhio vehicle was subjected to a seizure within the meaning of the fourth amendment when fleet stopped it on a public street and detained its occupants.delaware prouse.a search or seizure is ordinarily unreasonable in the absence of individualized suspicion of wrongdoing.citation.indianapolis edmond u,edmond.however,in certain limited or exceptional circumstances,reasonable suspicion of criminal activity is not required for a seizure to be reasonable under the fourth amendment.ibid.edmond stated w e have upheld certain regimes of suspicionless searches or seizures where the program was designed to serve special needs,beyond the normal need for law enforcement.citations.we have also allowed searches for certain administrative purposes without particularized suspicion of misconduct,provided that those searches are appropriately limited.citations.ibid.the united states supreme court has also upheld brief,suspicionless seizures of motorists at a fixed border patrol checkpoint designed to intercept illegal aliens citation and at a sobriety checkpoint aimed at removing drunk drivers from the road citation,citing michigan of state police sitz.in none of these cases,however,did the united states supreme court indicate approval of a checkpoint program whose primary purpose was to detect evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing.edmond,at.in the circumstances of edmond,the court held because the primary purpose of the indianapolis narcotics checkpoint program is to uncover evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing,the program contravenes the fourth amendment.id.at.edmond stated when law enforcement authorities pursue primarily general crime control purposes at checkpoints such as here,stops can only be justified by some quantum of individualized suspicion.id.at.
however,if the primary purpose of a stop or seizure is to promote a special need of government beyond the normal need for law enforcement and is not to uncover evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing,the special needs exception to the usual requirement for individualized,reasonable suspicion for a stop or seizure may apply if,on balancing the government special need against its intrusion on the individual fourth amendment privacy right,a court determines the stop or seizure was reasonable under the fourth amendment treasury employees von raab,skinner railway labor executives,vernonia school dist.acton,delaware prouse,supra,at,edmond,supra,at munoz cir.one court has also stated in assessing the strength of the government interests,courts must ascertain whether the government could employ less intrusive alternatives.citations.munoz,supra,at.
accordingly,t here is a analysis applicable to fourth amendment checkpoint cases.first,the court must determine whether the primary purpose of the checkpoint was to advance the general interest in crime control.citation.if so,then the stop is per se invalid under the fourth amendment.citations.if the checkpoint is not per se invalid as a crime control device,then the court must judge the checkpoint reasonableness,hence,its constitutionality,on the basis of the individual circumstances.citation.this requires consideration of the gravity of the public concerns served by the seizure,the degree to which the seizure advances the public interest,and the severity of the interference with individual liberty.citations.fraire cir.although fraire analysis specifically addressed vehicle checkpoints,there is no reason why the same analysis should not apply to other traffic stops of vehicles,including the stop of maikhio vehicle in this case.
in the circumstances of this case,we conclude fleet stop of maikhio vehicle was indisputably made for normal law enforcement needs and to uncover evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing,a misdemeanor fishing offense by a specific individual,maikhio.as described in the factual and procedural section above,fleet saw maikhio fishing.he saw maikhio catch something and place it in a black bag,but he could not see what maikhio had caught.fleet watched as maikhio left the pier and drove away from the parking lot in his vehicle.fleet then conducted a traffic stop of maikhio vehicle on a public street because he wanted to make sure that maikhio was in compliance with the california fishing laws and regulations.accordingly,the primary,if not sole,purpose of fleet stop of maikhio vehicle was to determine whether maikhio had violated a fishing law,committed a misdemeanor fishing offense and presumably to cite maikhio if fleet determined he had done so.that purpose was clearly to detect or uncover evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing and therefore promote the general purpose of crime control.because fleet stop of maikhio vehicle did not serve a special need of government,it was per se unreasonable under the fourth amendment absent the existence of reasonable suspicion that maikhio was involved in criminal activity edmond,supra,at,fraire,supra,at.because the primary purpose of fleet stop of maikhio vehicle was to uncover evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing,the stop contravene d the fourth amendment if fleet had no reasonable suspicion that maikhio was involved in criminal activity.edmond,at.like the court in edmond,w e decline to suspend the usual requirement of individualized suspicion where a dfg warden seek s to employ a traffic stop of a specific vehicle primarily for the ordinary enterprise of investigating crimes.id.at.
contrary to the people assertion,the stop of maikhio vehicle was not done primarily for the special need purpose of educating maikhio or another purpose beyond the normal need for law enforcement.although we agree the dfg and its wardens have a governmental interest in protecting california fish and wildlife,we disagree with the people assertion that the dfg enforcement of fish and wildlife laws and regulations,stopping of vehicles to cite criminal offenders serves a special need beyond the normal need for law enforcement.the people suggestion that fleet was only promoting compliance with,and not enforcing,california fishing laws and regulations is disingenuous and a distinction without a difference in the circumstances of this case.likewise,the primary purpose of fleet stop of maikhio vehicle was not to protect fish and wildlife.although criminal citations may have the effect of deterring and educating violators of california fishing laws and regulations,that effect does not make the primary purpose of fleet stop of maikhio vehicle the protection of fish educational,rather than criminal enforcement of those laws and regulations.people perez,supra,th,cited by the people,is factually inapposite and does not persuade us to conclude otherwise.that case involved a vehicle checkpoint primarily regulatory in purpose.id.at.
even were we to conclude the primary purpose of fleet stop of maikhio vehicle was not for normal law enforcement needs or to uncover evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing,it is likely that on applying the special needs balancing test we would conclude the suspicionless stop was unreasonable under the fourth amendment.we note that maikhio had a substantial privacy interest in driving his vehicle on a public street at night.in prouse,the united states supreme court stated we can not agree that stopping or detaining a vehicle on an ordinary city street is less intrusive than a stop on a major highway as held unconstitutional in we can not assume that the physical and psychological intrusion visited upon the occupants of a vehicle by a random stop to check documents is of any less moment than that occasioned by a stop by border agents on roving patrol.both of these stops generally entail law enforcement officers signaling a moving automobile to pull over to the side of the roadway,by means of a possibly unsettling show of authority.both interfere with freedom of movement,are inconvenient,and consume time.both may create substantial anxiety.for fourth amendment purposes,we also see insufficient resemblance between sporadic and random stops of individual vehicles making their way through city traffic and those stops occasioned by roadblocks where all vehicles are brought to a halt or to a near halt,and all are subjected to a show of the police power of the community.delaware prouse,supra,at.
traffic stops of vehicles also may have no preventive purpose or effect.because a motorist could not actively violate fishing laws and regulations while driving lawfully on public roads,vehicle stops can have no preventive purpose,other than a possible deterrent effect.munoz,supra,at.furthermore,although we assume the dfg has a significant interest in the protection of fish and other wildlife,that purported special need could be promoted through less intrusive means.in assessing the strength of the government interests,courts must ascertain whether the government could employ less intrusive alternatives.citations.id.at.in the circumstances in this case,fleet could have stopped maikhio and inquired about his catch while maikhio was on the pier or as he was walking to his car in the parking lot.that less intrusive means of protecting fish and wildlife presumably would have been reasonable under the fourth amendment.likewise,a dfg checkpoint could have been established at the end of the pier or in the parking lot to educate the public regarding fish and wildlife laws and regulations.people perez,supra,th at.
although the people argue fleet method of using a spotting scope to observe fishing activity and then stop vehicles on public streets to check compliance with fishing laws and regulations is the most effective means of promoting the government interest in protecting fish,the fact that a certain method of promoting a government interest is the most effective does not necessarily make it reasonable under fourth amendment,particularly if a less intrusive method exists.were we to balance maikhio privacy interest as an occupant of a vehicle traveling on a public street against the dfg interest in educating the public and protecting fish,it is very likely we would conclude fleet presumed suspicionless traffic stop of maikhio vehicle was unreasonable under the fourth amendment.people levens,a conservation officer may not stop a motorist if the officer merely believes that the motorist is currently or was very recently engaged in lawful hunting.because a traffic stop is a greater intrusion than a brief detention in the field,we require that an officer must reasonably believe that a motorist hunting is illegal before the officer may make a valid stop.state larsen,while the state clearly has a strong interest in regulating and protecting its wildlife,the warrantless search of a fish house by a conservation officer is per se unreasonable in the absence of express consent or other circumstance justifying entry and therefore is unconstitutional under the fourth amendment.
reasonable suspicion under the fourth amendment 
the people alternatively contend the trial court erred by granting maikhio motion to suppress evidence because fleet had reasonable suspicion under the fourth amendment that maikhio was involved in criminal activity and therefore could lawfully stop maikhio vehicle.
in certain circumstances,a police officer may stop and briefly detain a person for questioning or other limited investigation.in re tony cal d.t o justify an investigative stop or detention the circumstances known or apparent to the officer must include specific and articulable facts causing him to suspect that some activity relating to crime has taken place or is occurring or about to occur,and the person he intends to stop or detain is involved in that activity.not only must he subjectively entertain such a suspicion,but it must be objectively reasonable for him to do so the facts must be such as would cause any reasonable police officer in a like position,drawing when appropriate on his training and experience citation,to suspect the same criminal activity and the same involvement by the person in question.the corollary to this rule,of course,is that an investigative stop or detention predicated on mere curiosity,rumor,or hunch is unlawful,even though the officer may be acting in complete good faith.citation.id.at,fn.omitted.
in determining the reasonableness of a stop or detention,we must consider the totality of the circumstances people loewen cal d.a n assessment of the whole picture must yield a particularized suspicion that the particular individual being stopped is engaged in wrongdoing.cortez.the possibility of an innocent explanation does not deprive the officer of the capacity to entertain a reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct.in re tony,supra,cal d at.however,no stop or detention is permissible when the circumstances are not reasonably consistent with criminal activity and the investigation is therefore based on mere curiosity,rumor,or hunch.ibid.the process of determining the existence of reasonable suspicion does not deal with hard certainties,but with probabilities.cortez,at.
on review of a motion to suppress,we defer to the trial court factual findings,where supported by substantial evidence,but must independently assess,as a question of law,whether under the facts as found the challenged search and seizure conforms to the constitutional standards of reasonableness.people franklin d.in opposing a penal code section motion to suppress,the prosecution has the burden to prove that the warrantless search or seizure was reasonable under the circumstances.citations.people williams cal th.
based on our review of the totality of the circumstances in this case,we conclude fleet did not have,at the time of the traffic stop,specific and articulable facts causing him or a reasonable dfg warden to suspect some activity relating to crime had taken place and maikhio was involved in that activity.in re tony,supra,cal d at.at the hearing on maikhio motion to suppress evidence,fleet testified that,using a spotting scope,he saw maikhio fishing by using the method.he saw maikhio catch something,but could not see what he caught and placed in the black bag.fleet testified the method can be used to catch fish,but also is commonly used to catch lobsters.while catching fish with that method is lawful,catching lobsters with that method is not.after maikhio left the pier and drove his vehicle out of the parking lot and onto public streets,fleet stopped maikhio vehicle.fleet testified that although he did n ot necessarily suspect at the time of the stop that maikhio had broken the law,he stopped maikhio vehicle because he wanted to make sure that he maikhio was in compliance with the california fishing laws and regulations.
the people argue specific and articulable facts existed for fleet stop of maikhio vehicle.they rely on the fact that fleet saw maikhio catch something using the method of fishing.however,based on the record in this case,we conclude the people did not carry their burden to prove fleet had a reasonable suspicion maikhio was involved in criminal activity based on his use of the method of fishing.that method could lawfully be used to catch fish.although that method could also be used to catch lobsters,neither fleet nor any other prosecution witness testified at the hearing that the method of fishing was,in his experience training,generally used more often to illegally catch lobsters than to lawfully catch fish.absent any testimony or other evidence showing there was a substantial possibility,much less a likelihood,that an angler,maikhio would use the method to illegally catch lobsters,fleet lacked a reasonable suspicion that maikhio was involved in criminal activity,had illegally caught a lobster.although it is true,as the people assert,reasonable suspicion may exist even if a suspect activity is consistent with innocent or lawful activity,maikhio method of fishing,based on the record in this case,does not support a conclusion that fleet had reasonable suspicion maikhio illegally caught a lobster using that method.
in circumstances involving ambiguous conduct that could be either legal or illegal activity,an officer may not make an investigative stop or detention unless that conduct,in the context of the totality of the circumstances,gives rise to reasonable suspicion that the suspect is involved in criminal activity.although,based on the totality of the circumstances at the time of the stop,it was possible maikhio had used the method to illegally catch a lobster,the record was devoid of any evidence showing there was a substantial possibility he had done so.absent that substantial possibility,fleet in effect acted on a mere hunch or speculation that maikhio had illegally caught a lobster.
an investigative stop or detention based on a mere hunch of criminal activity is unreasonable under the fourth amendment.in re tony,supra,cal d at people loewen,supra,cal d at people hernandez cal th.in hernandez,the california supreme court recently concluded that although some people driving with a displayed temporary vehicle permit may be violating the law,that permit may be forged or issued for a different vehicle,the officer could point to no articulable facts supporting a reasonable suspicion that defendant,in particular,may have been acting illegally.hernandez,at.likewise,although in this case some people fishing with the method may be violating the law,by catching an lobster,fleet could point to no articulable facts supporting a reasonable suspicion that maikhio,in particular,may have been acting illegally.see also people perrusquia th,no reasonable suspicion where officer saw defendant park his idling car in a convenience store parking lot near a street exit,heard something thud on car floorboard,and observed defendant attempt to avoid contact with officers people krohn th,people jones d,no reasonable suspicion where officer saw man receiving money from another in a high crime neighborhood people roth d,no reasonable suspicion where officer saw man walking in early morning hours in deserted parking lot of closed shopping center people.butler d,no reasonable suspicion where officer saw car with tinted windows near a liquor store kerr cir,no reasonable suspicion where officer saw man loading boxes into vehicle in residential area in people levens,supra,at a conservation officer may not stop a motorist if the officer merely believes that the motorist is currently or was very recently engaged in lawful hunting.because a traffic stop is a greater intrusion than a brief detention in the field,we require that an officer must reasonably believe that a motorist hunting is illegal before the officer may make a valid stop.we conclude,based on the totality of the circumstances shown in the record,fleet did not have reasonable suspicion to s
