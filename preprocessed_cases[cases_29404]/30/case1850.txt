appellant friends of lagoon valley filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging the approval by the city of vacaville and the vacaville city council collectively,city of a project to develop a portion of vacaville known as the lower lagoon valley.appellant claimed the lower lagoon valley policy plan implementation project project was inconsistent with the vacaville general plan and the lower lagoon valley policy plan and further claimed approval of the project residential development violated the density bonus provisions of municipal and state law,vacaville,et the trial court denied the petition in a ruling and awarded in costs to real parties in interest triad communities,and lagoon valley mpc,llc collectively,triad.this appeal from the judgment and cost award followed.we conclude the city did not abuse its discretion in approving the project and did not violate the law by awarding triad a density bonus of percent.we also conclude the cost award was within the trial court discretion.accordingly,the judgment is affirmed in its entirety.
background 
in august,the city adopted the vacaville general plan general plan,which described the city policies for land use,circulation,community facilities and environmental resource management.the general plan required that development in certain areas,including the lower lagoon valley,proceed in accordance with specific policy plans.shortly after the general plan was adopted,the city approved the lower lagoon valley policy plan policy plan with the goal of facilitating the development of a business park of regional significance and housing in the lagoon valley area,the general plan listed several guidelines for commercial and residential development.relevant to this appeal,the general plan required development of the business park and highway commercial areas to be of the highest standard of quality,protecting view corridors and the open space feel of the valley,and it limited residential development to units,which were to be integrated with a golf course and a recreation complex.in general,the plan stated that development should enhance the recreational potential of the area.several guidelines stressed the need to protect existing views of the lagoon valley lake and surrounding hills and to preserve the open space feel of the valley.
the policy plan translated these guidelines into a detailed proposal for development of the region.specifically,the policy plan proposed to reserve a total of acres for creation of an park and acres for a medical complex,which would include a kaiser hospital.commercial development was also proposed along interstate,with the possibility of a new hotel construction.the policy plan proposed to build residences in a community surrounding an golf course,with other recreational facilities possibly to be combined with the golf course clubhouse.in addition to the golf course,the policy plan anticipated two major recreational uses of land a regional park,and a trails network in the extensive open space area bordering the lagoon valley.a total of acres would be left as open space in the plan.
despite these plans,no significant development occurred in the lower lagoon valley during the.by,however,triad had acquired options to purchase a substantial portion of the lower lagoon valley and had prepared a preliminary plan for developing the site.in june,the city adopted a specific plan proposed by triad and certified an environmental impact report eir for the project.at the same time,the city approved amendments to the general plan to implement triad proposal.these amendments changed the general plan reference to a business park to business village and updated the number of residential units permitted from to shortly after these actions,a group called greenbelt alliance filed suit challenging the city approvals under the california environmental quality act ceqa.the parties eventually reached a settlement that called for the city to rescind its approvals of triad plan and adopt a new plan with lower overall development density and a reduction in residential units from to.the city rescinded its approvals but,consistent with the settlement agreement,let stand its approval of the final eir for the plan.
in january,triad submitted a revised development plan for the lower lagoon project that is challenged in this appeal.significant aspects of the project include construction of a business village and town center with square feet of office space and up to square feet allocated for retail and commercial uses development of a residential community,with a variety of housing types integrated with a golf course and associated recreational facilities preservation of acres of open space,including parks and recreational uses and creation of public uses such as a new fire station and roadways.the planned residential community would include homes including affordable housing units and attached townhouses reserved for senior citizens.an additional affordable housing units would be located in the town center.
a report of the city planning commission explained that the project reduced the overall development from that approved in the plan and from the guideline set forth in the policy plan.although approximately more residential units would be constructed,substantially less square footage would be devoted to office space and commercial uses,and this reduced space eliminated the possibility of big box retail uses.the city also discussed the project in an addendum to the previously certified eir.no supplemental eir was necessary,the city concluded,because the project smaller development area would actually reduce the potential intensity of uses in the area and thus would not produce any significant new environmental impacts.on february,the city approved the addendum to the eir and the project itself,along with the project vesting tentative map and planned development permit.this permit included approval of a density bonus,for the project.
on april,appellant filed a petition for peremptory writ of mandate and complaint for injunctive relief against the city,naming triad and several lagoon valley property owners as real parties in interest.appellant alleged the city approvals violated the subdivision map act,because the project was inconsistent with several policies expressed in the general plan and the policy plan.in addition,appellant asserted the project residential component violated state and municipal density bonus laws,vacaville,et an administrative record,consisting of nearly pages,was certified less than three weeks later,and the matter proceeded to hearings on august,and october.on november,the trial court issued a detailed ruling rejecting all of appellant claims and denying the petition for writ of mandate and request for injunctive relief.
after judgment was entered on the order,triad filed a memorandum of costs seeking to recover a total of in costs.nearly all of this sum of costs incurred for preparation of the administrative record.these amounts were later amended,with triad claiming a total of in costs,of which was attributed to costs for preparing the administrative record.appellant moved to tax costs,arguing this amount was excessive because large portions of the administrative record were not relevant to the challenges raised in the petition and because portions of this record may actually have been prepared,and associated costs already paid or forgiven,in a prior case.the trial court granted the motion in part,fixing triad cost recovery at.
discussion 
project is consistent with applicable plans 
the legislature has required every county and city to adopt a comprehensive,general plan for the physical development of the county or city.a general plan provides a charter for future development and sets forth a city or county fundamental policy decisions about such development.federation of hillside and canyon assns.city of los angeles th,d.these policies typically reflect a range of competing interests.ibid.nevertheless,a city land use decisions must be consistent with the policies expressed in the general plan.unified school dist.city of corona th,d.t he propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development depends upon consistency with the applicable general plan and its elements.citation.citizens of goleta valley board of supervisors cal d.
while recognizing that some aspects of the project deviated from particular planning provisions,the city determined that the project was consistent overall with the general plan and the more precise development guidelines of the policy plan.specifically,a february,report of the city planning commission concluded t he particular mix of proposed land uses,as well as specific design characteristics of the project,appears to be consistent with the lower lagoon valley policy plan.the policy plan has provisions for discretion and conditional uses which would allow for a portion of the proposed golf course to be located on lands designated in the policy plan as office business park.in addition,the flexibility provided for under the state density bonus statutes would also permit a mixed use project where residential units can be located within the area designated for office business park in the policy plan.the commission noted that minor inconsistencies were best addressed at the planned development stage,during which adjustments could be made to ensure that the overall goals,objectives and policies of the policy plan would be achieved.accordingly,the city passed a resolution finding the project proposed vesting tentative map and planned development were in accordance with the goals,objectives,and policies of the policy plan,the general plan and the development code.in ruling on the mandate petition,the trial court concluded these findings were supported by substantial evidence.
a governing body conclusion that a particular project is consistent with the relevant general plan carries a strong presumption of regularity that can be overcome only by a showing of abuse of discretion.napa citizens for honest government napa county bd.of supervisors th,d napa citizens sequoyah hills homeowners city of oakland th,d sequoyah hills.an abuse of discretion is established only if the city council has not proceeded in a manner required by law,its decision is not supported by findings,or the findings are not supported by substantial evidence.code civ,subd.b.we may neither substitute our view for that of the city council,nor reweigh conflicting evidence presented to that body.citation.sequoyah hills,supra,th at,d.this review is highly deferential to the local agency,recognizing that the body which adopted the general plan policies in its legislative capacity has unique competence to interpret those policies when applying them in its adjudicatory capacity.citations.because policies in a general plan reflect a range of competing interests,the governmental agency must be allowed to weigh and balance the plan policies when applying them,and it has broad discretion to construe its policies in light of the plan purposes.citations.a reviewing court role is simply to decide whether the city officials considered the applicable policies and the extent to which the proposed project conforms with those policies.citation.citation.san franciscans upholding the downtown plan city and county of san francisco th,d sfudp.because an appellate court task in review of a mandate proceeding is essentially the same as that of the trial court,we review the agency actions directly and are not bound by the trial court conclusions.id.at,d napa citizens,supra,th at,d save our peninsula committee monterey county bd.of supervisors th,d save our peninsula.
appellant argues the project is inconsistent with both the general plan and the policy plan,and the city contrary findings are not supported by substantial evidence.appellant complaints center on three particular areas increased traffic and differences in traffic circulation reduced size and scale of development for the office business park and increased residential development.in addition,appellant objects that the overall layout of proposed uses is different from what was envisioned in the general plan map.
an action,program,or project is consistent with the general plan if,considering all its aspects,it will further the objectives and policies of the general plan and not obstruct their attainment.citation,supra,th at,d.state law does not require perfect conformity between a proposed project and the applicable general plan r ather,to be consistent,the subdivision map must be compatible with the objectives,policies,general land uses,and programs specified in the applicable plan.as interpreted,this provision means that a subdivision map must be in agreement or harmony with the applicable plan.citations.sequoyah hills,supra,th at,d.
general plans ordinarily do not state specific mandates or prohibitions.rather,they state policies,and set forth goals.napa citizens,supra,th at,d.the plans at issue in this case are no exception.the general plan sets forth two types of policies guiding policies,which are the city statements of its goals and philosophy,and implementing policies,which describe actions consistent with these goals in as much specificity as is appropriate given the city current level of knowledge and agreement on each policy issue.introductory statements in the general plan stress the flexibility of the policies described and the ability of planning officials to balance competing policies when necessary.thus,the general plan states that classifications for development serve as a guide for zoning,and zoning regulations,while they must be consistent with the plan,need not be identical to it.the policy plan adopted to implement the general plan policies for the lagoon valley area continues this theme of flexibility.after noting that the guiding policies and the implementing policies of the general plan generally do not identify responsibilities or set a time frame for development,the policy plan explains that b oth sets of policies allow for flexibility and require interpretation by staff and the city decision makers.
increased traffic 
appellant primary claim of inconsistency concerns the increased levels of traffic expected to result from the project.a transportation impact analysis prepared for the city in february concluded that traffic generated by the project development would not in itself cause significant impacts on intersections,freeway segments or freeway ramps or merge points however,by the year,the project was expected to contribute to significant cumulative traffic impacts at several locations the analysis proposed a mitigation plan for some of these locations,but,because freeway segments and freeway ramps are within the jurisdiction of the california department of transportation caltrans,the city could not implement mitigation measures for these areas on its own.thus,the february eir addendum,which was approved by the city and has not been challenged,identified certain significant and unavoidable transportation impacts from the project occurring by the year.over the next years,the project would contribute to degradation reaching an unacceptable level of service on a segment of interstate and two freeway,and to traffic at certain intersections.to mitigate these impacts,triad agreed to make a fair share contribution,equal to the city traffic impact fee,to pay for improvements to the freeway ramps,widening of the freeway and road improvements needed to accommodate cumulative traffic at certain city intersections.
a land use policy in the general plan not specific to the lagoon valley area states that the city will not permit development of such intensity or density that,if built without commensurate transportation or other infrastructure improvements,the resulting water and sewer service requirements and traffic generated will create substantial problems or unacceptable levels of service,unless an acceptable mitigation program to provide these services is implemented.elsewhere,the general plan states that developers should be required to pay their fair share for improvements to public facilities,including streets,bridges and traffic signals,made necessary by the new development.financial contribution to an improvements program has been recognized as a reasonable plan for mitigation of adverse impacts under ceqa.see city of marina board of trustees of california state university cal th,d,contribution to mitigation program was a satisfactory mitigation measure under ceqa save our peninsula,supra,th at,d payments to county traffic impact fee program were sufficient mitigation under ceqa for project that contributed to cumulative traffic impacts on highway and other roadways.
consistent with these authorities,we conclude the city did not abuse its discretion in concluding the project payment of traffic impact fees was a reasonable mitigation program.appellant complains there is no guarantee the mitigation measures will ever be implemented,alluding to the current funding situation of the state in general,and caltrans in particular.while it is true that a mere commitment to pay fees is inadequate if the fees bear no relation to actual mitigation save our peninsula,supra,th at,d,that is not the case here.the project will contribute money to specific mitigation measures,which are described in the eir addendum.moreover,as noted in the transportation impact analysis prepared for the project,the city and caltrans will be cooperating to prepare a project study report for the freeway ramp improvements described in the eir.all that is required by ceqa,or by the wording of the city general plan,is that there be a reasonable plan for mitigation.citations.save our peninsula,supra,th at,d.nothing required the city to set forth a schedule for the completion of specific roadway improvements.see also city of marina board of trustees of the california state university,supra,cal th at,d,uncertainties affecting implementation of improvements did not render a mitigation plan inadequate under ceqa.
the holding in endangered habitats league,county of orange th,d endangered habitats does not require us to reach a different result.unlike the flexible general plan provisions at issue in this case,the general plan in endangered habitats required the maintenance of specific levels of service at certain intersections as computed using a specific methodology.id.at,d.although an eir determined cumulative traffic impacts were not significant under a different methodology,the court remarked this fact was of no import given the unambiguous requirements of the general plan.id.at,d.the court also concluded the developer contribution to a fee program was not a sufficient mitigation plan because there was no evidence of what improvements would actually be funded by the fees.id.at,d see also napa citizens,supra,th at,d circulation plan that identified no specific means of relieving traffic congestion beyond seeking increased state funding for highway projects did not represent an affirmative commitment to mitigate adverse traffic impacts.here,in contrast,specific improvements are planned and described in the eir addendum,and triad must contribute the project fair share for the improvements by paying the city traffic impact fee.finally,a declared purpose of the general plan in endangered habitats was to restrict development unless adequate traffic circulation could be provided.endangered habitats,supra,th at,d.preventing traffic congestion on interstate and freeway exchanges was not a central policy stated in the general plan or policy plan.
appellant also argues the project violates certain guiding policies in the transportation element of the general plan.although appellant seeks to characterize these guiding policies as rigid mandates on the minimum levels of service that must be maintained at all intersections and exchanges,the policies actually afford the city a high degree of flexibility in balancing traffic circulation and land use considerations.the general plan states that development should s trive to maintain los c as the minimum standard at all intersections,interchanges and road links.a related guiding policy indicates los d is permissible as an interim level of service while improvements are being undertaken to bring service up to los c or better,or alternately the city has discretion to approve los d as an allowable standard for the year for infill areas or isolated situations where existing development or other practical considerations limit improvements.the general plan also gives the city authority to approve service at los e or f if the city council makes certain findings at a public hearing.one situation in which the general plan authorizes approval of los e or f as a permanent condition occurs when the affected intersection or exchange is in an infill or isolated area t here is no practical and feasible way to mitigate the lower level of service and t he project resulting in the lower level of service is of clear,overall public benefit.
the record indicates lagoon valley is a rural and geographically isolated area,and practical considerations unquestionably limit the city ability to improve traffic circulation in the problem areas.the only roadways,intersections or exchanges expected to degrade below los c by the year are those connected with interstate,where the city does not have jurisdiction to implement mitigation measures unilaterally.under these circumstances,the most the city could do was require the developer to contribute funding for future mitigation projects the city would pursue in cooperation with caltrans.appellant claims the city had no discretion to approve a project that resulted in unacceptable levels of service,but,as we have noted,the transportation policies in the general plan give the city flexibility to allow reduced service levels if the project is beneficial and there is no feasible way to improve the los with mitigation.moreover,appellant interpretation would effectively prevent the city from approving any development in the lower lagoon valley because,according to the transportation impact analysis,unacceptable levels of service are expected in at nearly all of the same freeway segments,ramps and intersections identified in the eir addendum even without implementation of the project.in other words,given that the future baseline for these roadways was projected to be at los d or lower,appellant rigid reading of the general plan would essentially rule out development in the result that is certainly at odds with the policies expressed in the general and policy plans.
reduced office business park development 
appellant complaint about the reduced size of the office business park in the project,as compared with the development envisioned in the policy plan,does not establish an inconsistency.the policy plan proposed to construct an office business park and a large hospital complex totaling over million square feet,whereas the project business village will cover only square feet.this difference in square footage,while significant,does not in itself violate the city plans.indeed,the general plan recognized that the balancing of policies could affect the city ability to implement certain development projects fully,and it explicitly provided the city has no obligation to approve projects at the maximum permitted density.the general plan expressly recognized that policies such as preserving natural habitats or maintaining desirable traffic levels of service,for example,could limit development on particular sites in ways not apparent from the plan diagram.moreover,although the square footage of the office business park deviates from the particular proposal described in the policy plan,it is not inconsistent with any guideline stated in the general plan.the relevant implementing policy requires that a plan for the lower lagoon valley facilitate development of a business park of regional significance and housing.the general plan does not specify any required square footage,but requires only that the business park construction be of the highest standard of quality,preserving view corridors and the open space feel of the valley.it was within the city discretion to conclude that the development proposed in the project is a regionally significant business park based on the unique style and high quality of its design.the project office business park employs high quality design and will continue the architectural village theme of the valley residential developments.office and commercial areas will be extensively landscaped and connected by a network of plazas and walkways,making the area and arguably more compatible with the valley open space feel than a development might have been.
increased residential development 
a corollary to appellant complaint about the decreased size of the office business park is its complaint about the increased number of residential units approved for the project as compared with the general and policy plans.appellant argues land uses originally envisioned as business or commercial in nature have effectively been shifted to residential uses in violation of the relevant planning documents.this argument construes the policies expressed in the plans too rigidly and ignores the flexibility city officials have in implementing them.the city had broad discretion to balance the many competing policies expressed in the general as the development of upscale housing and office and commercial construction,and the preservation of open space,views and recreational determining whether to approve the project.the question is not whether the square footage of the proposed development matches the square footage envisioned for various uses in planning documents,but whether the project is compatible with,and does not frustrate,the general plan goals and policies.napa citizens,supra,th at,d.a general plan must try to accommodate a wide range of competing those of developers,neighboring homeowners,prospective homebuyers,environmentalists,current and prospective business owners,jobseekers,taxpayers,and providers and recipients of all types of to present a clear and comprehensive set of principles to guide development decisions.once a general plan is in place,it is the province of elected city officials to examine the specifics of a proposed project to determine whether it would be in harmony with the policies stated in the plan.citation.it is,emphatically,not the role of the courts to micromanage these development decisions.sequoyah hills,supra,th at,d.
substantial evidence supports the city conclusion that the residential development proposed in the project is compatible with general plan goals and policies.balance does not require equivalence,but rather a weighing of pros and cons to achieve an acceptable mix.defend the bay city of irvine th,d.the general plan requires only that development of the lower lagoon valley will include a regionally significant business park and housing,and it lists several requirements for achieving these goals.consistent with the general plan,the residential villages in the project will consist almost entirely of upscale homes,which will be integrated with a championship style golf course and recreational complex.the project also brings a substantial number of and senior housing units to the lagoon valley,many of which will be integrated with the business village state law encourages cities to provide such affordable housing through incentives to developers,and the policy plan gives planning officials leeway to permit mixed uses like the townhouses located in the business village so long as they are consistent with the policy plan and do not impair other permitted uses.
finally,appellant complaint that the layout of land uses in the project differs from the general plan land use and circulation map is anticipated and answered by the general plan itself.although a diagram had been prepared illustrating the policies of the plan,the general plan cautioned that this map was presented only as a general illustration of the policies of the general plan and was not intended to reflect every policy direction.the general plan anticipated that review of applicable policies would be necessary to determine the precise land use potential of any site.division two of this court rejected a similar claim of inconsistency because oakland general plan confer red upon city officials some discretion to diverge from the details of the map,so long as the variation serve d the plan policies and objectives as well or better.sequoyah hills,supra,th at,d.because the general plan map was likewise intended to be a guideline,not a mandate,we conclude the city did not abuse its discretion in approving a somewhat different layout of uses than was originally envisioned for the lagoon valley.
ii.the density bonus complies with state housing law 
appellant next claims the city violated state housing law and corresponding municipal ordinances by granting triad a density bonus of over percent.we conclude the city had discretion to award a density bonus higher than the maximum amount set forth in the applicable statute,government code section section in text or density bonus law.we also reject appellant challenge to the city calculation of the density bonus.
interpretation of the density bonus law 
in,the legislature added several provisions to the state planning and zoning law,et to address the shortage of affordable housing in california,subd.a see also building industry city of oceanside th,d concluding these statutes show an important state policy to promote the construction of low income housing and to remove impediments to the same hansen department of social services d.discussing legislative efforts to remedy statewide shortage of housing for low and moderate income families.one of these statutes,section,offers incentives to developers to include low income housing in new construction projects.although application of the statute can be complicated,its aim is fairly simple when a developer agrees to construct a certain percentage of the units in a housing development for low or very low income households,or to construct a senior citizen housing development,the city or county must grant the developer one or more itemized concessions and a density bonus,which allows the developer to increase the density of the development by a certain percentage above the maximum allowable limit under local zoning law,subds.a,b.in other words,the density bonus law reward s a developer who agrees to build a certain percentage of housing with the opportunity to build more residences than would otherwise be permitted by the applicable local regulations.shea homes limited partnership county of alameda th,d.
the version of section in effect during the relevant time period mandated that local governments provide a density bonus when a developer agreed to construct percent of total units for lower income households,percent of total units for very low income households,a senior citizen housing development as defined in civil code sections and,or percent of units in a planned development,subd.k for moderate income households,subd.b version.for developers who provided low income units,very low income units or senior citizen housing,the density bonus was required to be an increase of at least percent over the otherwise maximum residential density allowed under a local zoning ordinance or general plan,subd.g version.the density bonus could be lower only if the developer agreed to accept a lesser percentage.ibid.the statute further directed that,for every percentage point increase in low income housing units the developer provided above the minimum amounts stated in subdivision b,the city or county had to increase the amount of the density bonus by percent up to a maximum of percent.ibid.a similar sliding scale applied to developers who constructed moderate income housing,except that the minimum density bonus for such housing was set at percent,not percent,subd.g version.
appellant contends this language describing percent as a maximum value precluded the city from granting triad a density bonus of just over percent.however,this argument is undermined by subdivision n of section,which stated and continues to state nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a city,county,or city and county from granting a density bonus greater than what is described in this section for a development that meets the requirements of this section or from granting a proportionately lower density bonus than what is required by this section for developments that do not meet the requirements of this section.italics added.
the primary goal in construing a statute is to ascertain legislative intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the law,fair employment housing com.cal d.to do so,we first examine the language of the statute,giving the words their ordinary,commonsense meaning and according significance to all words used,if possible.id.at,lewis county of sacramento th,d.the statute words generally provide the most reliable indicator of legislative intent if they are clear and unambiguous,t here is no need for judicial construction and a court may not indulge in it.diamond multimedia systems,superior court cal th,d.lewis county of sacramento,supra,th at,d see also people pecci th,d.
although the calculations described are complicated,in our view the language of section is clear and unambiguous.if a developer agrees to dedicate a certain percentage of the overall units in a development to affordable or senior housing,the density bonus law requires the municipality to grant the developer a density bonus of at least a certain percentage,ranging from a low of percent for moderate income housing or percent for senior and all other affordable housing to a maximum of percent,depending on the number of affordable housing units provided over the minimum number necessary to qualify for a bonus,subd.g.because the statute imposes a mandatory duty on local governments,and provides a means for developers to enforce this duty through civil proceedings,subd.d,it is clear that percent represents the maximum amount of bonus a city is required to provide,not the maximum amount a developer can ever obtain.the entire aim of section is to provide incentives to developers to construct housing for seniors and low income families.see stats,ch,legislative findings and declarations supporting enactment of section.it would undermine this policy to interpret subdivision g as imposing an absolute cap,since such a rule would prevent developers from negotiating to obtain a higher density bonus in exchange for including even more low income or senior housing than is provided for in section.indeed,this may describe what happened in the present case,since the project includes both senior housing and moderate income housing.
the plain language of subdivision n also supports our interpretation because it clearly states that section may not be construed to prohibit a local government from granting a larger density bonus than is provided for in the density bonus law.nevertheless,appellant argues subdivision n applies only when a municipality enacts an ordinance to provide a higher density bonus.thus,appellant insists,the density bonus awarded here violated section because the city did not grant it by way of an ordinance.nothing in the density bonus law suggests that a municipality must enact an ordinance any time it wishes to provide more of a density bonus than is required by state law.if the legislature had intended to require an ordinance in such situations,it could easily have said so,and it is not the court place to insert words into the statute.an appellate court should be loathe to construe a statute which has the effect of adding or subtracting language.citation.people pecci,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted see also jurcoane superior court th,d.moreover,setting up an additional hurdle for municipalities to clear,passing an ordinance under these circumstances would be contrary to the spirit of the density bonus law,which is designed to encourage,even require,incentives to developers that construct affordable housing.
to support its contrary arguments,appellant offers isolated statements from the legislative history of the amendments to section and subsequent amendments to the statute.resort to extrinsic sources of legislative intent is appropriate only when statutory language is ambiguous or is shown to have a latent ambiguity.lewis county of sacramento,supra,th at,d.while we believe the language of section is clear,we have examined the legislative history of the amendments in an abundance of caution,keeping in mind that the language of a statute bears far more significance than statements by committee members or interested parties.i t is the language of the statute itself that has successfully braved the legislative gauntlet.it is that language which has been lobbied for,lobbied against,studied,proposed,drafted,restudied,redrafted,voted on in committee,amended,reamended,analyzed,reanalyzed,voted on by two houses of the legislature,sent to a conference committee,and,after perhaps more lobbying,debate and analysis,finally signed into law by the governor.the same care and scrutiny does not befall the committee reports,caucus analyses,authors statements,legislative counsel digests and other documents which make up a statute legislative history.citation.jurcoane superior court,supra,th at,d.
on february,senate bill was introduced to amend section.to be entitled to a density bonus under the prior version of the law,a developer had to construct at least percent of its housing units for low or moderate income households,or percent for very low income households,or percent for senior citizen housing,subd.b version.senate bill cut these percentages in half,thereby making it easier to qualify for a density bonus.bill reg.sess.as introduced,amending,subd.b.as the law was written in,local governments were obligated to grant a qualifying developer a density bonus of at least percent,unless the developer agreed to accept a smaller percentage,subd.g version.an amendment introduced april,proposed to change this definition of the required density bonus from a flat minimum value to a sliding scale,in which the density bonus a city had to grant would rise in accordance with the number of affordable housing units a developer contributed beyond the minimum number needed to qualify.amend.to bill reg.sess,amending,subd.g.under this sliding scale,the minimum value of a density bonus was changed from percent to percent,but for each percentage point of affordable housing a developer contributed over the new lower minimums the amended statute established,the required density bonus was increased by percent,up to a maximum of percent.id.at the sponsors of the bill explained that the amendments to section were intended to increase the flexibility and usefulness of density bonus law by both reducing the minimum percentage of targeted units needed to obtain a density bonus and by increasing the amount of density bonus that can be obtained when the percentage of targeted units is increased.housing community development,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.the assembly later amended the bill to raise the floor of the sliding scale for density bonuses from percent to percent.assem.amend.to bill reg.sess.june,amending,subd.g.
legislative history reflects that the only organizations opposed to senate bill were the california chapter of the american planning association ccapa,the league of california cities league and the california state association of counties csac.in a july memorandum,they repeated their opposition to the density bonus range set forth in the bill and explained they could not agree to go higher than,unless approved by the city or county up to,due to carrying capacity,lot size and other issues that will not support another units beyond what was originally zoned for a site.in other words,municipalities did not want to be required to provide a density bonus over percent without regard to local conditions,because conditions in some areas would not be equipped to support a greater increase in development.the organizations representing california cities and counties were willing to accept density bonus requirements up to percent,but only if the increased bonus was approved by the local government granting it.legislators never incorporated the proposals of ccapa,league and csac into senate bill.
on july,the language that became section,subdivision n was added to the bill.assem.amend.to bill reg.sess.july.immediately after this amendment was made,the california association of realtors,a cosponsor of the bill,explained the new provision clarified that localities can award a greater density bonus than under state law and award a lower density bonus for developments that do not qualify for a state density bonus.no mention was made of a need for local governments to enact an ordinance to award such bonuses nor was there any mention of an ordinance in an analysis of the amended bill prepared by the department of finance,which stated only that the bill would a llow local governments to provide density bonuses greater than the maximum standards specified in the statute.of finance,analysis of bill reg.sess.
in early august,ccapa,league and csac urged the legislature to vote no on senate bill,in part because the bill imposed a maximum required density bonus of percent.they proposed an amendment reducing the maximum requirement to percent.legislators finally struck a compromise on august,when they amended the bill to reduce the top end of the density bonus scale from percent to percent.assem.amend.to bill reg.sess,amending,subd.g.
it is clear from our overview of the entire legislative history of senate bill that the percent maximum density bonus level described in the bill final version,and set forth in the version of section,reflects the maximum density increase that would be statutorily imposed upon municipalities.cities and counties were opposed to the higher percentage,and fought to reduce it,because the maximum density bonus value stated in subdivision g of section reflects the maximum that a city or county will be required to give to developers.the legislative history simply does not support appellant contrary interpretation.percent was intended as a cap on what a municipality was required to give there is no indication it was ever meant to cap what a municipality had authority to give.accordingly,the city award of a density bonus for the project of just over percent was consistent with the letter and the spirit of section.
nor do we find anything in the legislative history of senate bill to support appellant contention that the city could only award a density bonus over percent by enacting a municipal ordinance.beyond senate bill,appellant also tries to support this argument with language subsequently added to section.after setting forth the density bonus required for different percentages of affordable housing,the current version of the density bonus law states that the term total units as used in determining percentages of housing needed to qualify for a density bonus does not include units permitted by a density bonus awarded pursuant to this section or any local law granting a greater density bonus,subd.g,italics added.legislative in clarifying amendments such as those enacted for section in not determinative,since the legislature has no authority to interpret a statute.people cruz cal th,d,harris capital growth investors xiv cal d,fn.moreover,the legislature mention in this context of density bonuses awarded pursuant to local law does not rule out the possibility that such bonuses can be awarded by other local action,and it certainly does not impose such a requirement on municipalities.any speculation about legislative intent this phrase invites does not persuade us to depart from the unambiguous language of subdivision n of section,which states that nothing in the statute shall be construed as preventing cities or counties from granting a greater density bonus than is required under section.see howard jarvis taxpayers county of orange th,d when statutory language is clear and unambiguous,we need not construe its meaning.
appellant also contends the density bonus here violated certain vacaville municipal ordinances regarding density bonuses.at the time the project was approved,these ordinances set forth essentially the same requirements as the state density bonus law prior to its amendment by senate bill,vacaville,providing for a density bonus of percent for a development with at least percent low income units,percent very low income units or percent of units reserved for senior citizens.however,once the legislature amended section,state law preempted inconsistent provisions in these municipal ordinances.if otherwise valid local legislation conflicts with state law,it is preempted by such law and is void.citations.city of los angeles cal th,d,see also cal,art.no.xi a county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local,police,sanitary,and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws lesher communications,city of walnut creek cal d.
calculation of density bonus for the project 
appellant also challenges the calculations the city offered in support of its award of a density bonus for the project.the city approval of a percent density bonus was based on the project construction of a townhouse community for senior citizens and units of housing for moderate income households,and its provision of several other amenities,such as the creation of a neighborhood park,the building of a new fire station and the addition of over acres to the lagoon valley park.
the version of section required a density bonus to be granted when a developer agreed to construct a senior citizen housing development as defined in sections and of the civil code,subd.b version.unlike other provisions that condition a density bonus on the construction of a certain percentage of affordable housing units,this subdivision requires the construction only of a senior citizen housing development.ibid.although prior law did require a certain percentage of senior housing to obtain a density bonus,senate bill was amended to change this provision after questions arose about the legality of imposing age restrictions on only a portion of a housing development.assem.amend.to bill reg.sess.june,amending,subd.b see assem.com.on housing and community development,analysis of bill reg.sess,as amended may,raising age discrimination concern and suggesting amendment to provide a density bonus for any senior citizen project qualifying under civil code.in light of this change,appellant argues a density bonus is required only when an entire development project is devoted to senior citizen housing.or,stated another way,in appellant view a density bonus granted pursuant to subdivision b of section can be used only to increase the density of the senior development itself,and can not justify density increases in other,housing.
the first problem with this argument is procedural appellant never raised it in the administrative proceedings below.the main objection appellant raised to the city planning commission was that the density bonus exceeded percent,which appellant argued was the maximum bonus permissible under section.the planning and zoning law limits issues that may be raised in a proceeding to attack a public agency finding or determination to those that were previously raised in a public hearing or in written correspondence delivered to the agency,unless the issue could not have been raised through the exercise of reasonable diligence or the agency prevented the issue from being raised,subd.b.the purpose of the rule of exhaustion of administrative remedies is to provide an administrative agency with the opportunity to decide matters in its area of expertise prior to judicial review.citation.napa citizens,supra,th at,d.exhaustion of administrative remedies is said to be a jurisdictional prerequisite to judicial action challenging a planning decision.sfudp,supra,th at,d,supra,th at,d see also endangered habitats,supra,th at,d declining to consider argument that had not been raised at the administrative level.appellant protests that it was not as knowledgeable as city officials about the workings of section or the details of the project,but it cites no evidence showing the issue about senior housing could not have been raised before the city approved the project.on the contrary,when the city explained the basis for its density bonus calculations in a public hearing,appellant had an opportunity to object to these calculations but failed to do so.as such,the issue is procedurally barred,subd.b.
moreover,even assuming it is not barred,appellant claim is substantively flawed.the argument is confusing and contrary to the p
