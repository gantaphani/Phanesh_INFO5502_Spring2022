after three environmental impact statements spanning two decades,the department of energy doe approved operation in of the waste isolation pilot plant wipp,a nuclear waste repository located in southeastern new mexico.citizens for alternatives to radioactive dumping citizens sought to enjoin the facility operation under the national environmental policy act nepa.citizens argued doe relied on faulty data regarding the subsurface geomorphology of the site in its environmental review,thereby the environmental hazards of waste storage at the site.the district court denied the requested injunction,finding doe actions were not arbitrary and capricious.

background 
the facility and location.congress approved wipp near carlsbad,new mexico in to provide a research and development facility to demonstrate the safe disposal of radioactive waste resulting from defense activities and programs,stat.one year later,in,doe completed its first environmental impact statement for the project as required by nepa.in,after the completion of most of the wipp construction,doe prepared a second supplemental environmental impact statement before facility testing would begin.
finally,before the facility would begin accepting waste,doe conducted a third impact statement,the disposal phase final supplemental environmental impact statement it published the record of decision in january of,concluding disposal of radioactive wastes at wipp was the preferred alternative to other options and authorizing disposal at the site.in conjunction with the,congress ordered the environmental protection agency to conduct a parallel environmental assessment.the agency review concluded with a finding in that wipp would comply with the radioactive waste disposal regulations promulgated by the agency.may.
the waste repository for the wipp is located feet underground,in the salado formation,a massive salt bed with low permeability that impedes groundwater flow in and out of the wipp repository.about feet above the wipp is a fractured layer of dolomite rock called the culebra dolomite.the culebra is the first layer above the salado formation with a continuous body of groundwater.above the culebra sits feet of claystone,mudstone,and siltstone sandwiched between layers of anhydrite called the tamarisk member.above the tamarisk member,another layer of dolomite,the magenta dolomite,runs from to feet below the surface.these formations are arrayed as follows 
the possibility of radioactive material from the wipp escaping into the local environment via groundwater was a risk factor considered by the doe in.in modeling the risk,the doe chose to investigate the culebra dolomite in detail,but not the magenta,because prior studies included in the record led doe to conclude the culebra was the most transmissive unit at the wipp site.aple.supp.app at.the agency arrived at this conclusion based on a record that established,i n most locations,the hydraulic conductivity of the magenta is one to two orders of magnitude less than that of the culebra.id.at.moreover,the stored at wipp would need to make their way through both the culebra and the tamarisk,which functions as a confining layer due to its low permeability,before reaching the magenta.id.at.failure to model the magenta is the basis for citizens appeal.
citizens lawsuit.citizens first brought common law public nuisance claims in new mexico state court in,seeking to enjoin the wipp facility.doe removed the case to federal court,which denied the request for an injunction.citizens subsequently amended their complaint to assert an additional claim that the inadequately complied with nepa.citizens had previously participated in the public comment phase of.as part of their nepa claim,citizens sought to inject evidence outside the administrative record based on research conducted by an expert consultant.
the evidence allegedly came to light after the record for was completed.citizens consultant,richard hayes phillips has actively studied the geomorphology around the wipp site for twenty years.in an affidavit prepared for this litigation,he claims during that time to have witnessed a pattern of lies and deceptions designed to disguise the true hydrology of the site.at.phillips supports these allegations for purposes of this appeal with two charges he points to a study of the magenta included in the that relies upon a miscalculated data point at a test well drilled near wipp,thereby understating the groundwater transmissivity of the formation and penciled editing marks made to include the miscalculation in the study,from which phillips arrives at the conclusion of data falsification.id.
the district court upheld doe record of decision.the court concluded the decision was not arbitrary and capricious,and there was no reason to consider the proffered materials in its review.in particular,the court carefully reviewed a number of charges by citizens that was inadequate in the way it analyzed the facility hydrology,geology,and possible release scenarios.the court,while acknowledging the scientific debate surrounding many of the issues,ultimately found support in the administrative record for the decisions made by doe.
on appeal,citizens has narrowed the issues to the following the district court should have admitted evidence regarding allegations of tampering with and miscalculation of data involving groundwater studies in the magenta formation and doe was arbitrary and capricious in its evaluation of the record by not further investigating the properties of the magenta based on the allegations raised by phillips

judicial review of agency action is normally restricted to the administrative record.lee air force,cir.it is only in extremely limited circumstances,such as where the agency ignored relevant factors it should have considered or considered factors left out of the formal record that we will consider evidence.id.internal quotations omitted.

to support its claim the administrative record should be supplemented,citizens contends water flow data for the magenta was concealed and misrepresented.relying on the allegations contained in phillips affidavit,citizens claims the studies based on this misrepresentation led the government to wrongly assume the culebra was the most transmissive geological layer in the storage facility proximity.as a result,doe decided it need not model the transmissive properties of the magenta layer.citizens argues that phillips charges satisfy its obligation to make a strong showing that doe engaged in bad faith and improper conduct,and therefore additional evidence should be produced in the administrative record.aplt.brief at.
we disagree.upon examining phillips affidavit,we find nothing to justify the inclusion of evidence to demonstrate gaps or inadequacies in the.
phillips makes two claims of misrepresentation.
first,he asserts he discovered a document as part of his research that evidences tampering with a hydrology report relied on by doe.he supports this allegation by pointing to handwritten editing marks he calls them alterations on a draft of a report which was eventually included in the.according to phillips,the handwritten notations demonstrate the author of the final report altered transmissivity data for the magenta dolomite downward from a high of feet per day to a high of foot per day.the significance of this data,which he claims doe relied on in dispensing with further mode
