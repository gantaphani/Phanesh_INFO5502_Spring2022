gail greenidge and geary greenidge the greenidges appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york james francis,iv,granting allstate insurance company allstate motion for summary judgment in a suit alleging that the insurer breached its duty of good faith when it rejected a settlement offer that required it to consent to a declaratory judgment action brought by an injured claimant that would establish the limits of its liability under the greenidges insurance policy.the court denied the greenidges for summary judgment and dismissed their complaint.for the reasons stated in this opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the greenidges own a home at billingsley terrace in the bronx.in,ray teachey brought an action on behalf of his infant daughter,taniya seay,against the greenidges in new york state supreme court,bronx county.see seay delano village,index the seay action.the complaint alleged that the infant suffered severe lead poisoning from exposure to lead paint while she resided at the greenidges property between october and april.the seay plaintiffs also brought claims against the owners and managing agents the of the apartment where teachey lived,as the infant had visited his apartment throughout this period.
the greenidges were insured pursuant to a homeowners policy the policy issued by allstate that had been in effect continuously since.the relevant portion of the policy stated that s ubject to the terms,limitations and conditions of this policy,allstate will pay damages which an insured person becomes legally obligated to pay because of bodily injury arising from an accident and covered by this part of the policy.the policy provided up to in indemnification for claims of bodily injury and specified that allstate was not obligated to pay any claim or judgment after it had exhausted its limit of liability.
because the policy effective date was february of each year,the parties agree that seay exposure to lead paint at the greenidges property spanned two policy periods.the policy,however,contained an provision stating 
regardless of the number of insured persons,injured persons,claims,claimants or policies involved,our total liability under the family liability protection coverage for damages resulting from one accidental loss will not exceed the limits shown on the declarations page.all bodily injury and property damage resulting from one accidental loss or from continuous or repeated exposure to the same general conditions is considered the result of one accidental loss.
the parties in the seay action disagreed about the effect of this provision on the policy limit of liability.allstate argued that the provision limited its liability to because seay injuries resulted from continuous or repeated exposure to the same general conditions and therefore constituted one accidental loss.the seay plaintiffs argued that seay injuries occurred over two policy periods and thus implicated two policy limits,increasing allstate liability to.
allstate appointed the law firm of minetti and benedict to represent the greenidges in the seay action.the insurer also informed the greenidges by letter that the plaintiffs in the seay action were claiming damages beyond the limits of their policy,that the greenidges would be personally liable for any judgment in excess of those limits,and that the greenidges were entitled to retain separate counsel at their own expense in addition to counsel appointed by allstate.
in,theresa sturges,a senior claim representative for allstate,assumed responsibility for handling the claim against the greenidges.in february of that year,counsel appointed by allstate to defend the greenidges advised sturges that the case would soon be assigned for trial and that the seay plaintiffs had offered to settle the case for,of which was to be paid by allstate on the greenidges behalf and was to come from the.no further progress toward settlement was made at that time.
on august,sturges learned that a trial date had been set.on october,counsel for the parties met in new york state supreme court and the presiding justice sought a settlement offer from allstate.allstate offered to settle for,its maximum liability under one policy limit.on october,the seay plaintiffs advised allstate that they would not discuss settlement unless the insurer conceded that the applicable policy limit was,or for each of the policies at issue.in the alternative,the seay plaintiffs proposed a settlement between and,with to be paid immediately and the balance contingent upon the outcome of a declaratory judgment action that would determine whether one or two policy limits were triggered.allstate rejected this proposal and referred the question of how many policy limits were triggered by seay injuries to three sets of outside counsel.
shortly thereafter,the settled for.in a letter dated october,counsel for the seay plaintiffs stated that unless allstate tendered,there would be no settlement and the insurer refusal to tender this amount would be the basis of a bad faith action.sturges forwarded this letter to the outside counsel who were in the process of reviewing allstate interpretation of the policy.within a week,allstate received legal opinions from the three sets of outside counsel.dennis of the firm of,mcguinness,conte,doyle oleson submitted a letter on october suggesting that there was no proof that seay had been exposed to lead during the first policy period and that allstate could therefore argue that only one policy limit had been triggered.did not address the provision.on october,alan eagle,a partner at rivkin,radler kremer,submitted a letter concluding that,although the law was not entirely clear,there may be a better than chance that a court would interpret the allstate policy to provide that only one limit is available for the claim and the policy limits may not be stacked.finally,in a letter dated november,gregory katz of the firm of wilson,elser,moskowitz,edelman dicker llp stated that his firm would read allstate policy provision to limit a claimant who suffered bodily injury as the result of a continuous exposure to lead paint to be entitled to the proceeds of a single policy because the policy defines injuries caused by continuous exposure,such as exposure to lead paint,as one accidental loss.
the trial of the seay action began on october,before justice janice bowman.on november,counsel for the seay plaintiffs indicated his intent to initiate a bad faith proceeding against allstate if the insurer did not agree to settle this case for the limit of liability under the greenidges or be determined in a subsequent declaratory judgment action.counsel for the greenidges noted that allstate had offered the plaintiffs but that the insurer refused to enter into a settlement dependant on the outcome of a declaratory judgment action brought by the seay plaintiffs.justice bowman expressed concern over the greenidges financial exposure in the absence of a settlement and noted that they could face a judgment for a million dollars.counsel for the seay plaintiffs responded that if allstate agreed to the declaratory judgment action,his clients would seek to recover no more than from the greenidges.
on november,attorney hugh campbell appeared in court as personal counsel for the greenidges and urged allstate to agree to a settlement that would limit his clients financial exposure.that night,campbell sent a letter to sturges repeating the seay plaintiffs offer to settle on a contingent basis and urging allstate to accept that offer.the following day,sturges responded with a letter reiterating allstate belief that seay injuries implicated only one policy limit and informing campbell that allstate would not consent to the settlement proposed by the plaintiffs.sturges also sent a letter to the seay plaintiffs,informing them that allstate offer to settle for remained open.the parties did not reach a settlement.
on november,the jury returned a verdict in favor of taniya seay in the amount of,and on july,judgment was entered against the greenidges in the amount of.the greenidges appealed,and the j
