environmental defense,the natural resources defense council,and the sierra club petition for review of a final rule promulgated by the environmental protection agency to regulate hot spot analyses undertaken as part of the transportation conformity determinations required by the clean air act caa.see and hot spot analyses in transportation conformity determinations for the new and existing national ambient air quality standards final rule,to be codified at pt.petitioners seek a remand of sections and b of the final rule on the ground that they fail to implement the conformity conditions in caa c a and b iii.petitioners also seek vacatur of epa decision to withdraw a previously announced emissions model from use in hot spot analyses on the ground that epa failed to give prior adequate notice or opportunity for comment we grant the petition in part and deny it in part.because petitioners fail to show that epa interpretation of caa c a is unreasonable or that epa failed to give adequate notice and opportunity for comment prior to withdrawing the model,we deny the petition as to those contentions.however,if any area properly means a local area under caa c b i and b ii,then it is arbitrary and capricious not to define the term similarly in b iii or not to explain why the term there means something different.we therefore grant the petition and remand the final rule for epa either to interpret b iii in harmony with b i and b ii or to explain why it need not do so.
pursuant to the caa,epa has established national ambient air quality standards naaqs that regulate air contaminants,including particulate matter measuring less than ten micrometers and less than micrometers.the states,in turn,have prepared state implementation plans sips to provide for implementation,maintenance,and enforcement of naaqs in each air quality control region or portion thereof caa a,a.see generally envtl.def.fund epa edf ii,coast air quality mgmt.dist.epa.the caa requires that states be divided into specific areas,which are rated nonattainment if air quality standards do not comply with the naaqs,attainment if they do,or maintenance if they have passed from nonattainment to attainment status.caa d a i ii e,d a i ii e.
the federal conformity rule,first adopted in,prohibited federal agencies from assisting,supporting,or approving transportation activities that do not conform to a state sip.see criteria and procedures for determining conformity to state or federal implementation plans.metropolitan planning organizations mpos for certain urban areas,as required by the federal highway law could not approve transportation activities that did not conform to a sip.id.in the years after adoption of the conformity rule,epa and the department of transportation dot engaged in inconclusive discussions about whether individual transportation projects that were part of broader transportation plans implementing sip requirements could be approved without further assessments.epa argued for additional assessments to evaluate whether individual projects would affect the attainment of naaqs in sip areas.see,letter from jennifer joy wilson,assistant adm r for external affairs,epa don clay,acting assistant adm r for air and radiation,epa,to robert farris,administrator,federal highway administration,dot.
in,congress amended the caa conformity provisions,requiring epa and dot jointly to promulgate transportation regulations.as amended,section c sets forth conformity requirements for all activities 
conformity to an implementation plan means 
a conformity to an implementation plan purpose of eliminating or reducing the severity and number of violations of the national ambient air quality standards and achieving expeditious attainment of such standards and 
b that such activities will not 
i cause or contribute to any new violation of any standard in any area 
ii increase the frequency or severity of any existing violation of any standard in any area or 
iii delay timely attainment of any standard or any required interim emission reductions or other milestones in any area.
c emphases added.
the epa first invoked its authority under c,c,to promulgate regulations applicable to transportation projects,in.in relevant part,those regulations required federal agencies and mpos to conduct an analysis of the impact of a transportation project upon carbon monoxide and pollution at the local level in nonattainment and maintenance areas.see.such an analysis thus provides information concerning pollutant levels on a scale smaller than the entire nonattainment or maintenance area,including,for example,congested roadway intersections id.the rule required only a qualitative approach for until epa releases quantitative modeling guidance on this subject and announces in the federal register that these requirements are in effect.id.d,d see also id.b.
in november epa proposed to amend these conformity regulations by adopting criteria and procedures for and revising the hot spot rule for.notice of proposed rulemaking nprm.on december,epa issued a supplementary proposal setting forth a number of hot spot options for.supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking supplemental nprm,and for,id.at.epa proposed to require only a qualitative analysis for in the first instance,as it had done for.id.at.
ultimately epa revised the existing hot spot regulation as regards and imposed the same criteria for.final rule.at amending.the new hot spot regulation,which applies in nonattainment and maintenance areas regardless of the sip,now provides that a new transportation project 
must not cause or contribute to any new localized co,violations or increase the frequency or severity of any existing co,violations in co,and nonattainment and maintenance areas.this criterion is satisfied if it is demonstrated that no new local violations will be created and the severity or number of existing violations will not be increased as a result of the project.
final rule.at codified at a.
during the rulemaking,petitioners commented that proposed a violated caa c a and b iii.they posited that by including only two of the four statutory conformity conditions,the proposed rule failed to require any finding that the project be consistent with the sip aim of eliminating all emissions violations and that the project emissions not delay timely attainment and interim progress in meeting emission milestones.epa,in response,rejected the view that the hot spot regulation supplants existing transportation conformity regulations,maintaining instead that the latter already require transportation projects to be consistent with the emissions projections and control measures in the sip.final rule.at.according to epa,the purpose of hot spot regulations is limited to preventing an increase in the severity or frequency of local violations of emissions standards,reflecting the mandate of caa c b i and b iii epa rejected a construction of caa c a and b iii that would require new individual projects to reduce emissions as opposed to preventing any new violations or worsening of existing violations.see id.
epa also announced in the final rule that a previously established quantitative emissions model,while potentially appropriate for quantitative analyses of at the regional level,was not appropriate for or analyses.id.at.previously,epa had stated that must be used in all conformity analyses,until it is replaced by newer approved methods or models.notice of availability noa,may.upon releasing,epa had explained that the release did not trigger any requirement quantitatively to analyze emissions under the hot spot rule.id.
petitioners challenge epa amendment to the hot spot conformity regulation,contending that it unlawfully ignores the requirements of caa c a and b iii.petitioners also challenge epa withdrawal of for hot spot analyses.
as a threshold matter,we hold that insofar as epa maintains that petitioners challenge to the final rule is time barred because epa did not reopen these issues in the rulemaking,its position is untenable.the final rule applied existing regulatory criteria to and,and there is a limited period of time within which an aggrieved party may obtain judi
