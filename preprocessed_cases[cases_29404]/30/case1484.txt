the federal tort claims act ftca gives district courts jurisdiction over civil actions on claims against the united states the government for money damages for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death,caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his or her employment,under circumstances where the government,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant under the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.see b.this waiver of sovereign immunity does not extend to claims against the united states based upon an act or omission of an employee of the government,exercising due care,in the execution of a statute or regulation or based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function.a.
this case involves an ftca action brought by university au glenbrook limited partnership,lawrence brandt,lawrence brandt,and robert brant collectively thomas loughlin and kathi loughlin,individually and on behalf of their children patricia gillum and camille the government alleged negligence in burying dangerous munitions and toxic chemicals on property leased from au in the spring valley area of the district of columbia around the time of world war i,failing to issue warnings about the buried munitions and chemicals and the resulting dangerous conditions,and failing to investigate and remedy the hazards and contamination it caused.gillum and saum initially filed their ftca and local law claims in superior court.their local law actions claimed that au was liable to the plaintiffs under district of columbia law,because the dangerous munitions and toxic chemicals on au property,and the hazardous conditions resulting therefrom,caused injuries to neighboring property owners.au removed these actions to the district court under b c.the loughlins filed both their ftca action and supplemental local law claims similar to those filed by gillum and saum in district court.the district court invoked its supplemental jurisdiction over all local law claims against au under a.
au filed a motion under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure to dismiss the local law actions for failure to state a claim.the district court denied this motion and wrote a lengthy opinion suggesting that the loughlins,gillum,and saum had stated a cause of action against au under district of columbia law.see loughlin united states,d loughlin i.the district court turned to the ftca matter after rendering a judgment on the supplemental action.the trial court first allowed the parties jurisdictional discovery limited to the existence of rules,regulations,or directives that might pertain to the first part of the discretionary function exception.the district court then granted the government motion to dismiss with prejudice the ftca actions under the discretionary function exception.see loughlin united states,d,loughlin ii.having found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the ftca,the district court dismissed all remaining claims without prejudice.id.at.the ftca claimants appeal the dismissal of their claims,as well as the limited scope of the trial court discovery orders.au separately appeals the district court denial of its motion to dismiss the supplemental action against the university.in the alternative,au asserts that,if the actions resting on district of columbia law are moot,then the district court decision on the claims should be vacated.
we affirm the district court dismissal of the ftca claims under the discretionary function exception.although the trial court framework for discovery was misguided,we nonetheless find that the parties had a full and fair opportunity to determine the relevant jurisdictional facts and the district court had an adequate record upon which to rest its judgment.finally,we vacate the district court decision denying au motion to dismiss.the district court had no subject matter jurisdiction over the ftca action.therefore,the trial court had no supplemental jurisdiction under a to entertain claims.accordingly,because it should not have reached the merits of the negligence claims under district of columbia law,the district court views on local law are a nullity and must be vacated.
background 
in april,at the invitation of au,the united states army leased grounds from the university and gave its corps of engineers corps exclusive control over the property.later that year,the bureau of mines established the american university experiment station aues in order to consolidate its chemical weapons research.when aues was transferred from civilian control to the war department newly formed gas service,it became central to the gas service research division,which used the experiment station to develop,manufacture,and test myriad chemical weapons.in order to simulate battlefield conditions,gas weapons were tested in trenches,bunkers,and pits created on the property.loughlin ii,d at.
shortly after the war end,aues was disbanded and the army transferred personnel and equipment to other bases.it is undisputed,however,that some munitions and chemical warfare materials remained buried in spring valley,either as a result of weapons testing or deliberate burial.id.at.in march,the army signed an agreement pledging to restore the buildings and grounds to the condition they were in when the government took control of the property.this agreement appears to have been superceded,however,by a subsequent agreement,dated june,in which the university agreed to release the government from its obligation to restore the property in exchange for the transfer of title to certain buildings erected by the army.id.the army nevertheless performed some salvage and restoration work before leaving aues some contaminated structures were burned and others were boarded up and surrounded with fencing.id.at.
in,when au embarked on plans to build a new athletic facility,the university discovered a article in the american university courier,which reported that the army had buried munitions on or near the university campus during world war i.the university notified the army,which conducted document reviews and scoured the site with metal detectors,but did not uncover conclusive evidence of any buried munitions.id.at.in,american university sold property to,which planned to construct two houses,at what is today and glenbrook road.in the course of these construction projects,workers uncovered old laboratory equipment and possible chemical contaminants.they also experienced severe physical reactions to the site that required emergency hospital care.id.at.informed the university,which retained an industrial hygiene consulting firm to investigate.the firm identified a herbicide,silvex,in the soil,which it explained could irritate the senses,but was not a hazardous substance.id.
around this time,workers excavating land approximately one mile from the property discovered an underground munitions bunker.that project developer contacted the army,which commenced investigations that lasted until and unearthed live and spent munitions and chemical materials from the world war i era.these events gave rise to separate litigation against the united states by the of that property.id.at citing miller united states.
in january,the army,now immersed in a comprehensive investigation to locate buried weapons,sought and received permission from to access its properties and sample the soil.id.at.in february,thomas and kathi loughlin tendered a purchase offer to buy the property at glenbrook road.disclosed to the loughlins the recent developments,and the loughlins hired an independent testing organization to sample the soil and evaluate potential environmental hazards.this independent firm found no contamination from hazardous substances.id.at.on march,the loughlins contracted to purchase glenbrook road.
meanwhile,on march,the corps collected soil samples from the properties.soil and groundwater samples were also collected from other points of interest throughout the area.in june,the defense department issued its final record of decision,which concluded that no further action was necessary with respect to the removal operation in spring valley.at this time,the army had removed from the area pieces of ordnance,of which were suspected of being chemical weapons.id.at.
the environmental protection agency epa also conducted soil sampling at glenbrook road during this time.epa collected seven samples on march,one of which revealed heightened levels of arsenic.id.at.both the loughlins and allege that they lacked knowledge of this abnormal result until it was disclosed to them by the corps in early february.id.indeed,in january,the corps issued a letter to the loughlins and other spring valley residents,which stated that the soil samples had not revealed chemical agents or explosives and that no hazard to human health or to the environment existed as a result of the army activities at aues.id.
in june,however,workers at the site of the au president residence at glenbrook road,next door to the loughlins home,suffered reactions to odors and fumes that burned their eyes.these workers unearthed laboratory glassware and broken bottles filled with chemicals.the university hired apex environmental,which conducted soil samples that confirmed the existence of a contaminated area approximately feet in diameter and up to two feet deep the contamination included arsenic.id.these events led the district of columbia to conduct its own investigation,which also found elevated levels of arsenic and other toxic substances.id.
in february,the corps conducted a geophysical survey of the korean ambassador residence at glenbrook road,which also abuts glenbrook road,and found two potential burial pits.the corps informed spring valley residents that it would investigate whether additional chemical materials existed at glenbrook road.a millimeter projectile was discovered buried six inches deep in the ambassador property in february.id.at.
in december,the corps also began further investigation of the loughlins property to confirm the absence of buried munitions,remnants thereof,and associated material.id.at quoting united states stat.of material facts not in dispute.on june,the corps collected soil samples.all but four of the samples contained elevated levels of arsenic.id.based on the june samples,the corps concluded that there was an unacceptable hazard from arsenic on the properties at and glenbrook road.id.the corps informed the loughlins,who were forced to permanently evacuate their home.since,army investigations in spring valley unearthed pieces of ordnance,including chemical munitions and bottles of chemicals.these events spawned several lawsuits.id.
this case presents ftca claims brought by appellants against the government.the loughlins,gillum,and saum also brought negligence claims against au,loughlin i,d at,which brought against the government under the ftca,see br.of au,loughlins,saum,and gillum ftca appellants br.the gillum and saum actions were initially filed in superior court and then removed to federal court under b c.the loughlins filed both their ftca action and their supplemental local law claims in district court.the district court exercised its supplemental jurisdiction over the local law claims under.on march,au moved to dismiss the local law claims pursuant to rule b.on june,the district court denied au motion to dismiss,finding that au owed a legal duty under the applicable district of columbia law.see loughlin i,d at.
on september,the government filed a motion to dismiss or,in the alternative,for summary judgment against all ftca claimants appellants under the discretionary function exception.see united states district court for the district of columbia,civil docket for case,reprinted in joint appendix.appellants argued that the motion was premature,because jurisdictional discovery was necessary.the district court permitted jurisdictional discovery limited to the existence of mandatory directives relevant to the first part of the discretionary function exception.see loughlin ii,d at.the district court subsequently granted the government motion to dismiss under the discretionary function exception,dismissing all claims against the united states with prejudice,and all remaining claims,including those against au,without prejudice.see id.at.
appellants appeal the dismissal of their case under the discretionary function exception and the court restrictions on jurisdictional discovery.see ftca appellants br.au separately appeals the district court denial of its motion to dismiss under rule b,seeking reversal on the merits with respect to saum if we find jurisdiction under the ftca,or vacatur if we affirm the applicability of the discretionary function exception.see appellant au au br.prior to oral argument,we ordered,sua sponte,that counsel be prepared to address the jurisdictional basis for this court to exercise appellate review and the effect that a determination that diversity jurisdiction exists for the case between saum and american university would have on au request for vacatur.see loughlin united states,order,order of.
ii.analysis 
the ftca vests the district courts with jurisdiction over civil damages claims against the united states 
for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government if a private person would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.
b.this waiver of sovereign immunity is limited in part by a,which insulates the government from suits regarding 
a ny claim based upon an act or omission of an employee of the government,exercising due care,in the execution of a statute or regulation,whether or not such statute or regulation be valid,or based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the government,whether or not the discretion involved be abused.
a.the second clause of a marks the boundary between congress willingness to impose tort liability upon the united states and its desire to protect certain governmental activities from exposure to suit by private individuals.united states empresa de viacao aerea rio grandense varig airlines,d.
a.the discretionary function exception 
the discretionary function exception is a barrier to subject matter jurisdiction.see cope scott.a district court thus has no authority to address the merits of claims allegedly arising under the ftca in cases in which the plaintiff is unable to overcome this jurisdictional barrier.because federal jurisdiction determinations are purely legal,we review de novo the district court judgment on the applicability of the discretionary function exception.see macharia united states,cert.denied,d dismissal pursuant to fed.civ.b reviewed de novo cope,at rulings on application of the discretionary function exception reviewed de novo.a complaint may be dismissed on jurisdictional grounds only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.conley gibson,d.
the supreme court has established a test to determine whether a governmental act or omission falls within the ambit of the discretionary function exception.see cope,at citing united states gaubert,d.these two prongs track the language of a.the first asks whether a federal statute,regulation,or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow gaubert,at.at quoting berkovitz united states,d.if such a binding directive exists,then the employee has no rightful option but to adhere to the directive.berkovitz,at.at.failure to abide by such directives opens the united states to suit under the ftca.
in the absence of such specific directives and where the challenged conduct involves an element of judgment,the second step determines whether the challenged discretionary act or omission is of the nature and quality that congress intended to shield from tort liability.varig airlines,at.at.the supreme court has explained that b ecause the purpose of the exception is to prevent judicial of legislative and administrative decisions grounded in social,economic,and political policy through the medium of an action in tort,the exception protects only governmental actions and decisions based on considerations of public policy.gaubert,at.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.what matters is not what the decisionmaker was thinking,but rather the type of decision being challenged cope,at.
appellants principally contend that the government failed to warn them of the buried munitions and toxic chemicals and of the soil contamination that these materials purportedly created.they argue that the district court erred when it concluded that these claims are covered by the discretionary function exception.see ftca appellants br.
appellants first submit that the government decision not to warn of the buried material violated binding directives.see ftca appellants br.if mandatory directives so constrained the government discretion,the discretionary function exception would not protect a failure to warn.we agree with the district court,however,that appellants have failed to cite any regulations or policies that prescribed a nondiscretionary duty to warn.we therefore affirm the district court ruling on prong one of the discretionary function test for the reasons enunciated by the district court in its exhaustive opinion.see loughlin ii,d at.
although appellants point to myriad documents from the world war i era,they fail to identify a specific and binding directive that addressed aues or research facilities in general,and proscribed the burial of munitions or required that such burials be marked.as the district court explained,appellants point to a shipping order that addressed aues but did not discuss buried munitions,and a gas warfare bulletin that proscribed burial in most cases and required markings where burial was permitted,but gives no indication that it applied to activities at aues.see id.at.
appellants also fail to identify specific and binding directives that pertain to their negligence claims for the time period,after the government had begun to investigate the potential existence of submerged chemical warfare materials and the risk of contamination.see id.at.we reject,moreover,appellants suggestion that the government had adopted an unwritten or de facto policy to inform the community during this time period.as the district court concluded 
while documents do suggest that the army wished to communicate information to the public about the progress of its investigation,it reads far too much into them to argue that they demonstrate an official,irrevocable commitment to alert the public to every development in the search for buried munitions,or to every potential danger that was discovered.
id.at.thus,appellants have failed to identify relevant binding directives or policies,the violation of which would bring this case outside of a.
we turn,then,to the second prong of the discretionary function exception.appellants argue that the government failure to warn of the buried munitions and of the resulting contamination was not a decision susceptible to public policy considerations.see ftca appellants br.first,appellants seem to urge that the government decision to bury the munitions without disclosing their burial during world war i or its immediate aftermath is not the type of decision susceptible to public policy considerations.this argument is untenable.the decision whether to warn of these burials in the immediate aftermath of the war was fraught with public policy considerations,cope,at internal quotation marks omitted.as the district court observed,it required balancing competing concerns of secrecy and safety,national security and public health.loughlin ii,d at.indeed,at oral argument,appellants counsel conceded that national security concerns are greater when the decision whether to warn is contemporaneous with the war effort.see recording of oral argument at.
appellants contend,however,that because the government duty to warn was ongoing,concerns that were salient in wartime can not determine the nature of the government decision not to warn over the subsequent years.see ftca appellants br.recording of oral argument at.the argument is without merit.appellants position assumes that the government was required consistently and regularly to revisit its initial decision not to warn and the relevant factors.a judicially constructed requirement to rethink particular decisions not to warn on a regular basis for over years would constitute precisely the judicial that the discretionary function exception was intended to displace.gaubert,at.at internal quotation marks omitted.it would insert the courts into prioritization and resource allocation decisions that implicate serious political,social,and economic considerations.instead,in order for us to consider whether the decision not to warn was susceptible to public policy considerations in subsequent years,appellants must identify circumstances in which the government itself would have revisited the decision not to warn.
appellants point to two such events.the first is a finding by epa that one of seven soil samples collected in from the glenbrook road property revealed heightened levels of arsenic.see ftca appellants br.appellants allege that they were not informed of this result until.second,appellants allege that they were not informed of a draft field sampling plan,which identified as points of interest two munitions pits adjacent to the glenbrook property.see see also,field sampling plan for hazardous and toxic waste,spring valley project,washington,on behalf of the army corps of engineers,draft field sampling plan.appellants submit that the government knowledge of specific hazards the abnormal soil sample and the points of interest in the draft field sampling plan renders the decision whether to warn void of public policy considerations.see ftca appellants br.
appellants arguments on these two points fail for the reasons provided by the district court 
in deciding whether this information on the abnormal soil sample result should be made public,the agency would have had to weigh several factors,including the reliability of the test,the significance of one unusual result,the possibility of unnecessarily alarming spring valley residents should the danger have ultimately proved unfounded,and whether further testing should be done before this data was revealed.conducting this delicate balance is a matter that calls for discretion of the sort that the ftca shields from judicial 
similarly,with respect to the pits,while there were two shell pits identified in a draft field sampling plan prepared by the corps in,no information existed at the time that the pits actually contained munitions t he existence of munitions were constructed to test,not bury,not necessarily indicate the presence of buried contaminants.certainly,the plan which claimants suggest was withheld from them does not indicate that weapons or other toxic materials were actually in the ground.as such,the army decision whether to announce this limited information,with its highly speculative relationship to actual risk,is subject to the same policy considerations that attended upon epa decisions whether to go public with its soil test results.
loughlin ii,d at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the district court judgment is consistent with this court decision in wells united states,where we held that the discretionary function exception barred claims that epa negligently failed to inform residents neighboring three lead smelters of potential risks and to provide a timely remedy for the hazards.see id.at.wells concluded that epa decision to engage in further study to determine the appropriate lead testing level was based on public policy considerations,including the and economic implications of recognizing an action level in one situation that could not be consistently applied.see id.at.
appellants contend,however,that cope scott,not wells,controls this case.in cope,we held that prong two of the discretionary function exception did not extend to the government decision not to post a warning sign on a particular strip of road.see cope,at.we rejected the government purported public policy concern of aesthetics,given the numerous signs on the same stretch of road.see id.at.appellants submit that just as cope held that the decision whether to post warning signs in suitable locations was not susceptible to public policy considerations once other warning signs were placed on the same strip of road,the government decision in to warn spring valley residents of contamination reveals that public policy considerations did not determine the government earlier decisions not to issue such warnings.thus,appellants argue,the only remaining questions are what the government knew and when,which turn on negligence law,not public policy.see recording of oral argument at.this argument can not carry the day for appellants.
the geography gap in cope warning sign at one location but not at another is not analogous to the time gap here warning issued in but not earlier.in cope,the presence of no less than signs on the same strip of road was probative of the nature of the decision to place an additional warning sign,because it demonstrated that the government was not concerned with preserving a pristine view on the particular stretch of road.see cope,at t he park service has chosen to manage the road in a manner more amenable to commuting through nature than communing with it.in contrast,the government decision to warn spring valley residents of contamination in sheds no light on whether the prior decision not to warn was susceptible to policy judgment and involve d an exercise of political,social,or economic judgment.cope,at quoting gaubert,at.at varig airlines,at.second alteration in original.that a government agent in made a different decision is irrelevant.see,allen united states,cir however erroneous or misguided the government deliberations may seem today,it is not the place of the judicial branch through the ftca to now question them.the passage of time gave the government more information to digest,an opportunity to the political,social,and economic considerations,and occasion to make a new policy judgment.the earlier judgment was no less a matter of policy because the later judgment was arguably better informed.
in other words,the nature of the decision whether to warn in was different from the nature of the decision whether to warn prior to because of intervening discoveries that rendered the risk to public health substantially less speculative.the burial pit on the property of the korean ambassador,which abuts the loughlins property,was not discovered until.when this pit was finally located,it was found to contain submerged munitions.loughlin ii,d at.in addition,of soil samples taken in june revealed elevated levels of arsenic.id.at.thus,the warnings that were issued in followed the discovery of a new burial pit and extensive new soil sampling results.they do not shed light on the nature of the earlier decisions not to warn.
b.the discovery orders 
before leaving the ftca appeal,we turn to appellants challenge to the district court discovery orders.appellants submit that the district court abused its discretion by limiting discovery to the existence of binding directives under prong one of the discretionary function exception.see ftca appellants br.we review the district court discovery rulings for abuse of discretion.see macharia,at.although the district court partition between discovery and discovery is misguided,we find no basis for reversal.
because the inquiry looks to the type of decision whether to warn,irrespective of considerations that factored into the actual decision,see cope,at,it may often be the case that discovery is unnecessary to determine whether prong two of the discretionary function exception extends to any particular act or omission.there are situations,however,where the factual predicate is critical to an accurate analysis of the nature of the decision made.in cope,for example,we rejected the government purported policy justification because we considered it in light of the factual context the government alleged aesthetic considerations were undermined by the presence of multiple signs on the same stretch of road.see cope,at.
the district court therefore erred in suggesting that our c ircuit law permits discovery as to prong only.tr.of status conference of.ignatiev united states,on which the district court relied,see tr.of mots.hearing of,is not on point.in ignatiev,ftca claimants alleged that the secret service likely had internal objectives or policies that created the requisite mandatory obligation to take certain safety precautions,which the claimants alleged had not been taken.at.we held that the lower court erred in not permitting discovery on the existence of such directives,noting that the only discovery necessary to establish jurisdiction pertains to the existence vel non of internal governmental policies id.at.circumscribing discovery in this way was consistent with the ignatiev appellants claim.even in ignatiev,however,we recognized that where facts are necessary to establish jurisdiction,plaintiffs must be afforded the opportunity for discovery of such facts prior to the granting of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.id.
jurisdictional discovery on the data that was available when a particular decision was made may be especially salient in the context,where the speculativeness of the risk affects the nature of the decision not to disclose.indeed,the district court relied on such facts when it concluded that the discretionary function exception applies to appellants claim.see loughlin ii,d at w hile there were two shell pits identified in a draft field sampling plan prepared by the corps in,no information existed at the time that the pits actually contained munitions.when such facts are probative of the nature of the decision itself,jurisdictional discovery may be illuminating.no bright line rule confines discovery to prong one of the discretionary function exception.the suggestion,moreover,that one can neatly partition discovery from discovery is misleading.evidence that sheds light on the type of decision made is not necessarily distinct from evidence on binding directives that would be responsive to prong one.the search for binding directives here,important facts pertaining to the nature of the decisions at issue.
although the district court misconstrued our case law on jurisdictional discovery,the discovery orders nonetheless afforded the parties a full and fair opportunity to pursue relevant information,which,in turn,allowed the district court to make a just finding on the speculativeness of the risk.this occurred because,as it turned out in this case,the discovery reasonably embraced the available data on potential hazards.the draft field sampling plan identified pits and trenches as potential burial areas,and presented sampling activities to be used to evaluate the possible presence of chemical agents or chemical contamination and explosives or contamination.draft field sampling plan at.the draft field sampling plan itself,therefore,undermines the suggestion that the government had specific knowledge of buried munitions or contamination in the area.a final remedial investigation evaluation report explains that the location of point of interest,the munitions pit that was eventually discovered on the korean ambassador property,was revised when aerial and supporting photographs were reevaluated as a result of a evaluation of the earlier remedial investigation.see army engineering and support center,army corps of engineers parsons engineering science,final remedial investigation evaluation report,operation safe removal formerly used defense site,washington.thus,the documents cited by appellants reveal an involved investigation and government actors struggling to define the scope of the potential hazard.
to the extent that appellants seek additional discovery relevant to the inquiry,they have failed to particularize their requests.in their briefs and when pressed at oral argument,appellants consistently failed to articulate precisely what information,pertaining to the nature of the decision whether to warn,they had been denied.see record
