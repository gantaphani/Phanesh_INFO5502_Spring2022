the miccosukee tribe of indians of florida the tribe filed two lawsuits challenging the federal government plans to replace a mile of the tamiami trail highway with a bridge,to increase the flow of water into everglades national park.the district courts dismissed the tribe claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,and we have consolidated the tribe appeals of those decisions.the district courts concluded that language congress inserted in a spending bill partially repealed the environmental laws that the tribe was invoking.the tribe challenges that interpretation,and asserts the rulings violate the constitution on several counts.for the following reasons,we conclude that the act of congress deprived the federal courts of subject matter jurisdiction over the tribe claims.therefore,we affirm the judgments of the district courts.
background 
historical backdrop of the litigation 
the miccosukee indians have long resided in the everglades the miccosukees historical association with their neighbors the seminole indians was tempered by the fact that the miccosukees spoke their own language,mikasuki.the federal government formally recognized the miccosukee tribe of indians of florida in.tribe members live and work on several reservations within the everglades.
geologists estimate that the everglades formed about years ago the indians called the place,meaning grassy water.a british cartographer labeled it the river glades,and author marjory stoneman douglas suggested that later mapmakers substituted the word ever for river the name everglades appeared on american military maps during the seminole wars.
the everglades covers much of the half of florida south of orlando.historically,water moved southward from the kissimmee river to lake okeechobee,then south and southwest into florida bay from lake okeechobee to the gulf of mexico,the land declines almost average only three inches per that the water forms a shallow,wide river,moving slowly southward 
in bad weather the water did not always move so gently.a hurricane in september caused a breach of the okeechobee levee,drowning upwards of farm workers the tragedy increased public awareness of the dangers of uncontrolled everglades waters.at the same time,the population of florida was continuing to grow,and with it the demand for land,food,and water.in,congress passed the flood control act,stat,authorizing the central and southern florida plan to control flooding in the everglades,and promote agriculture and water supply.the effect of the series of levees and canals that followed was to shunt more water out through the east and west coasts of florida,and drastically reduce the southward flow through the everglades.
the tamiami trail the trail,also known as highway,was the first highway to cross the everglades.its name derives from the cities at its ends,tampa and miami.construction began during the first world war and took more than a decade to complete.when workers were not battling the swamp,they were using dynamite to break through the rock beds on the naples side while the newer interstate to the north,called alligator alley,carries more vehicles across the everglades every day,the trail remains a vital road and hurricane evacuation route.some of the portion of the trail runs along the northern boundary of everglades national park 
although the trail remains an impressive engineering achievement,it poses a substantial environmental challenge.it acts as a dam to restrict water from flowing south into everglades national park and greatly reduces the flow into the shark river slough,the main water corridor of the everglades.moreover,to preserve the roadbed from erosion,engineers found that they had to lower water levels of the surrounding swamp.the restricted water flow was subsequently blamed for vast losses of wading birds,fish,and native plants.
efforts to restore the everglades historic flows 
on the strength of renewed concerns about the health of the everglades,in congress enacted the everglades national park protection and expansion act,stat,et.enppea.the enppea directed federal agencies to research ways to improve water flow in the park,and describe them in a report titled modified water deliveries to everglades national park.in,the president signed the water resources development act,stat,wrda,outlining the comprehensive everglades restoration plan cerp that updated the original central and southern florida plan for the everglades.one element of cerp called for improvement of water flow through the trail.
in june,the army corps of engineers corps issued its final limited reevaluation report and environmental assessment concerning improvements to the trail it concluded that the most effective and economical option of all the ones studied was alternative.a construction of a bridge at the eastern end of the trail.the bridge would replace the current roadbed and would greatly increase the amount of water that could flow southward into the shark river slough.
on june,the tribe sued the corps,claiming that the selection of alternative.a violated the national environmental policy act of,et.nepa,the federal advisory committee act,app.faca,and wrda.for ease,we refer to this case as the nepa case the tribe claimed that the federal government failed to obey federal environmental laws in planning the bridge,in part by failing to prepare adequate statements of environmental impact.moreover,the lawsuit alleged that higher water levels would flood tribal lands and tree islands.the tribe asked for judicial review under the administrative procedure act,et,and requested an injunction to stop the construction.
congress first appropriations bill 
congress in the meantime continued to legislate on everglades restoration.on september,congress passed a continuing appropriations act,stat.section of the act spoke to the immediate building of the bridge 
amounts provided by section for implementation of the modified water deliveries to everglades national park shall be made available to the army corps of engineers,which shall immediately carry out alternative.a to highway the tamiami trail as substantially described in the limited reevaluation report with integrated environmental assessment and addendum,approved august 
stat.at emphasis added.
on october,the tribe filed suit against the corps and the fish and wildlife service,alleging violations of the endangered species act of,et.esa.we refer to this case as the esa case.the lawsuit alleged that a biological opinion issued by the fish and wildlife service failed to fully address the bridge threat to the continued survival of two endangered bird species,the snail kite and the wood stork.there are two wood stork colonies close to the planned bridge route.like the nepa suit,the esa suit sought a court order blocking construction of the bridge until the federal government complied with the law.
meanwhile,the corps moved to dismiss the nepa suit,citing of congress continuing appropriations act.on october,the nepa court denied the corps motion to dismiss the tribe suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,holding that was not specific enough to exempt the corps from nepa.section neither mentioned nepa by name,nor included the key phrase notwithstanding any other provision of law,which the court described as the language usually associated with an exemption or limited repeal.at.shortly thereafter,on november,the nepa court granted in part the tribe motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the corps from building the bridge until it complied with environmental procedures.
congress omnibus appropriations act of 
on march,congress passed the omnibus appropriations act,stat.omnibus act.the omnibus act included this passage 
construction 
including rescission of funds 
for construction,improvements,repair or replacement of physical facilities,including a portion of the expense for the modifications authorized by section of the everglades national park protection and expansion act of,to remain available until expended 
provided,that funds appropriated in this act,or in any prior act of congress,for the implementation of the modified water deliveries to everglades national park project,shall be made available to the army corps of engineers which shall,notwithstanding any other provision of law,immediately and without further delay construct or cause to be constructed alternative.a to highway the tamiami trail consistent with the limited reevaluation report with integrated environmental assessment and addendum,approved august 
stat.at emphases added.in the following discussion,we refer to the phrase notwithstanding any other provision of law as the notwithstanding clause.we call the phrase immediately and without further delay the immediacy clause.
on june,the nepa court,in response to the corps renewed motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,held that the omnibus act is an explicit exemption from nepa and faca that moves the bridge from the reach of such statutes.at.the court found it significant that congress added the same notwithstanding clause that the court had found lacking in the earlier appropriations act.the nepa court also rejected the tribe constitutional challenges to the omnibus act vagueness,delegation,separation of powers,bill of attainder,due process,and equal protection.the nepa court dismissed the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,and dissolved the preliminary injunction that it had earlier entered.the tribe timely appealed.
the corps filed a copy of the nepa court dismissal with the esa court.on august,the esa court adopted the reasoning of the nepa court to conclude it too lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the tribe claims.the esa court also invoked the doctrine of collateral estoppel to bar the tribe from relitigating its constitutional challenges to the omnibus act because the nepa court had already rejected them.the esa court granted the united states motion to dismiss the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the tribe filed its notice of appeal the next day.
ii.standard of review 
the district court grant of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction presents a legal question that we review de novo.sinaltrainal,cir citation omitted.in construing a statute we must begin,and should often end with the language of the statute itself.kehoe fid.fed.bank trust,cir citation omitted.we review the district court invocation of collateral estoppel de novo.united states weiss,cir citation omitted.
iii.types of repeal 
the main question here is whether the omnibus act modifies the nepa,faca,and esa for purposes of the tribe lawsuits,thereby depriving the federal courts of subject matter jurisdiction to hear the tribe claims.besides being the principal issue of this appeal,the question and the answer also control the outcome in the related appeal the dot case.the focus is on the interaction between the omnibus act and previous acts of congress.the term for this dynamic is and how a later act of congress modifies an earlier one.another name for it is exemption.
the tribe claims that the omnibus act effects no explicit repeal here because it fails to mention any statute it is repealing.the tribe also claims that the corps has failed to meet the high standard for showing that an appropriations act effects an implied repeal.the corps counters that the plain language of the omnibus act,in particular congress addition of the notwithstanding clause,makes it clear that congress intended to relax its existing environmental statutes in order to get the bridge built as quickly as possible.
at oral argument,counsel for the tribe said a repeal has to be either express or implied.while that statement may be true,it does not necessarily follow,as counsel claimed,that there are only two modes of repeal.supreme court and eleventh circuit cases,and sutherland statutes and statutory construction,seem to identify at least three explicit repeals,general repealing clauses,and implied repeals we review the characteristics of each in turn.
explicit repeals 
an explicit repeal occurs when the later statute explicitly identifies the earlier statute it is repealing.sutherland statutes and statutory construction ed.congress can accomplish this identification by citing the earlier statute or referring to its subject matter,or even by giving the style and case number of a lawsuit that is filed under the earlier statute,robertson seattle audubon,
congress walks a fine line in terms of what it may do here and still uphold the separation of powers.congress may not interfere in the judicial process.it may not dictate the result for a particular case,or tell an article iii court how to apply the law to specific facts.see nichols hopper,cir henderson,cir.
but congress is always free to amend the law,even if doing so has the effect of extinguishing a pending case.see seattle audubon society,at.at,at.and among the areas in which congress legislates is the jurisdiction of the federal courts.congress often exercises its power both to confer jurisdiction,and to deny it.see landgraf usi film.t here is an important difference between congress telling this court how it should decide a particular case expressly prohibited by united states klein,wall,and congress withdrawing jurisdiction to decide a particular case coal.to save our mall norton,d.
general repealing clauses 
to effect an explicit repeal,a statute must identify the repealed statute.if it does not,a statute may still sometimes effect a repeal through the use of a general repealing clause.sutherland.one example of such a clause is n otwithstanding any other federal law.united states novak,cir en banc quotation omitted.the supreme court has found these phrases have the power to override other law 
as we have noted previously in construing statutes,the use of such a notwithstanding clause clearly signals the drafter intention that the provisions of the notwithstanding section override conflicting provisions of any other section.likewise,the courts of appeals generally have interpreted similar notwithstanding language to supersede all other laws,stating that a clearer statement is difficult to imagine.
cisneros alpine ridge group,citations,omission,and quotations omitted interpreting the clause n otwithstanding any other provisions of this contract in a section landlord contract.
our court has previously read these clauses the same way.in castro sec y of homeland,cir per curiam citing cisneros,our court held that the same general repealing clause at issue here,notwithstanding any other provision of law,worked an exemption to an earlier statute concerning hiring standards for tsa screeners 
in castro,the plaintiff sued the department of homeland security dhs,claiming that it violated the rehabilitation act of by citing his history of seizures as a reason not to hire him.the district court granted dhs motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,finding that the aviation and transportation security act atsa that congress passed after the terrorist attacks exempted dhs from the nondiscrimination provisions of the rehabilitation act.
this court affirmed,holding that the notwithstanding clause was congress indication that the statute containing that language is intended to take precedence over any preexisting or legislation on the same subject.id.omission and citation omitted.while this plain language alone was enough to effect a repeal,this court also noted that atsa specified physical requirements for security screeners color perception,visual and aural acuity,physical coordination,and motor skills,f b that on their face were inconsistent with the rehabilitation act prohibition of discrimination on the basis of physical disabilities,a.at.castro directs our inquiry here both for its evaluation of the notwithstanding clause,and its approach to statutory construction.
the ninth circuit has read this phrase the same way.in doing so,that court emphasized the importance of statutory context.hearing an appeal to an environmental lawsuit,consejo de desarrollo economico de mexicali,united states,cir,the ninth circuit held that the phrase n otwithstanding any other provision of law in an omnibus tax bill exempted the united states from nepa and esa for purposes of lining the all american canal without delay.
the ninth circuit noted that the notwithstanding clause is not always applied in blanket fashion.we have repeatedly held that the phrase notwithstanding any other provision of law is not always construed literally.rather,when the phrase is used,we have determined its reach by taking into account the whole of the statutory context in which it appears.id.at internal quotations and citations omitted 
further complicating matters is the question of whether a general repealing clause requires the finding of a conflict between the newer and older statutes.some courts base their finding of repeal via a general repealing clause on an irreconcilable conflict.see,norton,d at sutherland noting that a general repealing clause has sometimes been held to repeal because an act conflicts.in castro,our court noted that the two statutes were inconsistent,but said the plain language of the notwithstanding clause was by itself sufficient to support a repeal.at.
we acknowledge that an general repealing clause carries the potential to create confusion about precisely which laws,if any,it is repealing a general repealing clause operates in the twilight between the clearer extremes of explicit and implied repeals.a general repealing clause is explicit only in the sense that it is announcing a repeal of all law or any law or federal laws its actual reach depends on an analysis of the statutory language relevant to it.without that careful analysis,a general repealing clause is a blunt tool prone to repeal too little or too much.
implied repeals 
a statute effecting an implied repeal,also known as a repeal by implication or implicit repeal does not identify the statute it is repealing.nor does it have a general repealing clause,like the notwithstanding clause at issue here.what is key is the legislature demonstration of intent to repeal a law.sutherland.congress intent to effect an implied repeal can be inferred when a later statute conflicts with or is repugnant to an earlier statute or when a newer statute covers the whole subject of the earlier one,and clearly is intended as a substitute.see united states devall,cir see also tug,united states,cir black,concurring listing cases requiring a positive repugnancy between two statutes as a precondition for finding an implied repeal.therefore for an implied repeal,a conflict is a minimum requirement,rather than the helpful sign of legislative intent supporting a general repealing clause.
the eleventh circuit has held that when two statutes conflict,the statute controls to the extent it conflicts with the statute.nguyen united states,cir.moreover,a specific statutory provision trumps a general one.id.at.the conclusion that two statutes conflict,however,is one that courts must not reach lightly.if any interpretation permits both statutes to stand,the court must adopt that interpretation,absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary.garfield ndc health,cir.courts must first assiduously attempt to try to construe two statutes in harmony before concluding that one impliedly repeals the other.tug,at.
because a repeal by implication requires the most speculation about the intent of congress,there is a presumption against finding one.tva hill,concluding that congress repeated appropriations bills funding construction of a dam did not impliedly repeal esa protection for a new species of fish endangered by the project patel quality inn,cir only when congress intent to repeal or amend is clear and manifest will we conclude that a later act implicitly repeals or amends an earlier one.see also tug,at noting the principles of judicial restraint and separation of powers which underlie the particularly high standard required for an implicit repeal.
this presumption against repeal by implication applies with even greater force to an appropriations bill,because legislators are entitled to assume that they only appropriate money for lawful purposes.tva,at.at.congress has the power to effect a repeal through an appropriations just needs to be clear it is doing so.united states will.
iv.analysis 
in this case,we hold that the notwithstanding clause of the omnibus act,analyzed within its surrounding statutory language,repeals the relevant environmental laws so as to deprive the federal courts of subject matter jurisdiction over the tribe suits.the district court finding that there was an explicit exemption from the environmental laws,while yielding the correct result,blurred the lines between the categories of repeal established in the cases.we believe it is correct and clearer to identify as such the general repealing clause that is at work here.our analysis of the omnibus act proceeds in three parts.first,we measure the effect of the notwithstanding clause.second,we consider the immediacy clause.lastly,we examine the imperative shall,which deprives the corps of discretion and therefore strengthens the case against judicial review here.
notwithstanding clause 
in the omnibus act,the notwithstanding clause splits the verb phrase shall construct or cause to be constructed.therefore,the clause speaks directly to any laws regulating the construction of the bridge.the environmental laws clearly applied to such a project.to the extent they did,the notwithstanding clause repeals them.
we base our conclusion in the statutory language in which the notwithstanding clause appears as the ninth circuit noted in consejo,a general repealing clause must be read in the context of the entire statute.indeed,this point highlights the weakness in the tribe argument that the notwithstanding clause works only to repeal appropriations laws relating to the bridge.the tribe argues that the primary purpose of this bill is to appropriate money for improvements to everglades national park,and that the only grammatical effect of the provided clauses that follow the main clause is to qualify the appropriation of money.therefore,the tribe concludes,a notwithstanding clause located within a provided clause can only repeal appropriations laws.
while this argument has superficial appeal,its focus is fatally overbroad.the more specific and grammatically relevant analysis of the notwithstanding clause is that it speaks to the verb construct,rather than to the syntactically more distant language of appropriating.the tribe has no good rejoinder to this point.
moreover,the omnibus act uses broad language here notwithstanding any other provision of law.stat.at emphasis added.nothing about the word any suggests that law should refer only to appropriation laws,rather than any laws 
our finding of a repeal squares with our precedent in castro.if castro were to call our result an exemption rather than repeal via a general repealing clause,the functional difference,if any,would be slight.at oral argument,counsel for the tribe sought to distinguish castro by noting that both the statutes there spoke to the same subject matter,whereas here a budget law would repeal environmental laws.this objection is unavailing.even if one grants the tribe assumption that the rehabilitation act and atsa do address the same subject matter,there is nothing in theory that prevents a budget bill from discussing a public works project in great detail,as the omnibus act here well illustrates.
the omnibus act sufficiently specifies its subjects,and uses precise language to identify the bridge.the cursory labels applied to a bill budget,defense,health care do not dictate the repeal analysis.the notwithstanding clause therefore repeals the environmental laws under which the tribe filed suit.
immediacy clause 
in the omnibus act,congress orders the corps to build the bridge immediately and without further delay.like the notwithstanding clause,this immediacy clause also splits the verb phrase shall construct.our cases require us to read such simple english simply.in the absence of a statutory definition of a term,we look to the common usage of words for their meaning.cbs primetime joint venture,cir quotation omitted.
the simplest reading of this plain language is that congress wanted the bridge built now.congress sought to facilitate this goal by repealing the environmental laws that it had previously passed.allowing further administrative challenges to the bridge under those environmental laws,more than two decades after congress passed legislation seeking to improve water flows in the everglades,would further delay the speedy completion of the bridge and frustrate congress clear intent.
in this way,the immediacy clause creates a direct conflict with the administrative review mandated by the environmental laws,and therefore the environmental laws must yield.this finding of a conflict cements our conclusion that congress effected a repeal here.we reach this conclusion without deciding the issue of whether finding a conflict is necessary for the operation of a general repealing clause.
mandatory language 
in the omnibus act,congress directs that the corps shall build the bridge as described in the june report.this command denies the corps any discretion in the matter.this lack of discretion is a third reason why the federal courts have no subject matter jurisdiction over the tribe suits.claims brought against an agency under nepa,faca,or the esa proceed only when the agency has choices in a,choices between alternatives that vary in their environmental friendliness.here,no discretion means no jurisdiction.
procedural statutes like nepa do not apply when an agency has no discretion to act or not to act on a given matter.dep t of transp.public citizen,holding that nepa does not apply to an agency that lacks statutory authority to act in the relevant manner ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,same holding under the esa florida key deer paulison,cir discussing public citizen a n agency can not be held accountable for the effects of actions it has no discretion not to take.moreover,the tension between the corps lack of discretion under the shall of the omnibus act,and the environmental statutes presumption of agency discretion,is an additional conflict between the statutes that we conclude supports a finding of repeal here.
the omnibus act of course refers to the,which in turn contains oblique references to nepa and esa these stray mentions are descriptive rather than prescriptive,and they are not to be mistaken for a grant of article iii jurisdiction quite the opposite obtains.when a legislature writes a set of administrative findings into law,the administrative findings become legislative ones,and thus are no longer reviewable through the ordinary avenues of administrative law.as one court put it,in this posture the record of decision became a legislative action and not an administrative action.in effect,there is no longer an administrative action for us to review.mallory,d at.
mallory was a pennsylvania district court decision that concluded that the notwithstanding clause in a transportation bill incorporating the administrative record of decision effected an implied repeal of nepa and the clean water act for a federal interstate highway project.mallory went on to state that is,by making the administrative decision a legislative decision,congress has barred plaintiffs from seeking review of the administrative decision.moreover,the action removes from the administrative agencies any discretion they may have had they now are required by statute to act in a predetermined manner.id.at.
we believe the analysis in mallory applies here.the lack of discretion in congress command to build the bridge precludes the applicability of statutes like nepa or the esa,which presume agency discretion as a starting point.and,the adoption of the administrative finding as a legislative finding bars judicial review of agency action.
conclusion 
the nepa court,clearly aware of the high legal standard for an implied repeal of nepa and faca,concluded that the omnibus act effected an explicit exemption from the reach of such statutes.at.it did this even though the omnibus act does not explicitly mention any statute it is repealing.the tribe correctly points out that the omnibus act language does not meet the generally understood test for an explicit repeal.for the reasons we have already stated,we prefer to describe this repeal as one resulting from a general repealing clause moreover,for the reasons stated by the district court in the nepa case,we find that the tribe constitutional challenges to the omnibus act are without merit we therefore affirm the district courts dismissals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.therefore,we affirm the judgments of the district courts.
while some of the introductory background in this subsection is not part of the record on appeal,it is included to assist in understanding the historical precursor to this litigation.we note that our analysis and decision of the legal issues in these appeals rest solely on the record.while some of the introductory background in this subsection is not part of the record on appeal,it is included to assist in understanding the historical precursor to this litigation.we note that our analysis and decision of the legal issues in these appeals rest solely on the record.
