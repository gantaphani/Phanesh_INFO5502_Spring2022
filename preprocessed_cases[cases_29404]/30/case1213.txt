this case involves one battle in a prolonged war over a finite and elemental grande water.the needs of the plants and animals that depend upon this water for survival are in tension with the needs of the human inhabitants of the middle rio grande valley the valley who depend upon the water for daily living and commercial and agricultural activities.alleging that the bureau of reclamation reclamation failed to properly maintain the delicate balance between these counterpoised needs to the detriment of several endangered species,defenders of wildlife,forest guardians,national audubon society,new mexico audubon council,sierra club,and the southwest environmental center the environmental groups sought relief in federal court pursuant to the endangered species act esa.
directly at issue is whether reclamation has discretion to reallocate water from agricultural and municipal contract users to maintain stream flows for the benefit of the rio grande silvery minnow minnow.the environmental groups claim that reclamation does and that its failure to weigh that discretion in its consultations with the fish and wildlife service the fws violated of the esa.
at the outset,we commend the district court.when confronted with an extended and sometimes acrimonious dispute between bitterly opposed and firmly entrenched interests,it acted impartially,thoughtfully,and thoroughly.we are constrained,however,to disagree with the district court and conclude that intervening events have mooted the environmental groups claim under the esa we also conclude that the district court erred in denying the appellants motions for vacatur.for the reasons stated below,we dismiss the appeal and remand to the district court to vacate its memorandum opinions and orders of april,september,and november,and to dismiss the environmental groups complaint with regard to their claim under the esa.
background 
federal involvement in the valley 
the human inhabitants of the valley have,for centuries,used the rio grande for irrigation.in,the middle rio grande conservancy district the mrgcd was formed to consolidate water rights and irrigation systems,and to rehabilitate the existing irrigation systems in the valley.the mrgcd subsequent financial difficulties coupled with aggradation of the river channel led to development of the middle rio grande project the project,one of two major federal water projects impacting the valley.approved by the flood control acts of and,the project consists of federally rehabilitated constructed facilities,diversion dams,canals,drains,and levees.the other major water project in the valley,the san project the san,imports water from the colorado river basin to the rio grande basin.see rio grande silvery minnow keys minnow ii,cir,vacated as moot,cir.

procedural history 
on november,the environmental groups filed an esa citizen suit seeking both injunctive and declaratory relief,in part,for reclamation and the army corps of engineers the corps failure to fully consult with the fws pursuant to a of the esa prior to issuing an october biological assessment.the environmental groups contended that reclamation and the corps possessed significant discretion over virtually all aspects of their funding and operation of the project,and therefore they must consult with the fws on all of these actions.at.the suit prompted several contract water users,including the mrgcd and the state of new mexico,to intervene.
on june,the fws issued a biological opinion.as a result,the environmental groups filed a second amended complaint contesting the validity of the and again raising reclamation and the corps alleged failure to consult with the fws to the fullest extent of their discretionary authority.
on april,the district court affirmed the on substantive grounds,leaving the remainder of the environmental group claims for later resolution.on the procedural front,however,the district court concluded that reclamation retains sufficient discretion over its river management and operations in the middle rio grande,specifically water deliveries under the project and under the san,to require reclamation to consult over those actions under section a of the esa.id.at.we subsequently dismissed the intervenors appeal of the april order for lack of standing and dismissed the federal agencies appeal because the order was not subject to interlocutory review.rio grande silvery minnow keys minnow i,app x,cir per curiam.
on september,the environmental groups sought emergency injunctive relief,alleging that a drought year was endangering the minnow and asking the court to order the federal defendants to meet the flow requirements of the on september,the fws issued a biological opinion in which it determined that,although reclamation operations in the valley were likely to jeopardize the minnow,there existed no reasonable and prudent alternative rpa to alleviate the jeopardy.
consequently,on september,the environmental groups filed a third amended complaint challenging the.they continued to press their allegation that reclamation failed to consult fully over all aspects of their middle rio grande water operations and related activities,the key elements of which included their decisions not to reduce water to the mrgcd and not to use san water for the benefit of the minnow.at.the environmental groups sought a declaration that both the and the were arbitrary and capricious,an order requiring the federal agencies to complete full consultation through issuance of a legally adequate biological opinion,and an order requiring the federal agencies to take all steps within their discretionary authority necessary to conserve the minnow.id.at.
in a september,memorandum opinion addressing the environmental groups motion for an injunction,the district court chided reclamation for having failed to timely reinitiate consultation despite the persistent historic drought and clear guidance that it had discretion to consult with the fws about limiting or reducing contract deliveries under the san and the project.id.at.because the fws could formulate no rpa that avoided jeopardy to the minnow,the district court determined that the was arbitrary and capricious.moreover,it concluded that reclamation was empowered to release san water to restrict future contract deliveries of both san and project water,and to restrict diversions by the mrgcd.an appeal ensued 
while the appeal was pending,the fws issued a march,biological opinion.the fws used a approach for purposes of determining the scope of the proposed federal action.id.at.that is,the fws,reclamation,the corps,and other interested parties consulted on the effects of total river depletions on listed species,without identifying particular aspects of the overall action as discretionary or.id.the fws concluded that the proposed actions would likely jeopardize the continued existence of the minnow.similarly,the fws analyzed the threat to the minnow and developed rpas based on biological needs of the species,independent of sources of water and discretionary authority.id.at.
in recognition of the district court prior orders and the pending appeal,however,reclamation proposed different measures it could use to avoid jeopardy to the minnow,depending on the ultimate determination of the scope of its discretion.under the first proposal,reclamation assumed that it had no discretion to limit contract deliveries to benefit the minnow and proposed a supplemental water program by which it would lease water from willing lessors to enhance river flows when necessary.under the second proposal,reclamation assumed that it had discretion to limit diversions,curtail water storage,and release stored water belonging to both contract users and the native american tribes and vowed to strive to allot shortages between all users.
meanwhile,in december,congress enacted a rider to the energy and water development appropriations act,stat,the minnow rider.the minnow rider placed san water beyond reclamation discretionary reach,stat.at.additionally,congress deemed conformity with the rpas and its as full compliance with the esa requirements for a period.id.at.congress enacted a second rider in,which extended the esa adequacy of the rpas and its through march.see consolidated appropriations act,stat,the minnow rider.finally,on november,congress amended the minnow rider and extended its coverage to include any amendments to the energy and water development appropriations act,b,stat,
following the issuance of the,the passage of the minnow rider,and our dismissal of the preliminary injunction appeal as moot,the environmental groups acknowledged that there is no further relief that can be issued at this time upon the existing claims in plaintiffs lawsuit.at.they sought dismissal but requested that the district court not vacate its prior orders.agreeing that the case was moot,the appellants urged vacatur.the environmental groups then sought to withdraw their motion to dismiss,claiming that their claim was not mooted by intervening events because the violation was likely to recur.
on november,although recognizing that congressional action mooted the environmental groups claims as to san water the district court rejected the contention that the environmental groups claim as to project water was moot.rather,the court determined that the fws issuance of the,and reclamation adoption of it,constituted a voluntary cessation with respect to reclamation failure to consider the alleged full scope of its discretionary authority.absent reclamation and the fws assurances that they would continue to operate under the discretionary option in the,the district court determined that they failed to meet their burden of establishing mootness.additionally,the district court entered a declaratory judgment requiring reclamation and the fws to consider,in future consultations,reclamation discretion to reallocate project contract water.finally,assuming arguendo that the case was moot,the court concluded that vacating its memorandum opinions and orders would not be appropriate and in the public interest.this appeal followed.

challenges to the and biological opinions are moot 
the appellants challenge the district court determination that the fws issuance of the did not moot the environmental groups claims to determine whether any claim remains for review,we must ascertain what type of relief the environmental groups seek,and whether we can,at this juncture,afford them meaningful relief see utah wilderness alliance smith,cir.
the environmental groups essentially contend that,since the minnow listing as endangered,and continuing to the date of the filing of the third amended complaint,reclamation has failed to fully consult.they prayed for a that the federal agencies are violating a by failing to consult on all discretionary aspects of the federal action,and for an injunction ordering full consultation.because only the and had been issued when the environmental groups filed their third amended complaint,we must therefore interpret their pleadings as directed at the and.the environmental groups allegations of legal wrongdoing must be grounded in a concrete and particularized factual context they are not subject to review as,ethereal grievances.see mining ass dep t of the interior,to determine whether anything remains of nma case,we need to identify which regulations nma challenged and whether the new rules altered those regulations.and only the and were extant targets for their allegations.
the problem for the environmental groups,however,is that neither the nor still exists.after the environmental groups filed their third amended complaint,the fws issued the,which superseded both of them.the establishes a new regulatory framework under which the propriety of reclamation actions must be judged.the environmental groups have not argued that the is a mirror image of the two biological opinions that it supplanted,nor could they.nor have they asserted that the changes are only superficial.conservation law found.evans,cir.
we must conclude that the fws issuance of the mooted the environmental groups prayer for both injunctive and declaratory relief.if we issued an injunction directing reclamation to consult concerning the biological opinions at issue in this litigation,it would have no effect in the real world because those biological opinions have been superseded.indeed,even as to the,a consultation injunction would be meaningless because the federal agencies already have consulted.an injunction ordering consultation using an expanded scope is no longer warranted.there is no point in ordering an action that has already taken place.utah wilderness alliance,at.
furthermore,any declaration that the and were insufficient due to reclamation failure to fully consult would be wholly without effect in the real world.the environmental groups insist that we are situated to provide some relief,especially declaratory relief regarding the scope of reclamation discretion in consultation.however,the environmental groups have not been able to point to some concrete ongoing injury.see cox,at t his court has explained that a plaintiff can not maintain a declaratory or injunctive action unless he or she can demonstrate a good chance of being likewise injured by the defendant in the future.alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.as the regulations governing formal consultation,and reinitiation of formal consultation,demonstrate,the duty to consult is not itself an ongoing agency action subject to challenge.see sierra club yeutter,cir once an agency submits a plan that has been agreed to through the section consultation process,the court then,applying the arbitrary and capricious standard of review,must approve or disapprove it.in other words,the environmental groups can not challenge the scope of consultation untethered from the federal agencies efforts to develop a biological opinion.the consultation process culminates in the issuance of a biological opinion water keeper alliance,at.and,in this case,that biological opinion has now been issued,the.
the environmental groups concerns about whether reclamation will appropriately consult with the fws in response to changing conditions are far too speculative to support a claim for declaratory relief.any such relief would amount to an advisory opinion regarding the scope of reclamation discretion and such an opinion would clearly be improper.see utah wilderness alliance,at suwa has not shown that the defendants are likely to violate section a in the near future.see also ctr.for biological diversity lohn,cir concluding that a claim for declaratory relief regarding allegedly improper regulatory policy was mooted by governmental agency listing of killer whale species as endangered,which was ultimate objective of environmental advocacy appellants the fact that agency employed the allegedly improper policy in effecting the listing did not alter the mootness calculus because it was too speculative that this policy in the future might adversely affect listed species or affect other killer whale species or.natural desert ass u.forest,wl,at,plaintiffs also argue that declaratory relief would be helpful to ensure that the new biop complies with the law and does so in a timely manner and that declaratory relief would clarify and settle defendants legal obligations.i agree with defendants,however,such justifications are so vague as to make article iii case or controversy requirement meaningless.courts should not micromanage an agency procedures under the guise of judicial review.
we addressed an analogous situation in wyoming.there the state of wyoming successfully brought a nepa challenge before the district court against a rule of the forest service,commonly known as the roadless rule,that generally prohibited road construction in inventoried roadless areas on national forest system lands.at.during the pendency of the appeal by certain environmental group,the forest service issued a final rule that replaced the roadless rule,and we concluded that the new rule has mooted the issues in th e case and dismissed the appeal.id.in particular,we noted that t he portions of the roadless rule that were substantively challenged by wyoming no longer exist.id.at.furthermore,we reasoned that the alleged procedural deficiencies of the roadless rule are now irrelevant because the replacement rule was promulgated in a new and separate rulemaking process.id.as in wyoming,to the extent that the environmental groups seek a declaration that the and are legally infirm due to reclamation failure to consult using the full scope of its discretion,we are not situated to issue a present determination with effect because those regulations no longer are all material purposes,they no longer exist.and,because of that fact,we likewise are not situated to cure any purported procedural irregularities in reclamation consultation behavior concerning those opinions.thus,the environmental groups claims are moot.see also.vehicle coal.forest,cir plaintiff challenge to the decision notice and its request for declaratory and injunctive relief is moot.the routt forest plan and its accompanying vehicle use policy now governs the routt national forest making plaintiff attack on the decision notice futile.emphasis added camfield city of.city,cir because parties have no legally cognizable interest in the constitutional validity of an obsolete statute,a statutory amendment moots a case to the extent that it removes challenged features of the prior law.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
on these facts,cases of our sister circuits also are instructive.for example,in american rivers national marine fisheries service,the ninth circuit summarized plaintiffs challenge as follows 
the plaintiffs alleged that the biological opinion issued by the national marine fisheries service violated a of the esa.specifically,american rivers contended that the federal defendants violated the esa by relying on the transportation of snake river smolts to conclude that the operations of the river power system are unlikely to jeopardize the continued existence of the listed salmon.
cir footnote omitted.however,during the course of the litigation,the national marine fisheries service issued a new biological opinion biological opinion which superseded the challenged biological opinion.id.at.with little difficulty,the ninth circuit concluded that plaintiffs action was moot.id.at t he biological opinion in the present case has been superseded by the biological opinion.therefore,any challenge to the biological opinion is moot.
the circuit reached a similar conclusion in national mining ass n.at issue there was the validity of several federal regulatory requirements imposed on permit applicants,and the procedures for contesting the accuracy of information used to determine permit eligibility.at.the permits were issued under the surface mining reclamation and control act,et,and its implementing regulations no one could engage in surface coal mining without such a permit.id.after oral argument,the interior department revised the regulations that governed some of the challenged regulatory requirements and procedures and,consequently,the circuit was faced with additional questions concerning the extent to which the case is now moot.id.
after identifying the regulations that were the subject of appellant challenge,the circuit determined that the interior department revisions to those regulations rendered appellant attack upon them moot.id.at.in particular,the circuit stressed that the revisions effected substantial changes to the previously existing regulatory regime,thus altering the conditions and eliminating the possibility of meaningful relief.id.at.the court noted the old set of rules,which are the subject of this lawsuit,can not be evaluated as if nothing has changed.a new system is now in place.id.accordingly,the circuit determined that the revisions mooted appellant challenge.see also forest guardians forest,cir holding esa and claims moot when challenged permits were issued pursuant to superseded biological opinion ramsey kantor,cir holding that the same rule of mootness applies where an agency would no longer be relying on the particular biological opinion that was being challenged,but rather upon a new opinion,and where an agency will be basing its ruling on different criteria or factors in the future.
the relevant case law thus strongly counsels in favor of a conclusion of mootness here.due to the fws issuance of the,we can provide no effective relief.the environmental groups did not challenge the,and it currently governs reclamation disposition of the water at issue.that has altered the parameters within which reclamation operates,creating a new regulatory context for assessing its compliance with its esa obligations.
the environmental groups reliance on the ninth circuit decision in forest guardians johanns is unavailing.in that case,the forest service and the fws engaged in comprehensive management and monitoring of lands used for grazing that ultimately allowed the forest service to presume that the fws concurred each year in a finding for parcels of land covered by its plan.johanns,at.when the forest service did not comply with the management and monitoring requirements,the plaintiff brought suit claiming that consultation should be reinitiated.see id.at.the forest service then reinitiated consultation and subsequently received the fws concurrence in its finding.id.at.
in holding that the forest service subsequent reinitiation of consultation did not moot the plaintiff claims,the court distinguished our decision in southern utah wilderness alliance.the court observed that the monitoring requirements were action that would extend through the lease term.id.at.additionally,the court determined that the forest service was likely to continue its practice of not complying with the monitoring requirements,especially because it argued that compliance was not required.id.the court,therefore,determined that a d eclaratory judgment in favor of forest guardians would thus ensure that the forest service does not continue to fail to meet its monitoring responsibilities in the future and that it fulfills its duty under the esa to consult with fws when necessary.id.consequently,the court concluded that,although the plaintiff request for an injunction was mooted by reinitiation of consultation,a declaratory judgment would,nevertheless,provide relief.id.at.
the absence of an esa violation makes this case distinguishable from johanns and more akin to southern utah wilderness alliance.see utah wilderness alliance,at finding plaintiff claim,seeking declaratory judgment for the bureau of land management alleged failure to consult with the fws as required by a,moot when agencies subsequently completed informal consultation.unlike the forest service in johanns,reclamation is not currently engaged in the same behavior that was the subject of the environmental groups objections.instead,the fws issued a superseding with which reclamation is complying.thus,we are constrained to conclude that the issuance of the mooted the environmental groups claim under the esa.
voluntary cessation 
the environmental groups argue,and the district court held,that the claim was not mooted by the issuance of the because reclamation voluntarily ceased the alleged objectionable behavior.we disagree.
one exception to a claim of mootness is a defendant voluntary cessation of an alleged illegal practice which the defendant is free to resume at any time.chihuahuan grasslands alliance kempthorne,cir.the rule that voluntary cessation of a challenged practice rarely moots a federal case traces to the principle that a party should not be able to evade judicial review,or to defeat a judgment,by temporarily altering questionable behavior.unified sch.dist,at quoting city news novelty,city of waukesha,d.in other words,this exception exists to counteract the possibility of a defendant ceasing illegal action long enough to render a lawsuit moot and then resuming the illegal conduct.chihuahuan grasslands alliance,at.
voluntary actions may,nevertheless,moot litigation if two conditions are satisfied it can be said with assurance that there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur,and interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.county of los angeles davis,d internal quotation marks,elipses,and citations omitted.v oluntary cessation of offensive conduct will only moot litigation if it is clear that the defendant has not changed course simply to deprive the court of jurisdiction.adver.city of miami,cir per curiam.the party asserting mootness bears the heavy burden of persua ding the court that the challenged conduct can not reasonably be expected to start up again.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d alteration in original quoting united states concentrated phosphate exp.ass n,d.
in practice,however,laidlaw heavy burden frequently has not prevented governmental officials from discontinuing challenged practices and mooting a case thus,even when a legislative body has the power to an ordinance or statute,ordinarily an amendment or repeal of it moots a case challenging the ordinance or statute.see camfield,at see also native vill.of noatak blatchford,cir a statutory change,however,is usually enough to render a case moot,even if the legislature possesses the power to reenact the statute after the lawsuit is dismissed.as a general rule,if a challenged law is repealed or expires,the case becomes moot.wright,miller cooper,supra note,at the legislative rules established by statute or administrative regulation may shift as an action progresses.ordinarily courts respond by applying the law in force at the time of decision mootness may result because the change has removed any basis for a claim,or has fully satisfied the claim.emphasis added wright,miller cooper,supra note,at repeal likewise moots attacks on a statute.indeed,in this governmental context,m ost cases that deny mootness rely on clear showings of reluctant submission by governmental actors and a desire to return to the old ways.wright,miller cooper,supra note,at emphasis added.more specifically,when a legislature repeals or amends a statute after it is judicially challenged,we have concluded that the exception has no application where there is no evidence in the record to indicate that the legislature intends to reenact the prior version of the disputed statute.camfield,at.in camfield,we distinguished the supreme court decision in city of mesquite aladdin castle,d,where the court determined that the action was not moot,by noting that aladdin castle preclud es a mootness determination in cases challenging a prior version of a state statute only when the legislature has openly expressed its intent to reenact the challenged law.id.

guided by these principles,we proceed to apply the test of county of los angeles here.we conclude that the district court erred in applying the exception to the mootness doctrine in this case.our de novo review of the record convinces us that the appellants have met their burden of establishing mootness.
the first part of the test requires us to inquire whether we can say with assurance that there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur.county of los angeles,at.our review of the record assures us that,in light of intervening events,there is no reasonable expectation that reclamation will revert to using the same consulting process which resulted in the and although the district court september,order no doubt played a role in the fws issuance of the,the absence of evidence here that the federal agencies used the issuance of the new merely to defeat the district court jurisdiction weakens the implication that they manipulated the system.see chihuahuan grasslands alliance,at nothing in the record presented to us indicates the blm termination of the leases at issue constitutes a voluntary cessation of illegal conduct made in an effort to evade judicial review or avoid judgment by temporarily altering questionable behavior.sossamon,at we will not require some physical or logical impossibility that the challenged policy will be reenacted absent evidence that the voluntary cessation is a sham for continuing possibly unlawful conduct.see also wright,miller cooper,supra note,at noting that although governmental defendants might take action as a direct response to litigation,a t any rate,again provides a secure foundation for mootness so long as it seems genuine save greers ferry lake,dep t of,cir w hile the district court preliminary injunction clearly had the salutary effect of prompting the corps to reevaluate its issuance of the fonsi finding of no significant impact,withdraw the smp shoreline management plan,and decide to prepare an eis environmental impact statement,the injunction can not continue in effect insofar as it purports to adjudicate the present or future legality of the withdrawn smp and to order an eis for the smp.
moreover,we are not here presented with a mere informal promise or assurance on the part of the governmental defendants that the challenged practice will cease.burbank,at see also wright,miller cooper,supra note,at noting that a conclusion of mootness ordinarily does not follow announcement of an intention to change or adoption of a plan to work toward lawful behavior.instead,the fws took the concrete step in of issuing a new biological opinion.this superseded and rendered obsolete the two biological opinions that provided the framework for the environmental groups challenge to reclamation scope of discretion.this established a new regulatory context for assessing the propriety of reclamation conduct under the esa.therefore,there is no reasonable expectation that reclamation actions could give rise to the issue in the same or essentially the same manner that gave rise to the environmental groups challenge.see county of los angeles,at concluding that use of unvalidated civil service exam unlikely to recur because,following commencement of litigation,city instituted new method of screening job applicants and increasing minority representation in fire department.
we do recognize that reclamation has not abandoned its narrow view of the scope of its discretion specifically,reclamation provided for an option to achieve the rpas that was consistent with its narrow view and contrary to the district court rulings concerning the scope of its discretion.however,even if reclamation reservation of this option suggests some possibility that it would revert to its narrow view should it avoid the precedential effects of the district court,for example,a mootness determination and possibility likely would not be sufficient to warrant application of the exception.see.hosp.ass n,at noting that the mere possibility that an agency might rescind amendments to its actions or regulations does not enliven a moot controversy.moreover,even if we accorded that possibility some persuasive force on the question,we would recognize that if the issue does arise again it would be in a different regulatory context than that challenged by the environmental groups,the and.consequently,the precise issue that was the subject of the environmental groups action is no longer extant,and it would not be reasonably likely to recur through reclamation actions.see unified sch.dist,at t he allegedly wrongful behavior in this case is highly,rather than conduct that is likely to recur on similar facts and in the same context.in such a case,the voluntary cessation doctrine is inapplicable,because our review of future instances of wrongful behavior may be quite different than the example that already has ceased.
moreover,significantly,the change effected by the is likely to be rather lengthy in duration.see burbank,at noting that the court was not faced with a situation where the order is of brief duration and the plaintiff may well be again confronted with the challenged conduct when the order terminates see also wright,miller cooper,supra note,at noting that t emporary compliance with a decree pending appeal,for example,clearly should not moot a case.as noted,through congress enactment of the minnow riders,the esa adequacy of the rpas and its has been assured until march.under these circumstances,it is unlikely that the reclamation would give up the protective shield constructed by the minnow riders during the period and revert to substantially the same discretionary approach that it followed in the and in consulting concerning a new biological opinion.
the district court expressly concluded that the minnow riders did not militate against application of the exception.significantly,however,in reaching this conclusion,the district court apparently did not consider the amendment to the minnow rider that had been enacted only three days before its ruling.tellingly,the district court stated 
movants federal agencies have failed to establish that it is absolutely clear that they would not return to their wrongful use of an impermissibly narrow and limited scope of discretion in future esa consultations.the minnow rider is conditional it protects the bo only if the federal agencies comply with the its and rpa,and only to the extent that the bo is not amended.it is virtually a certainty that there will be more esa consultations in the near future over water operations in the middle rio grande all the considerations that affect water operation decisions on minnow survival such as climate,water availability,the understanding of minnow biology,and so forth,are subject to change,meaning the issue of the scope of discretion is likely to recur.
at emphasis added.the district court application of the exception therefore appears to have been grounded on a false,that the minnow riders would ensure that reclamation actions pursuant to the comported with the esa only so long as the was not amended.in fact,even through a series of amendments to the over the life span of the minnow riders,reclamation conduct can still remain insulated from esa attack,so long as it conforms to that.in sum,county of los angeles first inquiry does not support a conclusion of voluntary cessation.
the second part of the county of los angeles test requires little discussion here.under that part,we examine whether interim events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.at.after undertaking this inquiry,we can identify no lingering effects from the federal agencies alleged violations of the esa in connection with the issuance of the and biological opinions.as discussed at length supra part ii a,any injury inflicted upon the environmental groups by reclamation purported failure to consult to the full scope of its discretion in connection with the and biological opinions can not be said to have survived the issuance of the,which superseded and replaced those opinions.
in bolstering its case against mootness,the environmental groups contend the issue is still significant and has a impact on reclamation ability to effectively comply with the flow requirements of the see aplees.br.at the extent of the bureau authority to alter operations of el vado dam or the mrg project diversion dams affects the success of its efforts every day to comply with the flow requirements of the bo.if the bureau has broad discretion to control water operations,it is also more likely to be able to purchase necessary water,because water rights holders will know that,one way or another,the bureau will have to obtain enough water to avoid jeopardy.however,as the federal agencies correctly note,the environmental groups have not filed a claim or sought relief with respect to reclamation activities in complying with the and ordinarily it would not be appropriate for a federal court to be in the business of monitoring such compliance activities in any event.see norton utah wilderness alliance,d the prospect of pervasive oversight by federal courts over the manner and pace of agency compliance with such broad congressional directives is not contemplated by the apa.see also fund for animals,bureau of land.
in sum,we simply are unable to conclude that the fws issuance of the,and reclamation adoption of it,provide the appropriate foundation for application of the exception of the mootness doctrine.accordingly,this litigation is moot with regard to the claim,and the district court erred in denying the appellants motions to dismiss the action for lack of jurisdiction.

the dissent contends that we have incorrectly applied a de novo standard of review to the exception to the mootness doctrine.dissent at.in particular,the dissent asserts that we should review the district court determination as to the effect of the federal agencies voluntary cessation of allegedly illegal activities under the more deferential abuse of discretion standard.id.at emphasis added.this standard leads the dissent to conclude regarding the issue of recurrence,the first part of the county of los angeles test that we must agree with the district court and assume that the federal agencies may sidestep their practices.id.at.likewise,the dissent is guided by this deferential standard in resolving the question of whether interim events have comprehensively and irrevocably eliminated the effects of the alleged violation,the second part of the county of los angeles test.indicative of this deference,the dissent states that it conclude s that the district court acted quite reasonably when it determined that the federal agencies can not show that the effects of the esa violation have been completely and irrevocably eradicated.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.however,we must disagree with our thoughtful colleague in dissent.in particular,we respectfully submit that the dissent objection to the standard of review is misguided.it apparently overlooks the critical distinction between constitutional mootness and prudential the former kind of mootness is at issue here.
courts recognize two kinds of mootness constitutional mootness and prudential mootness.see,united states grant.fletcher united states,cir utah wilderness alliance,at constr.dep t rockwell int l,cir new mexico ex rel.state highway dep t goldschmidt,cir see also chamber of commerce dep t of energy,per curiam the doctrine of mootness has two distinct branches.charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,at ed.under the doctrine,a federal court has jurisdiction over only cases and controversies.const.art.iii,cl.a n actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review,not merely at the time the complaint is filed.arizonans for official english arizona,d internal quotation marks omitted.
even if a case is not constitutionally moot,a court may dismiss the case under the doctrine if the case is so attenuated that considerations of prudence and comity for coordinate branches of government counsel the court to stay its hand,and to withhold relief it has the power to grant.fletcher,at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted utah wilderness alliance,at stating that p rudential mootness addresses not the power to grant relief but the court discretion in the exercise of that power emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.p rudential mootness arises out of the court general discretion in formulating prospective equitable remedies constr.dep t,at see chamber of commerce,at the cousin of the mootness doctrine,in its strict article iii sense,is a melange of doctrines relating to the court discretion in matters of remedy and judicial administration.this doctrine generally applies only to requests for injunctive or declaratory relief.constr.dep t,at all the cases in which the prudential mootness concept has been applied have involved a request for prospective equitable relief by declaratory judgment or injunction.see fletcher,at utah wilderness alliance,at.
a evaluation may be an important component of the overall analysis with respect to both constitutional and prudential mootness.under both article iii and prudential mootness doctrines,the central inquiry is essentially the same have circumstances changed since the beginning of litigation that forestall any occasion for meaningful relief.utah wilderness alliance,at.under both mootness doctrines,courts must assess the likelihood that defendants will recommence the challenged,allegedly offensive conduct.compare chihuahuan grasslands alliance,at noting in the constitutional context that this exception exists to counteract the possibility of a defendant ceasing illegal action long enough to render a lawsuit moot and then resuming the illegal conduct,with fletcher,at noting as to prudential mootness that a court may refuse to grant relief where it appears that a change of circumstances renders it highly unlikely that the actions in question will be repeated,and constr.dep t,at noting that,in cases involving prudential mootness,a court may decline to grant declaratory or injunctive relief where it appears that a defendant,usually the government,has already changed or is in the process of changing its policies or where it appears that any repeat of the actions in question is otherwise highly unlikely.
although we engage in similar factual inquiries to ascertain constitutional and prudential mootness,different standards of review apply to these doctrines.the constitutional mootness question is a threshold inquiry because a live case or controversy is a constitutional prerequisite to federal jurisdiction.our review of this question is de novo.fletcher,at citation omitted see also sample johnson,cir we apply a de novo standard for reviewing a district court decision on subject matter jurisdiction,and,concomitantly apply that standard in reviewing questions of mootness.citation omitted.by contrast,we review the district court determination of prudential mootness for an abuse of discretion because this doctrine is concerned with the court discretion to exercise its power to provide relief.fletcher,at emphasis added.as a component of the mootness analysis,it naturally and ineluctably follows that the inquiry will be subject to the same standard of review as the overarching mootness question at constitutional or prudential.compare unified sch.dist,at tacitly applying de novo standard of review to contention of voluntary cessation in the context,with comm.for the first amendment campbell,cir explicitly applying standard of review to assertion of voluntary cessation in the context.
in this case,we apply a de novo standard of review because the case presents a question of constitutional mootness.if we had concluded that the environmental group esa claims survived this inquiry,it might well have been appropriate to conduct a analysis,given that the environmental groups seek only injunctive and declaratory relief,constr.dep t,at.however,we need not reach this issue or definitively opine on it,because we have determined that the environmental groups esa claims are constitutionally moot.
the dissent mistakenly applies the ordinarily is associated with the the question of constitutional mootness in this case.to support the application of an standard,the dissent primarily relies on the supreme court opinion in grant the tenth circuit opinion in committee for the first amendment campbell and opinions from other circuits dissent at.the dissent reliance is misplaced.despite its arguments,grant and committee for the first amendment actually are quite consistent with our opinion.the cases from the other circuits,moreover,are contrary to our precedent and otherwise unpersuasive.
in grant,the supreme court established the dual analysis of constitutional and prudential mootness.at.based upon our analysis below,we must respectfully conclude that the dissent has misguidedly relied upon grant analysis related to prudential mootness in arguing for use of an standard in this only constitutional mootness is at issue.under the doctrine,the court held in grant that the defendants had not carried their heavy burden of showing that their voluntary cessation of illegal interlocking corporate directorates rendered the case moot.id.at.although the defendants indicated that the interlocking corporate directorates no longer existed and disclaimed any intention to revive them,the court reviewed the issue de novo and determined that this averment was insufficient to render the case moot.id.such a profession as offered by defendants does not suffice to make a case moot although it is one of the factors to be considered in determining the appropriateness of granting an injunction against the acts.id.at douglas,dissenting suggesting that the ruling of the district court was now conceded by the majority to be erroneous.
once the court rejected the claim,it considered prudential mootness.id.at.it was in this context that the court in grant used the language relied upon by the dissent,which noted the obligation of the government,as plaintiff,to demonstrate that there was no reasonable basis for the district judge decision.id.at see dissent at quoting from grant,at.more directly,under the doctrine,the court held that the government had not carried its burden of showing that the district court had abused its discretion in dismissing the case.see grant,at id.at we conclude that,although the actions were not moot,no abuse of discretion has been demonstrated in the trial court refusal to award injunctive relief.emphasis added.
to be sure,the court in grant did not expressly label the different mootness doctrines.however,the opinion language nonetheless clearly indicates that the court applied two different mootness different standards of undertaking the inquiry.commentators have explicitly noted the distinct constitutional and prudential components of grant mootness analysis.see wright,miller cooper,supra,at discussing the court resolution of the question and noting that grant is t he most important single illustration of the remedial doctrines,principles of prudential mootness.and we have recognized expressly the dimension of grant analysis.see constr.dep t,at noting the supreme court original formulation of the test for prudential mootness in grant see also goldschmidt,at citing grant in discussing approvingly the proposition that even if some remnant of the original controversy be still alive,this is an instance where the courts,as a matter of prudence and sound discretion,should stay their hand and withhold drastic injunctive relief.
thus,we need not quarrel with the dissent contention that the court applied the standard of review in grant.the problem for the dissent,however,is that the court applied this standard with respect to a mootness doctrine that is not germane to the resolution of this is,the doctrine.therefore,we respectfully submit that the dissent reliance on grant in objecting to the application here of the de novo standard of review is misplaced at issue here is constitutional mootness and that standard of review is appropriate.see,chihuahuan grasslands alliance,at unified sch.dist,at.
for similar reasons,the dissent hardly fares better with its objection by relying on our decision in committee for the first amendment.at bottom,that case involves application of the doctrine consequently,it was entirely appropriate for the court to apply an standard of review.in committee for the first amendment,plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive and later monetary relief against various defendants in response to a decision by the board of regents regents of oklahoma state university osu suspending the showing of the last temptation of christ.at footnote omitted.the film was shown on the scheduled dates and,during the course of the litigation,the university adopted a new policy concerning use of university facilities for expressive purposes including the showing of movies,which we noted effected major changes from the policy that plaintiffs initially challenged.id.at.
the district court concluded that plaintiffs claim for prospective relief,declaratory and injunctive relief was moot.id.at.in providing background on the subject of mootness,we did briefly cite to cases associated with the doctrine,such as county of los angeles,and we noted their holdings.see id.at.however,when assessing the viability of plaintiffs specific claim for prospective relief,we clearly were focused on the issue of.this is evident in our heavy reliance from the outset to the end of our mootness analysis on t he most important single illustration,wright,miller cooper,supra,at,of the is,grant.compare comm.for the first amendment,at quoting in the first paragraph of the opinion from grant analysis,which notes that the quantum of contrition that should be expected from an offender ceasing challenged activity is a question better addressed to the discretion of the trial court quoting grant,u.at,with id.at in the final paragraphs of its mootness analysis,quoting from grant discussion,noting that plaintiffs simply have not met their burden with respect to some cognizable danger of recurrent violations.quoting grant,at.
more specifically,in committee for the first amendment,we set forth the test from grant and indicated that we would review the district court mootness ruling for an abuse of discretion.id.at.regarding whether the inquiry was one of prudential mootness,it is telling that we assessed whether the district court could have reasonably concluded in exercising its general discretion in formulating prospective equitable remedies,constr.dep t,at,that providing prospective relief here was not appropriate,by actually examining ourselves the contours of the specific relief sought by plaintiffs.see comm.for the first amendment,at what plaintiffs seek is an injunction framed no more narrowly than requiring the defendants to follow the first amendment concerning future activities of every sort.no specific facts anchor such a command rendering enforcement problematic in a university environment where hundreds of decisions concerning extracurricular use of facilities are made every academic year.in other words,our focus was on the district court exercise of discretion in fashioning equitable remedies and not on whether there was a n actual controversy.arizonans for official english,at internal quotation marks omitted.we concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion insofar as it determined that plaintiffs request for injunctive relief was moot.comm.for the first amendment,at see id.at.
thus,the flaw in the dissent reliance on committee for the first case predicated on grant be readily apparent this is not a case.accordingly,as with grant,we have no basis to attack the dissent contention that committee for the first amendment applied an standard of review.but it did so with regard to a mootness doctrine that is not at issue mootness.with respect to the mootness doctrine that is at issue,our case law is standard of review is de novo,fletcher,at.
finally,the dissent looks to cases from the seventh and second circuits for support.dissent at citing kikumura turner,cir harrison burrowes bridge constructors,cuomo,cir.these cases,however,are unpersuasive and do not square with our own precedent such as fletcher,which recognizes the distinction regarding the applicable standard of review between the doctrines of constitutional and prudential mootness and,more specifically,holds that only in the case of prudential mootness do we apply an standard of review,because in such a case we are concerned with the district court discretion to exercise its power to provide relief.fletcher,at id.the constitutional mootness question is a threshold inquiry because a live case or controversy is a constitutional prerequisite to federal jurisdiction.our review of this question is de novo.citation omitted.in kikumura,the seventh circuit appears to have fallen victim to the same mistake that we respectfully have attributed to the the analysis of grant co.onto a case involving constitutional mootness.for example,in a mootness discussion that cites to grant,the seventh circuit states that d etermining whether an official voluntary cessation from engaging in conduct challenged as unconstitutional renders a case moot calls for an exercise of judicial discretion.kikumura,at.
kikumura may be at odds with other seventh circuit cases,which appear not to have made the same mistake,but instead have recognized that the the subsidiary question of voluntary the jurisdiction of federal courts and is reviewed de novo.in federation of advertising industry representatives,city of chicago,for example,the seventh circuit reviewed de novo the question of whether to apply the exception to a issue,cir.in that context,the seventh circuit stated whether a case has been rendered moot is a question of law that we review de novo a question of mootness arises when,as here,a challenged ordinance is repealed during the pendency of litigation,and a plaintiff seeks only prospective relief.id.at citations omitted see walsh dep t of veterans affairs,cir noting that w e review the district court decision entering summary judgment on mootness grounds de novo,and proceeding to address the specific question of voluntary cessation de novo evers astrue,cir this case begins and ends with our determination of jurisdiction w e review a district court dismissal on mootness grounds de novo.citations omitted john united church of christ city of chicago,cir we review de novo the district court grant of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b,which includes a dismissal on mootness grounds.irrespective of whether kikumura is inconsistent with seventh circuit precedent,however,insofar as kikumura calls for the application of an standard of review to the question of constitutional mootness it is inconsistent with our precedent,and we accordingly decline to follow it.
for somewhat similar reasons,the second circuit decision in harrison burrowes bridge constructors is contrary to our precedent and unpersuasive.there,like the kikimura court,the second circuit mistakenly relied upon the language of grant concerning prudential mootness,in announcing the standard of review for a question of constitutional mootness.harrison burrowes bridge constructors,at.the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the state minority business program.id.at.the state passage of an emergency regulation that suspended enforcement of the program goals presented an issue of voluntary cessation to the district court.id.at.the district court ruled that the state action mooted the plaintiffs claim for declaratory and injunctive relief.id.at.citing grant,the second circuit concluded that an standard of review was appropriately applied to the district court ruling,and it determined that t he district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing plaintiffs complaints as moot because the emergency regulation suspends application of the minority enterprise goals on contracts.id.
harrison burrowes bridge constructors is contrary to our precedent mistaken reliance on the analysis of grant applies an standard,rather than a de novo standard,to a question of constitutional mootness.moreover,even if its application here was not barred by our precedent,we would be wary of adopting the rule of harrison burrowes bridge constructors.at least one second circuit case has intimated that the standard articulated in harrison burrowes bridge constructors is limited to the context of voluntary cessation.see irish lesbian gay org.giuliani,cir the defendants here have not voluntarily agreed to cease enforcing section against plaintiff or to grant plaintiff permit requests in the future.therefore,the standard does not apply and we review the district court determination of mootness under the customary de novo standard.however,the supreme court has clearly held that voluntary cessation is part and parcel of the analysis and can result in a finding that an action or claim is moot.see city of los angeles,at.accordingly,voluntary cessation implicates the jurisdiction of federal courts,and our circuit and also the second circuit have recognized that those involving reviewed de novo.compare fletcher,at the constitutional mootness question is a threshold inquiry because a live case or controversy is a constitutional prerequisite to federal jurisdiction.our review of this question is de novo.citation omitted,with lamar adver.of penn,llc town of orchard park,cir t he condition of mootness is not a defense that could be waived by a defendant,but rather is a condition that deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction.alterations in original and internal quotation marks omitted and united states new york city transit,cir a ruling that a case is not moot is reviewed de novo.this case is not moot unless no reasonable expectation remains that the policy will be reinstituted.in sum,we respectfully conclude that the dissent reliance on harrison burrowes bridge constructors is misplaced.the case is contrary to our precedent and otherwise unpersuasive.
for the foregoing reasons,we must disagree with our thoughtful colleague in dissent concerning the standard of review that is applicable to the mootness question in this case.we thus proceed to the issue of vacatur.
because the district court was without jurisdiction,and thus without the power to enter the november judgment,that judgment must be vacated however,the appellants also have challenged the district court denial of their motions to vacate the district court orders.thus,we must also consider whether the circumstances under which this case became moot require us to vacate those orders of the district court.we review the district court denial of a motion to vacate for abuse of discretion.see amoco oil envtl.prot.agency,cir.
whether any opinion should be vacated on the basis of mootness is an equitable question.minnow iii,at citing bancorp mortgage bonner mall,d thus,we consider the nature and character of the conditions which have caused the case to become moot.bancorp mortgage,at quoting united states gesellschaft.in general,w hen a case becomes moot on appeal,the ordinary course is to vacate the judgment below and remand with directions to dismiss.judicial review stout,cir.this is because a party who seeks review of the merits of an adverse ruling,but is frustrated by the vagaries of circumstance,ought not in fairness be forced to acquiesce in the judgment.u.bancorp mortgage,at.consequently,it is frequently appropriate for an appellate court to vacate the judgment below when mootness results from happenstance or the actions of the prevailing party.wyoming,at.
on the other hand,if the party seeking vacatur has caused mootness,generally we do not order vacatur.minnow iii,at see also amoco oil,at we have recognized that granting vacatur to a party who both causes mootness and pursues dismissal based on mootness serves only the interests of that party.solid waste dep t mechs.city of albuquerque,cir the city both caused mootness and sought dismissal on the basis of mootness,and now requests a de facto reversal on the claim that it has abandoned.this use of the mootness doctrine does not appear to serve any interest other than the city own.
however,in mcclendon,where we ordered vacatur,we stressed that the appropriateness of vacatur must be determined on the basis of the particular circumstances.at internal quotation marks omitted see also black police ass district of columbia,noting this mcclendon emphasis on particular circumstances and concluding that it suggest s that the tenth circuit decision in solid waste department mechanics should be viewed as simply a specific instance where refusing vacatur served the public interest and not as establishing a general rule against vacatur where mootness results from voluntary governmental action.in mcclendon,the parties entered a settlement agreement designed to reduce inmate crowding in a detention center.at.approximately six months later,the defendants informed the court that population caps in the settlement agreement had been exceeded.id.at.after several hearings,the defendants appealed certain portions of the district court orders regarding court inspection of temporary housing.id.at.while the case was on appeal,the defendants succeeded in fully complying with the settlement agreement.id.at.
we determined that,not only did the defendants compliance with the settlement agreement moot the appeal,but that portions of the district court orders relating to the inspections should be vacated.id.at.compliance with the settlement agreement did not constitute manipulation of the judicial process by deliberately aborting appellate review to avoid a decision on the issues.rather,defendants conduct in complying with the settlement agreement constitutes responsible governmental conduct to be commended.id.
turning now to the district court ruling,the court predicated its vacatur ruling on the assumption that the case was moot.the court then proceeded to analyze whether vacating its orders was appropriate and in the public interest and ruled that vacatur relief should not be granted.the district court determined that neither issuance of the nor legislative enactment of the minnow rider could fairly be described as happenstance.at.the court further observed that the appellants intended to manipulate the judicial process by lobbying congress for passage of the minnow riders.id.at.moreover,in weighing whether the public interest supported vacatur,the court noted the possible guidance that its orders could provide in addressing similar esa issues if the issue arises again in litigation in connection with this or other endangered species in the middle rio grande system or elsewhere,this court factual and legal analysis may provide a baseline to inform the debate,even though this court decisions are not binding precedent for other courts.id.at.lastly,the court also noted that a n additional reason for denying the vacatur motions is to make clear to the public that nothing improper motivated the district court discretion decision.id.at.in that regard,the court expressed concerns regarding critical comments of certain state and local new mexico governmental officials,which had been reported in the media.the court feared that the comments might lead the public to believe that the court had engaged in misconduct in performing its judicial duties and that the court rulings concerning the issue were something other than principled judicial interpretations of the law on difficult issues.id.
as to this last point,we strongly reject any suggestion that the esteemed and able district court judge in this case has discharged his responsibilities with anything other than the highest levels of integrity and impartiality and are especially troubled insofar as such suggestions have emanated from the ranks of new mexico governmental officials who should be aware of the weight their words tend to carry in the public mind.however,we are ultimately constrained to conclude that the district court abused its discretion in declining to vacate its earlier orders.
to begin,our resolution of the mootness issue necessarily impacts our examination of where the equities lie in this case.minnow iii,at.we have already determined that the record did not support the view that the fws issuance of the and reclamation adoption of that and its rpas stemmed from an objective to manipulate the judicial process by depriving the district court of jurisdiction.mcclendon,at.and we reached that conclusion even after acknowledging that the federal agencies actions were in part in direct response to the district court rulings,rather than the product of a decision to change regulatory direction.therefore,we would not consider it to be reasonable to the district court apparently the federal agencies voluntary actions in connection with the should weigh against them and militate against vacatur.
indeed,with reference to mcclendon,the district court here described the issuance of the as commendable governmental conduct but was concerned by what it called the hedge that is,reclamation reservation of the option of complying with the rpas under its narrow view of its view that the district court had rejected.at.however,as we have discussed in addressing voluntary cessation,reclamation reservation of the option of employing its narrow view of its discretion does not,under the unique circumstances of this case,make it significantly likely that it will revert to the precise approach toward the exercise of its discretion that the environmental groups challenged in the and and that the district court rejected.therefore,we would not consider it to be reasonable to impute to the federal agencies,by virtue of their issuance and adoption of the,a manipulative intent to divest the district court of jurisdiction and to rid themselves of the district court rulings regarding the that were rendered in the context of the superseded biological opinions.consequently,to the extent that the district court vacatur decision was predicated on an imputation of such manipulative intent,we conclude that its decision amounted to an abuse of discretion.
significantly,we agree with the federal agencies that the issuance of the was not a major factor in the district court vacatur decision,but rather it turned on congress enactment of the minnow riders.and,regarding that basis,we must conclude that the district court reasoning is even more problematic and moves us even more strongly to conclude that the court vacatur ruling amounted to an abuse of discretion.in particular,the district court endorsed the view that the appellants alleged lobbying of congress for the minnow riders should weigh against them in the equitable balance.we disagree.
passage of legislation that moots a case is a voluntary act which could,conceivably,weigh against vacatur.see black police ass n,at.but at issue here is not whether congress should be denied vacatur of the district court prior orders because it enacted the minnow riders.the federal agencies and other appellants were before the district court seeking that equitable relief,not congress.however,the district court essentially imputed congressional action to the appellants.yet the acts of the legislature are not the acts of executive branch agencies,states,or private parties.see id.at.only congress controls the enactment of federal legislation.see minnow iii,at the actions of the congressional delegation are not acts of the parties in this case,however.thus,we can not agree that the government and the congressional delegation from new mexico are guilty of acts that should give rise to equitable rights for the appellees.
even assuming that the appellants actively lobbied the new mexico congressional delegation,they were certainly not assured of a particular outcome.to the extent that the minnow riders contributed to the mootness of the case,the case became moot as a consequence of the actions of a third party,congress.passage of the minnow riders was simply beyond the appellants control see valero terrestrial,at concluding,when mootness was caused by state legislature amendment of statute and not acts by executive branch officials before the court,district court was correct to vacate its judgment jones temmer,cir vacating judgment when plaintiff suit against colorado public utilities commission was mooted by colorado legislature amendment of challenged taxicab regulations.
therefore,we conclude that the district court erred in attributing the conduct of a third the appellants in determining whether equitable considerations militated in favor of vacatur.such error in significantly basing its denial of vacatur on this improper and irrelevant factor,congress legislative action ineluctably provides a strong indication that the district court abused its discretion.see motors harry brown,llc,cir an abuse of discretion occurs where the district court fails to consider an important factor,gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor,or commits a clear error of judgment in weighing those factors.emphasis added kern txo prod,cir noting that when we say that a decision is discretionary we do not mean that the district court may do whatever pleases it and that an abuse of discretion can occur,inter alia,when an irrelevant or improper factor is considered and given significant weight wong wing hang ins,cir noting that the denial of suspension to an eligible alien would be an abuse of discretion if it were,inter alia,grounded on an impermissible basis such as considerations that congress could not have intended to make relevant internal quotation marks omitted.under the facts presented here,we conclude that,by relying significantly on the enactment of the minnow riders to support its vacatur ruling,the court abused its discretion.
additionally,vacatur is appropriate to prevent a judgment,unreviewable because of mootness,from spawning any legal consequences.united states munsingwear.by its terms,munsingwear applies to final judgments.nonetheless,we have applied its rationale to vacate interlocutory decisions that have no collateral or preclusive effect.see affiliated ute citizens of the state of utah ute indian tribe of the uintah ouray reservation,cir.although the district court has fashioned its rulings concerning the issue thoughtfully and with considerable skill,contrary to the court analysis,we conclude that this factor should not necessarily result in a denial of vacatur,and under the circumstances of this case it was unreasonable for court to deny vacatur.should the issue arise in the future with respect to the valley or other locales,it will almost invariably present a whole array of new factual and scientific issues for litigation by reclamation and other federal agencies,as well as by any concerned private parties.accordingly,it is at least open to question the extent to which the district court rulings would provide meaningful guidance to future litigants.
at bottom,however,we conclude that,under the facts of this case,it would be unreasonable for the district court to have concluded that reclamation has operated in a manner that should require it to labor in the future under any legal consequences that might be spawned by the district court orders.vacatur of the district court orders clears the path for future relitigation of the issues between the parties and diminishes the chances that the prior orders can be used for their persuasive value against any of the parties in subsequent proceedings.mcclendon,at quoting marc,fdic,cir en banc per curiam.ultimately,m oreover,since the district court opinion s will remain on the books even if vacated,albeit without any preclusive effect,future courts and litigants will be able to consult their reasoning.black police ass n,at.
thus,under the particular circumstances presented by this case,we determine that the district court abused its discretion when it denied appellants vacatur request and,for the reasons noted above,we conclude that the court decision is reversible error see also id.in this context,absent additional evidence of an illegitimate motive,we believe the general rule in favor of vacatur still applies.needless to say,this does not mean that vacatur should be granted in all cases of this kind.we are cognizant that both the district court and the parties have expended enormous amounts of time and resources in this litigation.furthermore,in our view,the district court orders were entered with the highest integrity and only after careful and informed deliberation.and,as noted,we condemn any suggestion by public officials to the contrary.however,we are constrained to conclude that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to vacate its orders.

for the foregoing reasons,we dismiss the appeal and remand to the district court with directions to vacate its april,memorandum opinion and order september,memorandum opinion and findings of fact and conclusions of law september,order and partial final judgment november,memorandum opinion and november,order and final judgment and to dismiss the environmental groups third amended complaint relating to their claim under the endangered species act

i.the district court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that the case was not mooted by the federal agencies voluntary cessation of their allegedly illegal activities.
standard of review 
to start,i disagree with the majority that we must engage in de novo review of the district court application of the voluntary cessation exception to mootness.i have no quarrel with the distinction between constitutional and prudential mootness,which the majority thoroughly explains.nevertheless,in my view,our precedent does not require the bifurcated voluntary cessation inquiry that the majority suggests,a de novo examination if the district court held the case to be constitutionally moot and an abuse of discretion review if it held the case to be prudentially moot.many of the voluntary cessation decisions invoked by the majority do not distinguish between the two doctrines,and lacking explicit guidance from controlling precedent,i think that we should review district courts voluntary cessation decisions,whether involving constitutional or prudential mootness,for an abuse of discretion.
as the district court noted,w hen a defendant has voluntarily ceased challenged conduct,in order to prove mootness the defendant has the burden to establish both that it is absolutely clear that the alleged wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur,and that interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation,citing county of los angeles davis,d united states grant.as with most mootness questions,the answer depends in large part on a uniquely individualized process of prediction centered on the facts and parties of each case.predictions must be made as to the probability of recurrence,the magnitude of any injury that would result,and the feasibility of preventing any injury by a future suit.the judgment that is made on the basis of these predictions may be shaped by the character of the plaintiff and by the character of the defendant.charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,at ed.
this,inquiry plays to the strengths of the district court,particularly when,as here,that court had a opportunity to assess these factors over years of litigation.we should give due regard to the district court feel for the case that we could not match without an inordinate expenditure of time.cook city of chicago,cir.
thus,as the environmental groups argue,and the supreme court recognizes,we should review the district court determination as to the effect of the federal agencies voluntary cessation of allegedly illegal activities under the more deferential abuse of discretion standard.grant,at,the necessary determination is that there exists some cognizable danger of recurrent violation,based on a standard of whether there was any reasonable basis for the district court decision comm.for the first amendment campbell,cir reviewing whether the district court abused its discretion in the determination that the voluntary cessation of unlawful conduct made the case moot see also united states concentrated phosphate export ass n,d finding in the mootness context that whether the likelihood of further violations is sufficiently remote to make injunctive relief unnecessary is a matter for the trial judge emphasis added.

b.the voluntary cessation exception to mootness 
as the district court noted,w hen a defendant has voluntarily ceased challenged conduct,in order to prove mootness the defendant has the burden to establish both that it is absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur,and that interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.at citing county of los angeles,at grant,at.under both prongs of the inquiry,i am not convinced that the defendants have carried their heavy burden.

as to the first prong of recurrence,in determining that the environmental groups challenges are moot,the majority fails to sufficiently consider the formidable burden that rests upon the federal agencies to satisfy this stringent test.concentrated phosphate export ass n,at the test for mootness in cases such as this is a stringent one.mere voluntary cessation of allegedly illegal conduct does not moot a case if it did,the courts would be compelled to leave t he defendant free to return to his old ways.quoting grant,at emphasis added county of los angeles,at tandy city of wichita,cir.although the majority acknowledges the existence of this heavy burden,op.at citations omitted,it apparently concludes that it is absolutely clear the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.tandy,at quoting friends of the earth laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d.but the district court,which has a better feel for this epochal litigation,concluded otherwise.see cook,at the judge acquire s a feel for the case that we could not match without an inordinate expenditure of time.indeed,the supreme court has stated that the determination of the likelihood of further violations in the mootness context is a matter for the trial judge.concentrated phosphate export ass n,at.
the majority accurately recounts the increased solicitude we may afford the voluntary actions by governmental actors,op.at,and it notes wright,miller cooper suggestion that the process of prediction also is shaped by the character of the of discontinuance by public officials are more apt to be trusted than like claims by private defendants.id.quoting wright,miller cooper,supra,at.some courts,may trust public defendants to honor a professed commitment to changed ways.id.at quoting wright,miller cooper,supra,at,see also coral springs,cir in a moot case,defendant expressly disavowed any intention of defending the ceased conduct.
however,whether or not public defendants are more trustworthy than private defendants,here we have no claim of discontinuance or a professed commitment to changed ways.reviewing for an abuse of discretion or de novo,the record is clear that the federal agencies have made no similar commitment here indeed,their refusal has been described as dogged,likely because it is a commitment the federal agencies are unwilling to make.d at.the federal agencies only argument in support of mootness is that the environmental groups have not challenged the biological opinion.akers mcginnis,cir in the present case,as the promulgation of work rules appears to be solely within the discretion of the mdoc,there is no guarantee that mdoc will not change back to its older,stricter rule as soon as this action terminates.
the federal agencies unwillingness to claim a commitment to change their ways does not discomfit the majority.the majority is reassured by the federal agencies concrete step in issuing the biological opinion,and views such a step as something more than a mere informal promise or assurance on the part of the governmental defendants that the challenged practice will cease.op.at quoting burbank twomey,cir.but,in my view,the biological opinion seems far from the secure foundation for mootness that a genuine may provide.id.at quoting wright,miller cooper,supra,at s again provides a secure foundation for mootness so long as it seems genuine.moreover,earlier in this litigation,the federal agencies explained that even after adopting the biological opinion,the legal question of reclamation discretion to use project water for endangered species may well recur,noting that the bureau might be unable to obtain sufficient water to comply with the biological opinion flow requirements.see fed.supp.br.on mootness,cir.et.
furthermore,i am uncertain how we could conclude there was no reasonable basis for the district court decision,grant,at,while also recognizing that the district court order played a role in the fws issuance of the biological opinion.op.at.as the majority acknowledges,the issuance of the biological opinion was at least in part in direct response to the district court rulings.id.at.and,if,as the court observes,reclamation has not abandoned its narrow view of the scope of its discretion,id.at,it is far from absolutely clear that the federal agencies have completely discontinued the practice or that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.see id.at tandy,at quoting friends of the earth,at grant,at noting that district court considers the bona fides of the expressed intent to comply,the effectiveness of the discontinuance and,in some cases,the character of the past violations when determining the risk of recurrence.
here,the biological opinion,together with the and minnow riders,demonstrate that congress deliberately left the issue of discretion over middle rio grande project water for decision by the federal agencies and the courts.d at.and reclamation,perhaps somewhat uncharacteristically,appears to shrug its shoulders at the suggestion it has full discretion.if history serves as any lesson,given the federal agencies grudging resistance described by the district court as their dogged refusal and the equivocal nature of the biological opinion,i believe we must agree with the district court and assume that the federal agencies may sidestep their practices.see d at the federal agencies have failed to establish that it is absolutely clear that they would not return to their wrongful use of an impermissibly narrow and limited scope of discretion in future esa consultations.united states or.state med.soc y.it is the duty of the courts to beware of efforts to defeat injunctive relief by protestations of repentance and reform,especially when abandonment seems timed to anticipate suit,and there is probability of resumption.the district court conclusion,together with a public interest in having the legality of the practices settled,militates against a mootness conclusion.grant,at.
eradication of the effects of the alleged violation 
the second prong of the supreme court voluntary cessation calculus is that interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.davis,at.the majority concludes,i believe correctly,that the and biological opinions have been superseded,but the majority seems to draw the incorrect conclusion that the effects of these biological opinions have been eradicated.the district court acted reasonably in expanding its inquiry beyond the four corners of the biological opinions to the actual effects of the agencies conduct on the minnow habitat e ven though an unusually wet spring in resulted in a dramatic increase in minnow spawning,it may never be known how the agencies dogged refusal to consider using project water in past years to prevent unnecessary river drying has affected the downward spiral of the silvery minnow.d at.as the recently released rio grande silvery minnow recovery plan observes,threats to the silvery minnow and its habitat indicate that it could be expected to become extinct in the foreseeable future.rio grande silvery minnow recovery plan,first revision,southwest region,fws,approved.county of los angeles,at holding that the second condition of mootness has been met because petitioners compliance has completely cured any discriminatory effects of the proposal emphasis added.thus i conclude that the district court acted quite reasonably when it determined that the federal agencies can not show that the effects of the esa violation have been completely and irrevocably eradicated.d at.furthermore,even reviewing the record de novo,i would conclude that the federal defendants can not show a complete cure of the esa violation.
ii.reclamation must consult with fws.
having determined that the case is not moot,i will briefly touch upon the merits.i agree with the district court that final resolution of the legal issue concerning reclamation discretionary authority over the middle rio grande project will greatly serve the public interest,and i would similarly conclude that i n any future consultations under the endangered species act,the bureau of reclamation must consult with the fish and wildlife service over the full scope of the bureau discretion concerning middle rio grande project operations.id.at citing its april,memorandum opinion and order doc,and its september,memorandum opinion and findings of fact and conclusions of law doc,and its order and partial final judgment doc.section of the esa establishes a consultation process to insure that any action authorized,funded,or carried out by a federal agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat a.
the esa obligates federal agencies to afford first priority to the declared national policy of saving endangered species.valley,at.the tennessee valley authority court noted statements from legislative proceedings preceding the esa,which tellingly remain valid over three decades later as we homogenize the habitats in which these plants and animals evolved,and as we increase the pressure for products that they are in a position to supply usually unwillingly we threaten our heritage the value of this genetic heritage is,quite literally,incalculable from the most narrow possible point of view,it is in the best interests of mankind to minimize the losses of genetic variations.the reason is simple they are potential resources.they are keys to puzzles which we can not solve,and may provide answers to questions which we have not yet learned to ask.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
as the court explained,section of the esa imposes requirements upon heads of all federal departments and agencies to use their authorities to facilitate programs for the protection of endangered species.id.at.at the same time,those agencies must ensure their actions will not jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species.a.the plain intent of congress in enacting this statute was to halt and reverse the trend toward species extinction,whatever the cost.valley,at.when fully considering the implications of reclamation responsibilities against this unambiguous backdrop,rather than cast the facts as a showdown between man and nature,we must abide by congress view that the value of endangered species is incalculable.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.man has options that nature does not.there are no hardship exemptions under the esa for federal agencies,and none is called for here.the district court reasoning,which modestly requires reclamation to merely consult with fws,abides by the plain language of the esa.
iii.the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the federal agencies motion for vacatur.
even if the district court had no reasonable basis to find that the case was not rendered moot by the federal agencies voluntary cessation of the allegedly illegal activities,i continue to see the district court decision denying vacatur as one well within its discretion,and would affirm.d at concluding that m ovants have failed to demonstrate their entitlement to the extraordinary remedy of vacatur of this court prior decisions.
standard of review 
vacatur is an equitable remedy,indeed,an extraordinary one,and the decision whether to grant vacatur is entrusted to the district court discretion.see bancorp mortg.bonner mall,d.again,the district court is better equipped than we are to fashion equitable relief,and we afford it considerable discretion in doing so.see boutwell keating,cir noting the district court considerable discretion in fashioning equitable remedies quoting stichting mayflower recreational fonds newpark,cir downie indep.drivers ass pension plan,cir we review the application of the district court equitable remedy for abuse of discretion.the burden is on the party seeking relief from the status quo to demonstrate equitable entitlement to the extraordinary remedy of vacatur.bancorp,at.as judge porfilio said,writing for the court in our previous decision in rio grande silvery minnow keys,cir minnow iii,when examining the moving party motion for vacatur,the district court should determine whether there are unresolved issues that remain to be tried.the district court here has made that determination,and has thoughtfully considered and denied the federal agencies motion for vacatur.
voluntary action of the party seeking relief from the judgment below 
the principal factor we consider in determining how to dispose of moot cases is whether the party seeking relief from the judgment below caused the mootness by voluntary action.solid waste dep t mechs.city of albuquerque,cir quoting bancorp,at.vacatur is ordinarily appropriate unless the losing party appealing the judgment was somehow responsible for making the case unreviewable.bancorp,at stewart blackwell,cir stating that vacatur is generally appropriate to avoid entrenching a decision rendered unreviewable through no fault of the losing party.thus,we have ordered vacatur when mootness occurs through not attributable to the the unilateral action of the party who prevailed in the lower court.chihuahuan grasslands alliance kempth
