we are asked to decide who must pay for cleaning up the mccoll superfund site in fullerton,california.the site was contaminated with hazardous wastes associated with the production of aviation fuel during world war ii.defendants in this case,shell oil,union oil of california,atlantic richfield,and texaco,collectively,the oil companies,operated aviation fuel refineries in the los angeles area during the war and dumped their wastes at the mccoll site.
the united states and the state of california brought suit against the oil companies under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla,to recover cleanup costs incurred at the site.the oil companies counterclaimed under the same statute,contending that the united states was liable for cleanup costs.
on motion for summary judgment by the united states and the state of california,the district court held that the oil companies were liable as arrangers under a.see united states shell oil shell i.the district court rejected the oil companies argument that they were exempt from liability on the ground that the contamination was caused by an act of war within the meaning of b.see id.at.on later for summary judgment by the united states and the oil companies,the district court held that the united states was liable as an arranger under a for the waste dumped at the site.see united states shell oil shell ii,at.the district court also held that the united states had waived its sovereign immunity to suit under a.id.at.after trial,the district court held that of the cleanup costs for the waste should be allocated to the united states,and to the oil companies,under f.see united states shell oil shell iii,d.

factual background 
avgas production 
the parties have entered into a comprehensive stipulation of facts,upon which the following narrative is based.in the early,petroleum refiners in the united states developed new technologies for producing gasoline fuel.until that time,the highest octane gasoline available had an octane rating of about,but by refiners possessed the ability to produce mass quantities of octane fuel.the primary consumer of this fuel was the united states military,which used it in airplane engines,leading to its colloquial name avgas.the high octane and low volatility of avgas allowed the design and use of internal combustion engines for military airplanes.
avgas was a blend of petroleum distillates and chemical additives.its base component was ordinary gasoline,to which the refineries added varying amounts of several additives.the most prevalent additive was a compound called alkylate,which comprised of the weight of avgas.the production of alkylate,as well as other additives,required the use of sulfuric acid.in the production of alkylate,through a process called alkylation,the refineries used purity sulfuric acid as a catalyst.approximately of the sulfuric acid used by the refineries during the war was devoted to this purpose.as a consequence of its use in alkylation,the purity of the acid was greatly reduced.spent alkylation acid could be reprocessed,at some expense,so that its purity was once again high enough for use as an alkylation catalyst.alternatively,spent acid either could be used in other refinery processes,or could be dumped without being reused.
when the war began,the alkylation process and the production of avgas were new technological developments.during the war,production of avgas increased more than,from roughly barrels per day in december to barrels per day in.sulfuric acid consumption increased,from million pounds per year in to million pounds per year in.the use of sulfuric acid in the alkylation process produced quantities of spent alkylation acid far greater than had ever been produced before.
because avgas was critical to the war effort,the united states government exercised significant control over the means of its production during world war ii.in,president roosevelt established several agencies to oversee wartime production.among those with authority over petroleum production were the war production board wpb and the petroleum administration for war paw.the wpb established a nationwide priority ranking system to identify scarce goods,prioritize their use,and facilitate their production it also limited the production of nonessential goods.the paw centralized the government activities.it made policy determinations regarding the construction of new facilities and allocation of raw materials,and had the authority to issue production orders to refineries.although the wpb,paw,and other government agencies had the authority to require production of goods at refineries owned by the oil companies,and even to seize refineries if necessary,in fact they relied almost exclusively on contractual agreements to ensure avgas production.in particular,the government entered into contracts to purchase avgas,and offered loans to refineries to help finance the construction of plants.
the government sought to maximize avgas production through the planned blending program.under this program,the government assisted the refineries operated by the oil companies in exchanging and blending various avgas components in order to maximize production of avgas.the government could,and sometimes did,direct that specific exchanges be made,but it usually accepted what was proposed by the refineries.the instructions issued under the planned blending program were at times quite detailed.sometimes they directed refiners to blend avgas in a way that would allow increased overall production even if that method would reduce an individual refinery yield.the program did not exercise direct control over the production of avgas components rather,it controlled only their exchange and blending after they had been produced.
the government reduced the financial risk to producers of avgas and its components through the aviation gas reimbursement plan agrp.this program allowed oil companies that entered into avgas supply contracts to recoup costs they could not have anticipated at the time of the execution of the contracts.the agrp directly reimbursed the refineries for any extraordinary expenditures they those incurred under the planned blending program to maintain maximum avgas production during the war.
throughout the war,the oil companies designed and built their facilities,maintained private ownership of the facilities,and managed their own refinery operations.the oil companies affirmatively sought contracts to sell avgas to the government,and the contracts were profitable throughout the war.after the war,the oil companies retained ownership of the facilities they had built with the help of government loans.
acid disposal and the mccoll site 
spent alkylation acid generated in the production of avgas could be reprocessed,used in other refinery operations,or discarded as waste.some of the oil companies reprocessed spent alkylation acid themselves,but at various times all of them entered into contracts to have other private entities reprocess it.the oil companies also used spent alkylation acid to improve the effectiveness of other avgas additives and to purify other refinery products,including gasoline,kerosene,and lubricating oil.the use of spent alkylation acid in other refinery processes produced waste in the form of acid sludge.acid sludge had an acid content significantly lower than spent alkylation acid.because of its low purity,it was difficult to reprocess and was not useful for refinery processes.
acid sludge had been a product of refinery operations before the discovery of the alkylation process.before the war,the technology to reprocess acid sludge had existed,and some had,in fact,been reprocessed.for reasons of cost,however,most acid sludge had been dumped or burned.during the war,acid sludge was generated in much greater quantities than ever before,and the oil companies dumped most of it.
during the war,there was a chronic shortage of railroad tank cars to transport spent acid for reprocessing or reuse offsite from the refineries where it was generated.on two occasions,the government refused to allocate the materials and resources necessary to build new acid reprocessing facilities in northern california.however,some reprocessing facilities were built during the war.one,owned by stauffer chemical company,was capable of handling both spent alkylation acid and acid sludge,but it failed to operate at design capacity and this failure resulted in the dumping of both spent alkylation acid and acid sludge.by late and,the oil companies were producing so much spent alkylation acid that they could not reuse all of it in their own refineries,and the facilities for reprocessing this acid were insufficient.when the resulting bottleneck threatened to halt avgas production,the oil companies dumped large quantities of spent alkylation acid at the mccoll site.
the government was aware during the war that avgas production generated acid wastes and that increased avgas production increased acid waste generation.the government took some actions to alleviate the problem of waste disposal.for example,in,it attempted to solve the problem of the spent acid reprocessing bottleneck by facilitating the lease of a large storage tank known as the wilshire storage tank in southern california.the government never specifically ordered or approved the dumping of spent acid and acid sludge by the oil companies,and there is no evidence that the united states was aware of the disposal contracts between the oil companies and mccoll.
the dumping site in this case is named after eli mccoll,who contracted to accept both spent acid and acid sludge from refineries near los angeles mccoll began accepting the waste and dumping it in earthen sumps at the site in june,and continued to do so until shortly after the end of the war.according to the district court,about of the waste at the mccoll site was spent sulfuric acid from the alkylation process,and about was acid sludge resulting from the treatment of benzol.shell iii,d at.of the remaining of the waste,most was acid sludge resulting from the chemical treatment of refinery products using spent alkylation acid.in the,mccoll,with the assistance of the oil companies,filled and capped the waste sumps to allow residential development of nearby areas,even though approximately cubic yards of hazardous waste remained at the site.the government began removing this waste from the site in the,at an eventual cost of close to million.on august,the mccoll site was officially removed from the national priorities list and converted into a wildlife sanctuary and community recreation facility.
ii.sovereign immunity 
we first examine whether the government has waived its sovereign immunity for purposes of liability under cercla.plaintiffs suing the united states must point to an unequivocal expression of intent to waive sovereign immunity.see lane pena,d blue widnall,cir.a waiver of sovereign immunity must be unambiguous,and the relevant statutory language is to be strictly construed in favor of the sovereign.lane,at.see also united states williams,d.
the oil companies contend that the necessary waiver appears in a of cercla,codified at a 
each department,agency,and instrumentality of the united states including the executive,legislative,and judicial branches of government shall be subject to,and comply with,cercla in the same manner and to the same extent,both procedurally and substantively,as any nongovernmental entity,including liability under section of this title.nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the liability of any person or entity under sections and of this title.
the district court held that this provision does waive the government immunity in the circumstances of this lawsuit.we review this question of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.see ma reno,cir.we agree with the district court.
the supreme court has read the language of a as an unambiguous waiver of the sovereign immunity of the united states.in pennsylvania union gas,d,the court concluded that an analogous provision of cercla was an unambiguous abrogation of the sovereign immunity of the states.it was led to that conclusion by comparing the language of d,applicable to the states,to the language of a,applicable to the united states 
it can be no coincidence that in describing the potential liability of the states in d,congress chose language mirroring that of a.in choosing this mirroring language in d,therefore,congress must have intended to override the states immunity from suit,just as it waived the federal government immunity in a.
id.at.emphasis added.we are,of course,aware that the court has overruled its conclusion in union gas that congress has the power under the commerce clause to abrogate the sovereign immunity of the states.see seminole tribe,d.but seminole tribe does nothing to cast doubt on the correctness of the court understanding of the meaning of a.
the united states does not dispute that a waives its sovereign immunity under cercla for some of its activities.indeed,it concedes liability under cercla for all of the cleanup costs associated with shell oil processing of benzol for the government.the united states argues,however,that the waiver contained in a is limited to cases in which it has undertaken nongovernmental activities.in part,it bases its argument on the fact that the heading for is federal facilities.it also bases its argument on the text of a,contending that the phrase making the government subject to cercla in the same manner and to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity restricts the waiver of sovereign immunity to situations in which the government acts as a nongovernmental entity.
we believe that the united states construction of a is too narrow.first,we disagree with the government analysis of the importance of the heading federal facilities at the beginning of.relying on this heading,the government argues that congress intended to waive sovereign immunity only with respect to facilities.
we agree with the third circuit analysis in rejecting this argument.see fmc united states dep of commerce,cir en banc.as an initial matter,we note that nothing in the text of a limits its effect to federal facilities.see id.further,the waiver language of a was enacted in,and the federal facilities portion of cercla was added in.for organizational reasons,the post codifiers placed the waiver of immunity under the federal facilities heading applicable to the provision.id.finally,after the waiver provision was moved,it employed language that explicitly referred without qualification to the provision of cercla.it employed no new language that would have limited the scope of the waiver.id.
second,the united states has repeatedly been held liable under cercla for acts that can not possibly be characterized as nongovernmental.the clearest example is the united states immense cercla liability for cleanups associated with military installations and activity.private parties do not operate military bases,and yet the united states has been found liable for the cleanup of hazardous wastes at military facilities.as explained by the third circuit 
a lthough no private party could own a military base,the government is liable for clean up of hazardous wastes at military bases because a private party would be liable if it did own a military base.united states allied,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,united states navy found liable under cercla because it authorized demolition which caused release of hazardous substances.
we hold that cercla waiver of sovereign immunity is coextensive with the scope of liability imposed by.if provides for liability,then a waives sovereign immunity to that liability.in so holding,we align ourselves with the two circuits that have thoroughly considered the issue.see east bay mun.util.dist.united states dep t of commerce,east bay mud recognizing that the phrase in the same manner and to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity was potentially ambiguous,but holding that does not,on its face,suggest a distinction between the exercise of private and regulatory powers fmc,at t he relevant sovereign immunity question under cercla is whether the government activities,however characterized,are sufficient to impose liability on the government as an owner,operator,or arranger.
the united states warns that this reading of a will subject it to liability in a wide range of cases where it acts in either a regulatory or remedial capacity.we believe its fears are exaggerated.we recognize that by making the united states liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private party,does subject the government to significant risk of liability.but the government is subject to liability only to the extent of the substantive provisions of cercla.that is,the waiver of sovereign immunity is coextensive with the scope of liability under,but the united states is liable under that section only when it qualifies as an owner or operator of a facility,an arranger of waste disposal,or an entity that accepts waste for treatment or disposal.otherwise,it is not liable and it maintains its sovereign immunity.as we hold below,even the pervasive activity of the government in this case does not fit within these categories.
we also note two defenses provided within.first,d confers a defense upon parties for costs or damages as a result of actions taken or omitted in the course of rendering care,assistance,or advice in accordance with the national contingency plan,unless such actions are negligent.second,d expressly immunizes state and local governments from liability for actions taken in response to an emergency created by the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance generated by or from a facility owned by another person.see east bay mud,at suggesting that d is intended to apply to activity that is primarily or exclusively governmental fmc,at i nasmuch as state and local governments are immune from cercla liability because of d for the consequences of cleanup activities this distinction is implied in the federal government waiver of sovereign immunity as well.
iii.arranger liability 
we next examine whether the government is liable as an arranger with respect to the waste at the mccoll site section a of cercla,codified at a,specifies that an arranger is a covered person and is thus liable for cleanup costs.the text of a provides that 
any person who by contract,agreement,or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment,or arranged with a transporter for transport for disposal or treatment,of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such person,by any other party or entity,at any facility or incineration vessel owned or operated by another party or entity and containing such hazardous substances shall be liable 
emphasis added.
direct arranger liability 
the district court characterized traditional direct arranger liability cases as those in which the sole purpose of the transaction is to arrange for the treatment or disposal of the hazardous wastes.shell ii,at.it noted that the oil companies had not argued for direct arranger liability on this basis,but it nonetheless held that certain facts have been presented to the court upon which the court could rest a traditional finding of arranger liability.the government began to arrange for the disposal of acid wastes,by undertaking the responsibility for disposing of the sludge the case law certainly supports the proposition that once an entity undertakes to arrange for disposal or treatment,it can not abdicate responsibility when the disposal becomes infeasible.id.at.
the district court relied on two things to support its conclusion that the united states was liable as a direct arranger.first,it relied on an august letter from the paw concerning an acid reclamation plant proposed by the monsanto chemical company that would have reprocessed acid waste produced by a tidewater oil company refinery in northern california.monsanto had delayed building the plant because of a disagreement with the government over the amount of accelerated depreciation it would receive.a compromise was reached on the depreciation issue in march,but monsanto had allowed its priority ranking,which would have authorized the construction of the plant,to expire.then,in july,the wpb refused to renew the priority ranking.
the paw made estimates of the amount of fresh acid that would be required in northern california,and was aware of acid waste disposal problems that the tidewater refinery was having,but it declined to get involved in resolving them.according to the stipulated facts,t he paw responded to tidewater that it considered tidewater disposal problems when making its acid estimates to wpb.on july,the paw said that the acid disposal problem was being left to wpb since they have overall responsibility for industrial uses of acid.in a letter dated august,from the paw to tidewater,the paw again stated the sludge disposal problem was being left with the wpb since they have the overall responsibility for industrial uses of acid.
second,the district court states that the government even undertook the rental of a storage tank,known as the wilshire storage tank,for the disposal of some acid wastes.id.at.
the stipulated facts indicate that in march the government did make efforts to facilitate the lease of a storage tank for acid waste in southern california owned by the wilshire oil company,with the result that the tank was being used for that purpose by april.the stipulated facts indicate that the government initially gave some consideration to leasing the tank itself,but do not indicate that the government was,in the end,the lessee of the tank.
the oil companies do not argue to us,just as they did not argue to the district court,that these facts are sufficient to support a finding that the united states was liable as a traditional direct arranger.a direct arranger must have direct involvement in arrangements for the disposal of waste.see,cadillac,united states,cir in which rubber companies that had transferred contaminated styrene to dow chemical for reprocessing were held to be arrangers catellus devel.united states,cir in which an automotive parts company that had sent used car batteries to a plant for lead recovery and disposal was held to be an arranger.we understand why the oil companies did not argue,and are not arguing,for arranger liability on this basis.there are simply insufficient facts in the record to support a conclusion that the united states directly entered into arrangements to dispose of acid waste at the mccoll site.
broader arranger liability 
the oil companies argue for arranger liability on a broader theory,contending that the government had sufficient control over the process that created the waste such that it should be considered an arranger.the test they propose is that if a party has substantial control over a manufacturing process wherein a hazardous waste stream is generated and disposed of,then that party assumes the obligation to control the disposal of that waste stream.the district court applied a somewhat different test to find arranger liability on a broader theory.it took its test from its reading of a case decided by the eighth circuit,united states aceto agric.chem,cir.that test,like the oil companies proposed test,includes a focus on the control by the united states a party is an arranger if it supplies raw materials to be used in making a finished product,and it retains ownership or control of the work in progress,where the generation of hazardous substances is inherent in the production process.shell ii,at.we agree with the oil companies and the district court that control is a crucial element of the determination of whether a party is an arranger under a.but we disagree with their conclusion that the government exercised the requisite control on the facts of this case.
there is no test,either in the statute or in the case law,for a broad theory of arranger liability under a.rather,we are required to sort through the fact patterns of the decided cases in order to find similarities and dissimilarities to the fact pattern of our case.in finding that the united states was an arranger,the district court explicitly relied on aceto.the question in aceto was whether pesticide manufacturers were arrangers and therefore liable for cleanup costs for contamination at the plant of a pesticide formulator,aidex corporation.the pesticide manufacturers routinely shipped active pesticide ingredients to aidex,which blended them with inert ingredients in order to produce pesticides that could be sold on the open market.after the pesticides were formulated,aidex shipped them either back to the manufacturers or directly to customers of the manufacturers.the manufacturers owned the pesticide ingredients and the pesticides at all times.the generation of waste at the aidex plant was an inherent part of the formulation process,through such things as spills,cleaning of equipment,and mixing and grinding operations.the eighth circuit held,under these circumstances,that the pesticide manufacturers were arrangers aidex is performing a process on products owned by defendants for defendants benefit and at their direction waste is generated and disposed of contemporaneously with the process.id.at.
we disagree with the district court that aceto controls this case,for the united states was in a materially different position in this case from the pesticide manufacturers in that case.the united states was the end purchaser of avgas,and was thus more like a customer of the pesticide manufacturers than like the manufacturers themselves.further,unlike the pesticide manufacturers,the united states never owned any of the raw materials or intervening products.it never owned unrefined petroleum,refined gasoline,fresh sulfuric acid,spent acid,or alkylate or any other additive.finally,unlike the manufacturers,the united states did not contract out a crucial and intermediate step in a manufacturing process,and then seek to disclaim responsibility for the waste generated during that step.
the oil companies also rely on an earlier eighth circuit case,united states northeastern pharmaceutical chemical,nepacco,cir.nepacco manufactured disinfectant at one of its plants.edwin michaels was the president and a principal shareholder of nepacco,and john lee was a and plant supervisor.with the knowledge and permission of lee,the plant manager agreed with a third party to bury drums of chemical waste from the plant on a farm several miles away from the plant.both lee and michaels were sued for cleanup costs as arrangers under a.by the time of the suit,nepacco was insolvent.
the eighth circuit held that lee was an arranger,even though he did not personally own or possess the waste 
it is the authority to control the handling and disposal of hazardous substances that is critical under the statutory scheme lee,as plant supervisor,actually knew about,had immediate supervision over,and was directly responsible for arranging for the transportation and disposal of the nepacco plant hazardous substances at the denney farm site.we believe requiring proof of personal ownership or actual physical possession of hazardous substances as a precondition for liability under a,would be inconsistent with the broad remedial purposes of cercla.
id.at.it also held that michaels was an arranger,even though he was not as directly involved as lee 
unlike lee,michaels was not personally involved in the actual decision to transport and dispose of the hazardous substances.as nepacco corporate president and as a major nepacco shareholder,however,michaels was the individual in charge of and directly responsible for all of nepacco operations,including those at the verona plant,and he had the ultimate authority to control the disposal of nepacco hazardous substances.
id.at.in aceto,the eighth circuit explained its earlier holding in nepacco,stating in dictum that it had held in that case that arranger liability is appropriate for those who had the authority to control the disposal,even without ownership or possession.aceto,at.
the oil companies rely on nepacco,and its later characterization in aceto,for the proposition that neither ownership nor actual control is necessary for arranger liability under a.in the view of the oil companies,mere authority to control is sufficient.the united states did not exercise any actual control over the oil companies disposal of spent acid and acid sludge at the mccoll site indeed,it did not even know that the oil companies had contracts to dispose of their waste at the site.but the united states had ultimate authority to exercise such control.it could have exercised control over the disposal of the waste,just as it could have seized the oil companies refineries under eminent domain and operated those refineries itself.if authority to control the oil companies waste disposal were sufficient without more,as the oil companies contend,then we would agree that the united states was an arranger under a.
however,we believe that the oil companies conception of authority to control is based on an incorrect reading of nepacco.in nepacco,there was actual control exercised by lee,who gave permission to the plant supervisor to dispose of the waste at the farm.michaels was lee superior in the chain of command.not only did michaels have authority to control lee actions,but there had also been an actual exercise of control by lee.in other words,nepacco holds that responsible officials in the chain of command of a corporation may be held responsible as arrangers when one of those officers has exercised actual control over the disposition of waste on behalf of the corporation,and the other officer has the authority to control the first officer.
in this case,the united states neither exercised actual control,nor had the direct ability to control,in the sense intended in nepacco.in this case,the waste never belonged to the united states,so there was never a united states employee in a position comparable to lee.further,even if we put the problem of ownership of the waste to one side,lee exercised actual control over the disposal of waste.in this case,no official or employee of the united states ever exercised actual control over any of the waste disposal at issue.thus,nepacco premise for liability of a superior with authority to control never existed.
moreover,an analogy to nepacco misses the essence of that case the court in nepacco held officers of a bankrupt company liable for an actual misdeed of that corporation.one of the two officers had participated in the misdeed the other officer was the president and a principal shareholder of the corporation,who as president had the authority to control the other officer and as shareholder had the potential to realize substantial financial benefit from the misdeed.in this case,there is no bankrupt corporation the united states committed no misdeed and there is no officer or employee named as a defendant.
to summarize our view of aceto and nepacco,and to assess the interrelationship of the factors of ownership,possession,and control over waste disposal,we can do no better than to quote from judge levi careful opinion in united states iron mountain mines.he writes 
it is true that some cases impose arranger liability on parties who did not literally own or physically possess hazardous waste at the time it was disposed of or released.but in each of these cases the party either was the source of the pollution or managed its disposal by the arranger citing numerous cases,including aceto and nepacco.no court has imposed arra
