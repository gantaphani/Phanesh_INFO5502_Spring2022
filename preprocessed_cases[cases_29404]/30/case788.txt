this case arises out of plaintiffs appellants tri valley cares,marylia turner,and janis kate turner collectively,tri valley cares second challenge to the sufficiency of the united states department of energy doe environmental assessment ea of a prospective biosafety level bsl facility at the lawrence livermore national laboratory llnl.in an earlier round of litigation,we upheld all aspects of the doe original ea,except for its failure to consider the impact of a possible terrorist attack.following our remand,on september,the district court entered summary judgment in the doe favor on the grounds that it had sufficiently revised its final revised environmental assessment frea to adequately consider the environmental impact of an intentional terrorist attack on the bsl facility at llnl.on november,tri valley cares timely appealed the district court decision,petitioning us to require the doe to prepare an environmental impact statement eis,or,in the alternative,to revise its ea,in light of the allegations set forth in its original complaint,to determine whether an eis is required.
we hold that the doe took the requisite hard look at the environmental impact of an intentional terrorist attack in the manner required by the national environmental policy act nepa and san luis obispo mothers for peace nuclear regulatory commission,cir.we further hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying tri valley cares motion to supplement the record.accordingly,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
a.the llnl biosafety level three facility 
on december,the national nuclear security administration nnsa,an agency within the doe,authorized the construction of a bsl laboratory at llnl.center for disease control cdc and national institutes of health nih guidelines divide biosafety lab operations into four levels bsl least hazardous through bsl most hazardous.bsl laboratories work with agents that may cause diseases in humans with serious or lethal consequences if untreated,and which have the potential of airborne transmission.common agents found in bsl facilities include west nile virus,yellow fever virus,mycobaterium tuberculosis,and sars virus.there are more than bsl laboratories in the united states.common examples of bsl facilities include hospital surgical suites,laboratories associated with medical schools,and university research laboratories.at the time of construction,the llnl bsl facility was the only bsl facility operating in the same facility as a nuclear laboratory.
the doe decided to undertake the construction of an onsite bsl facility at llnl because limitations in its bsl and laboratories forced llnl to conduct its bsl research.this research was difficult and costly because llnl lacked physical control,and shipping and handling increased the risk of and degradation.
for the new bsl facility,llnl selected a,prefabricated building to be constructed next to existing bsl facilities.the system comprised a double high efficiency particulate air purifying hepa air filtration system,as is consistent with cdc guidelines.each hepa filter removes at least percent of bioagents.the facility also has additional safeguards against pathogenic breach,including a ventilation system that would draw the contaminated air back into the facility,a backup power system that would enable employees to shut down portions of the contaminated part of the facility,and a system that would prevent any air flow in the facility in the event of a total power loss.
b.the original environmental assessment 
the doe performed an ea for the proposed llnl bsl laboratory,pursuant to nepa.the ea considered the environmental impacts of the bsl laboratory on a wide range of issues,including human health,ecological resources,transportation,waste management,geology,soils and seismology,noise,and air quality.the ea also discussed how cdc and nih guidelines govern the facility operations and mitigate the risk of infection and accidental release.
in evaluating the public risk potentially caused by the bsl facility,the doe relied upon three major sources of data statistics from hundreds of other bsl laboratories the army biological defense research program bdrp laboratories and llnl bsl and laboratories.in addition to examining the normal operations of the aforementioned sources,the ea analyzed potential abnormal impacts on those sources,using a catastrophic release scenario,modeled upon a maximum credible event mce,simulating the outer bounds of impact caused by a pathogen accidental release.
the doe considered numerous possible methods of assessing the threat of release,but it chose a catastrophic release simulation a centrifuge analysis,that the army used to perform a nepa analysis of its own biological research labs.the catastrophic release model used by the army also was an mce type of analysis,which simulated a reasonably foreseeable event with a low likelihood of occurrence,but with high risk.in the army simulated catastrophic release model,a liter of coxiella burnetii burnetii was hypothetically divided into six centrifuge tubes with loose caps and loose.when the centrifuge was activated,some of the tubes contents would be aerosolized,resulting in the production of almost billion airborne pathogens.
the army then modeled a plume of the airborne pathogens as it moved through the lab and outside via the ventilation system.in order to produce conservative results,the army simulated only one hepa filter,operating at only percent effectiveness.the army concluded the chance of public exposure to an airborne pathogen,at a percent rate of contracting the disease,was extremely remote.
using the army centrifuge model,the doe concluded that the chances of exposure at the llnl bsl lab were even more remote than those modeled by the army because the army scenario assumed one hepa filter that was percent effective.the llnl bsl lab,the doe reasoned,filters all room air through two hepa filter banks,each of which is at least percent effective.the army scenario also assumed a lab in close physical proximity to the public,whereas the llnl bsl lab is mile from the nearest public area.finally,the army assumed lower wind speeds than are prevalent at llnl higher wind speeds would decrease airborne concentrations more quickly.based on this analysis,the doe concluded that even if a catastrophic release were to occur,there would be no significant impact on public health or safety.this conclusion thus led the doe to issue a finding of no significant impact fonsi.
c.the first round of litigation 
in august,tri valley cares brought suit in the united states district court for the northern district of california,challenging the ea on numerous grounds under nepa.tri valley cares department of energy,no.c sba,wl cal.sep.on september,the district court granted summary judgment for the doe on the ground that the doe had satisfied the requirements of nepa in preparing the original ea,at wl at.on appeal,we affirmed all aspects of the ea,except for the doe failure to consider the environmental impact of a terrorist attack.tri valley cares dep t of energy,app x,cir.we thus affirmed in part and reversed in part,remanding for the sole purpose of the doe considering whether the threat of a terrorist act required the preparation of an eis.id.at.
d.the draft revised environmental assessment drea 
on remand,the doe prepared a drea in march,addressing the impacts associated with terrorist attacks to determine whether the threat of terrorist attack necessitated preparation of an eis.the drea was circulated for public comment from april,through may.
to analyze the threat that terrorist activity posed to the llnl bsl laboratory,the doe was required to take a different approach than it did when analyzing the threat posed by accidents.because there are an infinite number of possible modes of attack,the doe considered three general types of terrorist threats a direct terrorist attack at the llnl bsl facility,resulting in loss of containment the theft and release of pathogenic material by an llnl terrorist outsider and the theft and release of pathogenic material by an llnl terrorist insider.
direct attack resulting in loss of containment 
the doe considered various possible modes of direct terrorist attack on the llnl facility,including a suicidal plane crash or an explosive device delivered by vehicle or on foot.in considering the impact of this type of threat,the doe used the centrifuge scenario to determine the bounded or outer limits of any release,and then analyzed factors which could mitigate such a release.
the doe concluded that the outer bounds of dispersion in a terrorist attack would be the same as those of the catastrophic release scenario used in the original ea.the centrifuge model analysis supported a finding of no significance for terrorist threat based upon a direct attack on the llnl bsl facility.
to further validate its findings using the centrifuge model the doe also considered several factors that would further limit the consequences of a direct terrorist attack.specifically,very limited quantities of biological agents are generally in use at llnl bsl,a fire resulting from an airplane crash or explosive device would likely kill many pathogens quickly and in the unlikely event of bioagent release,microorganisms would generally be rendered innocuous by exposure to generally occurring environmental conditions.the doe concluded that these factors in the aggregate would substantially reduce the number of pathogens released and capable of human infection,as the result of a direct attack.it also concluded that the impact of a facility breach caused by a direct terrorist act would be no greater than the impacts addressed in the army catastrophic release scenario analyzed in the initial ea.
theft and release by an llnl bsl terrorist outsider 
the drea next considered the threat of the theft and release of a pathogen by a llnl bsl terrorist outsider.it examined this possible form of attack by evaluating the types of pathogens available at the llnl bsl facility in comparison to the types of pathogens available from other sources,including other bsl facilities and the natural environment.comparatively speaking,the doe reasoned that hundreds of other bsl facilities in the united states regularly handle and store the same types of substances as the llnl bsl facility.moreover,many substances are available from common environmental sources.thus,a terrorist outsider seeking such materials could find them in many bsl facilities nationwide,most of which lack the safeguards and security infrastructure of llnl.
unlike the majority of the bsl labs nationwide,most of which are academic or clinical facilities,llnl bsl is surrounded by a patrolled security fence with required for entry it has its own security force,including an armed emergency response force.access to the bsl facility is limited to employees registered with the cdc and trained and qualified under its guidelines.access to individual lab rooms within the building is limited to staff members approved to work during specific shifts,and all lab rooms are equipped with motion sensors.finally,within the lab,select agents are stored in locked freezers when not in use.accordingly,the doe reasoned that when considered against the thousands of other sources from which a terrorist outsider could obtain the same pathogenic materials,the addition of a single,bsl facility at llnl did not significantly alter the status quo.
theft and release by an llnl bsl terrorist insider 
lastly,the doe considered the potential impact of the theft and release of a pathogen by an llnl bsl terrorist insider.to evaluate this threat,the doe did not use an empirical model,but rather,engaged in a probabilistic analysis assessing the probability that an insider with access to bsl pathogens would have the motive to commit such an attack and assessing the public threat assuming that an insider had the access and motive to release a pathogen.
with regard to the first prong of the doe insider theft and release analysis,the doe found that the likelihood that an insider would have the motive to commit such an attack was very low,based upon the small number of persons with access to pathogens at the llnl bsl facility fewer than ten and the high number of screenings and protective programs and security procedures,unique to the llnl bsl facility.in addition to complying with nationwide doj risk assessment screenings,hhs authorization screenings,and cdc registration,llnl bsl requires its employees to also comply with its own monitoring and training system,select agent human reliability program.
further,even assuming motive,the doe found that the risk of effective theft and release by an llnl bsl terrorist insider was extremely low because an llnl bsl terrorist insider would need to further cultivate and prepare any covertly removed pathogen before release.the doe specifically reasoned that this outcome further rendered the threat of insider theft and release highly improbable because direct removal of any significant quantity of a pathogen would be quickly noticed because material inventories are regularly audited,and the llnl bsl facility does not even contain large amounts of aerosolized pathogens,but instead stores them in small,frozen samples,in ml vials.
e.the final revised environmental assessment 
on january,after evaluating public comment,the doe found that no significant environmental impact would result from a terrorist attack on the bsl laboratory.accordingly,it released a frea and a fonsi on january.the frea was substantially identical to the drea,except for a few administrative updates and three substantive updates.one of the substantive updates addressed two anthrax shipping incidents in,while the other two dealt with subcommittee hearings regarding bsl safety procedures,following an incident at texas a 
f.the current litigation 
on march,tri valley cares filed a new complaint alleging that the doe had again failed to prepare an adequate ea and fonsi,failed to prepare an eis,failed to supplement the rea,and failed to publicly circulate the fonsi.following the district court denial of a motion for preliminary injunction by tri valley cares,each party moved for summary judgment.in its motion for summary judgment,tri valley cares asserted that the doe failed to prepare an adequate frea and revised fonsi failed to conduct an ea in good faith failed to prepare an eis failed to supplement the frea and failed to publicly circulate the fonsi.tri valley cares sought a judgment compelling the doe to prepare an eis,or alternatively,to prepare a revised ea and to reconsider whether an eis is necessary.
tri valley cares relied upon three primary arguments to support its motion it claimed that the doe reliance on the same centrifuge analysis used in the original ea to assess the dangers of a terrorist attack in the frea violated nepa the doe failure to disclose information related to a anthrax shipping incident in the march drea violated nepa and the doe failure to disclose information regarding violations for restricted experiments conducted at the llnl bsl facility violated nepa.on september,the district court granted summary judgment in the doe favor on the ground that the doe had properly conducted its analysis in revising the frea,in compliance with this court original mandate.

our mandate in tri valley cares i 
in tri valley cares i,we affirmed the original ea on all grounds,except for its failure to consider the impact of a possible terrorist attack.on that ground alone,we remanded for the doe to consider whether the threat of terrorist activity necessitates the preparation of an environmental impact statement,by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the human health,safety,and environmental risks associated with a terrorist attack at llnl bsl facility.tri valley cares i,app x at citing san luis obispo mothers for peace nuclear regulatory comm n,cir mothers for peace i.following that decision,in mothers for peace ii,we upheld the nrc finding of no significant impact in a revised ea in which the nrc first analyzed site the low risk factors,and then bounded the maximum impact of an attack using an mce model.see san luis obispo mothers for peace nrc,cir mothers for peace ii applying b a.

direct attack on the llnl facility 
the doe utilized its mce scenario,developed in the original ea,to evaluate the outer bounds of a pathogen release.in tri valley cares i,we previously upheld the use of this centrifuge model for a bounding analysis of the impacts of abnormal catastrophic events,including earthquakes and accidental plane crashes.there,the model was applied not to measure the cause of the triggering event,but rather the outer limits of its impact.
in selecting the centrifuge model to measure the potential impact of a direct terrorist attack on the llnl bsl facility,the doe specifically reasoned that the catastrophic release model was analogous to the direct attack scenario because the triggering incidents earthquake or accidental plane crash in the former,intentional plane crash or suicide bombing in the latter would result in similar structural damage to the llnl bsl facility.moreover,the doe further refined its analysis of a terrorist attack using the centrifuge model by highlighting several key distinctions from the army original model that would significantly alter the consequences of such an event at the llnl facility specifically the very limited quantities of biological agents generally in use the likely destruction of pathogens resulting from the fire caused by an airplane crash or explosive device and the likely destruction of pathogens resulting from general environmental exposure.
because the army catastrophic release scenario measured the effects of a catastrophic event at llnl bsl,it was reasonable that the model be applied to consider the outer bounds of a threat of terrorist attack.we read mothers for peace ii as supporting the proposition that use of an mce model,such as the catastrophic release scenario applied here,is an acceptable method to simulate the bounds of a direct terrorist attack when the agency decision to use that model is reasonably supported by agency evidence.see mothers for peace ii,at affirming assessment of a terrorist threat where agency projected pathogen release using maximum credible event here,as in mothers for peace ii,the doe applied a general mce analysis to measure the outer limits of the impact of a direct terrorist attack.the mce centrifuge model used in the original ea was an outer bounding model for a hypothetical maximum credible event it was not designed to be unique to only one particular incident,or even type of incident.we find the doe use of the mce centrifuge model sufficient under nepa and mothers for peace ii because the doe reasonably justified its selection based upon record evidence and additional analysis of factors.
whether we agree that a centrifuge model was the best way to assess the threat of direct terrorist attack is not the inquiry before us.lands council,at w hen specialists express conflicting views,an agency must have discretion to rely on the reasonable opinions of its own qualified experts even if,as an original matter,a court might find contrary views more persuasive.internal citations omitted.under nepa,we must restrain from acting as a type of omnipotent scientist,and instead must restrict ourselves to inquiring only whether an agency took a hard look at the potential environmental impacts at issue.muckleshoot indian tribe forest,cir per curiam quoting robertson methow valley citizens council.when reasonable scientists disagree on appropriate models for analysis,we must defer to agency experts.lands council,at.here,the doe provided ample justification and evidence for why it used the centrifuge model to assess the impact of a terrorist attack it analogized triggering events,compared critical distinctions,and considered uniquely different circumstances.accordingly,because of the deference that must be afforded to the agency,we find that the doe took the requisite hard look at the threat of direct terrorist attack.
theft and release by a llnl bsl terrorist outsider 
in assessing the impact of a terrorist threat by the theft and release by an llnl bsl terrorist outsider,the doe used a comparative nationwide analysis to determine that the llnl bsl facility would not be an attractive terrorist target.specifically,the doe explained that the llnl bsl would not alter the status quo basis because there are hundreds of other bsl facilities in the united states that regularly handle and store the same substances,and moreover,that such substances are also available to potential terrorists from common environmental sources.
tri valley cares contends that the doe analysis is deficient because,pursuant to a,the doe must assess the risk of terrorist theft and release in the context of the livermore locale.we disagree.although a suggests that actions are generally evaluated in the context of a project locale,nothing in the regulation prohibits the doe from exercising its discretion to apply a nationwide analysis when appropriate.see parks babbit,d,cir.the identification of the geographic area within which a project impacts on the environmental resources may occur is a task assigned to the special competency of the appropriate agencies.kleppe sierra club.
we find that the doe determination of the potential impact of a terrorist theft and release of a pathogen on a national level satisfies nepa because the record does not show any meaningful difference between the materials present at the llnl bsl facility and those present at other bsl facilities nationwide.nowhere in the record is there any proof that the llnl bsl facility is more prone or attractive to terrorist theft and release of a pathogen by an outsider than any other bsl facility.to the contrary,the record reveals that llnl is actually one of the most heavily guarded federal facilities,in contrast to hundreds of relatively unguarded bsl facilities nationwide.given that there are more than other bsl facilities nationwide,many of which lack the safeguards of llnl bsl facility,and further,given that many of the bsl pathogens also exist in the natural environment,doe reasonably concluded that the construction of a bsl facility at llnl did not change the status quo,and therefore found no significant impact.see burbank anti noise group goldschmidt,cir holding that where a proposed project does not alter the status quo then it does not have a significant impact.accordingly,we find that the doe reasonably exercised its discretion in determining no significant impact from the threat of theft and release by a llnl bsl terrorist outsider.
theft and release by a llnl bsl terrorist insider 
lastly,the doe discussion of the impact of the potential theft and release of a pathogen by an llnl bsl terrorist insider also satisfies nepa.although the doe did not use an empirical model,it engaged in a thorough probabilistic analysis that assessed the probability that an insider with access to bsl pathogens would have the motive to commit such an attack and the public threat that would result,assuming that an insider did have the access and motive to release a pathogen.
tri valley cares claim that the doe violated nepa because it did not employ empirical analysis fails.empirical analysis is not required under nepa an agency must only provide a convincing statement of why the threat did not require an eis.see ocean advocates army corps.of eng rs,cir.the doe laid out its probabilistic analysis,discretely defined the scope of its inquiry,and thoughtfully examined the likelihood of an insider stealing and releasing pathogens from llnl.based upon the facts that a very small number of people have access to the select agents at llnl bsl,all of whom are subject to extensive screening procedures from multiple agencies and the form and quantities of the pathogens at llnl bsl would require significant additional efforts to bring about a terrorist attack,the doe concluded that the threat of a theft and release by an insider was not significant.the doe methodical inquiry satisfies nepa requirement that it provide a convincing statement as to why the threat did not require an eis.accordingly,we find that the doe reasonably concluded,based upon its discretion and a thorough examination of the evidence in the record,that threat of terrorist attack by a theft and release from an llnl bsl terrorist insider was not significant.
adequacy of the frea 
the purpose of an ea under nepa is not to amass and disclose all possible details regarding a proposal,but to create a concise public document that serves to b riefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact.league of wilderness defenders blue mountains biodiversity project allen,cir nepa review must concentrate on the issues that are truly significant to the action,rather than amassing needless detail.quoting b.an ea must provide the public with sufficient environmental information,considered in the totality of the circumstances,to permit members of the public to weigh in with their views and thus inform the agency process.bering strait citizens army corps.of eng rs,cir.
a.the anthrax shipping incident 
tri valley cares maintains that the doe did not satisfy the standard set forth in mothers for peace i,which held that nepa serves two fundamental purposes to require agency consideration of detailed information concerning significant environmental impacts and to ensure that the public can both access and contribute to that body of information via comments.mothers for peace i,at citing dep t of trans.public citizen,emphasis added.specifically,tri valley cares claims that the doe violated nepa by failing to fully disclose a anthrax shipping incident,therefore depriving the public of the ability to comment.
the incident involved a professor at louisiana state university who owned a collection of anthrax samples used at llnl and contracted with a former llnl employee to return to llnl to package and ship the collection to two private labs.the former employee returned to llnl on august,and packaged and shipped samples from the collection to one of the labs,without incident.on september,the former employee returned to the facility to ship samples to the other lab.the shipment arrived intact but the second lab noted discrepancies between the shipment received and the inventory.finally,on september,the former employee sent a second shipment of samples to the first lab.in unpacking the vials,employees at the first lab discovered improperly sealed vials,and were exposed to anthrax that had leaked into the interior packaging.the first lab concluded,however,that nothing was detected on the outside of the shipping container and therefore the leak was not a public health issue.as a result of the incident,the cdc suspended all transfers of select agents from llnl,and llnl voluntarily suspended all work with select agents pending an investigation.it also established an incident analysis committee.in december,the incident analysis committee completed a comprehensive report identifying areas in need of correction and tracing many of the causes of the incident to the unique role of the former employee.in response,llnl implemented numerous corrective actions,including expanding the select agent security plan.in february,dot examined llnl select agent program,concluded that the new procedures were sufficient and that the incident resulted from an unusual event.on april,the doe authorized the resumption of select agent work at llnl.
in the original ea,the doe reasoned that the addition of samples from llnl to the hundreds of tons of infectious material already shipped daily would not have a significant impact on the risk of transportation accidents.in the drea,the doe added a brief discussion of the shipping incident,without identifying the select agent involved,but found that a more detailed discussion was not warranted when considered against the history of safe shipments of hundreds of tons of infectious materials.following public comment to the disclosure of this incident in the drea,including comments from tri valley cares itself,the doe revised the frea to include an even more detailed discussion of the anthrax shipping incident in the hope of providing the public with a better understand ing of why the incident did not add si
