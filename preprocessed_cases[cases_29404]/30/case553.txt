in kennedy building associates cbs corporation kennedy ii,cir,we remanded in part for modification of the district court injunction,asking the district court to determine which requirements of the minnesota decision document were necessary to accomplish the goals of the minnesota environmental rights act mera.et.the district court modified injunction states that cbs has substantially complied with the minnesota decision document and imposes no additional requirements.kennedy appeals.kennedy also argues that the district court order denying its requests to increase the amount of the performance bond posted by cbs and for response costs was in error.we affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.
in our previous decisions,kennedy building associates viacom,kennedy i,cir and kennedy ii,cir,we have detailed the history of the kennedy building site.the property was previously owned by westinghouse,which operated an electrical transformer repair facility there.these operations led to significant contamination of the building,surrounding soil,and groundwater with polychlorinated byphenyls pcbs and chlorobenzenes,which are hazardous substances.westinghouse was virtually certain that there was pcb contamination on the property.despite this knowledge,westinghouse sold the site to hillcrest development company in without disclosing the probable contamination.in,gerald trooien,a partner in kennedy building associates,bought the property and transferred it to kennedy.
in,kennedy discovered the contamination.kennedy reported the contamination to the minnesota pollution control agency the agency and began further investigations and of the site.kennedy then brought suit against cbs,the successor in interest to westinghouse the district court found cbs liable under the federal comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act cercla and the minnesota environmental response and liability act merla.the court awarded kennedy in statutory response costs and issued a declaratory judgment of liability for future response costs,which cbs did not appeal see kennedy i,at.the court also issued an injunction under mera,requiring cbs to clean up the contamination at the site.cbs appealed the injunction,and we reversed and remanded for more precise definition of the specific acts required of cbs and to limit its scope to only that relief authorized by mera id.at.
before the kennedy i proceedings,cbs entered into a consent order with the agency that would lead to the development and implementation of a response action plan plan to clean up pollution at the kennedy building site.on remand from kennedy i,the district court held the case in abeyance for the development of the plan.kennedy participated in the comment process.relevant to this appeal,kennedy commented that absent the removal of all contaminated soils from the site,the asphalt cap will have to be maintained indefinitely to prevent water infiltration.kennedy specifically objected to the inclusion of permeable,unpaved islands in the parking lot plans submitted by cbs.the agency considered this comment and responded that any concern regarding residual contamination would be addressed by monitoring.further,it explained that replacement of the asphalt surface is not an integral part of the remedial action it is solely for the purpose of site restoration.at the end of the administrative process,the requirements of the plan were laid out in the minnesota decision document decision document issued by the agency.the plan required cbs to perform site preparation and asphalt removal soil excavation and confirmation sampling disposal,backfilling of excavated areas,site restoration,and resurfacing of excavated areas and long term monitoring.the decision document also noted that cbs is obligated to perform future additional remedial action upon redevelopment or exposure of remotely accessible soils.
on february,the district court issued an order modifying the injunction to incorporate the plan requirements from the decision document,order cbs to provide the court with the results of periodic testing,and order further remedial action contingent on tests showing the spread of contamination or redevelopment that would expose unremediated soils.the court also required cbs to post a bond to cover costs of future relief,which was later set at.cbs appealed,arguing that the injunction was not sufficiently specific,that the evidence showed there was no need for injunctive relief under mera,and that the district court did not have the power to require cbs to post a bond.in kennedy ii,we affirmed as to the latter two arguments,but found the injunction to lack the required specificity and remanded with instructions that the district court expressly list those actions required by the injunction.at.
cbs implemented the plan,beginning work in july.the plan required cbs to excavate all contaminated soil up to twelve feet below the surface and backfill with clean fill.this excavation covered most of the lot and was particularly extensive on the east and north sides of the building.in order to complete the required excavation without risk of severe structural damage,cbs determined that it was necessary to install a system of concrete buttresses on the east and north sides of the building.rather than removing the buttresses after excavation and backfill,cbs determined that it was preferable to leave them in place.they were covered with backfill and paved over when the parking lot was restored.restoration of the site,including permanent paving of the parking lot,was completed in may.throughout the implementation of the plan,kba alleges that it incurred expenses due to testing soil,holding meetings,having building personnel provide access to various parts of the kennedy building,and obtaining advice regarding various issues.
the district court hearing regarding modification of the injunction on remand and kennedy motion for additional relief was set for september.on august,the agency issued a letter approving cbs response action implementation report with the addition of a monitoring well.kennedy contended that cbs remedial action did not comply with the requirements in the decision document and asked the district court to impose additional requirements.kennedy also moved the district court to increase the bond posted by cbs and to award kennedy in response costs.the district court modified the injunction to impose no further requirements on cbs declined to increase the amount of the bond and denied kennedy motion for response costs.we affirm the district court as to the mera injunction and bond issues.we remand for further proceedings on response costs.
kennedy appeals the district court modification of paragraph of the mera injunction on remand to impose no further requirements on cbs,except those in paragraphs remediation and bond and remediation,previously affirmed by this court.
at the outset,kennedy argues that the district court did not comply with the appellate mandate when it failed to determine which of the decision document requirements further the purposes of mera and independently evaluate cbs performance of the applicable decision document requirements.in kennedy ii,we remanded the injunction to the district court to ensure that it specifically enumerated any requirements it placed on a party.at.the district court order did not set out detailed factual findings.rather,it explicitly found only that cbs had substantially performed the remediation requirements imposed upon it by the minnesota decision document.we conclude that the district court order is consistent with our mandate.see duncan energy forest,cir reviewing implementation of appellate mandate.because the district court did not order any further relief,our mandate did not require detailed findings although more detailed findings of fact would assist the parties and this court,the district court findings were sufficient to provide a basis for its decision and permit our review.see swanson youngdale,seagrave,cir detailed findings unnecessary when,inter alia,record itself sufficiently informs the court of the basis for the trial court decision internal quotation omitted see also snyder dewoskin in re mahendra,cir district court may adopt rationale of prevailing party by implication.
next,kennedy argues that the district court erred in determining that no further relief was necessary under paragraph of the injunction.we review the district court issuance of a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion.united states bailey,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when it bases its decision on a legal error or a clearly erroneous finding of fact.id.quoting roach stouffer,cir in turn quoting kennedy ii,at.a factual finding supported by substantial evidence on the record is not clearly erroneous,robinson geico ins,cir,even where we would have viewed the evidence differently had we been sitting as the trier of fact.dixon crete med.clinic,cir.
there is substantial evidence in the record that cbs completed the remediation required by the decision document.cbs submissions to the agency,the district court,and this court point to substantial record evidence that all accessible and remotely accessible soils above contamination standards have been removed and replaced with clean dirt and the parking surface was restored kennedy does not contest that cbs carried out these remedial actions in accordance with the decision document,nor that cbs repaved the parking lot.rather,kennedy makes specific contentions that certain aspects of the remediation were inadequate.for kennedy to prevail,it must show that the district court clearly erred in rejecting its contentions that the buttresses parking lot did not comply with the decision document and were necessary to protect the environment.see kennedy i,at purpose of injunction to protect kennedy rights if agency fail ed to devote the resources to see that cbs performed.
first,kennedy contends that the buttress system installed by cbs is a structure that must be removed under the terms of the decision document and poses a threat of contamination.kennedy argues that cbs did not disclose the permanent installation of buttresses to the agency and thus,no determination has been made as to whether they violate the terms of the decision document.the record reveals,however,that the buttresses are depicted in the exhibits to the remedial action implementation report submitted to the agency and that the district court was clearly apprised of their existence.we are persuaded that the permanent installation of foundation support does not violate the terms of the decision document for instance,the decision document discusses using grout,also a permanent installation,to stabilize the building as one of a list of options.we further conclude that substantial evidence supports the district court determination that removal of the buttresses is not required by the decision document or by the goal of protecting natural resources.the record discloses measures taken to prevent pcb and cholorbenzene contamination of the buttresses,such as use and disposal of plastic lining,removal of all contaminated soil around the buttresses,and installation of clean fill.despite kennedy expert testimony that contamination of the buttresses was likely,it was not clearly erroneous to find that the protective measures were taken by cbs were sufficient.finally,kennedy argument about the potential for future contamination at the time of buttress removal and disposal is unavailing.injunctive relief will not issue to address speculative future harm.see hbe,cir 
second,kennedy contends that cbs did not comply with the decision document requirements for restoring its parking lot,and argues that the current design,including permeable islands in the asphalt parking lot,poses a threat of pollution,impairment,or destruction to natural resources.substantial evidence supports the district court rejection of this factual contention.although the decision document required cbs to reinstall asphalt,it noted that the replacement of the asphalt surface is not an integral part of the remedial action it is solely for the purpose of site restoration.during the comment process,kennedy expressed concern that poor maintenance of the asphalt and the inclusion of green space in the parking lot design created the risk that contamination would spread.the agency considered kennedy comment and concluded that there was no significant risk of such migration and the monitoring requirements were sufficient to address any concerns,and reiterated its position that reinstallation of the asphalt was for restoration rather than remediation.kennedy complaints regarding the design of the parking lot,which was reconfigured to comply with city of minneapolis permit requirements,show neither that cbs failed to comply with the decision document nor that the parking lot design endangers natural resources.
the district court did not clearly err in finding that cbs substantially complied with the decision document and rejecting kennedy proposed factual findings that the parking lot and buttresses endangered natural resources.thus we find no error in the district court conclusion that no further injunctive relief was necessary under paragraph.mera permits the court to impose equitable relief only if it is necessary or appropriate to protect the air,water,land,or other natural resources located within the state from pollution,impairment,or destruction.
the district court modification of paragraph of the mera injunction was not an abuse of discretion.
kennedy appeals the district court denial of its motion to increase the bond posted by cbs to cover the cost of future remediation.kennedy argues that the excavation conducted by cbs uncovered greater quantities of contaminated soil and greater concentration of contaminants than expected,resulting in higher than anticipated future remediation costs.accordingly,it moved the district court to increase the bond amount imposed by the injunction,and affirmed in kennedy ii,from to.the district court summarily denied kennedy motion.cbs urges us to affirm,arguing that kennedy proposed motion was outside the scope of remand from kennedy ii,and that kennedy previously waived the issue.further,cbs argues that there has been no change in circumstances that permits the district court to reconsider the amount of the bond.
to the extent that kennedy argues that the district court could have revisited this issue under our kennedy ii remand,we review the scope of the mandate de novo.see duncan energy,at.otherwise,we review the district court denial of a motion to modify a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion,unless denial is based on purely legal grounds which we review de novo.see lone star steakhouse saloon,longhorn steaks,cir modification of permanent injunction reviewed for abuse of discretion jones swanson swanson,cir denial of rule b motion generally reviewed for abuse of discretion denial on purely legal grounds reviewed de novo.w e may affirm the district court on any basis supported by the record.jones united states jones,cir quoting harper,cir.
in kennedy ii,we remanded the injunction to the district court for a modification of paragraph of the injunction,as discussed above.although kennedy motion below to increase the bond was styled separately from its suggestions for modification on remand,kennedy now appears to argue that the bond amount is within the scope of the remand because the purpose of the bond is to ensure that the mera injunction is properly implemented.our remand in kennedy ii,however,did not instruct the district court to modify paragraph of the injunction,which ordered the bond,or the subsequent order setting the bond amount.further,we limited the scope of the district court modification of paragraph to specify ing which requirements of the decision document were to be included in the injunction.at.as cbs points out,a bond requirement was not adopted in the decision document.we conclude that the bond amount is outside the scope of the remand,and thus the district court was without authority under the kennedy ii mandate to increase the bond.bethea levi strauss,cir on remand district court ha s no authority to grant further relief on issues not in front of appellate court.
