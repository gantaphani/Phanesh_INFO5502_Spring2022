the miccosukee tribe is a federally recognized indian tribe whose members reside and work within the florida everglades.the southern everglades restoration alliance sera is a group organized and funded at least in part by certain federal agencies to assist themselves and other agencies in developing strategies for implementing restoration projects in the everglades.the tribe believes that the advice sera has provided to federal agencies has caused continuing damage to tribal lands in the everglades.as a result,the tribe brought a lawsuit under the federal advisory committee act faca.et,seeking a declaratory judgment that sera was an advisory committee within the meaning and coverage of the act,that it was therefore subject to the requirements of the act,and that sera and its member agencies had failed to comply with those requirements,resulting in sera actions being void.sera is now defunct,but the tribe also sought an injunction against the use of any of its advice and the tribe calls sera work product by any of the agencies named as defendants.the named defendants,in addition to sera itself and its former executive director,lewis hornung,included a number of federal agencies and officials who allegedly had participated in sera or had relied on advice given by sera in implementing restoration projects in the everglades 
the district court,after finding that the tribe had standing to bring the lawsuit,determined that although sera did fall within the plain meaning of the statutory term advisory committee,it was not within the intended scope of faca.that determination led to the district court conclusion that the tribe had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.we disagree with the district court decision and reverse the judgment of dismissal as to virtually all of the defendants,affirming it only as to sera itself and hornung.
background 
sera ceased to exist sometime in,but according to the complaint,in the sera had been organized and funded by federal agencies to assist its members,both federal and state agencies in developing strategies for implementing restoration projects in the florida everglades.the sera members collaborated to provide advice and recommendations for use in implementing various federal policies and programs dealing with the everglades,including,for example,the modified water deliveries project,which was designed to restore more natural hydropatterns in water conservation areas of the everglades.
sera failed to comply with some of the requirements of faca,which governs the procedures certain committees established by the executive branch must follow.for example,faca requires notice of meetings of the committees or agencies it covers to be published in the federal register,see.a,and none of sera meetings were.
the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim,or in the alternative,for summary judgment,contending,among other things,that the tribe lacked standing to bring the lawsuit that sera was not governed by faca because it did not meet that act definition of advisory committee and did not fall within the act purposes and that even if sera would otherwise have been within the scope of faca,it was taken out by virtue of the unfunded mandates reform act,et.after staying discovery,the district court granted the motion to dismiss the complaint,concluding that sera was not a committee governed by faca because,although it did meet the plain language of faca statutory requirements as set forth in the definition of advisory committee,it did not fall within the spirit of the statute as revealed by its legislative history.the tribe appealed.
ii.discussion 
a threshold issue in this case is whether the tribe has standing to seek the relief it is seeking under faca.the district court believed that the tribe had alleged a sufficiently concrete and redressable injury to establish standing.reviewing the issue de novo,florida ass of med.equip.dealers apfel,cir,we agree.
in order to establish standing,a plaintiff must allege and eventually prove an injury in fact,which means harm to the plaintiff that is concrete and actual or imminent causation and redressability,which means a likelihood that the requested relief will redress the injury.steel citizens for a better environment,d.the required showing,of course,depends to some extent on the stage of the litigation at which the standing issue is being decided,lujan defenders of wildlife,d,and here we are at the pleading stage.at the pleading stage,general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant conduct may suffice,for on a motion to dismiss we presume that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.id.at.at internal quotations omitted.
the complaint alleges that sera involvement in developing a plan for everglades restoration,which included recommending an alternative plan to the modified water deliveries project a water management plan authorized by congress to protect tribal lands,had delayed the implementation of that congressional plan for restoration of the everglades and had thereby damaged tribal lands.the complaint also alleges that continued reliance on sera advice will result in decisions further delaying the implementation of the congressional project,which will in turn continue to damage the land that the tribe relies on for its subsistence.see id.
the defendants contend that the tribe has failed to show it has standing because the alleged injury is too general the tribe has not adequately alleged the failure of sera to follow the faca procedures caused the damage to tribal lands which the tribe asserts as its injury and a use injunction would not redress the claimed injury,because the complaint does not allege how sera advice might be relied on in the future to cause harm,especially since sera no longer exists.according to the defendants,in order to establish standing,the tribe was required to plead specific facts describing the advice sera had given that delayed implementation of the congressional plan,how that advice had influenced the final policy decision of the federal agency or agencies,and how the final decision had resulted in damage to tribal lands and would continue to damage them in the future.
if this case were at the summary judgment stage,and discovery had been conducted instead of stayed,we might agree with the defendants arguments.see lujan,at.at in response to a summary judgment motion the plaintiff can no longer rest on mere allegations,acceptable at the pleading stage but must set forth by affidavit or other evidence specific facts.but that is not where this case is.it is only at the motion to dismiss stage,and at this stage the tribe is only required to generally allege a redressable injury caused by the actions of sera about which it complains.see lujan,at.at.it has done that.without discovery,the tribe is not expected to allege more particular information,such as the specific advice sera gave which resulted in delaying implementation of the congressional project,especially since sera allegedly did not make public its advice and recommendations.see complaint.
taken as true for purposes of the motion to dismiss,the tribe allegations of a past and continuing injury to its tribal lands allegedly caused by federal agencies actual and continuing reliance on sera recommendations that were arrived at in violation of faca establishes injury in fact and causation for present purposes.see rivers coalition dep t of the interior,cir a court may properly enjoin the government use of a product created by a committee that failed to comply with faca requirements.and the alleged injury could well be redressed by prohibiting the use of sera recommendations by the defendant federal agencies.see generally byrd epa,rejecting argument that plaintiff injury was not redressable because the panel that had allegedly operated in violation of faca had disbanded.in short,the tribe in its complaint met the standard for establishing standing at the pleading stage.
we agree with sera and hornung,however,that the tribe claim for relief against them is moot.hornung is no longer the executive director of sera,and sera no longer exists.a declaratory judgment and use injunction against the nonexistent sera and against hornung,who no longer holds the now position of sera executive director,would afford the tribe no meaningful relief.see dow jones,kaye,cir.so,we will affirm the district court judgment to the extent it dismisses the complaint insofar as sera itself and hornung are concerned.we turn now to the issues that are not moot,those that have to do with what is to happen to the lawsuit insofar as it concerns the other defendants,those federal agencies that continue to exist and officials in positions at those agencies that continue to exist.
c.the merits 
congress enacted faca in to reform the use of advisory committees by the executive branch.specifically,the act aims to reduce the number of unnecessary committees and to increase the uniformity of procedures for the committees that are necessary.b.to achieve its goal,faca places a number of requirements on advisory committees.an advisory committee is defined in the act as any committee,board,commission,council,conference,panel,task force,or other similar group that is established or utilized by the president or an agency in the interest of obtaining advice or recommendations for one or more federal agencies or officers.the requirements advisory committees have to meet include filing a detailed charter,giving advance notice in the federal register of any meetings,generally holding open meetings,having an officer or employee of the federal government preside over or attend every meeting,making records available to the public,and if the committee is established by legislation or created by the president or other federal official or agency,being fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be performed and not being inappropriately influenced by the appointing authority or by any special interest.
it is undisputed that sera failed to operate in compliance with the requirements faca imposed on advisory committees.the question is whether it was an advisory committee for faca purposes.to answer that question,we look to the statute and the definition of advisory committee which congress gave us to express its intent about the scope of that act.
in faca itself congress said that it meant for the term advisory committee to include any committee,board,commission,council,conference,panel,task force,or other similar group,established or utilized by the president or a federal agency in the interest of obtaining advice or recommendations for the president or one or more agencies or officers of the federal government.it is clear that,at least insofar as the allegations of the complaint are concerned,sera fit within the plain meaning of the statutory definition of an advisory committee.in the words of the complaint,sera was an entity with federal,state,and other member agencies that was organized in the mid by the federal defendants in the interest of obtaining advice or recommendations and coordination regarding their respective activities,especially the implementation of four water projects relating to the everglades,and the federal defendants obtained such advice and recommendations from it.complaint.
the circuit has said that in order to be an advisory committee for purposes of faca definition,a group must have,in large measure,an organized structure,a fixed membership,and a specific purpose and must render advice or recommendations as a group,not as a collection of separate individuals.ass of am.physicians and surgeons,clinton.we need not decide whether we agree with that view,because assuming those characteristics are essential,sera is alleged to have had them.
the supreme court has said that to be a faca advisory committee an entity must have been established by statute,the president or a federal agency in order to provide advice to the federal government.public citizen dep t of justice,d.the complaint alleges that sera was formed or organized by federal agencies in order to give them advice and recommendations about the implementation of federal programs in the everglades.it was allegedly funded by federal agencies and did not select its own agenda,but instead was organized to work on an agenda given to it involving agency projects like the modified water deliveries project.that is enough to establish that it was established to provide advice or recommendations to government agencies.
the circuit has taken the position that in order to qualify as a group established to provide advice or recommendations,within the meaning of faca,the entity also must have been created to provide advice or recommendations with regard to specific government policy and not merely to facilitate an exchange of ideas and information or simply to be an operational committee.see sofamor danek group,gaus,judicial watch,clinton,ass of am.physicians,at.assuming that is correct,the complaint alleges sera was created to implement advice or recommendations,coordinate or integrate activities,create policies or law,or otherwise make decisions involving government policy relating to everglades restoration,which is enough to satisfy the circuit test.complaint.
the district court determined that even though the plain language of faca covers sera,that language is trumped by what the court perceived to be the core concern behind the enactment of government decision making from the undue influence of special interests.relying primarily on public citizen dep t of justice,d,the district court decided,in effect,that the plain language reach of faca exceeds the intended grasp due to the overly broad statutory definition of advisory committee.the district court essentially cured what it thought was congress drafting mistake by interpreting faca to include only those groups or entities that present a danger of undue influence by special interests,which it implicitly defined to be only those whose membership includes at least one entity representing private interests.the court concluded that the failure of the complaint to allege that the members of sera were anything other than state and federal agencies or officials responsible to the heads of their agencies,the president and the public,or that they sought to influence governmental policy regarding restoration programs on the basis of parochial private interests was fatal to the notion that sera was an advisory committee.
that reasoning is replete with errors and the conclusion it reaches is wrong.to begin with,it is not even clear to us that the complaint fails to allege sera included private groups.the complaint says in one place that sera was composed of federal,state,and other member agencies and in another place refers to it as made up of federal and participants and consultants.complaint,emphasis added.at worst,this language is ambiguous other and consultants could mean local government,or they could mean private groups or parties,and because the court was ruling on a motion to dismiss,the complaint should be construed in the light most favorable to the should have been interpreted to include allegations of private party involvement in sera.that error really is not essential to our conclusion,however,because putting aside that factual concern,there are legal flaws in the court reasoning.
the district court relied primarily on the supreme court decision in public citizen,but that case involved a different issue entirely,and much of the reasoning contained in the public citizen opinion actually runs counter to the district court conclusion.for one thing,public citizen does not establish,as the district court thought,that the sole or principal purpose of faca was to protect government decision making from the influence of special interests.to the contrary,what the supreme court said was that faca principal purpose was to enhance the public accountability of advisory committees established by the executive branch and to reduce wasteful expenditures on them.public citizen,at.at.moreover,the bottom line result of the public citizen decision actually runs against what the district court insisted was the principal p
