in exercising judicial review under b of the federal power act fpa,b,the court is again confronted with the unusual statutory configuration where,in granting hydroelectric licenses,the federal energy regulatory commission is obligated both to conduct its own environmental assessment to protect and enhance fish and wildlife and to include such prescription conditions for fishways as the secretary of the interior may direct.see j.wisconsin power and light company petitions for review of commission orders placing conditions on its license as a result of the secretary prescription.essentially,contends that the secretary prescription is unsupported by substantial evidence.although did not argue on rehearing before the commission with the specificity presented in its brief on appeal,because we conclude,in light of the statutory scheme,that there was a reasonable ground for failure so to do under fpa b,the court has jurisdiction to address the merits of petition.upon so doing,we conclude that challenges to the secretary prescription conditions lack merit and that any challenge it may have to potential costs of fishway devices is not ripe.
fpa j provides that in order to adequately and equitably protect,mitigate damages to,and enhance,fish and wildlife including related spawning groups and habitat affected by the development,operation,and management of the project,each hydroelectric license issued by the commission shall include conditions for such protection,mitigation,and enhancement.j.however,regardless of what conditions the commission may or may not include in a license,fpa provides that the commission shall require the construction,maintenance,and operation by a licensee at its own expense of such fishways as may be prescribed by the secretary of the interior or the secretary of commerce,as appropriate.id.at.both provisions were at issue in the proceedings before the commission involving license application.
the prairie du sac hydroelectric project the project is a megawatt dam located on the wisconsin river in wisconsin about ninety miles upstream of the mississippi river.see wisconsin power light,ferc at,wl initial order.it was constructed and initially operated pursuant to a fifty year federal permit,which expired in.see wisconsin power light,ferc,wl,reh g denied,ferc,wl.after the commission determined in that the project must be licensed,see,applied for an original license to continue to operate and maintain the project.notice of the application was published on august,and on december,notice issued that the application was ready for environmental analysis.see initial order at.in,the secretary of the interior,for the fish and wildlife service,and in collaboration with the wisconsin department of natural resources the department,submitted recommended license conditions pursuant to fpa j.the secretary also requested that any license include a provision reserving the secretary authority to prescribe the construction,operation,and maintenance of appropriate fishways at the project.the commission issued a final environmental assessment on november.in january,the secretary and the department called the commission attention to the recent removal of four dams opening up an additional miles of river upstream of the project and providing substantial spawning and foraging habitat for riverine fish,and reiterated their j recommendations that upstream fish passage facilities be installed at the project.
on june,the commission granted a thirty year license for the project subject to conditions.the license included most j recommendations,with the exception of those concerning fish passage.rejecting the recommendations of the secretary and the department,the commission did not include conditions in the license requiring to make provision for the upstream movement of fish around the dam or to take measures to protect fish from injury when traveling downstream through the project.the commission,adopting a staff report,found no evidence of an effect on fish populations due to turbine mortality or fish entrainment,whereby fish enter the project water intakes and pass through its generating turbines,and therefore declined to require the installation of expensive protection devices.id.at.the commission likewise determined that,because of the dubious chance for success and high construction costs,measures were not required to permit fish to travel upstream around the dam.id.at.instead,the commission recommended that develop a plan in consultation with the secretary and the department to identify specific measures to enhance fishery and other aquatic resources in the project vicinity.while concluding the fishways would not be in the public interest,the commission stated that should new information in the future indicate a different finding,the secretary prescription authority was reserved.id.
the secretary and the department requested rehearing,citing new information and changed circumstances,and the secretary resubmitted her fishways recommendations as a prescription.the new information related to recent research on additional passage strategies applicable to the project,and the changed circumstances related to the removal of four upstream dams after the commission had concluded its environmental assessment.the commission included the prescription as conditions in the license and dismissed the rehearing requests as moot.see order on rehearing and amending license,ferc,wl amended license order.among other things,the amended license required,in coordination with the secretary and the department,to install within one year fish protective devices to prevent fish from entering the turbines complete within one year a detailed engineering and biological study of fishway alternatives at the dam,including identifying and detailing the costs of a proposed solution to allow fish passage design,build,test and refine within three years the fishway approved by the secretary and the department and incorporate within one year thereafter any fishway refinements found necessary by the secretary and the department.id.
sought rehearing of the amended license order on the ground that the commission inadequately explained the reversal of its initial order.in the request for rehearing,argued that there was no reasoned basis for the commission imposition of additional conditions in the amended license,and that no record evidence demonstrated the need for devices.even if circumstances had changed since the commission completed its environmental assessment,argued,the commission had erred by failing to consider cost and technical issues in amending the license.the commission denied rehearing because t he commission has no authority to amend or reject a section prescription that is timely filed.order denying rehearing,ferc,wl rehearing order.
petitions for review of the commission orders on the ground that the secretary prescription was arbitrary and capricious because the record fails to show that fish entrainment at the project has an adverse effect on fishery resources,that the prescribed entrainment protective devices are technically feasible,would be effective,and survive a analysis,and that the fish species the secretary seeks to protect would use or benefit from the prescribed upstream fish passage facilities.
as a threshold matter,the secretary challenges the jurisdiction of the court to consider challenge to the secretary fishways prescription.because,according to the secretary,did not argue in its request for rehearing by the commission that the secretary conditions are not supported by substantial evidence,but instead claimed only that the commission had failed to justify the change from its original decision not to impose fishway conditions,the secretary maintains that the court may not consider the contentions presented in brief.
fpa b provides in pertinent part that n o objection to the order of the commission shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the commission in the application for rehearing unless there is reasonable ground for failure so to do.b.this court strictly construes the jurisdictional requirement that such objections must be specific.see office of the consumers counsel,state of ohio ferc,town of norwood ferc.although the court seldom finds reasonable grounds for failure to raise specifically objections before the commission prior to raising them on judicial review,see public service of new mexico ferc,rehearing en banc denied,petition presents an extraordinary situation where such reasonable grounds existed.see public service of new mexico ferc,asarco,ferc.
in bangor company ferc,the court held that fpa mandates inclusion of the secretary fishway prescriptions as a condition of the commission license.see also american rivers ferc,cir wisconsin pub.serv.ferc,cir wiscpsc lynchburg hydro,ferc,at escondido mut.water la jolla band of mission indians,d.the court also held that while the commission is the proper party to be named as respondent,the commission has no authority to review the secretary prescription and instead acts as a neutral forum responsible for compiling the record for judicial review.see bangor,at.at most,if the commission determines that a license as conditioned should not issue,it can refuse to license a project.see id.at escondido,at.at.it followed that once the commission issues a license containing the secretary prescription,the challenge to the prescription occurs in the court of appeals,and not before the commission on rehearing.see bangor,at escondido,at.at.
under the interpretation of the statutory scheme adopted in bangor,at,where a party seeks to challenge the secretary prescription,as opposed to a determination that the commission has authority to review,the request for rehearing by the commission is a mere formality necessitated by fpa b.in order to preserve its right to judicial review,then,had to apply for rehearing,but it did not have to develop its objections with the usual specificity that is required under fpa.compare motor equipment mfrs.ass nichols.doing so would have been useless because the commission could not review the secretary prescription.the fact that rehearing request was succinct does not affect the court jurisdiction over petition for review based upon the administrative record before the commission.although the rehearing request focused on the commission failure to examine the administrative record underlying the secretary prescription,it also stated that there was a lack of record evidence to support the conditions imposed in the amended license.conceivably,the commission could have responded to the rehearing request by inviting the secretary to supplement the administrative record.bangor,at.but at this stage of the proceedings it is too late to pursue that alternative.in bangor,the court declined to remand to allow the secretary to supplement the administrative record,and also denied the secretary motion to add to the record before the court because congress intended that the secretary prescription be supported based on the record before the commission as would any other commission licensing requirement.see b.
accordingly,because fpa b contemplates situations in which the court will review matters not presented to the commission,we hold in light of the statutory scheme that had a reasonable ground for failing to set forth its objections to the amended license order in its request for rehearing by the commission with the specificity that is customarily required.we therefore turn to the merits of challenge to the secretary prescription as set forth in the amended license order.
fpa b provides that t he finding of the commission as to the facts,if supported by substantial evidence,shall be conclusive.b.the statute implicitly invokes the familiar arbitrary and capricious standard.see bangor,at.thus,in seeking to have the court declare the secretary prescription to be arbitrary or capricious,bears a heavy burden.see transmission access policy study group ferc.the court may not substitute its judgment for that of the secretary,and must consider only whether the secretary decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment,citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d,bearing in mind that s ubstantial evidence means more than a scintilla,but less than a preponderance of the evidence.burns director,office of workers comp.programs.the court,accordingly,must sustain the secretary prescription if it is consistent with law and supported by the evidence presented to the commission,either by the secretary or other interested parties.escondido,at.at.in a prescription case,it is the secretary,and not the commission,judgment to which the court is giving deference.id.at.at.
in contending that the secretary prescription for upstream fish passage was arbitrary and capricious,focuses on the secretary statement that,as regards turbine mortality of fish,biological significance is not the primary issue,but rather that project operation results in the mortality of important fishery resources,which are the property of the state of wisconsin.contends that the record lacks substantial evidence to support the proposition that fishery resources have economic value,and implicitly maintains that any prescription based on an unsupported rationale is arbitrary and capricious.but confuses the rationale provided by the secretary in for recommendations to the commission pursuant to fpa j,j,which obligates the commission to include license conditions that protect and enhance fish and wildlife,with the revised rationale applicable to the secretary prescription.in any event,the secretary recommendations proffered further rationales that are supported by substantial record evidence,such as that reestablishing upstream and safe downstream passage around the project for paddlefish would help considerably to preclude the need for the fish and wildlife service to formally list this species on the federal list of threatened and endangered species and would help considerably to allow this species to be removed from the state list.and,although the secretary prescription incorporated by reference her recommendations,the prescription provided further justifications for the new requirements,namely to provide for safe,timely,and effective fish passage,as well as the protection of threatened species.
moreover,that the protection and conservation of fishery resources underlies the secretary prescriptions need not be proved in every such prescription,for congress has made clear that the purpose of is to provide for safe and timely fish passage,see pub,b,stat,as well as other fish and wildlife benefits both downstream and upstream of a project.conf,at.furthermore,the secretary issued a comprehensive plan that has been accepted by the commission pursuant to fpa a,a.the plan identifies the secretary commitment to protect the quality and quantity of the nation recreational fisheries that she has found to be socially and economically significant.see fisheries usa the recreational fisheries policy of the department of the interior fish and wildlife service at,available at.to serve these goals requires restoration or enhancement of depleted or declining fisheries,such as exist at the project.hence,the secretary need not establish whether fishery resources warrant protection as a general proposition,but rather must provide substantial evidence to show that fishery resources will be adversely affected by a particular project as well as to support the particular solutions for protecting those resources.
contends for the first time on appeal,however,that the secretary is bound by a regulation of the commission to the rationale and evidence provided for the prescription in her initial comments in.see b.although this contention is raised in reply brief,see city of nephi ferc,the contention is flawed in any event.the commission regulation requires the secretary to present her prescription as part of her initial comments filed with the commission,b,but it does not limit the secretary prescription to the state of knowledge and circumstances at the time of her initial comments.nor has the commission so construed it.the initial order,while concluding that a fishway or rehabilitation of the navigation lock would
