this is a record review case in which the appellants,an assortment of environmental organizations,challenge six biological opinions biops issued by the united states fish and wildlife service usfws or fws pursuant to the endangered species act esa,et.the biops in question allowed for timber harvests in specified northwest forests and also authorized incidental takes of the northern spotted owl spotted owl,a threatened species under the esa.this case will bear on how the usfws conducts its duties under the esa in light of the comprehensive northwest forest plan nfp that was implemented,in part,to protect the spotted owl.
we begin by explaining the legal regime created by the esa.for any federal action that may affect a threatened or endangered species or its habitat,the agency contemplating the action the action agency must consult with the consulting agency to ensure that the federal action is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of an endangered or threatened species and that the federal action will not result in the destruction or adverse modification of the designated critical habitat of the listed species.a.these consultations are known as section consultations.the action agency typically makes a written request to the consulting agency,c,and,after formal consultation,the process concludes with the consulting agency issuing a biological opinion.see generally.cattle growers united states fish and wildlife,cir.the biop should address both the jeopardy and critical habitat prongs of section by considering the current status of the species,the environmental baseline,the effects of the proposed action,and the cumulative effects of the proposed action.g.
if the biop concludes that jeopardy is not likely and that there will not be adverse modification of critical habitat,or that there is a reasonable and prudent alternative to the agency action that avoids jeopardy and adverse modification,the fws can issue an incidental take statement its which,if followed,exempts the action agency from the prohibition on takings found in section of the esa.b.if the biop concludes that jeopardy or adverse modification can not be avoided,section g of the esa provides that the action agency may apply for an exemption from section prohibition on taking and the strict civil and criminal penalties associated with such unlawful takings.
we next discuss the northwest forest plan and this litigation.the crux of the challenge revolves around protection of the northern spotted owl,strix occidentalis caurina,a cavity nester that tends to live its adult life in the same territory.as a result of prior litigation,in the spotted owl was listed by the fws as threatened.june,spotted owl hodel.after being required to do so by a court order,spotted owl lujan,the fws delineated the critical habitat for the spotted owl in.
in response to further litigation,the federal government adopted a comprehensive forest management plan for the entire range of the spotted owl known as the northwest forest plan.the nfp survived litigation,see seattle audubon soc y moseley,cir,and currently controls the use of the forests at the heart of this challenge.relevant to this appeal,the nfp allocated the forests into late successional reserves lsrs,matrix lands,and adaptive management areas,with different harvesting rules applied to each area.the lsr allows less harvesting than matrix lands an interagency analysis of the nfp found that it would provide for stable and owl populations,though owl populations were projected to decline in the.the nfp was subject to a section consultation and the resulting biop concerning this broad forest plan found no jeopardy or adverse modification.because the nfp covered such a wide area,from northern washington to northern california,involving virtually all of the federal government forested land in this expansive area,the nfp biop explicitly declined to address the unique impacts of any particular action or implementation of the nfp.the nfp biop did not authorize incidental takes,deferring such consideration instead to future biops that would address specific projects.
since the government approval of the nfp,the fws has issued at least biops and incidental take statements for spotted owls in the lands covered by the nfp.a total of incidental takes of spotted owls have been authorized,and acres of spotted owl habitat have been removed,downgraded,or degraded.six representative biops are the subject of this litigation.the first three are programmatic biops that addressed multiple timber harvest projects covering multiple years.
the first biop is the coos bay biop,completed on february.this biop authorized the removal of acres of suitable owl habitat and acres of critical habitat,and the incidental take of at least eight spotted owls.
the second programmatic biop is the willamette biop,completed on september.this biop allowed the modification of about acres of spotted owl habitat,with more than acres completely removed.acres of critical habitat were to be affected,with acres completely removed.the fws authorized the incidental take of all spotted owls associated with the project.
the third programmatic biop is the rogue valley biop for timber sales in southwest oregon and northern california.the biop authorized the removal of about acres of suitable spotted owl habitat and the degrading of more acres.the biop allowed the incidental take of all spotted owl pairs or resident singles affected by the action.the biop also authorized the likely removal or degradation of acres of critical habitat for spotted owls.
the fourth biop is the upper iron timber sale biop,completed as amended on january.this biop notes four owl pairs,but does not say how many acres of critical habitat will be impacted,though it states that acres of suitable habitat for a specific owl pairing would be affected.the entire project area is classified as critical habitat.the fws authorized the incidental take of two spotted owl pairs.
the fifth biop is acci biop,completed on september.this biop allows harvesting of acres,degradation of acres of critical habitat,and incidental take of all spotted owls associated with the project.
the sixth biop is the la roux timber sale,approved on april.this biop allows for removal of acres of critical habitat,the incidental take of one known owl pair,and well as the incidental take of any owl in the area.
in november,appellants challenged many of the biops issued by the fws in the united states district court for the western district of washington.the challenged biops included the six at issue here.american forest resource council afrc sought,and was granted,permission to intervene.a temporary restraining order sought by appellants to stop these six and other projects was denied,as was the fws and afrc motion to dismiss on finality grounds.in march,the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment as to the six biops in this case.on july,the district court granted summary judgment to the fws and on august,the district court entered judgment.subsequent proceedings led the district court to issue final judgment on the six biops in this case on march.appellants timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.

the appellants challenge the six biops on both the jeopardy analysis and the critical habitat requirements of a section consultation.appellants also challenge whether the fws amendments to the biops are properly before us.
the first requirement of an esa biop is to determine whether the proposed action is likely to jeopardize the continuing existence of the species.here,appellants challenge the fws jeopardy analysis,arguing that the methods employed by the fws do not lead to an accurate picture of the true jeopardy posed to the spotted owl by the approved projects protected by the biops.
appellants first contention is that the fws may not use the changes to the spotted owl habitat as a proxy for the jeopardy that the spotted owl may face from any given proposed project.the fws concedes that it tracks a project effect on the spotted owl primarily by monitoring status and trends in the owl habitat,but argues that such an approach is permissible.
the fws contends that predicting species jeopardy based on habitat degradation is within the realm of agency discretion,is scientifically sound,and has been approved by this court in other contexts.an agency scientific methodology is owed substantial deference,united states alpine land and reservoir,cir,and in the context of deference to scientific methodology,the holding of inland empire pub.lands council united states forest,cir,is apposite.in that case,we deferred to the agency expertise in allowing this proxy on proxy approach 
the test for whether the habitat proxy is permissible in this case is whether it reasonably ensures that the proxy results mirror reality.see idaho sporting,rittenhouse,cir holding that deference to proxy on proxy approaches is not warranted when the proxy method does not reasonably ensure accurate results.cattle growers,at t he use of ecological conditions as a surrogate for defining the amount or extent of incidental take is reasonable so long as these conditions are linked to the take of a protected species.quotation marks omitted.though it is a close case,we conclude that the habitat models used here reasonably ensure that owl population projections from the habitat proxy are accurate.
based on a consideration of the entire record,the use of habitat as a proxy for species in this case makes sense.the habitat analysis here is not just a simplistic x number acres y number of owls type of equation.rather,the habitat proxy takes into account type of land,extent of degradation of the habitat,relationship between different habitats,the owls distribution,and the owls range.the jeopardy analysis also takes into account factors,including competition from other species,forest insects,and disease.this detailed model for owl population is sufficient to ensure that the fws habitat proxy reasonably correlates to the actual population of owls.finally,the habitat proxy does not exist in a vacuum the fws has a program of demographic studies that supplements and verifies the habitat results.bearing in mind the deference owed the fws scientific judgment,alpine land,at,we can not say that use of a habitat proxy was impermissible.
second,appellants argue that the statutory scheme does not allow a habitat proxy method for jeopardy assessment even if habitat proxy is a sound method.the esa is concerned with two variables in the context of species preservation,the amount of species and the amount of species habitat.see,a stating that biops focus on species jeopardy and adverse modification of critical habitat greenpeace marine fisheries,d,noting that there are two standards,species and habitat.appellants argue that because habitat is already accounted for in the adverse modification prong of section analysis,any analysis of jeopardy to species must look to the actual species themselves instead of simply analyzing habitat,or at the very least,must continually verify habitat models by population verifications.
we reject this argument.focus on actual species count is an overly narrow interpretation of what is required under the jeopardy prong.the fws asserts that it uses different methodologies when it analyzes habitat under jeopardy and adverse modification,limiting potential overlap.importantly,if the habitat proxy is used correctly,it can evaluate a species habitat that has not been designated as critical habitat,and thus is indirectly evaluating species that live outside the critical habitat.in the ordinary course,any endangered or threatened species may have some habitat that is not deemed critical habitat.see c noting that,except for circumstances established by the secretary of the interior,critical habitat shall not include the entire geographical area which can be occupied by the threatened or endangered species.further,if habitat models are sufficiently accurate and are robust,in the sense that the results are accurate in many cases,then the models function as if the fws were counting spotted owls.because the esa does not prescribe how the jeopardy prong is to be determined,nor how species populations are to be estimated,we hold that it is a permissible interpretation of the statute to rest the jeopardy analysis on a habitat proxy.
appellants next argue that the fws could not substitute the nfp for independent jeopardy analysis.at the heart of the jeopardy portion of the biop is the interaction of the nfp with the esa.compliance with the nfp is the fws primary justification for its ultimate jeopardy analysis.in the biops at issue,while explicitly not assessing whether the specified projects comply with the nfp the fws relies on the habitat allocation of the nfp especially lsrs for the fws no jeopardy conclusion.the nfp biop did not authorize incidental takes,promising that future project specific biops would consider the issue.the nfp biop said that the nfp would be adjusted based on information developed through future section consultations.now,the project biops are relying on compliance with the nfp to find no jeopardy.appellants argue that this feels like a shell game.
we disagree.it is undisputed that the nfp was developed on sound scientific analysis as an effective method to conserve the spotted owl,and that the associated biops implement this method.moreover,the six biops at issue in their jeopardy analyses did not rely solely on the nfp,but conducted independent analyses of data.we have previously approved programmatic environmental analysis supplemented by later environmental analysis.see salmon river concerned citizens robertson,cir approving such an approach in the nepa context.it should be borne in mind that the nfp is not an ordinary government strategy instead,the history and care in its creation bespeak the massive effort that led to its birth.see seattle audubon soc y lyons,noting that the nfp was the result of a massive effort by the executive branch of the federal government to meet the legal and scientific needs of forest management and reflect s unprecedented thoroughness in doing this complex and difficult job.the nfp is a unique plan that has already been approved by this court,see moseley,cir,and we are hesitant to fault the agency for relying on it in the context of this case.
appellants respond that the nfp lacks effectiveness monitoring results and that the nfp predicted that its effectiveness could not be precisely measured in the early years of implementation.while the lack of effectiveness monitoring coupled with reliance on the nfp for these biops is somewhat troubling,we are reassured that such monitoring is currently being conducted with a report due in.if such effectiveness monitoring were not taking place,or if the monitoring reveals that the nfp is not meeting expectations,we would not allow the fws to rely simply upon the nfp predictions.without such affirmative evidence,however,we refrain from punishing the fws for relying on the unique and extensive northwest forest plan.
the agency summed it up accurately our defense analysis remains fundamentally at a level analogous to implementation monitoring for the nfp.anyone skeptical about the adequacy of the nfp will not be moved by this defense.without more evidence that reliance on the nfp is problematic,we will not order the fws to reinvent the wheel for every biop.we hold that,in the absence of affirmative evidence showing why reliance on the nfp is inadequate or incorrect,the fws may permissibly rely,in part,on the projections and assumptions of the nfp in its jeopardy analysis.
appellants finally allege that there are analytical flaws in the jeopardy analysis.appellants argue that the biops current status analysis is insufficient because it does not discuss the current status of the spotted owl in terms of population size,variability,and stability or the status and distribution of the listed species.second,appellants argue that the environmental baseline,the environmental condition preproject is insufficient because the biops do not take into account past incidental takes.finally,appellants argue that the cumulative effects sections of the biops lack detail and do not explain how changes in the environmental baseline,combined with other potential actions,justify the cumulative effects analysis.
the problem with these arguments is that they attempt to put old wine into new bottles these arguments attack reliance on habitat and the nfp for jeopardy determinations.as we have rejected appellants direct challenge on both these accounts,appellants indirect challenges fail as well.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the fws on the jeopardy analysis.
we next turn to the critical habitat portion of the challenged biops.it is here that the picture is complicated by error and,on our analysis,becomes less rosy for the fws.
appellants first argue that the fws interpretation of adverse modification,is unlawful.esa section consultations require that in every biological opinion,the consulting agency here the fws ensure that the proposed action is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of an endangered or threatened species and that the federal action will not result in the destruction or adverse modification of the designated critical habitat of the listed species.a.
the fws,in turn,defined destruction or adverse modification as 
a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of a listed species.such alterations include,but are not limited to,alterations adversely modifying any of those physical or biological features that were the basis for determining the habitat to be critical.
this regulation requires a close reading to grasp its import.appellants argue that the regulatory definition sets the bar too high because the adverse modification threshold is not triggered by a proposed action until there is an appreciable diminishment of the value of critical habitat for both survival and recovery 
we agree.here,the fws has interpreted destruction or adverse modification as changes to the critical habitat that appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of a listed species.emphases added.this regulatory definition explicitly requires appreciable diminishment of the critical habitat necessary for survival before the destruction or adverse modification standard could ever be met.because it is logical and inevitable that a species requires more critical habitat for recovery than is necessary for the species survival,the regulation singular focus becomes survival.given this literal understanding of the regulation express definition of adverse modification,we consider whether that definition is a permissible interpretation of the esa.
to answer that question,there is no need to go beyond chevron first step in analyzing the permissibility of the regulation the regulatory definition of adverse modification contradicts congress express command.as the fifth and tenth circuits have already recognized,the regulatory definition reads the recovery goal out of the adverse modification inquiry a proposed action adversely modifies critical habitat if,and only if,the value of the critical habitat for survival is appreciably diminished.see cattle growers ass united states fish and wildlife,cir sierra club united states fish and wildlife,cir.the fws could authorize the complete elimination of critical habitat necessary only for recovery,and so long as the smaller amount of critical habitat necessary for survival is not appreciably diminished,then no destruction or adverse modification,as defined by the regulation,has taken place.this can not be right.if the fws follows its own regulation,then it is obligated to be indifferent to,if not to ignore,the recovery goal of critical habitat.
the agency controlling regulation on critical habitat thus offends the esa because the esa was enacted not merely to forestall the extinction of species,promote a species survival,but to allow a species to recover to the point where it may be delisted.see defining conservation as all methods that can be employed to bring any endangered species or threatened species to the point at which the measures provided pursuant to this act are no longer necessary sierra club,at.the esa also defines critical habitat as including the specific areas occupied by the species which are essential to the conservation of the species and the specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by the species that are essential for the conservation of the species a emphases added.by these definitions,it is clear that congress intended that conservation and survival be two different though complementary goals of the esa.see f the secretary shall develop and implement plans for the conservation and survival of endangered species and threatened species.emphasis added.clearly,then,the purpose of establishing critical habitat is for the government to carve out territory that is not only necessary for the species survival but also essential for the species recovery.
congress,by its own language,viewed conservation and survival as distinct,though complementary,goals,and the requirement to preserve critical habitat is designed to promote both conservation and survival.congress said that destruction or adverse modification could occur when sufficient critical habitat is lost so as to threaten a species recovery even if there remains sufficient critical habitat for the species survival.the regulation,by contrast,finds that adverse modification to critical habitat can only occur when there is so much critical habitat lost that a species very survival is threatened.the agency interpretation would drastically narrow the scope of protection commanded by congress under the esa.to define destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat to occur only when there is appreciable diminishment of the value of the critical habitat for both survival and conservation fails to provide protection of habitat when necessary only for species recovery.the narrowing construction implemented by the regulation is regrettably,but blatantly,contradictory to congress express command.where congress in its statutory language required or,the agency in its regulatory definition substituted and.this is not merely a technical glitch,but rather a failure of the regulation to implement congressional will.
the fifth circuit reached this same conclusion in sierra club.reviewing the critical habitat language and the same regulatory definition of destruction or adverse modification,the court held 
conservation is a much broader concept than mere survival.the esa definition of conservation speaks to the recovery of a threatened or endangered species.indeed,in a different section of the esa,the statute distinguishes between conservation and survival.requiring consultation only where an action affects the value of critical habitat to both the recovery and survival of a species imposes a higher threshold than the statutory language permits.
sierra club,at footnotes omitted.the court bolstered its conclusion from the legislative history where congress had considered an earlier critical habitat regulation that required effects on both recovery and survival and had rejected such an interpretation.id.at the fws definition of the modification standard in terms of survival and recovery is consequently an attempt to revive an interpretation that was rejected by congress.we agree with the fifth circuit,and with the tenth circuit analogous reasoning,and hold that the regulatory definition of adverse modification gives too little protection to designated critical habitat.
in circumstances where an agency errs,we may evaluate whether such an error was harmless.see.in applying harmless error analysis,our precedent dictates that the agency must demonstrate that its error on the controlling regulation was harmless 
if the record is not complete,then the requirement that the agency decision be supported by the record becomes almost meaningless.indeed,where the record looks complete on its face and appears to support the decision of the agency but there is a subsequent showing of impropriety in the process,that impropriety creates an appearance of irregularity which the agency must then show to be harmless.
portland audubon soc y endangered species,cir internal citation omitted.here,the incorrect definition created an impropriety in the process,and the it is to answer appellants claims about critical now demonstrate that the definition was harmless.
in the context of agency review,the role of harmless error is constrained.the doctrine may be employed only when a mistake of the administrative body is one that clearly had no bearing on the procedure used or the substance of decision reached.buschmann schweiker,cir internal quotation marks omitted emphases added.in the context of agency,like a biop,we must exercise great caution in applying the harmless error rule in informal agency adjudications including notice and comment rulemaking to avoid gutting the apa procedural requirements,harmless error analysis in administrative rulemaking must therefore focus on the process as well as the result.riverbend farms,madigan,cir emphases added 
that the agency was operating under a regulation that we now hold was impermissible has an inescapable bearing on the requisite showing of whether the fws considered recovery in its critical habitat inquiry.here,the supreme court demands that we afford the agency a presumption of regularity.overton park,at.in other words,the fws must be presumed to have followed the adverse modification regulation.thus,when analyzing the biops critical habitat analysis,we must presume,unless rebutted by evidence in the record,that the fws followed its definition of adverse modification and thereby ignored the evaluation of whether adequate critical habitat would remain to ensure species recovery.
this conclusion that the agency is here bound by the presumption of regularity is only reinforced by the surprising fact that at oral argument the fws asserted that it still believes that its regulation is correct.with the fifth circuit having previously addressed the regulatory infirmity,but with the fws continuing to assert its regulation validity,we have even more reason here to credit the presumption of regularity as dispositive in this case.if the government argues that its regulation is correct,why should we presume anything but that the fws followed it 
the fws could show harmless error by proving that,even if it ignored recovery on the record by following its regulation,it did not affect the result of the critical habitat analysis.if this argument is advanced,the agency is no longer entitled to deference in its defense of the biops.an explanation that even if the fws had not used the incorrect regulatory definition,the same outcome would have resulted is a decision explanation that is disfavored overton park,at.perhaps this is the reason that the government adopts a slightly more refined position in its brief and at oral argument,the fws asserted that it implicitly recognized the central role of recovery in its critical habitat analysis and cites to the federal register where the fws created the northern spotted owl critical habitat.thus,the fws is not arguing that it relied on the regulation and that reliance was harmless.instead,the fws argues that consideration of recovery was implicit in its critical habitat analysis,that no matter how we interpret the adverse modification regulatory definition,the fws meets that standard.we now evaluate that contention by examining the critical habitat analysis in each of the challenged biops 
rogue valley biop 
recovery is mentioned twice in the critical habitat analysis,and both mentions are in the introductory paragraph.the biop specifies that t he purpose of critical habitat is to identify those lands that may require special management to maintain recovery options and t he recovery strategy usdi the final draft recovery plan was incorporated into the nfp which was adopted by the federal government as its contribution to the recovery of the species.this discussion of recovery is descriptive.this section defers analysis of recovery benefit of critical habitat to the consideration of lsrs created by the nfp.moreover,the biop says that the loss of suitable acres would have an adverse effect on the ability of the critical habitat network to function as intended,while also stating that the action would constitute an adverse effect to the critical habitat but would not likely result in adverse modification.this language,seemingly following the incorrect logic of the regulation,can not be read to declare that the agency considered recovery when its regulation told it not to do so.the remainder of critical habitat discussion in this biop revolves around the protections that the nfp,through the lsrs,will give the owls 
willamette province biop 
similar to the rouge valley biop,there is almost a recitation of the role of critical habitat,the draft recovery plan,and the incorporation of that recovery plan within the nfp.this is again descriptive,and,like the rouge valley biop,can not be considered an adequate evaluation of the impact of the proposed action.the biop notes that nonlsr critical habitat would be lost,but because the habitat lsrs would compensate,the loss would not cause adverse modification.
coosbay biop 
there is no discussion of the purpose of critical habitat the words recovery and conservation are not mentioned.the only analysis is the number of acres cut and a reliance on lsrs to compensate for loss of critical habitat.
upper iron timber sale 
there is scant discussion of the effect on the owl habitat,and there is no mention of critical habitat,much less mention of recovery or conservation.
acci,gnat,and smooth juniper timber sales 
in the summary of the effects of these three sales,there is no discussion of recovery or conservation.the analysis gives a percentage loss of certain forest types,critical habitat and lsrs.there is also a section on critical habitat,which discusses the loss of lsr and critical habitat without mentioning,or conducting analysis on,recovery or conservation.
la roux timber sale 
this timber sale discusses the number of acres of suitable habitat lost and talks about dispersal across lsrs.there is a brief discussion of effect on chu,but this is mainly limited to discussion of the amount of habitat lost and that the critical habitat would not lose its overall characteristics.the words recovery or conservation do not appear nor is there specific analysis of these concepts.we can not infer that analysis was conducted but not described in the biop.
looking at what the fws said in the last four biops,the definitional error is not harmless.the presumption is that the agency,by its own regulation,ignored the recovery aspect of critical habitat analysis.nowhere in the four opinions is there a hint of recovery discussion,or any hint that the agency went beyond its regulation.under the rule of chenery,we can not impute an agency rationale under the rationale of morgan,we can not look into the mind of the fws and as dictated by overton park,the fws post hoc to us that concern about conservation infused the critical habitat be rejected,and the agency argument found lacking.for the last four biops,concern about species recovery has left no footprint in the critical habitat analysis.the supreme court precedents prohibit us from implying an analysis that is not shown in the record.for the last four biops,the fws has not clearly shown that the error was harmless.
the question is a bit more difficult for the first two biops.here,the fws twice mentioned recovery that the purpose of critical habitat is to preserve recovery option
