plaintiffs heartwood and regional association of concerned environmentalists collectively heartwood are environmental organizations dedicated to the protection of public lands.their lawsuit in this case was prompted by regulations issued by the united states forest service limiting the notice and appeal rights for a class of actions.the history summarized by the district court explores the genesis of this case.
prior to,the forest service administrative appeal regulations linked administrative review opportunities to the documentation prepared pursuant to the national environmental policy act nepa,and allowed for the appeal of agency decisions documented in a decision memo,decision notice,or a record of decision.the forest service explained the distinction as follows.for actions which significantly affect the environment and for which an environmental impact statement is required under nepa,the forest service documents its decision in a record of decision.where an environmental assessment is prepared and,based on that assessment,the forest service makes a finding of no significant impact on the environment,the determination is documented in a decision notice.finally,actions falling within a class requiring no environmental documentation under nepa and which are categorically excluded under nepa implementing regulations are documented in a decision memo.
in march of,the forest service proposed the elimination of appeals for all those decisions except for appeals of forest plans,characterizing the appeals as,procedurally onerous,confrontational and costly.in the face of significant public opposition to the proposal,congress enacted the appeals reform act of ara which required the forest service to establish a notice and comment process for proposed forest service actions concerning projects and activities implementing land and resource management plans developed under the forest and rangeland renewable resources planning act of and required the forest service to modify the appeals procedure for such projects.the forest service proposed regulations to implement the ara,which provided notice,comment and administrative appeals for all actions except project or activity decisions documented in a decision memo listed in forest service handbook,section,categories through and through.those categories included construction of trails,utility lines,approval of certain special use permits,tree regenerations,prescribed forest burning and cutting designed to improve timber stands,and certain mining investigations which allow the building of up to one mile of roads.prior to that proposed regulation,all projects documented in a decision memo were subject to appeal.the forest service ultimately finalized that regulation,and denied heartwood petition for rulemaking,which had sought the rescission and of the regulation as an improper implementation of the ara.
after allowing some time during which the regulations were in operation in order to assess the impact,heartwood filed suit in november before the statute of limitations expired.heartwood contended that the forest service violated the ara and the administrative procedure act apa by promulgating regulations that improperly exempt many proposed forest service actions from notice,comment and administrative appeal.the complaint sought a declaration that the forest service violated the ara and the apa and a remand of the regulations to the forest service for in accordance with the law,as well as the enjoining of all agency actions that should have provided the public with notice,comment and administrative appeal under the ara.
in response to the suit,the forest service engaged in extensive settlement negotiations with heartwood.on january,and thereafter on nine additional occasions at intervals,the forest service moved to extend the time to file its answer to the complaint in order to complete those negotiations.the negotiations ultimately proved fruitful,and on september,the parties entered into a consent judgment,which the court entered on september.in that consent judgment,the forest service agreed to apply the notice,comment and appeal procedures to a list of projects and activities including some involving recreational uses.some of the numerous projects and activities encompassed within the consent order and subject to notice,comment and appeal included the use of prescribed burning,the creation of wildlife openings,and the designation of certain travel routes for vehicles and the construction of new routes.at this point in time,the shawnee trail conservancy and the blueribbon coalition the recreational groups filed a motion to intervene.the district court granted intervention and also granted the recreational groups motion to vacate the consent judgment pursuant to rule e.in granting the rule e motion,the district court held that the recreational groups were necessary parties to the action under federal rule of civil procedure.
heartwood filed a notice of appeal from that decision and argues before this court that the district court erred in granting the motion to intervene as well as in vacating the consent judgment.in opposition,the recreational groups and the forest service question our appellate jurisdiction to hear this matter and defend the district court decisions,although no party argues that the district court properly determined that the recreational groups were necessary parties.
we turn first to the jurisdictional issue.heartwood acknowledges that the order vacating the consent judgment was not a final judgment and does not premise jurisdiction on that basis.instead,heartwood asserts that the decision was appealable pursuant to a,which allows for the appeal of i nterlocutory orders of the district court granting,continuing,modifying,refusing or dissolving injunctions the supreme court in carson american brands,d,applied that provision to a district court order refusing to approve a consent decree.in that case,the district court refused to approve a consent decree between a tobacco producer and a class of present and former seasonal employees and applicants for employment,in a lawsuit alleging that the tobacco producers had discriminated against the class members in hiring,promotion,transfer,and training opportunities.the consent decree would have required the tobacco producer to give hiring and seniority preferences to employees and to fill of all of the supervisory positions in the richmond leaf department with qualified employees.id.at.the district court refused to approve that consent decree,concluding that it unlawfully granted preferential treatment on the basis of race in violation of title vii absent a showing of present or past discrimination and that the relief must be limited to actual victims of that discrimination.
the fourth circuit refused to review that order on appeal,holding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the order was not a final judgment and was neither a collateral order under nor an interlocutory order refusing an injunction under a.the supreme court,however,reversed that decision,holding that the appellate court had subject matter jurisdiction over the decision refusing to approve the consent decree because that order had the practical effect of refusing an injunction.because a was intended to be a limited exception to the rule,the court in carson held that an interlocutory order that has the practical effect of refusing an injunction is appealable under that provision if the order might have serious,perhaps irreparable,consequences and can be effectually challenged only by immediate appeal.id.at,quoting baltimore contractors,bodinger.in donovan robbins,cir,we summarized the holding of carson 
carson,we conclude,requires that irreparable harm be shown whenever a party wants to appeal immediately either an interlocutory order deferring the entry of a permanent injunction,whether or contained in a proposed consent decree,or an interlocutory order that while not explicitly the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction may have consequences summed up in the words irreparable harm similar to those of such an order
