this appeal involves the review of a final decision by the united states environmental protection agency epa redesignating the status of the cincinnati metropolitan area from nonattainment to attainment for ozone,and approving a clean air maintenance plan for the area.marilyn wall and mike fremont,residents of ohio,filed suit to request that this court vacate the epa decision.the sierra club,an organization with members living in the ohio area,intervened in support of wall and fremont.for the reasons set forth below,we vacate the epa action in redesignating the cincinnati metropolitan area to attainment status for ozone,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
factual background 
ozone is a principal component of urban smog.see,at.as a highly reactive chemical,ozone can create severe health problems such as chest pains,shortness of breath,coughing,nausea,throat irritation,and increased susceptibility to respiratory infections,even when inhaled by healthy adults.id.at.it is also extremely corrosive,causing metals to rust and paints to crack and fade.see id.
pollution sources do not emit ozone directly.instead,its oxides nox and volatile organic compounds vocs react to form ozone in the presence of sunlight.see id.at.these precursors,in turn,are emitted by sources such as motor vehicles,power plants,and industrial factories.because ozone is often formed in large,stagnant air masses that drift from one region to another,air quality models are used to forecast the ozone levels that might result from a particular combination of precursor sources.see ohio epa,cir.
statutory and regulatory background 
national ambient air quality standards 
the clean air act caa,as amended in and,requires the epa to establish national ambient air quality standards naaqs for certain airborne pollutants,including ozone,as necessary to protect the public health and welfare.see caa.under the caa,the epa designates the status of various geographic areas as attainment,nonattainment,or unclassifiable,depending on whether the area meets the naaqs for a particular pollutant.see caa d,d.more stringent air pollution control requirements apply to nonattainment areas than to attainment areas.see caa.nonattainment areas for ozone are further classified as marginal,moderate,serious,severe,or extreme,depending on the severity and persistence of the ozone problem.see caa a b,a b.
responsibility for meeting the naaqs rests with the states.under the caa,each state must draft a state implementation plan sip containing specific pollution control measures for each pollutant.see caa.the caa specifies different deadlines by which marginal,moderate,serious,severe,and extreme ozone nonattainment areas must attain the naaqs,as well as the programs that each state must adopt in its sip to achieve such attainment.see caa.areas with more severe classifications are given more time to reach attainment,but are required to implement more stringent control measures.see caa a.
the epa must review each submitted sip and either approve or disapprove the plan within one year after the agency has determined that the state completed its sip submission.see caa k.if the epa approves the sip,either in whole or in part,then the approved provisions become federally enforceable.see caa.but if the sip is disapproved,then the state becomes subject to sanctions,see caa,as well as to federally imposed clean air measures.see caa c.
evaluation of whether an area has attained the ozone naaqs 
the epa regulations that were promulgated in establish the applicable naaqs for various pollutants and the methodology for determining whether an area has attained that standard.see pt.two types of naaqs are set forth in the regulations national primary ambient air quality standards,which define levels of air quality which the administrator judges are necessary,with an adequate margin of safety,to protect the public health,and national secondary ambient air quality standards,which define levels of air quality which the administrator judges necessary to protect the public welfare from any known or anticipated adverse effects of a pollutant.pt.b.
section a of the regulations sets the primary standard for ozone at a concentration of parts per million.under this section,the ozone standard is attained when the expected number of days per calendar year with maximum hourly average ozone concentrations above parts per million is equal to or less than,as determined by appendix pt.a.appendix h,in turn,explains the methodology by which experimental results are converted into the expected number of days that the ozone standard would be exceeded.see pt,app.because the methodology involves averaging a region results over a period for each monitoring site in the region,an area will attain the naaqs only if,over the period,each of its monitoring sites record three or fewer times during which the ozone concentration has exceeded the naaqs.see id.
requirements for ozone nonattainment areas 
part d of subchapter i of the caa provides specific pollution control requirements that apply only to nonattainment areas.in general,a sip for an ozone nonattainment area must include measures to ensure the timely attainment and maintenance of the standard.see caa a a,c,b.the sip must also include provisions for the enforcement of the measures included in the sip,see caa a c,as well as the commitment of adequate resources and legal authority to implement the enforcement measures.see caa a e i.
for a moderate ozone nonattainment area,a sip must include the following specific measures pollution limits that reflect the reasonably available control technology ract for existing factories that emit vocs,see caa c,b,and procedures to ensure that state and local transportation plans and projects conform to the clean air plans.see caa c a,c a.
requirements for the redesignation of an area from nonattainment to attainment 
a state may request the epa to redesignate an area from nonattainment to attainment status if that area has improved in air quality.see caa d d.after an area is so redesignated,it no longer need comply with the more stringent air pollution measures that apply only to nonattainment areas.caa a i requiring sips for nonattainment areas to meet the applicable requirements of part d of this subchapter.the responsibility,instead,is on the state to apply the enforcement provisions contained in its maintenance plan.see caa d,d requiring maintenance plans that are submitted with redesignation requests to include such contingency provisions as the administrator deems necessary to assure that the state will promptly correct any violation of the standard which occurs after the redesignation of the area as an attainment area.
five criteria must be met for an area to be redesignated from nonattainment to attainment status 
the administrator may not promulgate a redesignation of a nonattainment area or portion thereof to attainment unless 
i the administrator determines that the area has attained the national ambient air quality standard 
ii the administrator has fully approved the applicable implementation plan for the area under section k of this title 
iii the administrator determines that the improvement in air quality is due to permanent and enforceable reductions in emissions resulting from implementation of the applicable implementation plan and applicable federal air pollutant control regulations and other permanent and enforceable reductions 
iv the administrator has fully approved a maintenance plan for the area as meeting the requirements of section of this title and 
v the state containing such area has met all requirements applicable to the area under section of this title and part d of this subchapter.
caa d e.at issue in the present case is whether the cincinnati metropolitan area has met the second,fourth,and fifth criteria.
caa section general enforceability requirements 
to satisfy the second and the fifth redesignation criteria,the epa must fully approve the applicable sip in accordance with of the caa.section k,which is codified at k in the second redesignation criterion,sets forth the process by which the epa must review a sip submission.according to this section,the epa is required to approve or disapprove a submitted sip within one year after concluding that the sip contains the information necessary to enable the administrator to determine whether the plan submission complies with the provisions of this chapter.caa k a.a completed sip submission,in turn,can only be approved if it meets all of the applicable requirements of this chapter.caa k.
subsection a of sets forth the general requirements for a sip.according to this subsection,a sip must include enforceable emission limitations and other control measures,means,or techniques,caa a a,provisions for the establishment and operation of appropriate devices necessary to collect data on ambient air quality,caa a b,and programs to enforce the limitations.see caa a c.
caa section general maintenance requirements 
a maintenance plan is required by caa d e iv as a component of a state redesignation request.such a plan must provide for the maintenance of the naaqs for at least years after the redesignation.caa a.maintenance is demonstrated by showing that future emissions will not exceed the level established in the attainment emissions inventory,which for ozone is parts per million.see pt.a.an epa memorandum states that any final determination regarding the adequacy of a maintenance plan will be made in light of the particular circumstances facing the area proposed for redesignation and based on all relevant information available at the time.memorandum from john calcagni,director,air quality management division,epa,procedures for processing requests to redesignate areas to attainment,calcagni memorandum.
the maintenance plan must also include enforcement provisions as the administrator deems necessary to assure that the state will promptly correct any violation of the standard which occurs after the redesignation of the area as an attainment area.caa d.in particular,these contingency provisions must require the state to implement all of the ozone control measures that were already in the sip prior to the time that the nonattainment area is redesignated to attainment.see id.
part d requirements specifically pertaining to nonattainment areas 
part d of subchapter i of the caa provides specific requirements that a nonattainment area must meet in order to fulfill the fifth criterion for redesignation.there are two subparts at issue in part d subpart,which sets forth the basic requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas,see caa,and subpart,which establishes additional specific requirements for areas classified as marginal,moderate,serious,severe,and extreme nonattainment areas.see caa.as to the relationship between the two subparts,i n some cases,the requirements contained in subparts of part d override subpart general provisions.state implementation plans general preamble for the implementation of title i of the clean air act amendments of.
subpart requirements 
to address air pollution stemming from transportation sources,congress enacted conformity requirements applicable to transportation plans and projects.these requirements,which are part of the caa amendments,provide that no federal agency shall engage in,support in any way or provide financial assistance for,license or permit,or approve,any activity which does not conform to a sip after it has been approved or promulgated under section of this title.c.the determination of conformity shall be based on the most recent estimates of emissions caa c b.
subpart of part d sets forth the actual requirements for federal activities.an activity conforms to a sip if the anticipated emissions from the activity will not frustrate a sip purpose of eliminating or reducing the severity and number of violations of the naaqs and achieving expeditious attainment of such standards,cause or contribute to any new violation,exacerbate an existing violation,or delay the timely attainment of the naaqs or any other such milestones.see caa c a b.
subpart reasonably available control technology ract requirements 
subpart of part d requires a sip for a nonattainment area to contain various ract rules,depending upon the severity of the area nonattainment.the ract rules govern all forms of air pollution from sources other than transportation.for a marginal nonattainment area,a sip is required to adopt a number of general ract rules for existing voc sources.see caa a a.a sip for a moderate nonattainment area must not only comply with the requirements for marginal nonattainment areas,see,but must also adopt additional ract rules for specific categories of voc emissions.see caa b.specifically,caa b a provides as follows 
the state shall submit a revision to the applicable implementation plan to include provisions to require the implementation of reasonably available control technology under section c of this title with respect to e ach category of voc sources in the area covered by a control technique guideline document issued by the administrator between november,and the date of attainment.
the epa has also set forth guidance on how it intends to interpret various provisions of the caa amendments in the general preamble to the amendments,supplemented at,and in various memoranda from its regional offices.in this general preamble,the epa has directly addressed the requirements for redesignation.see.at.
c.the cincinnati metropolitan area status as a nonattainment area 
in,the cincinnati metropolitan area was designated as an ozone nonattainment area pursuant to the amendments to the caa.see approval and promulgation of implementation plans and designation of areas for air quality planning purposes ohio.the cincinnati metropolitan area covers counties in both kentucky and ohio,and is accordingly referred to as a ozone nonattainment area.j.in the year after the caa amendments were passed,the epa reaffirmed its designation of the area for moderate ozone nonattainment,with an attainment deadline of november.see designation of areas for air quality planning purposes.
because of the area status,kentucky and ohio were required to submit revisions to their respective sips by no later than november,taking into account the measures applicable to moderate ozone areas and providing for the attainment of the ozone standard by the november,attainment deadline.see caa b a.both states submitted timely revisions,but the epa was unable to fully approve the submitted sips due to various deficiencies.see approval and promulgation of implementation plans and designation of areas for air quality planning purposes ohio and kentucky,proposed.
the epa never published a notice of disapproval pursuant to caa k because,in november of,kentucky and ohio submitted requests to redesignate the cincinnati metropolitan area to ozone attainment status.the states based their requests on the fact that the area had not violated the ozone naaqs over the previous period.these redesignation requests,however,were eventually denied because the cincinnati metropolitan area had experienced a violation of the ozone naaqs in the summer of.see disapproval of the request to redesignate the kentucky portion of the cincinnati northern kentucky moderate ozone nonattainment area to attainment and the associated maintenance plan.although kentucky petitioned for a review of the agency determination,the agency disapproval was upheld by this court in kentucky epa,wl cir,unpublished table opinion.the epa,rather than publish a notice of disapproval,instead granted the area two extensions.see approval and promulgation of implementation plans and designation of areas for air quality planning purposes ohio and kentucky,june.these extensions are not challenged in the present case.
in,kentucky and ohio again submitted requests to have the cincinnati metropolitan area redesignated to attainment status.their requests were based on three years of ambient air quality monitoring data showing that the area was not in violation of the ozone naaqs for the period from to.the epa also considered data showing that the cincinnati metropolitan area continued to attain the ozone naaqs in.see.at.a notice proposing the approval of kentucky and ohio sip submissions and redesignation requests was published on january.see.at.
in publishing the notice,the epa acknowledged that kentucky did not have fully approved requirements in its sip for the cincinnati metropolitan area.it determined,however,that the part d requirements were not applicable for the purposes of evaluating the redesignation requests because areas are subject to the conformity requirements regardless of whether they are redesignated to attainment and must implement conformity under federal rules if state rules are not yet approved.at.
the epa also acknowledged that ohio had not yet fully adopted the ract rules concerning the categories of voc sources covered by the control technique guideline ctg document issued by the epa between november,and the attainment date.these voc source categories included the aerospace,synthetic organic compound manufacturing,reactor and distillations processes,shipbuilding,and wood furniture industries.see.at.despite its standard redesignation policy that would require full adoption,submission and approval of certain ract rules rules prior to approval of the redesignation request,the epa proposed to depart from this policy by approving kentucky and ohio redesignation request based on the following explanation found in the federal register 
since the due date for the ctg ract rules at issue preceded the submission of the redesignation request,epa believes,however,that in the context of the particular circumstances of this redesignation,that it is permissible to depart from that policy and instead accept a commitment to implement these ract rules as contingency measures in the maintenance plan rather than require full adoption and approval of the rules prior to approval of the redesignation.see grand rapids,michigan,redesignation fr,june,first,the ract rules at issue in this redesignation were not needed to bring about attainment of the standard in cincinnati.second,ohio has demonstrated continued maintenance of the ozone standard through without the implementation of these measures.third,ohio has placed other contingency measures in the maintenance plan that would bring about far greater emission reductions than the ract rules and would therefore be substantially more effective in terms of correcting violations attributable to local emissions from the cincinnati area that may occur after redesignation.
in their comments to the epa notice of proposed approval,wall,fremont,and the sierra club challenged the epa justifications.see letter from marti sinclair,acting chair of the ohio chapter of the sierra club,to elmer bortzer,chief of the regulation development section of the epa.they argued that kentucky and ohio maintenance plans,required under caa,were deficient.to support their argument,the petitioners contended that the caa requires that air quality models be used to determine a state ability to achieve maintenance,which the epa had not done.they also challenged the reliability of the epa assumptions regarding future emission levels,arguing that t he history of this nonattainment area shows that epa can not rationally assume that emission levels correlate with ozone levels in some sort of linear or consistent fashion.
moreover,the petitioners pointed out that the epa had made contradictory findings in a separate rulemaking proceeding dealing with the adoption of more stringent national emission limits for new cars and trucks.see control of air pollution from new motor vehicles tier motor vehicle emissions standards and gasoline sulfur control requirements.in this separate rulemaking proceeding,the epa included the cincinnati metropolitan area on a list of areas certain or highly likely to require additional emission reductions in order to attain and maintain the ozone naaqs.at.this finding was based on computer models that showed that the cincinnati metropolitan area would exceed the ozone naaqs by if no additional emission reductions were made beyond those already expected.see.at.
the petitioners also argued that the maintenance plans failed to comply with caa c e i because the plans lacked explicit commitments of legal authority and resources to implement all of the plans measures.in particular,the petitioners claimed that the maintenance plans lacked enforcement programs,as well as concrete assurances that kentucky and ohio would have the necessary personnel and funding to carry out the plans.
their alternative argument was that the epa had no authority to determine that the requirements of part d,subpart,did not apply to the redesignation requests.according to the petitioners,t he fact that the state is still obligated to submit state transportation conformity procedures and that federal conformity procedures still apply hardly excuses the state failure to adopt such procedures as required by statute.
the final argument of the petitioners was that the epa had no authority to redesignate the cincinnati metropolitan area before the states had fully adopted all of the ract rules of part d,subpart,that were specifically mandated under caa b.they claimed that the caa did not allow the states to defer the adoption of ract rules by incorporating them only as optional contingency measures.furthermore,they reasoned that because of this deficiency in the adoption of the ract rules,the epa never fully approved the sips in accordance with caa k.
five months after the epa published its notice of proposed approval,and after receiving public comments from the petitioners and other parties,the epa made a final determination that the cincinnati metropolitan area had attained the naaqs for ozone and had met the other requirements for redesignation.the epa accordingly issued a final ruling on june,to be effective july,granting kentucky and ohio redesignation requests.see approval and promulgation of implementation plans and designation of areas for air quality planning purposes ohio and kentucky.june.this timely petition for review followed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
a final action of the epa will not be overturned unless the decision is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a see also southwestern.growth alliance browner,cir.the supreme court has established a process for reviewing an agency interpretation of a statute that it administers.see chevron,natural res.def.council,d.if congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,id.at,then this court must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.but if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.
in evaluating whether the epa construction of a statute is permissible,a court need not find that it is the only permissible construction that epa might have adopted but only that epa understanding of this very complex statute is a sufficiently rational one to preclude a court from substituting its judgment for that of epa.chem.mfrs.ass natural res.def.council,d internal quotation marks omitted.this court,however,must also reject administrative constructions that are inconsistent with the statutory mandate,sec.indus.ass bd.of governors of the fed.reserve,d citations omitted,and conduct a searching review of the epa use of air quality projections under the caa,ohio epa,cir.
approval of kentucky and ohio clean air maintenance plans 
wall,fremont,and the sierra club raise three challenges to the epa evaluation of the clean air maintenance plans for the cincinnati metropolitan area.they argue that the methods used by the epa to demonstrate maintenance do not meet the requirements of the caa,the epa own models,applied in a different rulemaking proceeding,demonstrate that the cincinnati metropolitan area will not maintain compliance with the ozone naaqs over the next ten years,and the maintenance plans lack the required resource and authority commitments for enforcement.because of the similarity of the first two arguments,they will be addressed together,while the third argument will be addressed separately.
demonstration of maintenance 
in evaluating kentucky and ohio maintenance plans,the epa used an inventory approach to determine that the states plans would provide for maintenance of the naaqs for at least years after redesignation,as required under caa.this approach involves making two sets of determinations that the area is currently in compliance and that future emissions in the area are projected to remain below the current level for the next ten years.the reasoning behind this approach is that an area is expected to remain in compliance so long as the predicted emissions within the area remain below the level that allowed the area to achieve compliance with the naaqs in the first place.
in the present case,the epa determined that the cincinnati metropolitan area was in attainment for both the to and the to time periods.see.at.the epa also determined that future emissions in the area were projected to decrease from the levels.see id.applying the inventory approach,the agency concluded that the combination of these findings shows that the current level of emissions is adequate to keep the area in attainment for the next ten years.at.
the petitioners,however,argue that the inventory approach does not meet the requirements of the caa.they challenge the epa authority to rely on methods other than air quality modeling to demonstrate maintenance when the demonstration of attainment is not also required.the petitioners point out that under a,the adequacy of a control strategy shall be demonstrated by means of applicable air quality models,data bases,and other requirements specified in appendix w of this part guideline on air quality models.this language,they contend,requires the epa to use modeling to show that the cincinnati metropolitan area will maintain the naaqs.according to their interpretation of this language,the epa reliance on the approach which does not involve modeling,does not meet the requirements of the caa.
the epa response is that the section of the code of federal regulations relied upon by the petitioners applies only to attainment demonstrations,and not to maintenance plans submitted under caa section.in its brief,the agency quotes a,which provides that e ach plan must demonstrate that the measures,rules and regulations contained in it are adequate to provide for the timely attainment and maintenance of the national standard that it implements.the epa also points out that the subsection contains no reference to caa,the section of the caa that specifically addresses maintenance plans.indeed,the epa own interpretive memorandum,published prior to the evaluation of the redesignation request in question,provides that a state may generally demonstrate maintenance of the naaqs by either showing that future emissions of a pollutant or its precursors will not exceed the level of the attainment inventory,or by modeling to show that the future mix of sources and emission rates will not cause a violation of the naaqs.calcagni memorandum,at emphasis added.
although the petitioners interpretation of the relevant language is at least as reasonable as that of the epa,the epa construction is neither impermissible nor in conflict with a statutory mandate.the phrase timely attainment and maintenance could be interpreted as limiting the application of the section exclusively to situations in which the state must demonstrate both attainment and maintenance,rather than encompassing situations in which the state must demonstrate only continued maintenance.moreover,the epa actions are completely consistent with its own interpretive memorandum,which allows for naaqs maintenance to be demonstrated by showing that the future emissions of a pollutant precursors will not exceed the level that allowed the area to achieve attainment in the first place.
the petitioners also point to findings made by the epa in a separate rulemaking proceeding published on february,tier motor vehicle emissions standards and gasoline sulfur control they allege contradict the findings made by the epa in the present case.in the tier rulemaking proceeding,the epa included the cincinnati metropolitan area among those that are certain or highly likely to require additional emission reductions.at.
but the findings in the tier rulemaking proceeding,as the epa explains,are not applicable here.the focus of the tier proceeding was not specifically to evaluate the attainment or nonattainment of the cincinnati metropolitan area,but rather to develop a major program designed to significantly reduce the emissions from new passenger cars and light trucks,including pickup trucks,vans,minivans,and vehicles,vehicles whose emissions contribute heavily to the generation of ozone.at.
furthermore,the epa relied upon more recent data in the present proceeding than in the tier proceeding.the epa points out that the air quality data used in the tier rulemaking proceeding came from before,and did not contain the data that was included in the cincinnati metropolitan area redesignation request.indeed,the epa acknowledged the availability of the more recent air quality data for the cincinnati metropolitan area in a separate tier rulemaking proposal that it published after promulgating the february,tier rule.see control of air pollution from new motor vehicles proposed heavy duty engine and vehicle standards and highway diesel fuel sulfur control requirements,june.
given the differences between the data used to generate the findings in the cincinnati metropolitan area redesignation proceeding and that used in the tier proceeding,the epa decision to treat the tier findings as inapplicable to the present case is a sufficiently rational one to preclude a court from substituting its judgment for that of epa.chem.mfrs.ass natural res.def.council,d.we therefore uphold the epa approval of the two states clean air maintenance plans for the cincinnati metropolitan area.
commitment of enforcement resources and authority 
the petitioners also contend that the epa erred in approving the cincinnati metropolitan area maintenance plans because the submitted plans lacked the required resource and authority commitments for enforcement.according to their argument,caa a c requires that e ach implementation plan include a program to provide for the enforcement of the measures described in the plan.they assert that the statute requires specific enforcement measures to be included in the maintenance plans that are submitted in requests for redesignation.
the petitioners further claim that the epa erred in relying upon the resource and authority commitments contained in the original sips for kentucky and ohio.see approval and promulgation of implementation plans kentucky approval of sulfur dioxide revisions,promulgating the epa approval of kentucky sip,and approval and promulgation of implementation plans ohio,promulgating the epa approval of portions of ohio sip,including the portions pertaining to the cincinnati metropolitan area.as support for their argument,they cite the following federal regulation each plan must include a description of the resources available to the state and local agencies at the date of submission of the plan and of any additional resources needed to carry out the plan during the period following its submission.emphasis added in the petitioners brief.this language,they argue,emphasizes the use of separate,commitments,rather than assum ing that the plan contains adequate enforcement and resource commitments based on inferences about plans from decades ago.
we agree that a more contemporary commitment of resources and authority would allow the states to tailor their commitments specifically to the plans for which epa approval is sought.but there is no language in the caa or in the epa regulations that specifically requires that a separate commitment be made within the maintenance plans themselves.thus,the epa permissibly determined that kentucky and ohio fulfilled the requirement of submitting a program to provide for the enforcement of the maintenance measures when such measures were already approved in their earlier sips.moreover,this decision is in accord with the interpretation given to the caa under the calcagni memorandum,ad
