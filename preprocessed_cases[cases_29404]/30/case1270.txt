plaintiff is a colorado property owner whose land abuts city of moab property containing a former class i landfill moab landfill.because of multiple environmental concerns regarding ownership and management of the landfill,plaintiff brought suit pursuant to the clean water act cwa,the resource conservation recovery act rcra,as well as several causes of action.plaintiff sought an injunction demanding compliance with the relevant statutes in addition to money damages related to the causes of action.in all,he sought relief on seven claims.
protracted litigation ensued.after most of the claims were dismissed by the district court only three of the seven remained to be resolved during the bench rcra claims and one cwa claim.although plaintiff did not prevail on most of his claims,the district court did enter an order granting relief on one of his rcra causes of action.the court ruled for defendants as to the other rcra claim and the cwa claim.
the injunction obtained by plaintiff ordered six specific items of injunctive relief 
the defendants shall erect a fence surrounding the entire moab landfill.
defendants must monitor combustible gases at the moab landfill on a quarterly basis.
defendants must keep all monitoring equipment operational.
defendants must continue to monitor the moab landfill cover on a regular basis to prevent extensive pooling or puddling and to diminish the risk of extensive erosion following storms.
defendants must maintain and file the reports required by the class iv permit.
to the extent the service district outsources any work at the moab landfill,the service district must monitor this work and ensure that all required reports are appropriately filed.
the district court also ordered each party to bear their own costs and attorney fees.plaintiff moved to amend the judgment arguing that he was a prevailing party and therefore entitled to costs and attorney fees.the district court denied the motion.both sides now appeal the district court order denying both parties attorney fees 
we have jurisdiction over the district court denial of attorney fees pursuant to.awards of attorney fees are generally reviewed for an abuse of discretion.mares credit bureau of raton,cir.in reaching that decision,we review de novo whether the district court applied the correct legal standard,and we review its findings of fact for clear error.see kiowa indian tribe hoover,cir.
at issue in this appeal is the attorney fees provision for rcra,which is codified at e before addressing whether either party is entitled to an award of attorney fees,we must determine the proper construction of the statute.the relevant portion of that section reads the court,in issuing any final order in any action brought pursuant to this section may award costs of litigation including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees to the prevailing or substantially prevailing party,whenever the court determines such an award is appropriate.e.there is relatively little case law interpreting this section of rcra.however,it is clear from the permissive language used by congress in enacting this statute may that an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party is discretionary.
in light of the dearth of case law construing this statute,plaintiff urges the court to follow precedent which interprets the attorney fee provision of b.we find this path persuasive.section also uses permissive language in empowering courts to grant an award of attorney fees in any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of section of this title,the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee b.to some extent,the plain language of b appears to grant courts broader discretion than that authorized by e.however,for our purposes,we view the two sections as sufficiently analogous to use case law in interpreting either statute interchangeably 
our view finds support in supreme court precedent.in city of burlington dague,d,the supreme court stated 
section e of the swda and d of the cwa authorize a court to award costs of litigation including reasonable attorney fees to a prevailing or substantially prevailing party.e emphasis added d emphasis added.this language is similar to that of many other federal statutes,see,k,d our case law construing what is a reasonable fee applies uniformly to all of them.flight attendants zipes,d.
although the supreme court was specifically concerned with the reasonable fee language of e,its logic is equally applicable to the prevailing party language found in the same section in light of the supreme court general recognition of the interchangeability of the case law interpreting similar attorney fees statutes,e,b,k,and d,we now look to supreme court and tenth circuit case law in deciding whether the district court was correct in declining the parties requests for fees.
applying this case law adds color to e admittedly ambiguous notation about the standards for determining one prevailing party status and also determines whether the standards differ between plaintiffs and defendants.in hensley eckerhart,the supreme court ruled that a prevailing plaintiff should ordinarily recover an attorney fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust,d quoting,emphasis added.whereas,the supreme court noted in christiansburg garment eeoc that prevailing defendants are only to be awarded attorney fees when the plaintiff claim is frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless,or that the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so,d.once prevailing party status is determined,the court then determines the request.see e see also hensley,at.
the district court gave no reasoning when it ordered the parties to bear their own costs of action and attorney fees,vol.i,at dist.march,order and judgment.generally,district courts must give an adequate explanation for their decision regarding requests for attorney fees,otherwise we have no record on which to base our decision.see bartlett martin marietta operations support.life ins.plan,cir reversing and remanding attorney fee issue because the district court did not explain its ruling on the petition for attorneys fees adequately.on this ground alone we remand the case to give the district court the opportunity to address this issue.however,because the determination of prevailing party status is generally a question of law,we will address that issue in particular.see jenkins by jenkins state of,cir explaining that the question of prevailing party status,a statutory term,presents a legal issue.in addition,we take this opportunity to announce some general principles of law regarding an award of attorney fees in an effort to give the district court guidance as to the issues it must address on remand.
noting the presumption in favor of awarding prevailing plaintiffs attorney fees,we turn to the question of whether plaintiff prevailed in this case for purposes of obtaining an award of attorney fees even though he clearly lost on several of his claims.in determining whether one is a prevailing plaintiff,we do not look to the case as a whole and weigh the prevailing claims against the defeated claims.instead,each claim is to be viewed separately as practiced by the ninth circuit in thomas city of tacoma,cir.in thomas,the ninth circuit recognized the plaintiff as a prevailing party as to the one claim he won at trial,despite the fact that the defendants were victorious on the numerous other claims,including a counterclaim.at,the fact that plaintiff failed to recover on all theories of liability is not a bar to recovery of attorney fees.emphasis in original.
the logic of thomas is supported by the supreme court decision in farrar hobby,where the court held that a plaintiff prevails when actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff,d.the ultimate degree of success or magnitude of relief obtained is irrelevant to the question of eligibility for a fee award.id.at.nonetheless,the parties focus much of their attention on the quantum of reli
