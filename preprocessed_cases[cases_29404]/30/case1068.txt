we consider whether grass residue remaining after a kentucky bluegrass harvest is solid waste within the meaning of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra.safe air for everyone safe air appeals the district court dismissal of its complaint for injunctive relief under rcra.we conclude that the district court erred in dismissing the case on jurisdictional grounds.however,because we determine that safe air has failed to demonstrate that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether grass residue is solid waste under rcra,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
in idaho,kentucky bluegrass is typically planted in the spring but does not flower and produce seed until the summer of the following year.by the time the flowers have produced seed,the bluegrass plants are fifteen to inches tall.to harvest bluegrass seed,farmers first cut the crop close to the ground to prepare the crop for combining,separating the seed from the crop.a curing process dries out and ripens the head of the crop.after the curing process is complete,a combine separates the seed from the straw,leaving the straw on the field.the seed is prepared for commercial distribution.however,straw and stubble the part of the crop not cut from the ground remain in the field.bluegrass farmers burn these remnants,a practice called open field burning or open burning.bluegrass farmers can repeat this process for several years,depending on the length of the productive life of each bluegrass field.
safe air is a corporation formed by individuals from northern idaho,washington,and montana.one of safe air objectives is to stop the practice of open burning.safe air asserts that smoke resulting from open burning endangers the public because it contains high concentrations of pollutants that create severe respiratory problems for residents in areas immediately surrounding bluegrass farms.the growers are a group of individuals and corporations that plant and harvest kentucky bluegrass seed commercially in idaho.all of the growers engage in open burning in the process of growing kentucky bluegrass.
safe air filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of idaho on may,alleging that the growers,by engaging in open burning,violated the resource conservation and recovery act,a b safe air also sought a preliminary injunction enjoining the growers from engaging in open burning.the growers filed a response in opposition to safe air motion for preliminary injunction,and also filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
on july,the district court held an evidentiary hearing on safe air request for preliminary injunction at which the testimony of witnesses was given subject to cross examination.on july,the district court dismissed safe air complaint,concluding that it was without jurisdiction to resolve safe air rcra claim because,inter alia,grass residue did not constitute solid waste under rcra 
safe air appeals.we have jurisdiction under,and affirm.
we first address the unusual procedural posture of the case.the growers filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.the district court construed the growers motion to dismiss as proceeding under rules b and b,and granted the growers motion under rule b.
safe air argues that the district court erred in dismissing its complaint because the district court reviewed evidence outside the complaint,evidence from the preliminary injunction hearing without converting the motion to dismiss into a summary judgment motion under rule and the district court erroneously construed as a jurisdictional issue the question of whether grass residue,the straw and stubble that remain on the growers fields after the bluegrass harvest is solid waste under rcra.we disagree with safe air on the first issue because the district court,in this context,was not obligated formally to convert the growers motion into a motion for summary judgment solely because it reviewed evidence outside the complaint.however,as to the second issue,we agree that,in the circumstances of this case,the district court erred by treating the issue of whether grass residue is solid waste under rcra as a jurisdictional issue.
the district court dismissed safe air claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under rule b.a rule b jurisdictional attack may be facial or factual.white lee,cir citation omitted.in a facial attack,the challenger asserts that the allegations contained in a complaint are insufficient on their face to invoke federal jurisdiction.by contrast,in a factual attack,the challenger disputes the truth of the allegations that,by themselves,would otherwise invoke federal jurisdiction.the growers jurisdictional attack was factual because the growers challenged safe air contention that grass residue constitutes solid waste under rcra.morrison amway,cir jurisdictional challenge was a factual attack where it relied on extrinsic evidence and did not assert lack of subject matter jurisdiction solely on the basis of the pleadings.

the district court erred in characterizing its dismissal of safe air complaint under rule b because the jurisdictional issue and substantive issues in this case are so intertwined that the question of jurisdiction is dependent on the resolution of factual issues going to the merits.the growers have not argued that safe air federal claims are immaterial,made solely for the purpose of obtaining federal jurisdiction,or wholly insubstantial and frivolous.bell,at.whether safe air alleged a claim that comes within rcra reach goes to the merits of safe air action.sun valley,at t he ability of the plaintiff to allege a claim that comes within the definitional reach of the petroleum marketing practices act is a matter that goes to the merits of the action.
safe air filed its claim under the citizen suit provision of rcra,a b,which permits suits 
against any person who has contributed or who is contributing to the past or present handling,storage,treatment,transportation,or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste which may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.
emphasis added.because this provision of rcra provides the basis for both the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal court and the plaintiff substantive claim for relief,the question of jurisdiction and the merits of this action are intertwined.for this reason,we hold that the district court characterization of its dismissal under rule b was error.sun valley,at.
for the reasons expressed above,we review the district court order below not as a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction but rather as a grant of summary judgment on the merits for the growers.great bank trust kotz,cir per curiam reviewing the district court dismissal for lack of jurisdiction as a grant of summary judgment where the district court dismissal was based on its conclusion that the note in question was not a security within the securities exchange act thus we review rcra and its definition of solid waste,interpretations of the statutory language in case law,and rcra legislative history to determine if safe air has demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of whether grass residue is solid waste under rcra.
rcra is a comprehensive environmental statute that governs the treatment,storage,and disposal of solid and hazardous waste.meghrig kfc western,d.congress overriding concern in enacting rcra was to establish the framework for a national system to insure the safe management of hazardous waste.am.mining cong.epa.congress also expressed concern over the rising tide in scrap,discarded,and waste materials and the need to reduce the amount of waste and unsalvageable materials and to provide for proper and economical solid waste disposal practices.id.quoting a and a.
safe air filed this lawsuit under the citizen suit provision of rcra,a b.to prevail,safe air must establish that the growers are contributing to the handling,storage,treatment,transportation,or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste which may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.a b emphasis added.safe air does not allege that the grass residue in question is hazardous waste.therefore,the crux of the case turns on the issue of whether kentucky bluegrass residue is solid waste within the meaning of rcra.
faced with the duty to interpret this provision of rcra,we follow established principles of statutory construction.c anons of statutory construction help give meaning to a statute words.we begin with the language of the statute.the wilderness soc y united states fish wildlife,cir en banc internal citations omitted.a nother fundamental canon of construction provides that unless otherwise defined,words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we have also recently reiterated the principle that,in construing a statute,courts generally give words not defined in a statute their ordinary or natural meaning.bonnichsen united states,cir quoting united states,d.with these maxims in mind,we turn again to rcra.
rcra defines solid waste as any garbage,refuse,sludge from a waste treatment plant,water supply treatment plant,or air pollution control facility and other discarded material,including solid,liquid,semisolid,or contained gaseous material resulting from industrial,commercial,mining,and agricultural operations emphasis added.rcra itself does not define the term discarded material.however,we note that the verb discard is defined by dictionary and usage as to cast aside reject abandon give up.the new shorter oxford english dictionary ed.we consider the term discard in its ordinary meaning to decide whether safe air presented a genuine issue of material fact supporting its contention that the kentucky bluegrass residue burnt by the growers is solid waste under rcra.
our sister circuits have considered the scope of rcra definition of solid waste,and their determinations are helpful to our analysis.the circuit assessed the scope of rcra definition of solid waste in american mining congress epa,amc i.in amc i,an industry group of mining and oil refining companies challenged an environmental protection agency epa rule amendment giving the epa authority to regulate reused materials in the petroleum and mining industries.noting that epa jurisdiction is limited to those materials that constitute solid waste,amc i,at,the circuit held that our analysis of rcra reveals clear congressional intent to extend epa authority only to materials that are truly discarded,disposed of,thrown away,or abandoned.id.at.it reasoned,persuasively to us,that e ncompassing materials retained for immediate reuse within the scope of discarded material strains the everyday usage of that term.id.at.significant for our purposes,amc i determined that materials have not contributed to a waste disposal problem where they are destined for beneficial reuse or recycling in a continuous process by the generating industry itself.id.at.the circuit held that epa contravened congress intent by attempting to regulate secondary materials.id.at 
the circuit reached a similar conclusion in association of battery recyclers epa.the issue in battery recyclers was whether materials generated and reclaimed within the mineral processing industry could be deemed solid waste under rcra,such that it could be regulated by the epa.the court held that at least some of the secondary material epa seeks to regulate as solid waste is destined for reuse as part of a continuous industrial process and thus is not abandoned or thrown away.id.at.
the eleventh circuit addressed a variation of this issue in united states ilco,cir.in ilco,a lead smelting company interstate lead producing ingots from lead plates of recycled automobile batteries challenged epa regulation of the plates interstate lead argued that,because it had never disposed of the lead plates,epa could not regulate the lead plates as discarded material under.the eleventh circuit disagreed,reasoning 
the lead plates and groups are,no doubt,valuable feedstock for a smelting process.nevertheless,epa,with congressional authority,promulgated regulations that classify these materials as discarded solid waste.somebody has discarded the battery in which these components are found.this fact does not change just because a reclaimer has purchased or finds value in the components.
considering these cases to be persuasive in identifying relevant considerations bearing on whether grass residue is solid waste under rcra,we will also evaluate whether the material is destined for beneficial reuse or recycling in a continuous process by the generating industry itself,amc i,at whether the materials are being actively reused,or whether they merely have the potential of being reused,amc ii,at whether the materials are being reused by its original owner,as opposed to use by a salvager or reclaimer,ilco,at.
we turn to the evidence submitted by the parties to the district court.the growers presented evidence that they do not discard the grass residue,but rather reuse grass residue in a continuous process of growing kentucky bluegrass.this reuse generates two primary benefits to the growers returning nutrients to bluegrass fields and facilitating the open burning process.
the growers presented evidence at the preliminary injunction hearing showing that grass residue contains nutrients that are beneficial to bluegrass fields when returned to soil.glen murray,the growers expert on growing kentucky in the northern idaho area,testified that grass residue contributes recycled nutrients and can act as a fertilizer to bluegrass fields.karl felgenhauer,a washington bluegrass farmer,also testified that grass residue contains such nutrients.paul stearns,another washington bluegrass farmer,testified that grass residue remaining after a bluegrass harvest contains potash and can act as a fertilizer.
the growers also presented evidence that grass residue is an integral component in the open burning process because grass residue carries fire efficiently across bluegrass fields.the grass residue vital role in the open burning process is significant because the growers submitted evidence establishing that open burning has four critical benefits for kentucky bluegrass farmers.
first,several witnesses testified that open burning extends the productive life of bluegrass fields.donald jacklin,safe air witness,testified that open burning in some cases increases the life of bluegrass fields up to twenty years.asked about the value of open burning to bluegrass production,jacklin testified that nothing equals burning,and that open burning is an agricultural practice incorporated into the production,planting,and harvesting of bluegrass.murray testified that a bluegrass field seed production can be maintained longer with open burning.felgenhauer,the washington farmer,testified that he experienced a significant decrease in the life of his bluegrass fields after an open burning ban was instituted in washington state.
second,several witnesses testified that open burning restores beneficial minerals and fertilizers to bluegrass fields.paul meints,one of safe air experts,testified that the value of burnt grass residue ash to bluegrass fields is p rimarily the restoration of the phosphorus and potassium that is held within that tissue,and that burnt grass residue ash left on soil is beneficial to bluegrass fields because it provides nutrients.defendant wayne meyer,an idaho bluegrass farmer,testified that phosphorus and potash remain on bluegrass fields as a result of the burning process,and that these elements act as a fertilizer to the fields.stearns testified that farmers who engage in open burning need to purchase less supplemental potash because open burning releases potash onto the bluegrass field.murray testified that nutrients are left in the ash of burnt residue.
third,the growers presented evidence suggesting that open field burning reduces or eliminates insects on bluegrass fields,reducing the need for pesticide use schultheis testified that he had to use more pesticides,herbicides,and fungicides on his fields after he stopped open burning,and that open burning also reduces wheat infestation meyer also testified that open burning controls weeds,insects,and disease.
finally,paul stearns testified that open burning blackens the soil on bluegrass fields,which maximizes the soil sunlight absorption to increase the crop yield for the following crop.meints also testified that blackened soil absorbs heat and sun rays.
safe air does not contest that grass residue provides benefits for the growers,but argues that the primary benefit to the growers from open burning is removal of grass residue,and that other benefits of grass residue are incidental to the growers goal of removing the residue.safe air argues that the two most important benefits from open burning of grass residue,sunlight absorption and enhancing productive life of bluegrass fields,result from the removal of grass residue as to the other benefits,the fertilizer in the ash and reduced pesticide use,safe air argues that these are incidental benefits that do not change the nature of what is transpiring from the discarding of waste.
however,even when we view the evidence in the light most favorable to safe air,there is no dispute that the growers realize farming benefits from reusing grass residue in the process of open burning.safe air did not present testimony challenging the growers contentions that grass residue offers nutrients to bluegrass fields burnt grass residue ash resulting from open burning helps fertilize bluegrass fields open burning reduces the incidence of weed,fungi,and insect infestation in bluegrass fields and open burning blackens bluegrass fields,which contributes to creating optimal conditions for the next bluegrass harvest.safe air dismisses these indisputable benefits as incidental,but our view is necessarily controlled by rcra statutory language suggesting that materials must be discarded to be considered solid waste.because there is undisputed evidence that the growers reuse the grass residue in a continuous farming process effectively designed to produce kentucky bluegrass,there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether grass residue is discarded material.it is not.the bluegrass residue is not discarded,abandoned,or given up,and it does not qualify as solid waste under rcra,based on its statutory definition of solid waste as discarded material.
moreover,our evaluation of each of the factors noted by our sister circuits in analogous cases,discussed above,supports that grass residue beneficially reused by the growers in producing kentucky bluegrass is not solid waste under rcra.the growers presented uncontroverted evidence establishing that the grass residue is destined for beneficial reuse in a continuous process of growing and harvesting kentucky bluegrass seeds,the generating industry,amc i,at the growers reuse grass residue,inter alia,to provide nutrients and to act as a fire accelerant for open burning,as opposed to being kept in storage for potential reuse,amc ii,at and the grass residue is being reused by farmers who are its original owners the growers,not by a salvager or reclaimer.ilco,at.under these standards,which we determine to have persuasive application here,there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether grass residue is discarded.
rcra legislative history also reinforces our conclusion that grass residue is not the type of material that congress intended to proscribe under rcra.the house report reveals that rcra was intended as a approach toward solving the problems associated with the billion tons of discarded materials generated each year,and the problems resulting from the anticipated annual increase in the volume of such waste,at,reprinted in.congress was concerned with waste products of all types that were contributing to landfills 
in addressing this problem,the committee recognizes that solid waste,the traditional term for trash or refuse is inappropriate.the words solid waste are laden with false connotations.they are more narrow in meaning than the committee concern.the words discarded materials more accurately reflect the committee interest.
not only solid wastes,but also liquid and contained gaseous wastes,wastes and sludges are the subjects of this legislation.waste itself is a misleading word in the context of the committee activity an increase in reclamation and reuse practices is a major objective of the resource conservation and recovery act.
id.at,reprinted in at.
in enacting rcra,congress also declared that agricultural products that could be recycled or reused as fertilizers were not its concern.the same house report stated,m uch industrial and agricultural waste is reclaimed or put to new use and is therefore not a part of the discarded materials disposal problem the committee addresses agricultural wastes which are returned to the soil as fertilizers or soil conditioners are not considered discarded materials in the sense of this legislation.id.at,reprinted in at.
the burning of bluegrass residue by farmers is not the evil against which congress took aim.to the contrary,the bluegrass residue is the type of agricultural remnant,used by farmers to add nutrients to soil,that congress did not consider to be discarded,at,reprinted in at m uch industrial and agricultural waste is reclaimed or put to new use and is therefore not a part of the discarded materials disposal problem the committee addresses agricultural wastes which are returned to the soil as fertilizers or soil conditions are not considered discarded materials in the sense of this legislation.
safe air response to rcra legislative history is unpersuasive.safe air argues that because the house report states that much industrial and agricultural waste is reclaimed,much does not mean all,and this leaves open the possibility that grass residue is solid waste.however,the possibility of such a distinction in theory does not persuade us that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether residue can properly be considered solid waste within rcra meaning 
given the uncontroverted evidence that the growers reuse the grass residue in a continuous process for kentucky bluegrass production,and do so in accord with farming practices that are beneficial in increasing crop yields,safe air has not demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact on the issue whether grass residue is a solid waste under rcra 
we discern from congress explicit language in rcra,focusing on discarded materials as a touchstone for solid waste,and from congress stated purposes,no congressional declaration or intent to prohibit the established farming practice of open burning of kentucky bluegrass residue.the benefits to the growers of this practice were established beyond dispute in the evidence presented to the district court.safe air has not demonstrated that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether grass residue is solid waste under rcra on the undisputed evidence,we conclude that kentucky bluegrass residue is not a solid waste,and that rcra does not prohibit the growers general practice of open burning 
i concur in part ii of the majority opinion,in which the majority concluded that we should review the district court dismissal for lack of jurisdiction as a grant of summary judgment on the merits for the growers.i respectfully dissent,however,from part iii,which holds that safe air has not demonstrated that the crop residue is a solid waste under rcra.because i disagree with the legal standard that the majority applies to determine whether the crop residue has been discarded,i would conclude instead that the growers have discarded the crop residue within the meaning of rcra.even if i were to agree with the majority interpretation of the rcra statute,i would nonetheless hold that there are genuine triable issues of fact.accordingly,i would reverse the district court judgment and remand for trial.
because rcra does not define discarded we look to the ordinary,contemporary,common meaning of that term wilderness soc y united states fish wildlife,cir en banc internal quotation marks omitted.thus,our ultimate task is to determine whether safe air has presented evidence that,if accepted as true,creates a genuine issue concerning whether the growers have drop ped,dismiss ed,let go,or g o t rid of as no longer useful,valuable or pleasurable the crop residue.webster third new international dictionary.
considering the evidence presented to the district court,i have little difficulty concluding that safe air has presented sufficient evidence to show that the crop residue was discarded.in opposition to the growers motion to dismiss and in support of its motion for preliminary injunction,safe air presented the district court with testimony and affidavits from its members,individuals in the community and medical and agricultural experts.in this testimonial and documentary evidence,safe air established that it is necessary to remove the residue in order to maintain seed yields.indeed,safe air contended that the primary purpose of burning the fields is to remove the excess crop residue from the bluegrass fields.
in their motion to dismiss,the growers did not dispute safe air assertion that the crop residue had to be removed from the fields.although the growers presented testimony and affidavits contending that they did not intend to discard the residue,they nonetheless admitted that the residue had to be removed from the fields in order to maintain seed production and to limit the insects and parasites that would otherwise find food and shelter in the residue 
because there is no dispute that the growers burn the crop residue to remove it from the fields,and because this act of removal is within the plain meaning of discard,i would reverse the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings 
it is that w here the plain meaning of a provision is unambiguous that meaning is controlling,except in the rare case in which the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of the drafters.ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.see also united states turkette,d if the statutory language is unambiguous,in the absence of a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary,that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.quoting consumer product safety comm gte sylvania,d.the majority analysis,however,extends beyond the plain meaning of discard to evaluate those relevant considerations,op.at,that it has gleaned from cases discussing the meaning of discard in distinctly different contexts.because i do not believe that there is any need to look beyond the ordinary meaning of the term discard and the majority has not offered any convincing rationale for its extended analysis,i would only look to the ordinary meaning of discard,and would conclude,as explained above,that the growers discard the crop residue.
even if the majority could justify importing relevant considerations in determining the meaning of discard,i would nonetheless reverse the district court judgment in this case.i disagree that the indeed,the statute the majority conclusion that mere beneficial reuse means that a substance has not been discarded under rcra.moreover,even were i to accept the majority interpretation,i would conclude that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the crop residue is destined for beneficial reuse in a continual process.op.at.
the majority cites to rcra legislative history to support its conclusion that rcra does not encompass the residue at issue here.because the plain and unambiguous definition of discard encompasses the crop residue,the legislative history should be examined only to determine whether there is a clearly expressed contrary legislative intent.united states fiorillo,cir quotation marks omitted analyzing statutory provision of rcra.
far from revealing a contrary intent,the legislative history demonstrates that congress intended solid waste to include any discarded material resulting from agricultural operations emphasis added the house report indicates that congress purposefully defined solid waste to include discarded materials to give rcra a broader reach.see,pt.i,at,reprinted in,
the majority makes much of the fact that the house report excludes a gricultural wastes which are returned to the soil as fertilizers or soil conditioners,pt.i,at,reprinted in at but see b indicating that residue from the growing and harvesting of agricultural crops which are returned to the soils as fertilizers are s olid wastes which are not hazardous wastes.but this statement does not indicate that congress intended to exclude from the scope of rcra agricultural waste that is first burned before being used as fertilizer according to the majority logic,any disposal process,no matter how environmentally unsound,would be exempted from the reach of rcra as long as the waste residue was eventually returned to the soil.this could not have been congress intent,especially since congress expressed a special concern with waste that was burned.see,pt.i,at,reprinted in at,see also id.at,reprinted in at listing improper disposal practices that resulted in harmful air pollution.am.mining cong.epa,amc ii concluding that,where the disposal or treatment process posed a danger to the public health,the material disposed of should be considered discarded.
no statutory declaration or other congressional statement of intent suggests that residue that is burned should be excluded from rcra definition of solid waste.rather,the house report reflects that rcra specifically applies to disposal practices that result in air pollution 
the committee believes that the approach taken by this legislation eliminates the last remaining in environmental law,that of unregulated land disposal of discarded materials and hazardous wastes.further,the committee believes that this legislation is necessary if other environmental laws are to be both cost and environmentally effective.at present the federal government is spending billions of dollars to remove pollutatns sic from the air and water,only to dispose of such pollutants on the land in an environmentally unsound manner.the existing methods of land disposal often result in air pollution,subsurface leachate and surface,which affect air and water quality.this legislation will eliminate this problem and permit the environmental laws to function in a coordinated and effective way.
part i,at,reprinted in at.where,as here,the residue is discarded and burned,the legislative history indicates that the disposal of such material is within the meaning of solid waste under rcra.
the majority also relies on cases to support its conclusion that the crop residue is not discarded.these cases,however,are inapplicable to the interpretation of solid waste at issue here.most notably,those cases interpret the meaning of solid waste in considering the validity of hazardous waste regulations promulgated by the environmental protection agency epa see amc i,at considering whether the epa exceeded its regulatory authority by including in process secondary materials in its definition of solid waste american mining cong.epa,amc ii considering whether the epa exceeded its regulatory authority in treating six wastes generated from metal smelting operations as hazardous waste united states ilco,cir considering whether lead parts,which have been reclaimed from spent car and truck batteries for recycling purposes,are exempt from the epa regulation under rcra.
although rcra defines solid waste to cover all types of discarded materials,see,the epa rcra regulations at issue in amc i,amc ii and ilco have a special definition of solid waste,see a,which applies only to wastes that also are hazardous for purposes of the regulations implementing subtitle c of rcra.b thus,the regulatory definition considered in amc i,amc ii and ilco is significantly narrower than the statutory definition at issue here.accordingly,i do not find these cases persuasive in our determination of whether the crop residue has been discarded.
even if i were to agree with the majority conclusion that the cases constitute persuasive authority,op.at,i would nonetheless conclude that there is a genuine factual dispute as to whether the crop residue has been discarded.i would therefore reverse the summary judgment in favor of the growers.
relying on the analysis in amc i,amc ii and ilco,the majority reasons that as long as the residue provides benefits for the growers,op.at,it has not been discarded under rcra.this unnecessarily narrows the definition of discarded material.
the cases do not support the majority proposition that the mere recognition of some beneficial use negates the fact that materials have been discarded under rcra.the cases cited by the majority distinguish between those materials extracted and immediately reused in an ongoing process and those materials discarded and only later put to beneficial use.amc i merely held that materials extracted from primary metals that are recaptured and recycled as part of an ongoing industrial process are not solid waste under the epa regulatory definition of that term.that same court later clarified that amc i holding concerned only materials that are destined for immediate reuse in another phase of the industry ongoing production process amc ii,at quoting amc i,at emphasis in original.the circuit also rejected the claim that potential reuse of a material prevents the epa from classifying it as discarded.see also ilco,at noting that p reviously discarded solid waste,although it may at some point be recycled,nonetheless remains solid waste am.petroleum inst.epa,holding that slag residue resulting from the production of steel was discarded even though zinc would later be recovered from the slag at a reclamation facility.
thus,even following the majority analysis and drawing on the principles from the above cases,it still must be shown that the residue is destined for immediate reuse in another phase of the industry ongoing production process.amc ii,at emphasis in original.relevant considerations may include such questions as the intent of the growers in using the materials and the purpose of removing the residue,see no spray coalition,city of new york,cir insecticides are not discarded within the meaning of rcra when they are sprayed into the air with the design of effecting their intended purpose of killing mosquitoes and their larvae water keeper alliance united states dep t of defense,d,holding that ordinances were not discarded material under rcra as soon as they made contact with the land because,at that moment,at least,they were still serving their intended purpose,aff cir and the specific mechanics of the process,including,for example,the length of time the crop residue was left on the fields before the growers burned it,see.coastal fishermen ass remington arms,cir lead and clay shots were discarded because they had been left to accumulate long after they had served their intended purpose.
safe air contends that the growers primary purpose in burning the residue is to remove is,burning residue is primarily an inexpensive waste disposal practice.on the other hand,the growers argue that they consider the crop residue important and valuable materials used in the agricultural process.there are thus decidedly different accounts of whether and how the crop residue factors into the continuing growth process for kentucky bluegrass even if i were to agree with the majority approach,i would reverse the district court judgment in favor of the growers because there exists a genuine dispute as to material facts.see,united states city of tacoma,cir noting that summary judgment is not proper if there is a genuine dispute as to any material fact.
because i would remand for further proceedings,i briefly address the question the majority has not decided whether the burning of the crop residue constitutes the past or present handling,storage,treatment,transportation,or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste which may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment a b.
disposal is defined in rcra to include the deposit or placing of solid waste into or on any land so that such solid waste or any constituent thereof may enter the environment or be emitted into the air.here,the burning of the crop residue clearly results in smoke and emits particles into the air,and such emissions only occur as a result of the growers is,by setting fire to the fields.thus,i would hold that the burning of the crop residue constitutes disposal of that waste under rcra.
in the alternative,i also would hold that burning the fields to remove the crop residue constitutes treatment or handling of solid waste under a b.rcra does not define treatment or handling in the context of solid waste,and thus,once again,i look to the ordinary meaning of these terms see wilderness soc y,at.the ordinary meaning of treatment is the action or manner of treating treat is further defined as to handle,manage,or otherwise deal with to subject to some action as of a chemical reagent to subject as a natural or manufactured article to some process to improve the appearance,taste usefulness,or some other quality.webster third new international dictionary.thus,even if the growers burned the waste solely to improve its as converting it into actions would still constitute treatment of that waste.
similarly,the burning of the crop residue constitutes handling of that waste.the ordinary meaning of handle is to deal with act upon dispose of perform some function with regard to.id.at.again,the growers burning of the crop residue fits within this definition.
the definitions of these terms solid waste,disposal,treatment,and handling together with the undisputed facts regarding the need to remove the crop residue,make it apparent that rcra applies to the burning of the crop residue.accordingly,i would hold that the growers practice of burning the crop residue after the bluegrass harvest constitutes handling or treatment of solid waste within the meaning of a b.for all the reasons above,i would reverse the district court judgment in favor of the growers and remand for trial.
this provision permits an individual to file suit against any past or present generator,past or present transporter,or past or present owner or operator of a treatment,storage,or disposal facility,who has contributed or who is contributing to the past or present handling,storage,treatment,transportation,or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste which may present an imminent and subst
