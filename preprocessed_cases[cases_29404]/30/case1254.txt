utah shared access alliance is utah largest motorized access advocacy organization.its members use motorized vehicles,including or vehicles orvs,to access lands throughout utah that are managed by the bureau of land management blm.after the blm imposed several restrictions on orv use in certain parts of the state,filed this lawsuit in the district of utah under the administrative procedure act apa,alleging violations of the federal land policy and management act flpma,the national environmental policy act nepa,the federal advisory committee act faca,and the national defense authorization act ndaa,as well as regulations promulgated pursuant to those statutes.the district court concluded that the blm had not violated flpma,nepa,or faca,and that did not have standing to bring its claim under the ndaa.the court therefore entered judgment in favor of the blm and dismissed the action under the ndaa.now timely appeals the district court ruling with respect to flpma,nepa,the ndaa,and certain regulations.we take jurisdiction under and affirm.
statutory framework 
federal land policy and management act 
nearly of utah is federal land managed by the blm,which is an agency within the department of interior.norton utah wilderness alliance,d suwa.flpma,codified at et,creates a versatile framework for governing the blm management of these lands.rocky mountain oil gas ass watt,cir.the statute directs the blm to manage public lands under principles of multiple use and sustained yield.a see also a listing purposes and values that should be considered in the management of public lands.multiple use management is a deceptively simple term that describes the enormously complicated task of striking a balance among the many competing uses to which land can be put suwa,at.citing c.these uses include,but are not limited to,recreation range,timber,minerals,watershed,wildlife and fish,and uses serving natural scenic,scientific and historical values.id.the phrase sustained yield refers to the blm duty to control depleting uses over time,so as to ensure a high level of valuable uses in the future.id.citing h.
to assist in the management of public lands,flpma requires that the blm develop,maintain,and,when appropriate,revise land use plans.a.these land use plans,which the blm regulations denote resource management plans rmps,see n,project both the present and future use of the land.a.proposed rmps are subject to a mandatory period of public notice and comment,see,and,once adopted,will guide and control future management actions and the development of subsequent,more detailed and limited scope plans for resources and uses.
flpma prohibits the blm from taking actions inconsistent with the provisions of rmps.see suwa,at.a the secretary shall manage the public lands in accordance with the land use plans developed by him all future resource management authorizations and actions shall conform to the approved plan.when needed,however,these plans may be amended.to do so,the blm must prepare an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement,see,and submit the proposed amendment to public notice and comment in the same way as when the plan was originally being prepared.
in any event,rmps must further the purpose of flpma,which is to ensure that 
the public lands be managed in a manner that will protect the quality of scientific,scenic,historical,ecological,environmental,air and atmospheric,water resource,and archeological values that,where appropriate,will preserve and protect certain public lands in their natural condition that will provide food and habitat for fish and wildlife and domestic animals and that will provide for outdoor recreation and human occupancy and use.
a.further underscoring the blm duty to protect the environment is the statutory requirement that i n managing the public lands the secretary shall,by regulation or otherwise,take any action necessary to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation of the lands.b.
executive orders and federal regulations pertaining to orv use 
orv use represents one of the multiple uses that the blm provides for and must balance in managing the public lands.in response to increased orv use on these lands,in president nixon issued an executive order for the purpose of establish ing policies and provid ing procedures that will ensure that the use of vehicles on public lands will be controlled and directed so as to protect the resources of those lands,to promote the safety of all users of those lands,and to minimize conflicts among the various uses of those lands.exec.order.the stated reason for the order was to further the purpose and policy of nepa it established criteria by which federal agencies were to develop regulations and administrative instructions for the designation of areas and trails on which orvs would be permitted.id.it also required agencies to monitor the effects of orv use on the public lands and o n the basis of the information gathered,they shall from time to time amend or rescind designations of areas or other actions taken pursuant to this order as necessary to further the nepa.id.
president carter,in,issued executive order,which amended executive order and strengthened it considerably.see exec.order.may.the amended order provides that notwithstanding the blm designations of public land use under the applicable rmp,the blm shall immediately close any area or route to orvs whenever it determines that orv use will cause or is causing considerable adverse effects to wildlife,wildlife habitat,and other natural resources.see id.amending exec.order,a.under the order,the closure must remain in place until the adverse effects have been eliminated.id.
the department of interior has adopted regulations to implement the nixon and carter executive orders,flpma,and other federal statutes.see et.under,all public lands must be designated as open,limited,or closed to vehicles.see.the designations must be made to minimize conflicts among the different users of the lands,hikers,orv users,and birdwatchers.id.in addition,care must be taken to avoid damage to natural resources and to prevent impairment of wilderness suitability.id.the initial designation of areas as open,limited,or closed to orvs is accomplished through the resource management planning process,and it must involve public participation and consideration of all viewpoints.a.
short of promulgating or amending an rmp,the resource management planning process does not speak to the manner in which an orv designation may be changed.as such,and in order to address executive order,the blm promulgated a regulation that requires the agency to close areas to orv use,without resort to the process undertaken when promulgating or amending an rmp,when the blm determines that orvs are causing or will cause considerable adverse effects to soil,vegetation,wildlife,wildlife habitat,cultural resources,historical resources,threatened or endangered species,wilderness suitability,other authorized uses,or other resources.a.notably,such closures are nondiscretionary the blm shall immediately close the areas affected to the type s of vehicle causing the adverse effect until the adverse effects are eliminated and measures implemented to prevent recurrence.id.emphasis added.this provision creates a separate duty to close without regard to the designation process it does not automatically become inoperative once the secretary exercises his discretion to designate the land.sierra club clark,cir.
the blm authority to close or restrict the use of public lands notwithstanding the provisions of the governing rmp is not limited to a.it is also permitted to do so in order to protect persons,property,and public lands and resources.an order closing or restricting the use of public lands under this authority must identify the lands that are closed to entry or restricted as to use specify the uses that are restricted specify the period of time during which the closure or restriction applies identify any persons exempt from the closure or restriction include a statement of the reasons for the closure and be posted and published as provided in the regulation.b,c.
national environmental protection act 
nepa,et,was enacted in recognition of the profound impact of man activity on the interrelations of all components of the natural environment,and the critical importance of restoring and maintaining environmental quality to the overall welfare of man.nepa prescribes the necessary process by which federal agencies must take a hard look at the environmental consequences of the proposed courses of action.pennaco energy,of interior,cir internal quotations omitted.at bottom,nepa insure s a fully informed and decision,see vermont yankee nuclear power natural res.def.council,d,especially when proposed activity may significantly affect the quality of the human environment.c.
accordingly,nepa requires all agencies that propose a major federal action that significantly affects the quality of the environment to prepare an environmental impact statement eis that describes the environmental impact of the action unavoidable adverse environmental effects alternatives to the action relationship between the uses and productivity of the affected environment and irretrievable and irreversible commitments of resources should the action be implemented.catron county bd.of comm rs,fish wildlife,cir citing c i v.if the impact of the major federal action on the environment is uncertain,the agency must prepare an environmental assessment ea to determine whether the impact will be significant such that an eis is required.id.citing e.an ea an eis is also required when an rmp is to be amended.see.notwithstanding these mandates,regulations provide for emergency exceptions 
where emergency circumstances make it necessary to take an action with significant environmental impact without observing the provisions of these regulations,the federal agency taking the action should consult with the council about alternative arrangements.agencies and the council will limit such arrangements to actions necessary to control the immediate impacts of the emergency.other actions remain subject to nepa review.
in this way,agencies must comply with nepa requirements to the fullest extent possible.
national defense authorization act

ii.background 
at issue is whether the blm acted within its authority when it imposed restrictions on orv use in box elder county and grand county,utah,from through.
box elder county 
pursuant to flpma,the blm has adopted rmps for its utah lands.the box elder rmp was adopted in and designates the vast majority of land as open to orv use.in,however,the blm published a notice of closure of public lands box elder order,which closed land that had been previously designated as open.the closure was ordered seasonally,from january through april,and the authority for the closure was listed as and.see.the order reads as follows

id.like the box elder order,the box elder order cited and as authorizing the closure.
in,after filed this action,the blm revoked both the and box elder orders and simultaneously issued a new order.that order box elder order stated that in five areas of the county orvs may only be used on designated routes.the remaining public lands were to be managed according to the box elder rmp.the box elder order provided 
notice is hereby given that effective immediately,the bureau of land management blm,salt lake field office,revokes the seasonal notice of closure of public lands published on april,fr and the notice of closure of public lands published on march,fr.notice is hereby given that effective immediately,orv use in the following five areas of box elder county is limited to designated routes devils playground acres,grouse creek mountains acres,hogup mountains acres,pilot mountains acres,and wildcat hills acres.the remaining public lands in box elder county will be managed according to the box elder resource management plan.
citing only as the authority for the closure order,the box elder order further provided that t his limitation will remain in effect until the considerable adverse effects giving rise to this limitation are eliminated and measures are implemented to prevent recurrence of these adverse effects.id.
grand county 
as with box elder county,land use in grand county is also managed by an rmp adopted in the.in january,the blm published two notices related to orv use.in the first notice grand county orv restrictions,orv use in five areas was to be limited to existing roads and trails only.the notice cited flpma,executive orders and,and and as its authority,and stated 
this notice places restrictions on travel by vehicles orvs and mountain bikes on specific public land administered by the blm moab field office.these actions are necessary to halt ongoing impacts and prevent future degradation of resource values.they are being implemented on an interim basis to protect resource values and public safety,pending revision of the resource management plan rmp for the area administered by the blm moab field office.
the second notice grand county camping restrictions,which was published in order to support implementation of the grand county orv restrictions,provided that camping involving vehicles would be limited to developed campgrounds and designated campsites.again,the blm cited as its authority for the notice.
procedural history 
on october,filed this suit in the district of utah,contesting implementation of the and box elder orders and the two grand county restrictions under flpma,nepa,faca and the ndaa.asked the district court to set aside the orders and restrictions under the apa.see.southern utah wilderness alliance,the wilderness society,great old broads for wilderness,and wildlands cpr were permitted to intervene and defend the blm action.thereafte
