plaintiffs hugh kern,leigh ann lipscomb,and the oregon natural resources council fund collectively,onrc appeal the district court grant of summary judgment to defendant united states bureau of land management blm and douglas timber operators,herbert lumber,and lone rock timber collectively,the timber companies.onrc suit involves blm action in the coos bay district,a blm district along the southwest coast of oregon.
onrc contends that the blm has failed to discharge its obligations under the national environmental policy act nepa,et,by twice failing in its decision process to consider adequately the impact of a pathogenic root fungus,phytophthora lateralis the fungus,on the port orford cedar the cedar.first,onrc challenges the adequacy of the environmental impact statement eis prepared for the coos bay resource management plan rmp for the coos bay district.second,onrc challenges the adequacy of the environmental assessment ea prepared for proposed timber sales in the analysis area within the coos bay district.both onrc and the defendants moved for summary judgment on onrc claims that the eis and ea were inadequate under nepa.
the district court dismissed onrc challenge to the eis as unripe without reaching the merits,and rejected onrc challenge to the ea on the merits.it found that the ea adequately addressed the impact that the timber sales would have on the spread of the fungus to the cedar,and it granted summary judgment to the blm.for the reasons that follow,we reverse the district court rulings on both the eis and the ea,and direct that summary judgment be entered for onrc.we hold that the challenge to the eis was ripe,and that the eis is inadequate under nepa.we also hold that the ea is inadequate under nepa.
statutory and factual background 
the national environmental policy act has twin aims.first,it places upon a federal agency the obligation to consider every significant aspect of the environmental impact of a proposed action.second,it ensures that the agency will inform the public that it has indeed considered environmental concerns in its decisionmaking process.baltimore gas natural res.def.council,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.nepa does not contain substantive environmental standards.rather,it establishes procedures that require agencies to take a hard look at environmental consequences.metcalf daley,cir see also robertson methow valley citizens council,d.
nepa requires federal agencies to prepare an eis prior to taking major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the environment.c some proposed federal actions categorically require the preparation of an eis.if the proposed action does not categorically require the preparation of an eis,the agency must prepare an ea to determine whether the action will have a significant effect on the environment.see council on environmental quality ceq regulations implementing nepa metcalf,at.if the ea reveals that the proposed action will significantly affect the environment,then the agency must prepare an eis.if the ea reveals no significant effect,the agency may issue a finding of no significant impact fonsi.see,see also metcalf,at.
b.the coos bay environmental impact statement 
the federal land policy and management act flpma,et,requires the blm to prepare rmps for the various districts under its control.see.by definition,preparation of an rmp is a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,and so categorically requires preparation of an eis.see blm regulations implementing flpma.in,the blm published an eis for the proposed rmp for the coos bay district.
the coos bay district is within the geographic range of the port orford cedar.the cedar is a valuable component of forest ecosystems in southwestern oregon and northwestern california and is susceptible to infection by the root fungus phytophthora lateralis.the fungus may be spread in a number of ways,and is usually fatal to infected trees.pl can be transmitted by surface water in streams or ditches.new infections can also occur if soil infested with pl spores is transported to uninfected areas,for example in mud clinging to vehicles,pedestrians,and animals.human activities that facilitate the spread of the fungus include timber cutting,road construction and maintenance,vehicle use,livestock grazing,and commercial cedar bough and mushroom collection.see northcoast envtl.ctr.glickman,cir.
the plaintiffs assert that the eis prepared in connection with the coos bay district rmp did not adequately discuss the effect of the fungus on port orford cedar.although the eis mentioned the fungus and the cedar,the eis discussion was limited to the statement that the blm will 
conform all management activities within the range of to the guidelines described in the blm management policies to mitigate damage caused by phytophthora lateralis.analysis for projects within the range of will consider possible effects on the species.
in may,the blm approved the coos bay rmp,supported by the eis.the rmp now governs projects within the coos bay district.
c.the environmental assessment 
in,the blm proposed timber sales within a subsection of the coos bay district known as the analysis area.timber sales do not categorically require preparation of an eis.an ea covering the analysis area was prepared in conjunction with the timber sale proposal.the spread of the fungus among port orford cedar was one of the issues identified in the ea,but that issue was eliminated from the analysis.using language echoing the coos bay eis,the ea stated only that following the guidelines established in the port orford cedar management guidelines blm should reduce the spread of the root rot disease and that following the guidelines would not have a significant adverse impacts sic to the resources.a fonsi based on the ea for the analysis area was signed on november.a decision document based on the ea and fonsi was prepared on february.the blm then entered into eight timber sales based upon the ea and fonsi.
after this suit was filed and after several of the timber sales occurred the blm revised the ea to include section s,which discussed the impact of the timber sales on the spread of the fungus within the area.based on the revised ea,the blm issued a new fonsi on july,finding again that the actions did not constitute a major federal action requiring an eis.based on the revised ea and new fonsi,the blm issued another decision document allowing logging to go forward pursuant to the timber sales that had already occurred.
d.the port orford cedar management guidelines 
the plaintiffs timely commented on the coos bay rmp and its accompanying eis,on the ea,and on the revised ea.plaintiffs main concerns centered on the fact that both the eis and the ea referred to a document entitled the port orford cedar management guidelines the guidelines but contained no analysis of the impact of the proposed rmp or proposed timber sales on the spread of the fungus and the effect of this spread on the cedar.the ea was revised to respond to the concerns of plaintiffs and others by,inter alia,adding section s,which provides some analysis of the effect of the proposed timber sales on the fungus and the cedar.however,the revised ea also continued to refer to and rely on the guidelines.
the blm completed the guidelines in.the guidelines describe strategies to minimize the spread of the fungus.these strategies have been incorporated by reference into a number of eiss and eas in addition to the eis for the coos bay rmp and the eas for the area,but the guidelines themselves have never been subject to nepa review.in,a group of environmental organizations,including onrc,filed suit alleging that the guidelines were subject to nepa review and required preparation of an eis.in,in northcoast environmental center,we held that nepa review and an eis were not necessary for the guidelines.we held first that the guidelines did not constitute final agency action as required by the general review provision of the administrative procedure act.see at see also lujan wildlife fed n,d.additionally,we held that the promulgation of the guidelines did not constitute a major federal action as required by c of nepa,c.see northcoast,at.
however,we noted in northcoast that although the guidelines in and of themselves were not subject to nepa,if they were incorporated into a specific agency action they would be subject to nepa in the context of that action.we noted that l aims are quite different from concrete plans and specific undertakings such as the blm resource management plans which the secretaries have submitted for purposes of environmental analysis under nepa.id.at emphasis added.we also noted that we were not creating a catch situation in which the guidelines would escape review under nepa 
there is no reason plaintiffs can not challenge the sufficiency of an agency eis when a discrete agency action is called for.the agencies will be unable to shield their port orford cedar program from nepa review because they will not be able to avail themselves of the council on environmental quality tiering provision.furthermore,the secretaries have stated their intentions to prepare an eis when they propose to implement particular control strategies with environmental impacts.as we stated in salmon river concerned citizens robertson,cir,judicial estoppel will prevent the secretaries from arguing they have no further duty to consider their port orford cedar management policies when programs are challenged.at.we assume that government agencies will comply with their nepa obligations in later stages of development.id.at 
at emphasis added.
e.the present case 
a concrete plan,a specific undertaking,and a program incorporating the guidelines,such as we anticipated in northcoast,are now before us.plaintiffs challenge the sufficiency under nepa of both the eis for the coos bay rmp and the revised ea for the eight timber sales within the area,both of which refer to the guidelines.onrc argues that the eis and the revised ea are inadequate under nepa because rather than analyzing the impact of the fungus on the port orford cedar,they merely refer to the guidelines,which have never been subjected to nepa review.onrc also argues that the revised ea is deficient because it relies in part on the guidelines,and because its analysis of the fungus and the cedar,considered alone,is inadequate.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to.the district court determination on summary judgment that the blm complied with nepa is reviewed de novo.okanogan highlands alliance williams,cir.ripeness is a question of law reviewed de novo.natural res.def.council houston,cir.an agency threshold decision that certain activities are not subject to nepa is reviewed for reasonableness.see northcoast,at.an agency decision not to prepare an eis once that agency has prepared an ea is reviewed for abuse of discretion,and will be set aside only if it is arbitrary and capricious.marsh onrc,d see also okanogan highlands,at.
ii.ripeness of the challenge to the coos bay eis 
defendants blm and the timber companies argue that ohio forestry ass sierra club,d,precludes onrc challenge to the adequacy of the coos bay eis.in ohio forestry,the court held that a challenge under the national forest management act nfma to an rmp promulgated by the forest service was unripe for judicial decision.see id.at.the court considered whether delayed review would cause hardship to the plaintiffs whether judicial intervention would inappropriately interfere with further administrative action and whether the courts would benefit from further factual development of the issues presented.id.at.see also abbott labs.gardner,d.first,the court found no hardship to the plaintiffs in delaying review because the rmp at issue was merely a general plan,rather than an authorization of specific action.that is,the plan itself did not give anyone a legal right to cut trees,ohio forestry,at,and the plan itself could not harm the plaintiffs.the court noted that a later challenge to a specific action might also include a challenge to the lawfulness of the present plan if but only if the present plan then matters,if the plan plays a causal role with respect to the future,harm from logging.id.at.the court found that the second and third factors weighed against review as well,because interference with the agency procedures was premature,and because the issue was presently too abstract for judicial review.see id.at.
defendants urge that ohio forestry forecloses our review of onrc nepa challenge to the coos bay eis because,like the plan in ohio forestry,the challenged plan in this case is an rmp.the defendants argue that the rmp prepared under flpma in this case is analogous to the rmp prepared under nfma in ohio forestry.however,this case differs from ohio forestry in a critical respect.the plaintiffs in ohio forestry alleged that the rmp violated nfma,the statute that required the preparation of the rmp.they did not allege that the rmp violated nepa.the plaintiffs in this case,however,do not allege that the rmp violates flpma.flpma is the equivalent,in this case,to nfma in ohio forestry.rather,they allege that the eis,prepared in conjunction with the rmp,violates nepa.because the plaintiffs here bring a nepa challenge to an eis,rather than a nfma or a flpma challenge to an rmp,they are able to show an imminence of harm to the plaintiffs and a completeness of action by the agency that the court held were missing in ohio forestry.
a nepa challenge to an eis is fundamentally unlike a nfma or flpma challenge to an rmp.as the court explained in ohio forestry,nepa,unlike the nfma,simply guarantees a particular procedure a person with standing who is injured by a failure to comply with the nepa procedure may complain of that failure at the time the failure takes place,for the claim can never get riper.id.at.the rights conferred by nepa are procedural rather than substantive,and plaintiffs allege a procedural rather than a substantive injury.see methow valley citizens,at.nepa itself does not mandate particular results,but simply prescribes the necessary process.muckleshoot indian tribe usfs,cir inland empire pub.lands council usfs,cir nepa exists to ensure a process,not to ensure any result.emphasis in original.if there was an injury under nepa,it occurred when the allegedly inadequate eis was promulgated.that is,any nepa violation and any procedural injury inherent in the promulgation of an inadequate eis for the coos bay rmp have already occurred.see west sec y of dep t of,cir noting ohio forestry distinction between a nepa claim,involving imminent and certain injury and a nfma claim see also wilderness soc y thomas,cir noting that ohio forestry had acknowledged that a forest plan could always be challenged under nepa.further,adjudicating onrc nepa claim now will not inappropriately interfere with further administrative action,see ohio forestry,at,because the blm has already promulgated the eis for the coos bay rmp.the plaintiffs claim is therefore ripe for review.
our holding comports with the seventh circuit decision in heartwood,usfs,cir.in heartwood,the plaintiffs challenged the forest service failure to prepare either an eis or an ea prior to promulgating categorical exclusions from nepa for certain classes of forest service actions.id.at.the forest service contended that the plaintiffs claim was not ripe under ohio forestry because it did not pertain to authorization of a specific project,but the seventh circuit disagreed.id.at.noting that the supreme court in ohio forestry had explicitly distinguished a nepa claim from a nfma claim,the court explained that a plaintiff clearly has standing to sue where there is a concrete injury underlying the procedural default even if the plan is not implemented immediately.id.at emphasis added citation and internal quotation marks omitted.therefore,the heartwood plaintiffs were not barred by ohio forestry from asserting their nepa claim,because they need not wait to challenge a specific project when their grievance is with an overall plan.id.at.
iii.adequacy of the eis for the coos bay rmp 
onrc argues that the eis for the coos bay rmp is inadequate in that it merely refers to the guidelines,which have never been analyzed in an eis.the coos bay eis makes no attempt itself to analyze the effect of the fungus on the port orford cedar.
in reviewing the adequacy of an eis,we employ a rule of reason to determine whether the eis contains a reasonably thorough discussion of the significant aspects of probable environmental consequences.or.natural res.council lowe,cir.under this standard,review consists only of insuring that the agency took a hard look.id.neighbors of cuddy mountain usfs,cir.the rule of reason analysis and the review for an abuse of discretion are essentially the same.id.we examine the adequacy of the eis using an objective good faith standard.see coalition for canyon bowers,cir.
scope of the required eis 
as a threshold matter,defendants argue that nepa did not obligate the blm to undertake a detailed environmental analysis of the fungus and the port orford cedar when it prepared the eis for the coos bay rmp.the defendants argue that the eis merely analyzes the resource management plan,rather than a specific action,and that analysis of the fungus and the cedar is not required until the time a federal agency makes an irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources.we disagree.
federal regulations require preparation of an eis in conjunction with the preparation of any rmp.see approval of a resource management plan is considered a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.the environmental analysis of alternatives and the proposed plan shall be accomplished as part of the resource management planning process.an agency may not avoid an obligation to analyze in an eis environmental consequences that foreseeably arise from an rmp merely by saying that the consequences are unclear or will be analyzed later when an ea is prepared for a program proposed pursuant to the rmp.t he purpose of an eis is to evaluate the possibilities in light of current and contemplated plans and to produce an informed estimate of the environmental consequences drafting an eis necessarily involves some degree of forecasting.city of davis coleman,cir emphasis added.if an agency were able to defer analysis discussion of environmental consequences in an rmp,based on a promise to perform a comparable analysis in connection with later projects,no environmental consequences would ever need to be addressed in an eis at the rmp level if comparable consequences might arise,but on a smaller scale,from a later action proposed pursuant to the rmp.
once an agency has an obligation to prepare an eis,the scope of its analysis of environmental consequences in that eis must be appropriate to the action in question.nepa is not designed to postpone analysis of an environmental consequence to the last possible moment.rather,it is designed to require such analysis as soon as it can reasonably be done.see save our ecosystems clark,cir reasonable forecasting and speculation is implicit in nepa,and we must reject any attempt by agencies to shirk their responsibilities under nepa by labeling any and all discussion of future environmental effects as crystal ball inquiry,quoting scientists inst.for pub,atomic energy comm n.if it is reasonably possible to analyze the environmental consequences in an eis for an rmp,the agency is required to perform that analysis.the eis analysis may be more general than a subsequent ea analysis,and it may turn out that a particular environmental consequence must be analyzed in both the eis and the ea.but an earlier eis analysis will not have been wasted effort,for it will guide the ea analysis and,to the extent appropriate,permit tiering by the ea to the eis in order to avoid wasteful duplication.
it is clear that the eis for the coos bay rmp should have included an analysis of the likely impact of the rmp on the fungus and the port orford cedar.this environmental problem was readily apparent at the time the eis was prepared.indeed,it was apparent several years before,as evidenced by the earlier preparation of the guidelines.the rmp contained enough specifics to permit productive analysis of the fungus and the cedar,including proposals for alternative ways of dealing with the problem.we therefore inquire whether the analysis in the eis for the coos bay rmp is adequate under nepa.
tiering to the guidelines 
onrc argues that the eis is inadequate because its only discussion of the fungus and the cedar is contained in a brief reference to the guidelines,and because the eis illegally tiers to the guidelines.tiering,or avoiding detailed discussion by referring to another document containing the required discussion,is expressly permitted by federal regulation 
agencies are encouraged to tier their environmental impact statements to eliminate repetitive discussions of the same issues and to focus on the actual issues ripe for decision at each level of environmental review.whenever a broad environmental impact statement has been prepared such as a program or policy statement and a subsequent statement or environmental assessment is then prepared on an action included within the entire program or policy such as a site specific action the subsequent statement or environmental assessment need only summarize the issues discussed in the broader statement and incorporate discussions from the broader statement by reference and shall concentrate on the issues specific to the subsequent action.
however,tiering to a document that has not itself been subject to nepa review is not permitted,for it circumvents the purpose of nepa.while nepa empowers neither the plaintiffs nor this court to the blm management decisions,it does require the blm to articulate,publicly and in detail,the reasons for and likely effects of those management decisions,and to allow public comment on that articulation.see methow valley citizens,at.publication of an eis gives the public the assurance that the agency has indeed considered environmental concerns in its decisionmaking process.although the guidelines may contain a detailed analysis of the impact of the fungus on the port orford cedar,the blm is not excused from its responsibility under nepa to perform an analysis of the effects of the fungus on the cedar in an eis specifically addressed to the coos bay rmp.see c i,iii.
we specifically noted in northcoast that the guidelines would not be indefinitely shielded from nepa review although ceq procedures allow agencies to incorporate by reference certain materials to cut down on the bulk of an eis,they can not tier their eiss to the broader port orford cedar program where the program itself has not been subject to nepa procedures.at.we cautioned additionally that judicial estoppel will prevent the secretaries from arguing they have no further duty to consider their port orford cedar management policies when programs are challenged.id.we now hold,as we warned in northcoast that we would,that the eis for the coos bay rmp may not tier to the guidelines,for which an eis has never been prepared.
analysis in the eis 
because the coos bay eis may not tier to the guidelines,its adequacy depends on the analysis contained in the eis itself.the sum total of the analysis in the eis is the statement that the blm will 
conform all management activities within the range of to the guidelines described in the blm management policies to mitigate damage caused by phytophthora lateralis.analysis for projects within the range of will consider possible effects on the species.
this statement is obviously inadequate.the first sentence is an impermissible attempt to tier the analysis to the guidelines.the second sentence is not an analysis,but rather a promise of a later analysis to be performed in connection with specific projects within the range of the.the revised ea for the analysis area is such a analysis.the adequacy of that ea has also been challenged by onrc.we now turn to that question.
iv.adequacy of the environmental assessment 
the district court held that the revised ea adequately analyzed the environmental impacts of the proposed timber sales in the area.the original ea contained no analysis of the fungus on the port orford cedar.indeed,it specifically excluded such analysis.section s of the revised ea,which was prepared only after the timber sales had commenced and this litigation was initiated,does analyze the impact of the timber sales on the fungus and the cedar,but it is the only part of the ea or revised ea to do so.
on appeal,onrc attacks the revised ea,including section s,on three grounds.first,onrc claims the revised ea was not timely because it was prepared after the timber sales were completed.second,onrc claims the revised ea improperly tiers to the deficient eis for the coos bay rmp and the guidelines.finally,onrc claims that section s of the revised ea fails to address the cumulative impact of the timber sales and other reasonably foreseeable future actions on the cedar.because we agree with onrc on the second and third grounds,we express no opinion as to the first.even assuming that the analysis contained in section s was timely,the revised ea is nevertheless inadequate under nepa.
the revised ea for the area impermissibly attempts to tier both to the eis for the coos bay rmp and to the guidelines.as just discussed,the eis for the coos bay rmp is inadequate because it,too,impermissibly attempts to tier to the guidelines.the revised ea is therefore inadequate to the extent that it attempts to tier to the eis.the same is true of the revised ea attempt to tier to the guidelines.as the district court correctly stated 
d efendant attempts to utilize the port orford cedar guidelines,which were never subject to nepa review,by asserting that the ea did not tier to the guidelines but merely referenced them as a shorthand way of describing a set of potential mitigation measures.however,nepa requires more than a shorthand reference to consider environmental impacts of an agency mitigation measures.to the extent that the coos bay rmp played a role with respect to the timber sales,it suffers from the same infirmity.
kern bureau of land,d,citation omitted.
cumulative impact analysis 
because the revised ea for the area may not tier to either the eis or the guidelines,we examine whether the revised ea,standing alone,satisfies the requirements of nepa.section s of the revised ea analyzes the impact only of the specific timber sales proposed for the area,and it analyzes the impact of that agency action only in that area.it performs no analysis of impacts outside the area.most important,it performs no cumulative impact analysis of reasonably foreseeable future actions outside the area that,in combination with the timber sales,could constitute collectively significant actions over a period of time.because the revised ea does not perform such an analysis,we hold that it is inadequate under nepa.
in determining the scope of the required nepa analysis,an agency must consider not only the proposed action,but also three types of related actions connected actions,similar actions,and cumulative actions.a.cumulative actions are those which when viewed with other proposed actions have cumulatively significant impacts.id.a.in determining the significance of a proposed action,an agency must consider 
whether the action is related to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulatively significant impacts.significance exists if it is reasonable to anticipate a cumulatively significant impact on the environment.significance can not be avoided by terming an action temporary or by breaking it down into small component parts.
b.see also churchill county norton,cir.the regulations define cumulative impact as 
the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency federal or or person undertakes such other actions.cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.
id.emphasis added.
consideration of cumulative impacts requires some quantified or detailed information g eneral statements about possible effects and some risk do not constitute a hard look absent a justification regarding why more definitive information could not be provided.neighbors of cuddy mountain,at.the cumulative impact analysis must be more than perfunctory it must provide a useful analysis of the cumulative impacts of past,present,and future projects.muckleshoot indian tribe,at.finally,cumulative impact analysis must be timely.it is not appropriate to defer consideration of cumulative impacts to a future date when meaningful consideration can be given now.see neighbors of cuddy mountain,at city of tenakee springs,at.when an agency determination of what are reasonably foreseeable future actions and appropriate component parts is fully informed and,we will defer to that determination.blue mountains biodiversity project blackwood,cir quoting save the yaak comm.block,cir.but we need not forgive a clear error in judgment.id.
federal regulations do not explicitly require an eis to include a discussion of cumulative impacts,edwardsen united states dep t of interior,cir,but they do direct agencies to consider cumulative impacts in determining the scope of an eis,citing c.we have interpreted the regulations to require that the eis consider the cumulative impact of the proposed action.see edwardsen,at see also neighbors of cuddy mountain,at w here several actions have a cumulative environmental effect,this consequence must be considered in an eis.city of tenakee springs clough,cir.
similarly,nepa regulations contain only a brief description of the requirements for an ea,and do not specifically mention cumulative impact analysis.they state that an ea must 
briefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact aid an agency compliance with the act when no environmental impact statement is necessary facilitate preparation of a statement when one is necessary.
a.an ea s hall include brief discussions of the need for the proposal,of alternatives as required by section e of nepa,of the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives,and a listing of agencies and persons consulted.id.b.
we have held that an ea may be deficient if it fails to include a cumulative impact analysis or to tier to an eis that has conducted such an analysis.see hall norton,cir blue mountains biodiversity project,at idaho sporting cong.thomas,cir.other circuits have also recognized the requirement that,in appropriate cases,an ea must include a cumulative impact analysis.see,soc y hill towers owners ass rendell,cir i f the cumulative impact of a given project and other planned projects is significant,an applicant can not simply prepare an ea for its project,issue a fonsi,and ignore the overall impact of the project newton county wildlife ass rogers,cir holding that an ea adequately addressed cumulative impacts where it covered a timber sale involving acres but considered environmental impacts on acres.the importance of analyzing cumulative impacts in eas is apparent when we consider the number of eas that are prepared.the council on environmental quality noted in a recent report that in a typical year,eas are prepared compared to eiss given that so many more eas are prepared than eiss,adequate consideration of cumulative effects requires that eas address them fully.council on environmental quality,considering cumulative effects under the national environmental policy act at,also available at http last visited,emphasis added.
we have previously indicated,in cases similar to this one,that cumulative impact analysis is appropriate at the ea level.in hall norton,the blm proposed to exchange acres of land it owned in the las vegas valley so that a private developer could build approximately new homes on the land.the blm prepared an ea that analyzed the pollution that would result from development on the land,but that failed to analyze the additional pollution that might result if other land it owned in the las vegas valley were also exchanged.plaintiff had alleged in his complaint that the ea had failed to consider cumulative impacts,but the district court had dismissed the complaint without considering the argument.
