the principal question that we must resolve in this appeal is whether the california coastal act of,public resources code section et the coastal act empowers the california coastal commission the commission to declare that property is an environmentally sensitive habitat area esha during an administrative appeal from a local government grant of a coastal development permit cdp.appellant security national guaranty,sng challenges three orders of the superior court the denial of sng petition for writ of administrative mandamus,the denial of sng motion to remand the matter to the commission for further proceedings,and the grant of summary adjudication to the commission.
we conclude that the coastal act grants the commission no power to declare property an esha during a cdp appeal.accordingly,we reverse the superior court denial of sng petition for administrative mandamus.we affirm the superior court grant of summary adjudication.
factual and procedural background 
the sng site 
appellant sng owns,and seeks to develop,a oceanfront site located west of state highway on monterey bay in sand city.from to about,the lonestar company conducted one of the largest commercial operations in the western united states on the land now owned by sng.lonestar excavated and sold sand for industrial,commercial,and consumer uses.the sand mining operations left the site in an environmentally degraded condition,with an excavation pit near the middle of the property.
for many years after its incorporation in,sand city was the site of a number of businesses engaged in heavy commercial and industrial activities.beginning in the,however,many of these businesses closed.recognizing the city need for economic recovery and development,sand city sought to provide for commercially viable resort and recreational development on designated portions of its coastline.
sand city local coastal program 
in the early,sand city formulated its local coastal program lcp the lup adopted by sand city designated what is now sng site for visitor serving commercial uses.the original lup also identified and mapped locations that were esha.section of the lup noted the existence of dune areas along the coast,explaining that the dunes were divided into two distinct east of highway and one west of highway.as to the area west of the highway and closest to the ocean,the lup stated that t he area provides no natural habitats and that no esha existed west of highway.the only esha identified and mapped in the lup were located east of highway.no esha were mapped on what is now sng site,which is located entirely west of the highway.the lup designated the property at issue in this appeal for commercial uses,with a density not to exceed units.
the commission concluded that sand city lcp met the requirements of the coastal act and certified the lcp as consistent with the coastal act goals and policies.during the certification process,the commission proposed,and sand city adopted,a number of modifications to the city lcp.after these modifications,the commission granted the sand city lcp final certification on march.
in,the commission conducted a periodic review of sand city lcp pursuant to section.the periodic review resulted in the commission making recommendations to sand city,including both lcp amendments and other actions.the record discloses no suggestion from the commission that the property at issue in this appeal be designated an esha.
the memorandum of understanding 
beginning in the late,the monterey peninsula regional park district the park district attempted to amend sand city lcp to make parks and open space the preferred use on all lands west of highway.in addition,the park district and the state department of parks and recreation the parks department sought to acquire coastal land within sand city for park purposes.sand city vigorously resisted the park district efforts,because it wished to preserve certain coastal parcels for development to ensure a stable fiscal future for the city.sand city eventually sued the park district to challenge,among other things,the park district land acquisition program in the city.
the controversy between sand city and the park agencies continued for years.in,senate majority leader henry mello intervened to mediate the coastal development dispute.senator mello arranged a meeting between the representatives of sand city,the park district,the parks department,and the commission.as a result of this initial meeting,the interested parties formed a discussion group in an effort to resolve the conflict.after further meetings of this discussion group,the interested parties agreed to settle their differences by executing a memorandum of understanding mou.
on april,representatives of sand city,the sand city redevelopment agency,the park district,and the parks department signed the mou.the commission was not a party to the agreement.among other things,the mou recognized the need for both appropriate development within sand city and for the protection of coastal views,dunes,and public access to the beach.in particular,one of the mou stated objectives was to e nable appropriate public and private development to occur along the sand city coastline including but not limited to visitor serving and residential uses.the mou also recognized that the site formerly used by the lonestar company was subject to an option to purchase by a private development company.that company was sng.
with regard to the former lonestar site,the mou provided that during the active period of the option or in the event the option is exercised,the parks department,the park district,and sand city agree to recognize and respect the option agreement and the option holder right to pursue development of the lonestar site consistent with the sand city lcp.during that same period,the park district and the parks department agreed to cease their efforts to acquire the former lonestar site.the park district further agreed that it would revise its application to amend the sand city lcp to exclude the lonestar site from the amendment.thus,the mou contemplated that the bulk of sand city coastline west of highway would be set aside for park uses,but that in two specific areas,including the lonestar site now sng property,commercial and residential uses would be permitted.
finally,the mou provided that sand city and the sand city redevelopment agency would dismiss their action against the park district.assured by the mou that some commercial and residential development would be permitted along the coast,sand city and its redevelopment agency acquiesced to further acquisition of coastal properties by the park agencies for park and open space purposes.
amendments to the sand city lcp 
prior to execution of the mou,the commission staff had offered to assist sand city and the park agencies in developing the lcp amendments which are necessary to carry out the proposed mou.to implement the mou,the park district and the commission agreed upon changes to proposed lcp amendment.rather than zoning all coastal properties within the city for preferred public park uses,the revised amendment excluded what is now sng site from the park designation,thus permitting it to be developed.on april,the commission unanimously approved amendment.the amendment became effective immediately upon the commission approval.
sng exercised its option to purchase the former lonestar site in,and closed on the property in early.at sng request,on april,sand city approved another amendment to its lcp to allow the land use designations on the sng site to be mixed,rather than segregated,while maintaining the uses and densities permitted by the lcp.the commission staff recommended that the amendment be approved with certain suggested modifications.although the staff analysis of the amendment discussed esha issues,it did not state or even suggest that sng site might be an esha.in fact,the commission staff found that the proposed amendment do es not raise an issue of conformance with coastal act habitat protection policies.the commission then approved this amendment on june.
sng project 
sng proposed project is called monterey bay shores resort.as initially proposed,the project contained units,but sng later reduced this number to.the project submitted was a development that provided for timeshare units,a hotel,residential condominiums,and visitor serving residential units,as well as a conference center.the project also contained plans for habitat restoration and dune stabilization.
sng then applied to sand city for issuance of a coastal development permit cdp for the project.on december,sand city city council adopted a resolution approving the cdp.the cdp approval was subject to conditions that sng would have to meet before it could begin construction at the site.the city council specifically found that the project as conditioned was consistent with sand city certified lcp.
appeal of the cdp to the commission 
the sierra club and two members of the commission appealed the issuance of the cdp to the commission.see,subd.a.on february,the commission determined that the appeal raised a substantial issue as to whether the project conformed to the sand city lcp,subd.b.as a result,the commission was required to consider the application at a de novo public hearing,subd.a,tit,b.
during the administrative appeal process,the commission staff reviewed the project in detail and prepared a report that recommended that the commission deny a cdp for the project on the grounds that the proposed development was inconsistent with sand city certified lcp as well as coastal act policies regarding public access and recreation.relying on the general policies regarding esha in sand city lcp,the staff report declared that the entire project site was an esha.the staff report made no mention of the specific finding in section of sand city certified lup that there were no esha in the area west of highway,the area that includes sng site.the staff report went on to conclude that sng project did not adequately protect environmentally sensitive dune habitat.
in addition to its esha findings,the commission staff concluded that the project did not meet lcp requirements regarding water supply.in particular,the staff report noted that the project required a water distribution permit from the montgomery peninsula water management district the water district and that the water district had denied the permit on october.
after a hearing on december,the commission voted to deny sng cdp based on the findings in the staff report 
sng action 
sng subsequently filed a combined petition for writ of administrative mandamus and complaint against the state of california and the commission,a petition which it later amended.sierra club intervened in the case.sng petition asserted seven causes of action,including claims for administrative mandamus under code of civil procedure section,inverse condemnation,breach of contract,and estoppel.the latter four claims are before us on appeal.
on december,the trial court denied sng petition for writ of administrative mandamus based on the commission findings that there were inadequate groundwater resources for the project.although the trial court did entertain argument on the legality of the commission esha designation,it did not rule on that issue.
on february,the trial court granted the commission motion for summary adjudication of sng claims for inverse condemnation,breach of contract,and estoppel.as to the claim for inverse condemnation,the trial court concluded that it was not yet ripe.citing toigo town of ross th,d toigo,the trial court noted that sng project was sng first application for development of its site.the trial court suggested that the commission had not made a final decision as to the uses to which sng site could be put and that the proper course for sng was to modify its project and reapply for a permit.see toigo,supra,at,d no final decision for takings purposes unless governmental entity has rejected a formal development plan and denied property owner request for a variance or exception from controlling regulations.addressing sng estoppel claim,the trial court concluded that such a claim is indistinguishable from a vested rights claim and that no such claim would lie until sng had obtained a valid building permit or its equivalent.finally,the trial court granted summary adjudication to the commission on sng claim for breach of contract.noting that sng breach of contract claim was grounded on the terms of the mou,the trial court held that the mou could not be read as binding the commission to approve sng project and that,in any event,the commission could not be bound by an agreement to which it was not a party 
on february,sng moved to remand the matter to the commission based on what it described as newly produced evidence.see code civ,subd.e.the alleged newly discovered evidence was a final judgment of the monterey county superior court in california american water city of seaside super.monterey county no.sng claimed that the decision had established that sng had more than sufficient water for the project.on april,the trial court denied sng motion to remand.
on march,sng voluntarily dismissed its remaining causes of action.the trial court entered separate judgments for the commission and for the sierra club.sng then filed a timely appeal from those judgments.
discussion 
in this court,sng attacks three of the trial court orders the denial of sng petition for writ of administrative mandamus the denial of sng motion to remand and the grant of summary adjudication to the commission.we will address sng contentions on each of these issues in turn.
sng was entitled to issuance of a writ of administrative mandamus.
sng contends that the trial court erred in denying its petition for writ of administrative mandamus.sng principal argument on this point is that the coastal act grants the commission no statutory authority to declare sng site an esha during the administrative appeal from sand city grant of a cdp.
in its responsive brief,the commission does not address sng arguments regarding its statutory authority to declare sng site an esha.although the commission acknowledges that sng has raised such a challenge the commission declines to address the issue.instead,the commission argues only that a decision on this question would amount to an advisory opinion and that substantial evidence supports its finding that sng site is an esha regrettably,we are therefore left to address sng argument regarding the commission statutory authority without the benefit of the commission written views 
standard of review 
relying on various provisions of the coastal act,sng contends that the commission has exceeded the jurisdiction granted to it by that statute.where a party alleges that the commission has acted beyond its statutory jurisdiction,it may challenge the agency order or decision in an action for administrative mandamus under code of civil procedure section.state of california superior court cal d.in such an action,the court inquiry extends to determining whether the agency acted in excess of its jurisdiction or abused its discretion by not proceeding in the manner required by law.code civ,subd.b schneider california coastal com.th,d schneider.
when the determination of an administrative agency jurisdiction involves a question of statutory interpretation,the issue of whether the agency proceeded in excess of its jurisdiction is a question of law.schneider,supra,th at,d.as the california supreme court has explained,a court does not defer to an agency view when deciding whether a regulation lies within the scope of the authority delegated by the legislature.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,fn,d,yamaha.we therefore review de novo whether the coastal act empowers the commission to designate property as esha during the administrative appeal from a local government grant of a cdp.
b.the commission purported esha designation is final and the matter is ripe for judicial review.
although the commission does not directly confront sng challenge to its statutory authority,it does contend generally that a decision on this issue would be premature.the commission appears to argue that its esha designation is not yet final because the commission has not made the requisite definitive pronouncement regarding the potential use of sng property.the commission thus urges that the trial court correctly refused to rule on what the commission calls specified determinations regarding sng property.according to the commission,those determinations are not final and hence not ripe for judicial review in an inverse condemnation claim.the commission relies on the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies in claiming that the matter is not ripe for review.we disagree with the commission,because we conclude that the agency purported esha designation is both final and ripe for review.
finality and exhaustion of administrative remedies 
code of civil procedure section,subdivision a permits courts to review only a final administrative order or decision made in an adjudicatory or proceeding.western states petroleum superior court cal th,d,see cal.administrative mandamus cont.ed.bar ed,under ccp a,a writ of administrative mandamus may be issued to review an administrative decision only if it is final,italics added.the need for a final decision is considered an aspect of the requirement that a party exhaust its administrative remedies prior to filing suit.cal.administrative mandamus,supra.here,the commission essentially contends that a decision on sng challenge to the commission authority to designate esha would be premature because there has been no final decision on the kind of development that might be permitted on sng site.
the commission argument overlooks the fact that this appeal involves two separate administrative commission purported esha designation,on the one hand,and the permitting decision,on the other.the two decisions are of an entirely different character.amending an lcp,by declaring certain property an esha,is a legislative act.yost thomas cal d,yost san mateo county coastal landowners county of san mateo th,d.in contrast,where the commission hears an administrative appeal from a local government issuance of a cdp,the commission is acting in a capacity.see,city of coronado california coastal zone conservation com.d.see also pacifica city of camarillo d.the courts have uniformly held that the coastal permit process is adjudicatory.that the commission permitting process may not have run its course says nothing about the finality of the commission purported esha designation it may be that there has been no final decision as to the uses to which sng property may be put toigo,supra,th at,d,but there has certainly been a final determination by the commission that the property is an esha.
even if the two administrative decisions were not entirely separate,sng would be excused from exhausting its administrative remedies.in this case,sng attacks the commission jurisdiction by contending that the coastal act grants the commission no authority to designate property as esha in the context of an appeal to the commission from a local government grant of a cdp.in such cases,the courts have held that the administrative jurisdiction exception to the exhaustion doctrine applies.coachella valley mosquito vector control dist.california public employment relations bd.cal th,d,coachella valley buckley california coastal com.th,d the rule of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply where the subject matter lies outside the administrative agency jurisdiction.our high court explained in coachella valley that a court may entertain a claim that an agency lacks jurisdiction before the agency proceedings have run their course if three factors favor review.coachella valley,supra,at,d.the court must consider the injury or burden that exhaustion will impose the strength of the legal argument that the agency lacks jurisdiction and the extent to which agency expertise may aid in resolving the jurisdictional issue.ibid.here,all three factors militate in favor of entertaining sng claim.
first,failure to review the issue of the commission statutory authority will impose significant burdens on sng.if,as the commission claims,sng site is an esha,the site is subject to the development constraints of section,which permits only uses dependent on habitat resources,subd.a.and,if the esha designation is proper,those constraints are applicable now.a site status as an esha places very significant limitations on permissible development.see bolsa chica land trust superior court th,d bolsa chica the terms of protect habitat values by placing strict limits on the uses which may occur in an esha sierra club california coastal com.th,d sierra club stating that residential development is prohibited in an esha.any future development proposal that sng might submit will be limited to uses.thus,whether through increased delay or project modification,the esha designation directly affect s the investment and project development choices of those whose activities are subject to the designation.national ass of home army corps,army corps decision to issue nationwide permits held final where it would have effect of causing builders either to put their projects on hold and seek individual permits,or modify their projects to satisfy conditions of nationwide permits.this factor thus weighs in favor of judicial intervention.
second,as we explain in part,post,sng makes a strong and persuasive argument that the commission has no statutory authority to make the esha designation in the context of a permit appeal.in fact,as we will show,not only does the commission lack statutory authority for its action,but in making its esha designation,it also intruded upon powers that the coastal act expressly allocates to local governments.this factor therefore also weighs in favor of excusing exhaustion.
finally,this issue is not one that would benefit from application of administrative expertise.here,the issues are purely legal and of a kind within the expertise of the courts.coachella valley,supra,cal th at,d.as we noted in discussing our standard of review,the issue of whether the agency proceeded in excess of its jurisdiction is a question of law schneider,supra,th at,d,and is one on which we do not defer to the commission views.yamaha,supra,cal th at,fn,d,see also bolsa chica,supra,th at,d court owed no deference to statutory interpretation adopted by commission in approving an lcp.this factor also favors review.
accordingly,because all three factors favor judicial intervention at this time,any failure by sng to exhaust administrative remedies is excused.coachella valley,supra,cal th at,d.
we also have no difficulty concluding that this issue is ripe for review.to determine whether an issue is ripe for review,we evaluate two questions the fitness of the issue for judicial decision and the hardship that may result from withholding court consideration.pacific legal foundation california coastal com.cal d.we are persuaded that the issue of the commission statutory authority is fit for judicial decision.as we indicated above,whether the coastal act grants the commission the power to declare sng site an esha during an administrative appeal from the grant of a cdp is a purely legal issue.resolution of this issue requires an interpretation of the coastal act,upon which the facts in this case will have little bearing.hayward area planning alameda county transportation authority th,d see also alameda county land use city of hayward th,d action for declaratory relief ripe when the parties dispute whether a public entity has engaged in conduct or established policies in violation of applicable law.the legality vel non of the commission action will not change from case to case or become clearer in a concrete setting.national ass home buil.army corps.such a purely legal challenge to the commission authority is therefore fit for decision now.ibid.purely legal challenge to agency action is presumptively reviewable.in addition,as we explained in our discussion of the administrative jurisdiction exception to the exhaustion doctrine,withholding decision would impose a significant hardship on sng.see id.at hardship shown where agency rule would confront builders with choice of applying for permit of activities builders claimed were beyond agency jurisdiction or face penalties for failing to do so.the question is therefore ripe for judicial review.
c.the commission acted in excess of its jurisdiction.
sng asserts that the commission has no authority under the coastal act to designate its property as esha in the course of a permit appeal.sng contends that the esha designation effected an amendment of the sand city lcp and that the coastal act assigns the task of drafting and amending the content of an lcp exclusively to local government.sng position is that the coastal act grants to local governments the power to draft their own lcp and to determine the content thereof.sng contends that the commission role is limited to determining whether a local government lcp complies with the provisions of the coastal act.our examination of the relevant provisions of the coastal act compels us to conclude that sng is correct.
general principles 
the commission,like all administrative agencies,has no inherent powers it possesses only those powers that have been granted to it by the constitution or by statute.see carmel valley fire protection dist.state of california cal th,d,state bd.of education honig th,d koch,administrative law practice ed,administrative agencies derive their power from other sources and hence agencies have only such authority as is delegated by the legislature.a n agency literally has no power to act unless and until the legislature confers power upon it.louisiana public service comm fcc,d,italics added lpsc.that an agency has been granted some authority to act within a given area does not mean that it enjoys plenary authority to act in that area.railway labor exec.ass national mediation bd,en banc.as a consequence,if the commission takes action that is inconsistent with,or that simply is not authorized by,the coastal act,then its action is void.see schneider,supra,th at,d accord,bmw of north america,new motor vehicle bd.d.it is fundamental that an administrative agency has only such power as has been conferred upon it by the constitution or by statute and an act in excess of the power conferred upon the agency is void.
our task is thus to determine whether the commission esha designation exceeded the commission statutory grant of authority under the coastal act.see benton board of supervisors d.to do so,we look to the relevant provisions of that statute.
the coastal act 
the coastal act sets out a process by which lcp are prepared,adopted,certified,and periodically reviewed.it also permits their amendment.as we shall show,the coastal act expressly vests in local governments,rather than the commission,the responsibility for determining the content of their lcp.thus,we conclude that the commission has no statutory authority to amend an lcp during the cdp appeal process.
preparation and content of the lcp 
the coastal act requires that each local government lying,in whole or in part,within the coastal zone prepare an lcp for that portion of the coastal zone under the local government jurisdiction,unless the local government asks the commission to prepare the lcp,subd.a.an lcp consists of two principal components an lup,and implementing actions,such as zoning ordinances and maps.see lcp consists of a local government a land use plans,b zoning ordinances,c zoning district maps,and d within sensitive coastal resources areas,other implementing actions see also defining implementing actions,defining land use plan.under the statute,t he precise content of each local coastal program shall be determined by the local government in full consultation with the commission and with full public participation,subd.c,italics added.
submission of the lcp for commission certification 
the local government must then submit the proposed lcp to the commission for certification.the local government may choose to submit its entire proposed lcp at once,or in phases in which case the lup is processed first,followed by the implementing actions,or in separate geographic units,subds.a c.the commission must then review the land use portion of the lcp under specified procedures,subd.a.if the commission finds that the lup meets the requirements of chapter of the coastal act,and is in conformance with the policies of that chapter,then it must certify it,subd.c commission shall certify lup meeting chapter requirements.the commission review of the lup is limited by statute to the commission administrative determination that the land use plan does,or does not,conform with the requirements of chapter commencing with section.in making this review,the commission is not authorized by any provision of this division to diminish or abridge the authority of a local government to adopt and establish,by ordinance,the precise content of its land use plan,subd.a,italics added.similarly,the commission may only reject the local government implementing actions on the grounds that they do not conform with,or are inadequate to carry out,the provisions of the certified land use plan.quoting with approval city of chula vista superior court d,our high court noted in yost that the commission in approving or disapproving an lcp does not create or originate any land use rules and regulations.it can approve or disapprove but it can not itself draft any part of the coastal plan.yost,supra,cal d at,italics added.
delegation of development review authority after certification 
once the commission approves the local government lcp,development review authority shall no longer be exercised by the commission over any new development proposed within the area to which the certified local coastal program,or any portion thereof,applies and shall at that time be delegated to the local government that is implementing the local coastal program or any portion thereof,subd.a.after certification,the local government has discretion to choose what actions it will take to implement its lcp.yost,supra,cal d at.thus,for example,the coastal act does not dictate that a local government must build a hotel and conference decision is made by the local government.it merely requires local governments to comply with specific the decision of whether to build a hotel or whether to designate an area for a park remains with the local government.id.at.
once the lcp is certified,the commission role in the permit process for coastal development is to hear appeals from decisions by the local government to grant or deny permits.feduniak california coastal com.th,fn,d,citing.the commission jurisdiction in such appeals,however,is limited.city of half moon bay superior court th,d.as relevant here,the coastal act limits the grounds for a cdp appeal to an allegation that the development does not conform to the standards set forth in the certified local coastal program,subd.b,italics added.
periodic review and amendment of the lcp 
the coastal act requires the commission to review every certified lcp at least once every five years to determine whether the program is being implemented in conformity with coastal act policies,subd.a.if the commission finds that a certified lcp is not being carried out in conformity with the coastal act,it must recommend corrective actions to the local government,which may include recommended amendments to the certified lcp.ibid.even in these circumstances,however,the statute gives the commission no power either to make the amendments itself or to compel the local government to make them.instead,the law requires the affected local government to report to the commission the reasons that it has not taken the recommended corrective action,subd.b.the commission may then review the local government report and where appropriate,report to the legislature and recommend legislative action necessary to assure effective implementation of the relevant policy or policies of the coastal act.ibid.
the commission role in the amendment process is similarly circumscribed.the coastal act provides for amendment of a certified lcp but once again makes clear that the lcp may be amended by the appropriate local government,subject to review by the commission,subd.a.
by declaring sng site an esha,the commission exceeded its statutory authority,improperly assumed powers reserved to local government,and contradicted the terms of the certi
