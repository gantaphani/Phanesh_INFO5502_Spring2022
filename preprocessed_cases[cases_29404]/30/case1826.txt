in deciding whether a punitive damages award violates the constitutional prohibition of arbitrary or grossly excessive punishment,the most important factor to be considered is the reprehensibility of the defendant conduct the united states supreme court has instructed courts undertaking this inquiry that a defendant dissimilar acts,independent from the acts upon which liability was premised,may not serve as the basis for punitive damages.on de novo review,we conclude that evidence of two massive oil spills is too dissimilar to be considered in assessing defendant reprehensibility in causing and responding to the underground contamination of plaintiffs commercial property.we further conclude that in order to comply with due process,the proscription of dissimilar acts evidence in punitive damages cases must apply to both the jury predicate determination whether a defendant is liable for punitive damages,subd.a,as well as to its subsequent evaluation of a defendant reprehensibility in assessing the amount of punitive damages to be awarded.
unocal corporation unocal appeals from the judgment awarding in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages on trespass,nuisance,and negligence claims arising from subterranean oil contamination that was caused by a leak from one of unocal pipelines.unocal contends that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations that the punitive damages award must be reversed and that interest on the judgment was incorrectly calculated.on the second assignment of error,unocal asserts that its federal due process rights were violated by the admission of evidence of unocal dissimilar conduct relating to other spills that occurred on other pipelines at different locations.state farm,supra,at.unocal also claims that the error was compounded by the trial court refusal of unocal proposed instruction limiting the jury consideration of the evidence.philip morris usa williams,d philip morris.
we agree with unocal that the punitive damages award does not comport with due process because the jury was effectively invited to punish unocal for injuring persons or entities that are not parties to this litigation,for conduct that had nothing to do with that which harmed the plaintiffs in this case.because unocal dissimilar conduct was admitted not only for the purpose of evaluating the degree of unocal reprehensibility in setting the amount of punitive damages,but also to prove that unocal was guilty of malice,fraud or oppression,the jury findings of liability for punitive damages and the amount of the award are both fatally undermined.accordingly,although we affirm the award of compensatory damages,we reverse and remand for a new trial on punitive damages liability and the amount of such damages to be awarded,if any.
facts and procedural history 
of limitations and compensatory operations in san luis obispo county 
from the early until unocal owned,operated and maintained miles of subterranean oil pipelines in central california,approximately miles of which were located in san luis obispo county.several pump stations throughout the county that heated and transported the oil were also owned and operated by unocal.in addition to these pipelines and facilities,unocal operated wells and a refinery at the oil fields in guadalupe the guadalupe facility,as well as pipelines that carried a petroleum diluting agent,or diluent,to the wells in order to facilitate the pumping of crude oil the diluent pipelines.the transportation pipelines and pump stations were operated and maintained through unocal northern pipeline division.the guadalupe oil wells were operated by unocal oil and gas division,while the facilities that refined the crude oil were operated by the refinery division.
one of unocal pump stations was located on tank farm road in san luis obispo the tank farm facility.two pipelines the a and b lines ran under tank farm road to and from the pump station.the a line ran south approximately nine miles to a pump station at avila beach the avila beach facility,while the b line ran to the north to another station.in,lightning ignited two of the large oil reservoirs at the tank farm facility and several smaller storage tanks,resulting in oil spills.there was also some evidence that one of the pipelines had ruptured in,although unocal had no record of the incident.
unocal replaced the a and b pipelines in,and cathodic protection systems were installed on both lines in.in,unocal hired a manager to monitor the cathodic protection system.the pipelines were also monitored by a computerized system that continuously gathered information about each pipeline pressure,temperature and flow rates.hydrostatic testing of the lines every five years from to did not identify any leaks,although the september monthly activity report referred to prior valve leaks on the a and b lines 
from to,there were a total of leaks in the northern pipeline division pipelines,including that were related to corrosion.of the leaks were in the san luis obispo district,which encompassed all of unocal facilities in san luis obispo county.nine of those leaks,most of which occurred at the avila beach facility where cathodic protection was at its lowest,were the result of external corrosion.unocal had no reports of any corrosion leaks from the a and b lines during that period.
james bushman,the holdgrafers pipeline corrosion expert,opined that unocal corrosion leaks were excessive.he also concluded that the a and b lines would not have been replaced in had they not been leaking due to corrosion,and he inferred that there would have been multiple corrosion leaks on those lines from the to the because they were placed in corrosive soil and operated at a higher temperature than other pipelines for which there were reports of corrosion.bushman also inferred from the high number of leaks that unocal did not take appropriate monthly readings or budget enough money for its cathodic system.
john scoggins,a former unocal employee who worked at the tank farm and avila beach facilities from approximately to,testified that an average of three leaks occurred each month,usually as the result of corrosion.he was only able to specifically recall leaks at the avila beach facility,however,as well as a leak into the san luis creek in the from a pipeline that runs west from the a and b lines.scoggins also testified that he participated in the monthly monitoring of the cathodic protection system during the entire course of his employment,and that he visited each test station in the district for that purpose at least once a month.he also testified that whenever a problem was discovered,he reported it to his supervisors and assisted in the repair.
discovery of the contamination on plaintiffs property 
plaintiffs are the owners of a,property on tank farm road.plaintiffs garry holdgrafer holdgrafer and evelyn holdgrafer purchased the property with harold and audrey york in for.the yorks sold their interest in the property to robert miller and neil maloney in the.plaintiff holdgrafer associates was subsequently formed to own and develop the property.in,unocal guaranteed a loan on the property,the proceeds of which were used by plaintiffs garry holdgrafer ii,cindy okerson,and holdgrafer okerson to buy out miller and maloney interests in the property.
by,three industrial buildings had been built on the two front parcels of the property and were fully rented to various tenants.in,a prospective buyer of land on tank farm road conducted preliminary soil tests that revealed oil contamination.the property was near plaintiffs property.unocal acknowledged that it owned and operated two underground pipelines along tank farm road,asked to see the final soil report when it was available,and represented that i f the contamination is a result of our operations,we will work with the present owner of the property,the county,and regional water quality board to resolve the problem.
in an october internal memorandum,unocal noted that w e have both soil and groundwater contamination at our san luis obispo tank farm and adjacent properties.two pending property sales fell out of escrow because of the discovery of oil contamination.subsequent site investigations have confirmed extensive contamination.there is no question that this was caused by either past pipeline leaks although we have no record of any or migration from the tank farm area.unocal paid to the landowners who lost interest on the land sales,and stated its intent to provide the property owners with a cleanup guarantee to the effect that unocal will remediate the properties to the satisfaction of the lead agency california regional water quality control board.
holdgrafer saw the tests being conducted on the neighboring property and heard a rumor there was contamination.holdgrafer contacted ron james,the supervisor of unocal tank farm facility,who told him w e are investigating it and we have a report and it shows that there is contamination along tank farm road.on january,unocal wrote to holdgrafer stating it was in the process of investigating hydrocarbon contamination in the san luis obispo area around tank farm road and seeking permission to conduct soil tests on plaintiffs property in furtherance of its investigation.the tests were conducted,and contamination was discovered on the two parcels of plaintiffs property that abut tank farm road.unocal informed holdgrafer of the test results,and provided him a copy of its experts investigation report on the matter.
unocal searched its internal leak records and retained environmental experts to investigate the contamination.james testified that no reports or evidence of a specific leak were found.with approval from the regional water quality control board rwqcb,unocal drilled soil borings and monitoring wells along tank farm road.the environmental experts reports identified a plume of contamination under a portion of plaintiffs property.holdgrafer was promptly provided those reports.unocal has continuously monitored the contamination to ensure that it is not migrating.
although the rwqcb initially concluded that the contamination would have to be removed,it did not demand excavation.in early,unocal submitted a risk assessment to the rwqcb indicating that the contamination does not pose a risk of harm to human health in,unocal submitted its corrective action plan to the rwqcb,in which unocal proposed that it continue to monitor the contamination and allow natural attenuation to biodegrade it over time as an alternative to excavation.in the meantime,unocal has continued to monitor the contamination and report the results to the agency.
the negotiations 
in november of,holdgrafer retained attorney hank mott to advise him regarding the contamination.on december,mott sent a letter to unocal stating that t he evidence is very conclusive that my client real property has been damaged by crude oil from your company operations.the impact on my client use of the property is extremely serious.a prospective lender or purchaser of the property will not be interested in the property due to this condition.we will be required to disclose this situation and this will make it virtually impossible to get a loan or to sell the property at its fair market value.we are prepared to file suit for the damages we have sustained.we are also prepared to enter into a sale of the two parcels to your company which are affected by the crude oil for the sum of million dollars.
on february,unocal,through its assistant counsel walter crim,responded we agree that the site investigation report shows that crude oil is present under your client property.however,we disagree that your client has suffered damages as a result of the crude oil being present.your letter indicates that a prospective lender or purchaser of the property will not be interested in the property due to this condition.this may or may not be true.as you are probably aware,the property which is west of your client property was sold even with the noted contamination.thus,the fact that the property is contaminated does not mean that the property can not be sold for its fair market value.if your client is desirous of selling the property to a bona fide purchaser,we will cooperate with the prospective purchaser and lender to allow the transfer to go through.as you are probably aware,unocal is in the process of completing its investigation and will begin remediation in the area as required by the regional water quality control board.unocal is committed to this.unocal is also committed to work with its neighbors along tank farm road to ensure that they do not suffer damages as a result of the contamination.however,this commitment is only for actual damages not prospective damages which would be considered speculative at this time.
at trial,holdgrafer testified that crim letter persuaded him that unocal would take care of the problem without the need for a lawsuit,and that he told his attorney that if they were going to clean it up,in his opinion,that would be the most method of trying to address this problem.holdgrafer thereafter met with james at least once a month until james left san luis obispo in,and was repeatedly assured that it was unocal responsibility and they would take care of the problem james successor,bob hill,also repeatedly assured holdgrafer that it was unocal fault,they would take the blame for it,and they were working on some way to solve the problem.
settlement negotiations continued from until early.after hill left in,mike biggi,unocal of environmental affairs,was brought in to negotiate a settlement of plaintiffs claims.during that time,in accordance with holdgrafer demands,unocal assisted in refinancing when the refused to provide financing as a result of the contamination.in october,unocal purchased the million first trust deed note on the property.unocal reimbursed plaintiffs for fees incurred in seeking financing,including the increase in interest payments that plaintiffs incurred in obtaining a extension of the loan.plaintiffs have continued to make monthly payments to unocal at the lesser interest rate.
in,holdgrafer was unable to obtain a loan to buy out miller and maloney interest in the property on behalf of his son and plaintiffs garry holdgrafer ii and cindy okerson.holdgrafer notified unocal that he and his partners would file suit unless unocal would assist them in obtaining financing.holdgrafer associates thereafter obtained a loan with a term for which unocal provided a guaranty.the loan was subsequently extended for several months after unocal provided additional guarantees and paid the associated fees.at holdgrafer request,unocal assumed the loan in the same manner it had assumed the first trust deed by purchasing the second trust deed.both notes are now beyond their original terms and are subject to being called on notice.
in october of,biggi sent holdgrafer a letter asking him i f unocal were to acquire the subject loan or replace with a similar loan,would this resolve outstanding issues with unocal at trial,biggi testified that unocal goal was to settle plaintiffs claims for contamination of the property,and the intent was to try to settle that claim through helping to finance,in addition to giving him some compensation because it had gone on for so long.unocal also explored with holdgrafer the possibility of breaking the contaminated property off from the uncontaminated property and attempting to agree to pay him damages for the property.the parties came close to settling the matter in.in,unocal proposed to settle by,among other things,paying off the outstanding balance on the loan and waiving any interest charges on the million loan through.no settlement was reached,however,because holdgrafer would not agree to unocal release and indemnification terms.
settlement discussions ultimately broke down.in,holdgrafer hired an attorney to pursue litigation against unocal.plaintiffs filed their complaint against unocal on april,alleging multiple causes of action including claims for private nuisance,trespass,negligence,and unfair business practices.
the compensatory damages award 
in the first phase of trial,the jury found that unocal was equitably estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense to the lawsuit.the jury specifically found that the estoppel period began on february,date of unocal response to holdgrafer demand ended in february of.
in the second phase,the jury found that unocal contamination of plaintiffs property constituted a permanent nuisance and trespass,and that unocal was negligent.plaintiffs were awarded in damages for past economic loss,and million for the diminished value of their property.plaintiffs unfair business practices claim bus,which was to be tried by the court,was settled for an undisclosed amount.
punitive damages 
civil code section,subdivision d,provides that t he court shall,on application of any defendant,preclude the admission of evidence of that defendant profits or financial condition until after the trier of fact returns a verdict for plaintiff awarding actual damages and finds that a defendant is guilty of malice,oppression,or fraud in accordance with section.while the statute refers only to evidence of the defendant financial condition,in practice bifurcation under this section means that all evidence relating to the amount of punitive damages is to be offered in the second phase,while the determination whether the plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages,whether the defendant is guilty of malice,fraud or oppression is decided in the first phase along with compensatory damages.see,barmas,superior court th,d city of el monte superior court th,d baji.here,however,both entitlement to punitive damages and the amount to be awarded were bifurcated from the issue of liability for compensatory damages.the court granted unocal request to bifurcate in this manner after ruling that the evidence regarding other spills at the guadalupe and avila beach facilities was admissible to prove that unocal was guilty of malice,fraud or oppression in its dealing with plaintiffs.in exchange,unocal waived its right to bifurcation under subdivision b of civil code section.
unocal pretrial challenges of the guadalupe and avila beach evidence 
prior to trial,unocal moved for summary adjudication of plaintiffs punitive damages claims on the ground that plaintiffs could not produce clear and convincing evidence that unocal acted with malice,fraud or oppression in causing or responding to the contamination of plaintiffs property.in opposing the motion,plaintiffs offered,among other things,declarations and testimony from other lawsuits related to three spills that occurred on other unocal pipelines at the guadalupe and avila beach facilities in and the guadalupe and avila beach evidence.plaintiffs asserted the evidence was admissible under johnson ford motor cal th,d,to prove unocal corporate pattern and practice of leaving contamination in place,concealing known contamination,suppressing its public discovery,and intentionally delaying any meaningful investigation or remediation for as long as possible.citing evidence code section,unocal argued that the proffered evidence was inadmissible and insufficient to establish that unocal had a habit or custom of avoiding responsibility for its spills,or that unocal acted pursuant to such a habit or custom in its dealings with plaintiffs.the court denied unocal motion,based in part on the guadalupe and avila beach evidence.
subsequently,on april,the united states supreme court issued its decision in state farm,holding that a defendant dissimilar conduct can not provide the basis for an award of punitive damages.state farm,supra,at.unocal thereafter renewed its motion for summary adjudication,contending that the state farm decision precluded the court consideration of the guadalupe and avila beach evidence.the trial court denied the motion.
unocal subsequently filed motions in limine to exclude the guadalupe and avila beach evidence pursuant to state farm and section.the court tentatively ruled it would allow evidence regarding the actions by unocal with respect to reporting,maintaining,installation sic,leakage and concealment of leakage from pipelines in the central coast region,to the exclusion of guadalupe evidence and ocean dumping.the court also ruled,however,that plaintiffs shall make an offer of proof outside the presence of the jury if they intend to present any such evidence and stated that its ruling to allow the evidence shall be a tentative ruling with respect to the hearing on punitive damages parameters and any evidence code section hearings.plaintiff is directed to notify the court when they are ready to have the issue addressed based on the conclusion of all evidence on the issue of punitive damages.the court will then determine if the tentative ruling shall stand.the court order also reflected the parties stipulation that they will not address either guadalupe o r ocean dumping during their opening statements.
after section hearings held during and at the conclusion of the second phases of the trial,the court rendered its tentative ruling final,concluding that plaintiffs could present evidence regarding corrosion damage and leaks on unocal guadalupe and avila beach pipelines,unocal knowledge of those leaks and its failure to make adequate and timely repairs,and evidence that unocal concealed leaks or contamination to avoid responsibility for cleaning them up.we summarily denied unocal writ petition seeking to compel the court to exclude the evidence.
the guadalupe evidence 
around,drew bandy,a fish and game patrol warden for the san luis obispo county marine patrol,responded to a report that something resembling oil was seeping through the sand at guadalupe beach into the surf zone.when bandy spoke to bob hugenard,a supervisor at the guadalupe facility,he was told they had fingerprinted that particular product that had emitted from the beach and it did not match any of the product that they were using in the fields and,therefore,it was theirs.when bandy asked hugenard to provide data regarding the amount of seepage that had been emitted,hugenard responded,they did keep track of how much diluent they used to interject into the wells and that he believed it was of no concern as to how much diluent that they used.hugenard also told bandy there were gauges for monitoring the output,but they did not work.
john smith,a former unocal employee who worked as a field operator at the guadalupe facility,testified that around he discovered that the diluent used to facilitate the pumping of oil from the wells had increased by approximately barrels a day.smith reported this to his supervisor,bob ryan,but nothing was done to cure the situation.smith also testified that he had seen diluent surfacing on the ground at least different times.sometime around,smith was sent to the beach to clean up diluent that had surfaced on the beach near one of the wells.when smith reported to his foreman,dale hicks,that it could not be cleaned up,hicks told him,we do want anybody to know that we know that this is here.unocal employee jim shoe,the area supervisor who worked out of the orcutt office,also told smith and the other employees at the guadalupe facility that we were to be talking to anybody about the situation.smith also recounted an incident when they brought a bunch of tractors in and loaded this stuff up and took it down to a place where they turned it into road mix.smith also testified that the diluent pipelines were in a bad state of repair and that t here were some lines that had or clamps on them in a stretch of or feet.in,smith contacted state authorities about the contamination at the guadalupe facility because he had heard that unocal was going to sell their lease at guadalupe and he feared that the mess was not going to get cleaned up.
dan tucker,a former unocal employee who worked as a field operator at the guadalupe facility from approximately to,testified that he and his supervisor,mario rubio,observed diluent on the beach near one of the wells sometime in the late or early.tucker also recounted a meeting at which hugenard assured the employees that the substance had been tested and that it is anything to do with unocal that,you know,it could have been ships that have gone by that have dumped their bilges tucker also eventually reported his concerns about the incident to state authorities.
allen huckaby,a lieutenant with the california department of fish and game who has worked with the department office of spill prevention and response since,went to the guadalupe facility in to investigate reports of oil surfacing on the beach.hugenard told huckaby that the original water quality control board was on top of the situation at guadalupe and that what i was seeing was residual sand and the problem was serious.after speaking to smith,huckaby directed unocal to produce its records from the guadalupe facility.based on his review of those records,huckaby concluded that unocal had withheld information that should have been reported to authorities regarding spills,numerous spills.he further concluded that unocal had indicated they did have spills,when in fact they had,to both the california and the regional water control board.specifically,records for the period between july of and july of reflected a total of leaks during that time,although only were actually reported to the state.huckaby also calculated from the records that in alone,approximately million gallons of diluent had been lost due to leaks.unocal also produced a map of the oil field identifying numerous spills that were never reported.huckaby testified that as early as,there was a significant spill adjacent to the ocean and at that same site where we were currently having the problem with oil surfacing.according to huckaby,that spill was only discovered by the state because t here was a report of oil off of pismo on the very same day that coordinated with that particular spill.huckaby also received unocal documents disapproving appropriations for the replacement of the diluent pipes,even though one of those documents painted a picture of the dire need to replace diluent lines because of their leakage.
gonzalo garcia,the unocal employee responsible for overseeing the cleanup at the guadalupe facility,testified that unocal discontinued using diluent at the facility in february of.garcia also provided extensive testimony regarding the,ongoing project to remove all of the contamination and restore the beach and affected wetlands,at an annual cost of approximately million.in the course of that project,it has been determined that a total of approximately million gallons contaminated more than acres at the site.as of the trial,only million gallons had been recovered.in some places,the contamination is feet deep.garcia acknowledged t here no question it a major contamination site.it also one of the most incredible ecological resources in the state of california.
the avila beach evidence 
on the night of august,huckaby responded to a reported leak at the avila beach facility and was informed by unocal employee william sharrer that oil had spilled into the ocean.the next day,huckaby returned to the facility and spoke to james,who was working at that time as the facility supervisor.huckaby testified that james told him it would be impossible to accurately determine the spill volume that the meters had been bypassed subsequent to repairing the pipeline and that the best that they could do was what they estimated just to be on the surface of the water.in further investigating the incident,huckaby went to unocal santa maria refinery from which oil is sent north to the avila beach facility.huckaby testified that he interviewed an individual he believed to be the superintendent of the refinery,who told him t he oil that was transported through the pipeline was metered at the refinery and with the redundant system,it would be pumped into tanks,and the strappings on the tank would also record the amount of oil.the superintendent also told huckaby that was their normal protocol.that how they determined the volume that they received to document.huckaby also determined that the leaking pipeline remained activated under pressure for a period of time after they shut off the pump station in avila.he opined that corrosion was the single most significant factor causing the leak.
james initially told huckaby that barrels of oil had spilled,of which had reached the ocean,and that approximately of those barrels had been recovered.after conducing meter readings at the santa maria refinery,huckaby determined there was a discrepancy.based on his experience,huckaby also believed that the recovery rate james had reported was extremely high,and that r ecovery rates are closer to,percent.
william sharrer,the environmental affairs supervisor of unocal northern pipeline division from through,responded to the avila beach facility after james called him and remained there for approximately hours to oversee the cleanup operation.plaintiffs attorney asked sharrer,h ow many animals were killed as a result of unocal contamination and were there any bathers at the time of the leak that got sick sharrer responded that t here were a number of birds and some mammals that were lost,and that he was unaware of any sunbathers who were claiming illness as a result of the spill.
the punitive damages award 
at the conclusion of the third phase of trial,the jury found by clear and convincing evidence that unocal was guilty of malice,fraud or oppression on the nuisance and negligence claims,and awarded plaintiffs in punitive damages.the trial court subsequently remitted the award to million.
proceedings and judgment 
unocal moved for a new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict jnov contending,among other things,that plaintiffs claims were barred by the statute of limitations and that the guadalupe and avila beach evidence had been admitted in violation of state farm.the court rejected both of these claims.the court ruling began by stating that t his case is about greed.it is about placing financial ahead of the interest of others.the court went on to offer at least two reasons why the guadalupe and avila beach evidence was admissible first,the evidence was relevant circumstantial evidence of defendants conduct,its actions and omissions on tank farm road as applied to the plaintiffs property.in particular,that evidence established practices and policies of defendants as regards their operations on similar pipelines used for similar purposes under similar circumstances for many years,and was therefore relevant circumstantial evidence of defendants actions and omissions for the pipeline in question especially in view of the fact that the pertinent records were largely missing.second,the evidence in phase three was relevant for purposes of determining the appropriate amount of punitive damages under the reprehensibility analysis set forth in state farm.the court also rejected unocal claim that the evidence of misrepresentations,lies,and concealment involved in avila beach and guadalupe are irrelevant here.the relevancy of those acts or omissions lies in the implication that defendants acted with the same reckless indifference to the rights of property owners on tank farm road,including plaintiffs,because they thought that they could,or would,get away with it by,concealing,or lying about the contamination until the evidence was just too overwhelming.
the court did,however,conclude that the punitive damages award was excessive.the court accordingly granted a new trial on the issue of punitive damages unless plaintiffs accepted a reduction of the punitive damages to million.plaintiffs accepted the remittitur.the court also ordered interest to run on the judgment from the date of the verdict,pursuant to former rule of the california rules of court now rule.
discussion 
of limitations 
it is undisputed that the statute of limitations on plaintiffs claims for permanent trespass,permanent nuisance,and negligence was three years code civ,subd.b,that plaintiffs became aware of the contamination on their property no later than,and that they did not file their lawsuit until.the jury found,however,that unocal was equitably estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense to all of the claims.unocal contends that the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to support that finding.
a defendant will be estopped to invoke the statute of limitations where there has been some conduct by the defendant,relied on by the plaintiff,which induces the belated filing of the action.witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions.it is not necessary that the defendant acted in bad faith or intended to mislead the plaintiff.citations.it is sufficient that the defendant conduct in fact induced the plaintiff to refrain from instituting legal proceedings.citation.w hether an estoppel the acts,representations or conduct lulled a party into a sense of security preventing him from instituting proceedings before the running of the statute,and whether the party relied thereon to his a question of fact and not of law.citations.shaffer debbas th,d.
in its special verdict,the jury found that unocal,through its statements or conduct,had induced plaintiffs to believe that they need not file a lawsuit in order to receive an amicable settlement of their claims against unocal unocal intended for plaintiffs to so rely on those statements or conduct plaintiffs were ignorant of the true state of the facts and plaintiffs reasonably relied on unocal statements or conduct in postponing their lawsuit.these findings address the essential elements of the equitable estoppel doctrine.skulnick roberts express,th,d.the jury also found that plaintiffs reasonable reliance on unocal representations began on february,date of unocal response to holdgrafer demand ended in february.these findings of fact are binding if supported by substantial evidence.platt pacific,andelson cal th,d.
although unocal correctly notes that the issue is one of law subject to de novo review where only one inference may reasonably be drawn from undisputed facts platt pacific,andelson,supra,cal th at,d,we reject its assertion that only one reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence offered on the issue.unocal argument to the contrary is premised on one selective portion of its response to holdgrafer demand letter,in which unocal disagreed with holdgrafer claim that the value of his property had been diminished by the contamination.in the same letter,unocal also represented that its investigation of the matter was ongoing,that it would begin remediation of the contamination as required by the state,and that it would do whatever was necessary to ensure that the affected property owners did not suffer any damages as a result of the contamination.the jury could have inferred from these representations that unocal was rejecting the claim for damages because it was prepared to remediate the contamination.if unocal could abate the contamination,then the injury was continuing as opposed to permanent.as a result,plaintiffs would not be entitled to recover damages for the diminished value of their property.santa fe partnership arco products th,d.
contrary to unocal contention,the reasonableness of holdgrafer reliance on unocal stated commitment to remediate to the satisfaction of the state was not contingent on a belief that unocal had promised to completely eliminate the contamination.cleaning up contamination to a level acceptable to or ordered by a governmental agency may suffice to establish that a trespass or nuisance is abatable and therefore continuing.mangini cal th,d,quoting capogeannis superior court th,d we are satisfied to presume that cleanup standards set by responsible public agencies sufficiently reflect expert appraisal of the best that can be done to abate contamination in particular cases.in addition,w here a potential defendant has promised to remedy a portion of the damages suffered by the plaintiff,it would be unreasonable to expect the plaintiff to jeopardize the possibility of repair by filing a lawsuit as to items of damage not covered by the defendant promise.this is particularly true where,as here,the defendant promise relates to a substantial aspect of the dispute.certainly the effect of a contrary rule would be to foster the precipitous filing of actions and reduce the possibility of settlement without litigation,outcomes hardly in the best interests of the judicial system or the public at large.shaffer debbas,supra,th at,d.a plaintiff claiming a permanent nuisance or trespass must bring one action for past,present and future damages.shamsian atlantic richfield th,d.because unocal promised to pay any actual future damages,and plaintiffs could bring only one lawsuit for all of their damages,they acted reasonably in refraining from filing suit so long as unocal was complying with its promise.
we also reject unocal contention that the court erred in admitting evidence of communications between unocal and holdgrafer after the statute of limitations had expired.such evidence was plainly relevant to the jury determination of the duration of the estoppel.we also find no merit in the claim that evidence regarding the parties settlement negotiations was improperly admitted.settlement negotiations are relevant and admissible to prove an estoppel to assert the statute of limitations.flintkote presley of northern california d.while unocal correctly notes that these negotiations took place long after the statute of limitations had expired,they were relevant to prove that plaintiffs were justified in delaying suit as long as they did.
punitive damages 
unocal contends that the punitive damages award violates due process because it is based on dissimilar conduct regarding the spills at the guadalupe and avila beach facilities.we review this claim de novo.see cooper industries,leatherman tool group,d.as we shall explain,we agree with unocal that the guadalupe and avila beach evidence should have been excluded from trial because it involves deplorable conduct that had nothing to do with the conduct that harmed plaintiffs.through that evidence,the jury heard that unocal had concealed other spills and leaks from the public and government,and had also denied responsibility for contamination and misrepresented the magnitude of damage to the environment.this conduct is radically different from the conduct at issue in this case.unocal reported the tank farm road spill to the state and all of the affected property owners.the contamination was contained and was thereafter continuously monitored by public and private entities,including plaintiffs,to whom unocal made full and continuing disclosure.the harm involved the subterranean infiltration of oil onto plaintiffs property,for which they rightfully sought compensation to protect their investment.settlement negotiations continued for over a decade.during this period unocal not only sought to prevent a recurrence,but guaranteed loans,and otherwise assisted in protecting plaintiffs from a negative financial impact on their investment.when plaintiffs determined they were not receiving appropriate satisfaction for their loss,they sued.
in state farm,the united states supreme court identified the following constitutional restriction on evidence offered to prove punitive damages a defendant dissimilar acts,independent from the acts upon which liability was premised,may not serve as the basis for punitive damages.a defendant should be punished for the conduct that harmed the plaintiff,not for being an unsavory individual or business.due process does not permit courts,in the calculation of punitive damages,to adjudicate the merits of other parties hypothetical claims against a defendant under the guise of the reprehensibility analysis punishment on these bases creates the possibility of multiple punitive damages awards for the same conduct state farm,supra,at.evidence of such conduct is admissible only if the court ensure s the conduct in question replicates the prior transgressions,at.although evidence of other acts need not be identical to have relevance in the calculation of punitive damages,the court must exclude evidence regarding conduct that had nothing to do with the plaintiff claim,at.
this rule is mirrored in the evidence code.subdivision a of section provides that evidence of a defendant prior bad acts or bad character is generally inadmissible to prove a propensity or disposition to engage in conduct on a specified occasion while the evidence may be admissible to prove some fact other than disposition,such as intent,method of operation,or absence of mistake or accident,subd.b,and evidence of a habit or custom may be admissible to prove the defendant acted in conformity with that habit or custom,the hallmark of admissibility on any of these grounds is similitude of the prior and present conduct.people ewoldt cal th,d,people memro cal d.in the same vein,while a plaintiff can demonstrate that a defendant conduct was more blameworthy and warrants a stronger penalty to deter continued or repeated conduct of the same nature by placing that conduct into the context of a business practice or policy johnson ford motor,supra,cal th at,fn,d,similarity of the conduct is key to establishing such a practice or policy ibid.
we are mindful that state farm dealt with dissimilar evidence offered to prove the degree of the defendant reprehensibility in assessing the amount of punitive damages to be awarded.here,the challenged evidence was offered to prove not only that unocal conduct was particularly reprehensible and therefore warranted substantial punitive damages,but was also offered to establish the predicate finding that unocal was liable for punitive damages,that it was guilty of malice,fraud or oppression in its dealings with plaintiffs.but we discern no legitimate reason why the due process concerns identified in state farm do not apply with equal force when the challenged evidence is offered for both purposes.in issuing its ruling,the supreme court plainly stated that evidence of the defendant dissimilar conduct may not serve as the basis for punitive damages.state farm,supra,at.no distinction is made between evidence offered to prove entitlement to punitive damages and evidence offered to prove the amount of damages to be awarded.moreover,the elements of malice,fraud and oppression are subsumed in the factors the jury subsequently considers in assessing the degree of the defendant reprehensibility we therefore conclude that state farm proscription of dissimilar conduct to prove the amount of a punitive damages award also applies to evidence offered to prove that the defendant is guilty of malice,fraud or oppression and is therefore subject to such an award.see,kentucky farm bureau mut.ins.rodgers,recognizing same.
we also conclude that the guadalupe and avila beach evidence was too dissimilar to the evidence presented regarding unocal conduct in causing and responding to the contamination of plaintiffs property and therefore should have been excluded.the guadalupe evidence related to a spill of million gallons of diluent on over acres at a facility operated by a different division of unocal.as a result of that spill,beaches,wetlands and the wildlife that rely on them were severely damaged or destroyed.two former unocal employees testified that they were essentially told by their supervisor to keep quiet about the spill,and that their efforts to respond to the disaster went unheeded.one of those employees also testified that he had witnessed efforts to conceal contamination that was plainly visible on the surface of the beach.when the state investigated,the supervisor of the facility was less than cooperative and denied responsibility for the incident.the facility records also revealed that more than spills at the facility had not been reported to the state.
here,there was a leak from a pipeline that runs under the road named for the large oil reservoir facility where it originates.as a result of that leak,there was subsurface contamination along the perimeter of an adjacent commercial property that apparently poses no threat to the environment or the health and safety of anyone.the governing regulatory agency has apparently accepted unocal position that there is no need to excavate the contamination because it will simply dissipate through attenuation over time.contrary to plaintiffs claim that unocal concealed the contamination of their property or had a secret plan to leave it in place,the uncontroverted evidence demonstrates that for over a decade,unocal has consistently represented that it would remediate the contamination to the extent required by the rwqcb.indeed,the settlement negotiations between the parties plainly contemplated that unocal would not excavate the contamination unless ordered to do so.as plaintiffs acknowledge,total excavation would require the destruction of their buildings,a result they hoped to avoid through settlement.this is evidenced by a september letter in which holdgrafer indicated that i f we can not work out an agreement with unocal,then we will hire an attorney firm from out of town to ask the courts to have unocal clean our property of all contamination,rebuild buildings plus pay for all damages.
plaintiffs also failed to establish any nexus between unocal intentional or negligent concealment of the numerous leaks at the guadalupe facility and its purported failure to maintain adequate records of leaks that had occurred on the a and b lines.there was no evidence that unocal failed to disclose any reports it actually had regarding a and b line leaks,or that it failed to report any such leaks to the government.on the contrary,unocal written policy was to report all leaks to the necessary regulatory agencies,and it is undisputed that the leak at issue in this case was reported unocal did admit there may have been leaks at the tank farm facility that were not included in the leak reports,but there was no evidence from which it could be inferred that any of those leaks were ignored,or that unocal ever violated its duty to report those leaks to the government.
the avila beach evidence is also too dissimilar to satisfy due process.that evidence related to an incident in which the equivalent of approximately barrels of crude oil spilled into the ocean at another facility,causing serious environmental damage,including killing birds and other wildlife.when the state responded,unocal misrepresented that it could not accurately measure the spill magnitude,then provided assessments regarding the magnitude of the spill and the rate of recovery that were significantly lower than the evidence indicated.none of these facts bears any similarity to the subterranean,nonhazardous contamination of plaintiffs property,or to unocal discovery and response to it.
kentucky farm bureau mut.ins.rodgers,supra,supports these conclusions.the kentucky supreme court reversed a bad faith punitive damages award because evidence of the defendant insurers dissimilar acts were admitted to prove malice,fraud or oppression,in violation of state farm and the state rules governing the admissibility of prior bad acts evidence in reaching its conclusion,the court reasoned in part that the erroneously admitted evidence related to an insurance claim handled by a different adjuster in which the defendant was the primary insurer,while the defendant was the secondary insurer in the plaintiff case,at.
here,there was no evidence indicating that the unocal employees responsible for operating the guadalupe facilities and responding to the spill had any connection to the tank farm facility,the a and b lines,or the company response to the contamination of plaintiffs property.while tank farm facility employee ron james was involved in the response to the spill at the avila beach facility,there is no evidence showing that he,or anyone else,has ever misrepresented the extent of the contamination of plaintiffs property,its cause,or the company ability to quantify it.in any event,james responses and reports regarding the spill at the avila beach facility are insufficient to demonstrate any deliberate attempt by unocal to mislead the government or the public,subd.a providing that a corporation can be held liable for punitive damages only upon a showing by clear and convincing evidence that an officer,director,or managing agent had advance knowledge of or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are awarded.another unocal employee notified the state authorities that the spill could be measured,and then provided the information to do so.
because the guadalupe and avila beach evidence was not sufficiently similar to the evidence regarding the contamination of plaintiffs property and unocal response to it,it should not have been considered by the jury.moreover,t
