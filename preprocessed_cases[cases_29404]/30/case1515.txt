rancho viejo is a real estate development company that wishes to construct a housing development in san diego county,california.the united states fish and wildlife service determined that rancho viejo construction plan was likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the arroyo southwestern toad,which the secretary of the interior has listed as an endangered species since.rather than accept an alternative plan proposed by the service,rancho viejo filed suit challenging the application of the endangered species act,et,to its project as an unconstitutional exercise of federal authority under the commerce clause.the district court dismissed the suit.we conclude that this case is governed by our prior decision in national association of home builders babbitt,and therefore affirm.

plaintiff rancho viejo plans to build a residential development on a site in san diego county.the property is bordered on the south by keys creek,a major tributary of the san luis rey river,and is just east of interstate.fws,opinion on the rancho viejo residential development at.the company construction plan is to build homes in an upland area of approximately acres,and to use an additional acres of its upland property and portions of the keys creek streambed as a borrow area to provide fill for the project.rancho viejo wants to remove six feet or more of soil from the surface of the borrow area,amounting to approximately cubic yards of material,and to transport that soil to the housing site to the north.joint stip.surveys of keys creek have confirmed the presence of arroyo toads on and adjacent to the project site.id.
because rancho viejo plan would involve the discharge of fill into waters of the united states,including wetlands,opinion at,the company was required by section of the clean water act,to obtain a permit from the army corps of engineers the corps.see id.a.the corps determined that the project may affect the arroyo toad population in the area,and sought a formal consultation with the fws pursuant to esa.
in may,rancho viejo excavated a trench and erected a fence,each running parallel to the bank of keys creek.arroyo toads were observed on the upland side of the fence.joint stip.in the fws view,the fence has prevented and may continue to impede movement of the toads between their upland habitat and their breeding habitat in the creek.id.on may,the fws informed rancho viejo that construction of the fence has resulted in the illegal take and will result in the future illegal take of federally endangered arroyo toads in violation of the endangered species act.may,letter at joint stip.

rancho viejo neither removed the fence nor adopted the fws proposed alternative.instead,it filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of columbia against the secretary of the interior and other federal defendants,alleging that the listing of the arroyo toad as an endangered species under the esa,and the application of the esa to rancho viejo construction plans,exceeded the federal government power under the commerce clause.see const.art.i,cl.the congress shall have power t o regulate commerce among the several states.
the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.in ruling on those motions,the district court noted that this circuit had only recently sustained,against a commerce clause challenge,a determination by the fws that hospital construction in san bernardino county,california would likely lead to the take of the delhi sands fly in violation of the esa.see national ass of home builders babbitt nahb.holding that rancho viejo case was indistinguishable from nahb,and finding nothing in subsequent supreme court opinions to cast doubt on that decision,the court granted the government motion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,united seniors ass shalala,and in so doing accord the esa a presumption of constitutionality,united states morrison,d.in this part,we first discuss the nahb decision,focusing particularly on the supreme court opinion that provided that case analytic framework,united states lopez,d.we then consider the application of nahb and lopez to the complaint filed by rancho viejo.in part iii,we examine rancho viejo argument that supreme court opinions issued after this court decided nahb have deprived that decision of its precedential force.
in lopez,the supreme court considered whether a provision of the school zones act,q a,supp.v,which made it a federal offense to possess a firearm near a school,exceeded congress authority under the commerce clause.at.at.the court held that the clause authorizes congress to regulate three broad categories of activity 
first,congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce.second,congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce,or persons or things in interstate commerce,even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities.finally,congress commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce,those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.
id.at.at citations omitted.with respect to the third category,the court discussed four factors that led it to conclude that the activities regulated by the school zones act did not substantially affect interstate commerce.
first,the court said,the possession of a gun in a school zone has nothing to do with commerce or any sort of economic enterprise,however broadly one might define those terms.lopez,at.at.second,the court observed that the act has no express jurisdictional element which might limit its reach to a discrete set of firearm possessions that additionally have an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce.id.at.at.third,lopez noted that,a lthough as part of our independent evaluation of constitutionality under the commerce clause we of course consider legislative findings,and indeed even congressional committee findings,neither the statute nor its legislative history contains express congressional findings regarding the effects upon interstate commerce of gun possession in a school zone.id.internal citations,quotations,and alterations omitted.finally,the court determined that the relationship between gun possession and interstate commerce was simply too tenuous to be regarded as substantial,and that if the government arguments were accepted,the court would be hard pressed to posit any activity by an individual that congress is without power to regulate.id.at.at.
in nahb,this circuit applied lopez in a case challenging the application of the esa to a construction project in an area that contained the habitat of the delhi sands fly.at wald.the fly,an endangered species,is found in only two counties,both in california.id.one of those counties reported to the fws that it planned to construct a hospital and power plant on a site occupied by the fly,and to expand a highway intersection in connection with that work.id.at.the fws informed the county that the expansion of the intersection would likely lead to a take of the fly in violation of section of the esa.id.at.thereafter,the county filed suit against the secretary of the interior,contending that application of the esa in those circumstances exceeded the authority of the federal government under the commerce clause.
a majority of the nahb court held that the take provision of esa,and its application to the facts of that case,constituted a valid exercise of congress commerce power.at,wald,id.at henderson,concurring.the court found that application of the esa fell within the third lopez category,concluding that the regulated activity substantially affects interstate commerce.in so holding,the majority agreed upon two rationales the loss of biodiversity itself has a substantial effect on our ecosystem and likewise on interstate commerce and the department protection of the flies regulates and substantially affects commercial development activity which is plainly interstate.id.at henderson,concurring see id.at,wald.examining those two rationales within the context of lopez four factors,the nahb court concluded that application of the esa to the county proposed construction project was constitutional.id.at,wald,id.at henderson,concurring.because the second nahb rationale readily resolves this case,it is the focus of the balance of our discussion 
secretary norton argues,and the district court concluded,that application of the four lopez factors leads to the same result here as it did in nahb.we agree.
the first lopez factor is whether the regulated activity has anything to do with commerce or any sort of economic enterprise,however broadly one might define those terms.lopez,at.at accord morrison,at.at.the regulated activity at issue in nahb the construction of a hospital,power plant,and supporting infrastructure was plainly an economic enterprise.as judge henderson observed,the department protection of the flies regulates and substantially affects commercial development activity.nahb,at see id.at wald,t he case at hand involves a regulation of the conditions under which commercial activity takes place.the same is true here,where the regulated activity is the construction of a acre commercial housing development.
second,the court must consider whether the statute in question contains an express jurisdictional element.lopez,at.at accord morrison,at.at.section of the esa has no express jurisdictional hook that limits its application,for example,to takes in or affecting commerce.lopez did not indicate that such a hook is required,however,and its absence did not dissuade the nahb court from finding application of the esa constitutional nor did it dissuade the fourth circuit from finding a similar application of the esa constitutional in gibbs babbitt,cir.indeed,all of the circuits that have addressed the question since lopez as well as those that have considered the matter since morrison have concluded that the absence of an express jurisdictional element is not fatal to a statute constitutionality under the commerce clause rather,in a case like this,t he absence of such a jurisdictional element simply means that courts must determine independently whether the statute regulates activities that arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction,which viewed in the aggregate,substantially affect interstate commerce.united states moghadam,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the third lopez factor looks to whether there are express congressional findings or legislative history regarding the effects upon interstate commerce of the regulated activity.lopez,at.at.there are no such findings or history with respect to the specific rationale that we rely upon here,the effect of commercial housing construction on interstate commerce but neither findings nor legislative history is necessary as lopez acknowledged,congress normally is not required to make formal findings as to the substantial burdens that an activity has on interstate commerce.id.at.at accord morrison,at.at.rather,such evidence merely enable s the court to evaluate the legislative judgment that the activity in question substantially affected interstate commerce,even though no such substantial effect was visible to the naked eye.lopez,at.at accord morrison,at.at.as we discuss in the remainder of this section,the naked eye requires no assistance here.
the fourth lopez factor is whether the relationship between the regulated activity and interstate commerce is too attenuated to be regarded as substantial.see lopez,at.at accord morrison,at.at.although rancho viejo avers that the effect on interstate commerce of preserving endangered species is too tenuous to satisfy this test,it does not argue that the effect of commercial construction projects is similarly attenuated.because the rationale upon which we rely focuses on the activity that the federal government seeks to regulate in this case the construction of rancho viejo housing development,and because we are required to accord congressional legislation a presumption of constitutionality,morrison,at.at,plaintiff failure to demonstrate or even to argue that its project and those like it are without substantial interstate effect is fatal to its cause.
this conclusion is not diminished by the fact that the arroyo toad,like the fly,does not travel outside of california,or that rancho viejo development,like the san bernardino hospital,is located wholly within the state.see nahb,at wald,noting that the fly has an radius,limited to california alone.as judge henderson said in nahb,the regulation of commercial land development,quite apart from the characteristics or range of the specific endangered species involved,has a plain and substantial effect on interstate commerce.id.at.there,the regulation relate d to both the proposed redesigned traffic intersection and the hospital it was intended to serve,each of which ha d an obvious connection with interstate commerce.id.henderson,concurring accord id.at,wald.here,rancho viejo project,located near a major interstate highway,is likewise one that is presumably being constructed using materials and people from outside the state and which will attract construction workers and purchasers from both inside and outside the state.id.at wald,
this analysis is perfectly consistent with lopez.in that case,the court noted that it had upheld a wide variety of congressional acts regulating intrastate economic activity where we have concluded that the activity substantially affected interstate commerce.at.at.such conclusions were often based upon viewing regulations of activities that arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction in the aggregate.id.at.at to survive commerce clause review,all the government must establish is that a rational basis exist s for concluding that a regulated activity sufficiently affect s interstate commerce.id.at.at.and there can be no doubt that such a relationship exists for costly commercial developments like rancho viejo as judge henderson made clear in nahb,i nsofar as application of section a of the esa acts to regulate commercial development of the land inhabited by the endangered species,it may be reached by congress because it asserts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce.at quoting lopez,at.at quoting wickard filburn.
rancho viejo does not seriously dispute that nahb is indistinguishable from this case.rather,plaintiff argues that,as a result of subsequent supreme court decisions in united states morrison,d,and solid waste agency of northern cook county army corps of engineers swancc,d,nahb is no longer good law.appellant br.at.before considering plaintiff argument in detail,we explain why the nature of the supreme court analysis in those decisions makes it highly unlikely that they undermine our circuit precedent.
in morrison,the court considered a challenge to a section of the violence against women act,which provided a federal civil remedy for victims of violence.concluding that the case was controlled by our decision in united states lopez,the court held that congress lacked authority to enact the provision under the commerce clause.morrison,at.at.lopez,of course,is the case that controlled this court decision in nahb.accordingly,because nahb was based upon lopez,and because morrison made clear that lopez provides the proper framework for conducting the required analysis,id.at.at,it would be quite surprising if morrison undermined our decision in nahb.see norton ashcroft,cir rather than breaking new commerce clause ground,morrison derived its framework directly from lopez.
rancho viejo reliance on swancc is even further from the mark.in that case,the supreme court held,as a matter of statutory construction,that an abandoned gravel pit that provided habitat for migratory birds did not constitute navigable waters within the meaning of the clean water act,a,and hence was beyond the regulatory authority of the army corps of engineers.at.at.although the petitioner in swancc also asked the court to decide whether congress could exercise such authority under the commerce clause if it chose to do so,the court expressly declined to reach that question.id.at.at.as rancho viejo notes,the court did indicate that if it were to consider the constitutionality of such an exercise,it would have to evaluate the precise object or activity that,in the aggregate,substantially affects interstate commerce.id.at.at quoted in appellant br.at.but as we discuss below,identifying the precise activity at issue in rancho viejo case only strengthens the conclusion that the take provision of the esa can constitutionally be applied to plaintiff construction project.
plaintiff principal argument is that,although lopez made clear that the first of its four factors was whether the object of regulation was economic activity,at.at,morrison reaffirmed and elaborated upon that factor in a way that undercuts this circuit opinion in nahb.appellant br.at.we agree that morrison reaffirmed and elaborated upon the first factor,but we see nothing in morrison discussion to suggest any dissatisfaction with the way the court treated the factor in lopez,and hence nothing to undercut our prior reliance on that case.to the contrary,morrison largely proceeded by quoting and paraphrasing lopez analysis.see,at.at noting that in lopez,the court observed that q was a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with commerce or any sort of economic enterprise,however broadly one might define those terms quoting lopez,at.at.
rancho viejo contends that morrison stands for the proposition that whether the regulated activity is economic is not simply a factor in the analysis,but instead is that noneconomic activity,whatever its effect on interstate commerce,can not be regulated under the commerce clause although plaintiff acknowledges that morrison expressly declined to adopt a categorical rule against aggregating the effects of any noneconomic activity because a categorical rule was unnecessary to the outcome of that case,it argues that the court came pretty close to adopting such a rule.appellant reply br.at quoting morrison,at.at.because the arroyo toad is not itself the subject of commercial activity,id.at,rancho viejo argues that regulation of the toad fails morrison and lopez first factor.
but how close the court came to embracing plaintiff view is irrelevant to the disposition of this appeal,because the esa regulates takings,not toads morrison instructs that the proper inquiry is whether the challenge is to a regulation of activity that substantially affects interstate commerce.at.at emphasis added.similarly,swancc declares that what is required is an evaluation of the precise object or activity that,in the aggregate,substantially affects interstate commerce.at.at emphasis added.when,as directed,we turn our attention to the precise activity that is regulated in this case,there is no question but that it is economic in nature.
that regulated activity is rancho viejo planned commercial development,not the arroyo toad that it threatens.the esa does not purport to tell toads what they may or may not do.rather,section limits the taking of listed species,and its prohibitions and corresponding penalties apply to the persons who do the taking,not to the species that are taken.see a,a b making it unlawful for any person to take any such species emphasis added id.providing civil and criminal penalties for a ny person who knowingly violates the esa.in this case,the prohibited taking is accomplished by commercial construction,and the unlawful taker is rancho viejo.
nothing in the facts of morrison or lopez suggests that focusing on plaintiff construction project is inappropriate or insufficient as a basis for sustaining this application of the esa.both of those cases involved the regulation of purely noneconomic activity the statute in morrison regulated violence the one in lopez regulated gun possession.see,morrison,at.at noting that the noneconomic,criminal nature of the conduct at issue was central to our decision in lopez.although rancho viejo argues that,in fact,the lopez defendant had brought the gun to school in order to sell it,one can examine the supreme court opinion with a microscope without learning that fact.it appears only in the lower court opinion,see united states lopez,cir,and the supreme court attached no significance to it.to the contrary,morrison describes lopez as a case in which neither the actors nor their conduct ha d a commercial character,and neither the purposes nor the design of the statute ha d an evident commercial nexus.at.at quoting lopez,at.at kennedy,concurring.
here,by contrast,both the actor,a real estate company,and its conduct,the construction of a housing development,have a plainly commercial character.so too does the design of the statute the esa seeks in part to regulate economic growth and development untempered by adequate concern and conservation,which,congress found,had the consequence of rendering various species extinct.a.as judge henderson wrote in nahb it is plain,then,that the congress contemplated protecting endangered species through regulation of land and its development,which is precisely what the department has attempted to do here.such regulation,apart from the characteristics or range of the specific endangered species involved,has a plain and substantial effect on interstate commerce.at 
rancho viejo suggests that even if the regulated activity here is the taking of the toads through economic activity,that fact still does not end the matter.although the esa may regulate economic activity,plaintiff insists that the statute has a noneconomic purpose the preservation of biodiversity,and,in this case,the preservation of toads that rancho viejo maintains are without commercial value.asserting that to survive commerce clause scrutiny a statute must be aimed at economic activity and not simply regulate it for some other purpose,rancho viejo concludes that the esa at least as applied to its project must fall.this argument suffers from a number of serious defects.
first,the esa,like many statutes,has multiple purposes.whether or not economic considerations were the primary motivation for the act,there is no question that the commercial value of preserving species diversity played an important role in congress deliberations.as judge wald described in nahb,t he committee reports on the esa reveal that one of the primary reasons that congress sought to protect endangered species from takings was the importance of the continuing availability of a wide variety of species to interstate commerce.at.likewise,the fourth circuit has noted that c ommittee reports and legislative debates have emphasized the importance of endangered species to interstate commerce.gibbs,at.
thus,to use a noneconomic purpose test to overturn a statute like the esa,we would have to do so on the ground that economic concerns were not the act true or primary motivation.such an enterprise is fraught with both difficulty and danger,see michael super,d plurality opinion of rehnquist,united states,d,and the supreme court has therefore permitted inquiry into legislative purpose in only a narrow class of cases,see city of columbia omni outdoor advertising,d the enterprise is difficult because distilling the true or primary legislative purpose out of the motivations of representatives and senators is inherently problematic.and it is that difficulty that makes the project a dangerous one dangerous because the indeterminacy of outcome leaves courts open to the charge that they have manipulated the determination of purpose in order to achieve their own policy preferences,and because rejecting a stated congressional purpose as untrue reflects considerable disrespect for the pronouncements of a democratically elected branch of government.is the esa true purpose to preserve the economic potential of species whose commercial value we can not now foresee,or did congress regard species protection as a moral imperative was the occupational safety and health act enacted to spare the country the loss of productivity occasioned by workplace injury,or to protect the lives of american workers for their own sake did congress pass the clean air and clean water acts out of concern that pollution hurts the economy,or out of a fundamental concern for the health of the citizenry for courts to insist on making these kinds of determinations a prerequisite for upholding the validity of congressional legislation is a recipe for judicial intervention in the political process.
moreover,the supreme court has long held that congress may act under the commerce clause to achieve noneconomic ends through the regulation of commercial activity.the first case in this line is champion ames,in which the court upheld the constitutionality of a statute prohibiting the interstate transportation of lottery tickets,notwithstanding that congress passed the statute for the protection of public morals.we should hesitate long,the court said,before adjudging that an evil of such appalling character,carried on through interstate commerce,can not be met and crushed by the only power competent to that end.id.at.at.ten years later,citing champion,the court rejected a commerce clause attack on the mann act,which prohibited the transportation of women in interstate commerce for immoral purposes.hoke united states.the court rejected the defendant claims that the act was a subterfuge and an attempt to interfere with the police power of the states to regulate the morals of their citizens.id.at.at.t he powers reserved to the states and those conferred on the nation,the court said,are adapted to be exercised,whether independently or concurrently,to promote the general welfare,material and moral.id.at.at emphasis added.
the supreme court briefly departed from this line in hammer dagenhart,enjoining,on commerce clause grounds,the enforcement of a federal statute excluding the products of child labor from interstate commerce.over justice holmes dissent,the court held the statute unconstitutional because t he thing intended was not regulation of transportation among the states,but rather standardiz ation of the ages at which children may be employed in mining and manufacturing.id.at.at.but hammer was expressly overruled in united states darby,in which the court upheld the fair labor standards act prohibition on the shipment in interstate commerce of products produced by employees whose wages or hours did not conform to the act requirements.the motive and purpose of a regulation of interstate commerce,the court declared,are matters for the legislative judgment upon the exercise of which the constitution places no restriction and over which the courts are given no control.id.at.at.
since then,the supreme court has never held an exercise of congress commerce power unconstitutional on the ground that the legislature had a noneconomic purpose.perhaps the most important of the subsequent cases is heart of atlanta motel,united states,d,in which the court rebuffed a commerce clause attack on title ii of the civil rights act of,et.the court acknowledged that t he senate commerce committee made it quite clear that the fundamental object of title ii was to vindicate the deprivation of personal dignity that surely accompanies denials of equal access to public establishments.id.at.at internal quotation marks omitted.but the fact that congress passed the statute to attack the moral outrage of racial discrimination did not lead the supreme court to find it unconstitutional.to the contrary,citing several of the cases discussed above,the court held that the fact t hat congress was legislating against moral wrongs render s its enactments no less valid.id.at.at see id.at.at.
the position urged by rancho viejo puts the constitutionality of many of the statutes at risk.and they are hardly the only ones.congress primary object in passing product safety legislation,for example,was not to improve the productivity of industry but rather to protect the of the public much the same can be said of federal environmental legislation and plaintiff position would make federal criminal law an area of particular vulnerability.surely statutes proscribing the use or possession of explosives,of weapons of mass destruction,and of firearms by convicted felons,were not passed merely or even primarily to protect commercial property but to protect lives nor did congress bar the murder of public safety officers because it was concerned about the economic impact of their deaths or the shipment of child pornography because it thought that the market for such materials was suboptimal 
it is true that congress has tied the application of many of these statutes to jurisdictional hooks.but there are many other criminal statutes that are not so tied.see,a b a iv making it unlawful to possess with intent to distribute grams of pcp.moreover,as we have noted above,a jurisdictional element is not critical to a statute constitutionality as long as there is other evidence that interstate commerce is substantially affected.see supra part.rancho viejo offers no reason to regard a noneconomic purpose as acceptable if tied to a jurisdictional hook,but unacceptable if effectuated as it is here through the direct regulation of commercial activity 
there is nothing in morrison or lopez to put the of atlanta line of precedent in doubt.indeed,both decisions repeatedly cite darby and heart of atlanta.see,morrison,at.at,lopez,at.at.morrison did overturn a statute that was passed with a moral purpose protecting women against violent crime.but unlike the esa,the violence against women act sought to achieve its objective by regulating an activity violence that the court found was not in any sense of the phrase,economic activity.morrison,at.at.similarly,the school zones act sought to achieve its noneconomic purpose the preemption of potential gun violence near schools by regulating conduct,t he possession of a gun in a local school zone,that was in no sense an economic activity.lopez,at.at quoted in morrison,at.at.thus,neither case precludes the conclusion that it is constitutional to apply the esa to a commercial construction project like rancho viejo.and a court must hesitate before extending those two cases,neither of which involved economic regulation of any kind,to require the unraveling of a vast fabric of supreme court precedent and congressional legislation.
rancho viejo next argues that even if the taking regulated in this case is commercial in character,the esa bans other takings that are not.because the esa prohibition on takings applies as much to a hiker casual walk in the woods as to the commercial activities of a real estate company,rancho viejo contends that the statute can not constitutionally be applied to its taking of arroyo toads.appellant reply br.at.plaintiff overbreadth argument is unavailing.
in lopez,the supreme court noted that where a general regulatory statute bears a substantial relation to commerce,the de minimis character of individual instances arising under that statute is of no consequence.at.at emphasis omitted quoting maryland wirtz,d.hence,because much activity regulated by the esa does bear a substantial relation to commerce,it may well be that the hiker hypothetical proffered by the plaintiff is of no consequence to the statute constitutionality.see hodel indiana,d a complex regulatory program can survive a commerce clause challenge without a showing that every single facet of the program is independently and directly related to a valid congressional goal.it is enough that the challenged provisions are an integral part of the regulatory program and that the regulatory scheme when considered as a whole satisfies the commerce clause test.
but we need not decide that question here because there is a more basic answer to rancho viejo hiker hypothetical it is not this case.plaintiff characterizes its complaint as fundamentally an challenge to the constitutionality of the defendants regulation of the taking of arroyo toads under the esa.complaint.and as we have already discussed,the particular application before us involves the regulation of rancho viejo commercial real estate development,which falls well within the powers granted congress under the commerce clause.
at oral argument,rancho viejo asserted that it has a different kind of challenge in mind.plaintiff objection,it said,is not confined to the application of the esa to its development project,but to the listing of this particular endangered species,the arroyo toad.oral arg.tr.at.in effect,plaintiff explained,w e are facially challenging the listing of the arroyo toad.id.at.but this curious characterization is simply the plaintiff attempt to have its cake and eat it too.the company would like us to consider its challenge to the esa only as applied to the arroyo toad,which it says has no known commercial value unlike,for example,mark twain celebrated jumping frogs of calaveras county.appellant reply br.at see appellant br.at.yet it would also like us to regard that narrow challenge as a facial one,unconstrained by the fact that plaintiff is a commercial developer.
this artificially constructed facial challenge must fail.as the supreme court held in united states salerno,to mount a successful facial challenge,the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the act would be valid.the fact that the act might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid,since we have not recognized an overbreadth doctrine outside the limited context of the first amendment,d because rancho viejo own case represents a set of circumstances under which the esa may constitutionally be applied even to the lowly arroyo toad plaintiff can not shoulder the heavy burden required to prevail in a facial challenge.id.in effect,rancho viejo seeks to trade the shoes of a commercial developer for those of a weekend hiker.but permitting plaintiff to stand in the hiker shoes would mean recognizing the kind of overbreadth challenge the supreme court has expressly forsworn.
before leaving this point,we further note that the constitutional circumstances we rely on here takings by commercial developers are neither an unintended nor an insignificant portion of the activities regulated by the esa.in that statute,congress expressly found that economic growth and development untempered by adequate concern and conservation was the cause for various species of fish,wildlife,and plants in the united states hav ing been rendered extinct.nahb,at henderson,concurring quoting a.moreover,as secretary norton points out,the activities that cause the loss of endangered species and that are regulated by the take prohibition are themselves generally commercial and economic activities.appellees br.at.finally,in listing the arroyo toad as an endangered species,the fws specifically found that d evelopment projects in riparian wetlands have caused permanent losses of riparian habitats and are the most conspicuous factor in the decline of the arroyo toad.at.because congress has constitutional authority to regulate such development projects,rancho viejo complaint fails regardless of whether it is characterized as an or facial challenge.
finally,rancho viejo draws our attention to morrison declaration that t he constitution requires a distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local.at.at.plaintiff argues that the esa represents an unlawful assertion of congressional power over local land use decisions,which it describes as an area of traditional state regulation.the esa,however,does not constitute a general regulation of land use far from encroaching upon territory that has traditionally been the domain of state and local government,the esa represents a national response to a specific problem of truly national concern.
in making these points,we can do little to improve upon the fourth circuit opinion in gibbs,which upheld,as a valid exercise of federal power under the commerce clause,an fws regulation that limited the taking of red wolves.at.as chief judge wilkinson explained,regulation of the taking of endangered species does not involve an area of traditional state concern,one to which states lay claim by right of history and expertise.id.at quoting lopez,at.at,kennedy,concurring.rather,as the supreme court acknowledged in minnesota mille lacs band of chippewa indians,a lthough states have important interests in regulating wildlife and natural resources within their borders,this authority is shared with the federal government when the federal government exercises one of its enumerated constitutional powers,d.moreover,while states and localities possess broad regulatory and zoning authority over land within their jurisdictions,i t is well established that congress can regulate even private land use for environmental and wildlife conservation.gibbs,at.tracing a history of congressional involvement in natural resource conservation,chief judge wilkinson concluded that it is clear from our laws and precedent that federal regulation of endangered wildlife does not trench
