in this action,robert pound and pro products,collectively pro products challenge an order of the district court declining to impose a monetary penalty against airosol company,airosol for violations of the clean air act caa,or the act.pro products also challenges the district court order denying its request for attorney fees and costs.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to,and reverse and remand for further proceedings.
pro products sells habitat control products for exotic animals,primarily reptiles.one such product is,an insecticide used to control mites and ticks on reptiles.by early,pound,the owner of pro products,learned that certain reptile dealers and reptile product suppliers were marketing a pesticide labeled black knight for use in eradicating reptile parasites.dealers and suppliers were marketing black knight for this use despite the fact that black knight was not registered or approved for the treatment of pests affecting reptiles.
black knight,a pesticide manufactured by airosol,is registered under the federal insecticide,fungicide,and rodenticide act fifra for treatment of various household pests.black knight is an aerosol product containing hydrochlorofluorocarbons hcfcs and monochlorodifluoromethane and monochlorodifluoroethane,respectively,class ii substances as defined and regulated by b of the caa,b.as of february,airosol manufactured and sold the identical product,registered under environmental protection agency epa registration,under three different labels black knight,airosol aircraft insecticide,and government insecticide.
the amendments to the caa included provisions to phase out the use of substances such as those contained in black knight,and provided that,unless a manufacturer has applied prior to january,for an exception or exemption for reformulation as set forth by statute or regulation,e ffective january,it shall be unlawful for any person to sell or distribute,or offer for sale or distribution in interstate commerce any aerosol product or other pressurized dispenser which contains a class ii substance d a see also b,c setting forth procedure to apply for temporary extension.thus,class ii substances,such as those contained in black knight,are banned by the caa,although the distribution or sale of products containing banned substances is permitted for an additional period if a reformulation exemption is first obtained.
on december,pro products brought suit against airosol under the citizen suit provision of the caa,a.pro products sued airosol,alleging,in pertinent part,that airosol was in violation of d a of the caa.on march,the district court granted pro products motion for partial summary judgment finding,as a matter of law,that airosol manufacture,sale,and distribution of black knight violated d a of the caa following a bench trial,the district court entered an order on july,declining to penalize airosol for its caa violations.the court cited other factors,but relied heavily on its conclusion that pro products suit was brought to remove a competitor from the market and not out of a concern for the environment.the court also denied pro products renewed request for attorney fees and costs noting a circuit split,and no guidance from this court,on whether an award of attorney fees is appropriate when the prevailing party brought the suit for personal financial gain rather than to further the purpose of the clean air act.appx.at.pro products now challenges the district court decision not to penalize airosol for violating the act,and also the district court denial of its request for attorney fees and costs.
caa penalty analysis 
we will uphold a district court findings of fact in support of a caa penalty unless the findings are clearly erroneous.see pub.interest research group of new jersey,powell duffryn terminals,cir,cert.denied,d the district court weighing of those facts,and its penalty determination,are reviewed for abuse of discretion.see united states dell aquilla,cir.however,we review de novo the statutory interpretation behind the district court decision.united states b w inv,cir reviewing a clean air act citizen suit.specifically,our review of the district court legal construction of the clean air act penalty factors is plenary.united states allegheny ludlum,cir.
section a of the caa provides the district court with authority to enforce such an emission standard or limitation,or such an order and to apply any appropriate civil penalties a.section e sets forth the factors that a court shall take into consideration in determining the penalty,if any,to be assessed for a violation of the act 
in determining the amount of any penalty to be assessed under this section or section a of this title,the administrator or the court,as appropriate,shall take into consideration in addition to such other factors as justice may require the size of the business,the economic impact of the penalty on the business,the violator full compliance history and good faith efforts to comply,the duration of the violation as established by any credible evidence including evidence other than the applicable test method,payment by the violator of penalties previously assessed for the same violation,the economic benefit of noncompliance,and the seriousness of the violation.
in considering fines under the act,courts generally presume that the maximum penalty should be imposed.united states b w inv,at see also dell aquilla,at courts usually calculate a fine under the caa by starting with the maximum penalty.when starting with the maximum penalty,courts then consider the factors described in e to determine what degree of mitigation,if any,is proper.see dell aquilla,at see also united states marine shale processors,cir w hen imposing penalties under the environmental laws,courts often begin by calculating the maximum possible penalty,then reducing that penalty only if mitigating circumstances are found to exist.this is not to say that this methodology must be used,but merely that we agree with the persuasive case law that concludes that this approach is satisfactory.dell aquilla,at a lthough courts may,and frequently do,begin at the maximum,we have never suggested that such a procedure is always appropriate.other courts,for example,use a bottom up approach whereby the economic benefit a violator gained by noncompliance is established and then adjusted upward or downward,rather than a top down approach in which the maximum possible penalty is first established,then reduced following an examination of mitigating factors.see united states mun.auth.of union,cir collecting cases in a cwa case.
here,the district court calculated the maximum possible penalty under the caa,then mitigated that penalty to zero based on the following findings a penalty greater than would bankrupt airosol,pro products never established that airosol violations of the act were intentional,airosol had not been previously penalized for similar violations,airosol voluntarily ceased manufacturing and selling black knight and will no longer benefit from its violations,the epa neither cited airosol nor elected to become involved in the case,airosol violations of the caa were not a serious threat to the environment,and most importantly,pro products purpose in bringing suit was to remove a competitor rather than a genuine concern for the environment.appx.at.
pro products makes four arguments in support of its contention that the district court abused its discretion in concluding that it was not appropriate to penalize airosol for its violations of the caa.first,pro products argues that the district court relied on improper factors not listed in e.second,it argues that the district court failed to address required factors enumerated in e.third,it argues that the factors relied on by the district court do not support a complete mitigation of penalty.last,it argues the district court did not consider certain evidence supporting the imposition of a penalty.
consideration of improper factors 
pro products argues that the district court relied on three improper factors in mitigating airosol penalty to zero.we agree.specifically,the district court first implied that mitigation is proper where a private citizen rather than the epa brought suit against a defendant for its clean air act violations.appx.at.the district court also looked to pro products failure to establish at trial that airosol intentionally violated the clean air act as a mitigating factor.id.at.finally,the district court found it most important that pro products motivation to enforce the caa was economic rather than environmental.id.at.
we review de novo whether unlisted factors such as these are properly considered other factors as justice may require within the meaning of e.see powell,at see also united states allegheny ludlum,cir concluding that imposition of a penalty under the cwa is reviewed for abuse of discretion,but review of the construction of cwa penalty provision is plenary.in powell,a citizen suit under the cwa,the district court granted summary judgment finding that the defendant manufacturer violated the cwa.powell,at.following a bench trial on the issue of penalties,the district court assessed in civil penalties.id.in calculating the penalty,the district court determined the maximum penalty to be and reduced that amount by because the epa and the new jersey department of environmental protection had failed to diligently prosecute the violator.id.at.the third circuit court of appeals reversed in part,finding that the mere failure by governmental agencies to prosecute an alleged violation does not allow a court to reduce a penalty.id.at.the court held that such failure by itself is not a factor that may be considered within the other matters as justice may require factor set forth in the cwa penalty statute.id.the powell court also found that because the epa had not affirmatively recognized and excused noncompliance,governmental inaction was not a basis for mitigation based on the violator good faith.id.
when calculating the appropriateness of a civil penalty,the caa,like the cwa,requires a district court to consider certain listed factors,but also permits a district court to consider other unlisted factors as justice may require.compare d considering other matters as justice may require,with e considering other factors as justice may require.both the cwa and the caa provide that a citizen suit can only be brought if there is a lack of prosecution by the state,or relevant agency.compare b b no action may be commenced if the administrator or state has commenced and is diligently prosecuting a civil or criminal action,with b b no action may be commenced if the administrator or state has commenced and is diligently prosecuting a civil action to require compliance.thus,the mere failure by governmental agencies to prosecute a violation does not allow a court to reduce a penalty.powell,at.here,the epa was aware of the instant litigation,but had not cited airosol or elected to intervene in this litigation.appx.at.we agree with the third circuit approach in powell and conclude that the district court erred in relying on agency inaction as a mitigating factor when conducting its caa penalty analysis.
second,the fact that pro products did not establish at trial that airosol intentionally violated the clean air act is also an impermissible basis for a complete mitigation of airosol penalty.appx.at.the act imposes strict liability upon owners and operators who violate the act.see dell aquilla,at b w inv,at.this is not to say that intent can not be considered when assessing a caa penalty,but here,as regards the district court placing a burden on pro products to establish that airosol intentionally violated the caa,it erred.also,we are mindful that the district court found that from october,to april,airosol sold cans of black knight and cylinders of black knight all containing substances banned by the caa,and that airosol pursued this course of conduct by relying on a letter it alleges it sent to the epa,but was never received.thus,insofar as airosol intentions are relevant here,there is insufficient evidence in the record to completely mitigate the imposition of a penalty on these grounds alone 
third,the district court expressly determined that the most important factor in its decision to mitigate airosol penalty was the motivation of the citizen plaintiffs who brought suit against airosol for its caa violations.we conclude this factor is irrelevant to a determination of the amount of penalty to be imposed under the caa.first,we have found no authority for the district court conclusion that a plaintiff motivation is a significant factor when determining what penalty should be imposed against a caa violator.moreover,congress enacted the caa citizen suit provision specifically to encourage citizen participation in the enforcement of standards and regulations established under this act.pennsylvania.valley citizens council for clean air,d citations omitted.congress intended the section to afford citizens very broad opportunities to participate in the effort to prevent and abate air pollution.id.citations omitted.thus,the fact that a plaintiff may have an economic interest in the outcome of the litigation does not justify mitigation of penalties against the violator.to the contrary,one of the purposes of these penalty provisions is to ensure that companies like airosol do not gain a competitive advantage from violating the caa.powell,at violators should not be able to obtain an economic benefit their competitors due to their with environmental laws.citations omitted.in short,there is no principled basis for relying on pro products motivation for bringing the suit,or the fact that the parties are competitors,to determine airosol penalty.thus,the district court reliance on these factors was error.
failure to address certain statutorily enumerated penalty factors 
we conclude further that the district court also erred as a matter of law by failing to address certain statutory factors that must be considered in a caa penalty analysis.although the caa does not prescribe what weight to apply to these factors,e of the act clearly requires that the district court consider the size of the business and the economic impact of the penalty on the business the seriousness of the violation the violator full compliance history good faith efforts to comply the duration of the violation as established by any credible evidence payment by the violator of penalties previously assessed for the same violation the economic benefit of noncompliance and the seriousness of the violations.
here,the district court did not consider the size of airosol business,airosol full compliance history,good faith efforts to comply,or the duration of the violation.because the failure to consider the enumerated factors in e is reversible error,we remand for the district court to include in its penalty analysis these additional factors.see,dell aquilla,at reversing penalty award for failure to consider evidence in violation of caa mandate to consider economic impact of the penalty.
specifically,in its order where it declined to penalize airosol for its caa violations,the district court made a factual finding that d ue to its financial troubles,airosol has decreased its workforce from approximately ninety employees to approximately thirty employees.appx.at.nonetheless,in the legal analysis that follows,the district court neither explicitly nor implicitly considered this factor.
the district court also failed to consider airosol full compliance history and good faith efforts to comply with the caa.e.the district court findings make clear that prior to suit airosol had never been in compliance with the amendments banning class ii substances,and airosol was aware of the class ii ban,but failed to properly file an application for reformulation,or to meaningfully inquire about the application it allegedly sent,or to otherwise comply with the act.also,airosol sold black knight for months after the district court determined that its sale of black knight violated the act.appx.at airosol admitted to offering black knight for sale until august,but on this date the sale of black knight was illegal pursuant to this court march,order.the district court failed to consider any of this evidence.
finally,in its order declining to penalize airosol for its caa violations,the district court made a series of factual findings indicating that airosol violations lasted more than a decade,from january,through march.airosol argues that since the district court found that airosol violation of the act extended over a period of days when considering a period from october,through march,this finding was somehow meaningfully considered by the district court in its penalty analysis.yet,the district court never discussed the duration of the violation as a factor in its penalty analysis,nor did it incorporate by reference its factual findings regarding duration of the violation into its legal analysis.on remand the district court should include in its penalty analysis consideration of these three factors,as well as the related evidence referenced above.
improper consideration of statutorily enumerated factors 
pro products next argues that to the extent the district court considered certain statutory factors set forth in e,it erred as a matter of law in doing so.we agree.the limited analysis conducted by the district court regarding the economic benefit factor of e resulted in its conclusion that airosol will not continue to benefit from its violations,as it has voluntarily ceased manufacturing and selling black knight.appx.at emphasis added.this conclusion is a misapplication of e because it requires a court to consider the economic benefit that the violator has received as a result of its violations of the caa,not the economic benefit it will receive in the future.the district court interpretation of the statute would permit any violator of the caa to mitigate a potential penalty simply by ceasing to pollute.we reject this interpretation of the act.
also,the district court conclusion which negates the seriousness of airosol violations as a basis for mitigation is not supported by any findings of fact.instead,the district court stated that it does not believe that airosol clean air act violations were a serious threat to the environment or the public because the parties did not offer,and the court is not aware of,a single measurable injury to the environment or the public caused by airosol manufacture and sale of black knight.id.while there is no statutory definition of seriousness of the violation,the effects of ozone pollution are well documented the issue then is whether a lack of evidence on the record linking airosol caa violations to discrete damage to either the environment or the public necessarily justifies the conclusion that airosol violations were not serious.we conclude it does not.
in powell,the third circuit upheld the district court finding that the defendant violations of the cwa were serious,even absent a showing which directly linked defendant discharges to actual harm to the environment or the public.see powell,at.in other words,powell held that a court may still impose a penalty if it finds there is a risk or potential risk of environmental harm,even absent proof of actual deleterious effect.considering the difficulty of measuring these types of harm,we find the logic of powell persuasive.we therefore conclude that the mere absence of a measurable harm to the public or the environment stemming from a particular caa violation does not necessarily indicate that a violation is not serious.particularly important here is the fact that congress had explicitly banned the substances contained in airosol noncompliant product,black knight.
the statutory economic benefit factor requires the district court to apply a retrospective rather than a prospective analysis,but the court has discretion in deciding how to calculate the economic benefits received from the defendant due to its noncompliance with the caa.the parties also disagree about how to measure the economic benefit of noncompliance factor set forth in e.pro products argues that any profits realized through the sale,or offer of sale,of a prohibited product ought to be included when assessing the economic benefit of a caa violation,the rationale being that one ought not to profit from one wrongful conduct airosol,on the other hand,argues that the economic benefit of noncompliance is more properly measured by considering the costs that it would have incurred to comply with the caa,the cost of reformulation.while the question is not easily resolved,we conclude that pro products has the better argument.
while the economic benefits calculation ideally begins with the costs that should have been spent,to achieve compliance,ludlum,at calculating economic benefit to polluter by the least costly method of compliance,precise economic benefit to a polluter may be difficult to prove,powell,at.given this reality,we acknowledge that there are methods other than the delayed or avoided capital expenditure for ascertaining economic benefit,municipal authority of union township,at analyzing economic benefit penalty provision set forth in cwa in terms of profits gained,rather than expenses avoided,from noncompliance due to unique circumstances,and we will accord the district court wide discretion in its calculation,see id.at.thus,if,on remand,the district court is unable to determine the costs airosol would have expended in order to become compliant with the caa,then it is free to consider any reasonable alternative to determine airosol economic benefit of as,the epa caa stationary source civil penalty policy some degree of profits long as its analysis is not in conflict with the caa or basic economic principles.
last,airosol claims that the record does not establish what costs it would have incurred to reformulate black knight and implies that,as a result,it should not be penalized for its violations of the caa.as noted above,however,because airosol cost of reformulation is not the only possible measure of its economic benefit of noncompliance,whether a penalty will be imposed in this case will not rise or fall on a cost of reformulation calculation.and,even if we assume,arguendo,that there is no reasonable means to measure airosol economic benefit of noncompliance,it follows that there would be insufficient evidence to mitigate the imposition of a penalty on this basis,and not,as airosol suggests,that it should not be penalized at all.see b w inv,at concluding that courts generally presume that the maximum penalty should be imposed,then mitigate the penalty in accord with the e factors.
attorney fee analysis 
pro products also challenges the district court denial of its motion for attorney fees and costs.we review a district court decision on whether to award attorney fees for abuse of discretion,but we review de novo the district court application of the legal principles underlying that decision.ass of prof l baseball leagues,very minor leagues,cir.for the following reasons,we conclude the district court erred.
some degree of success on the merits 
under the american rule,parties to a lawsuit ordinarily pay their own attorney fees.alyeska pipeline serv.wilderness soc y,d.there are several exceptions to this principle.most notably,there are certain statutory provisions that permit a court to order one party to pay the fees and costs of another.bennett coors brewing,cir.typically,these statutes allow courts to award fees to the prevailing party.see,civil rights attorney fees awards act,t he court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.less commonly,the caa,and other federal statutes,allow courts to award costs of litigation including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees to any party,whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.d see also loggerhead turtle v.the county council of volusia county,cir collecting statutes.
while this court has not had occasion to address when an award is appropriate under the caa,the supreme court has held that absent some degree of success on the merits by the claimant,it is not appropriate for a federal court to award attorneys fees ruckelshaus sierra club,d id.at.we conclude that the language of the section,read in the light of the historic principles of in this and other countrie
