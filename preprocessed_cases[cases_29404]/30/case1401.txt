the state of north carolina petitions for review of the final rule of the environmental protection agency removing the northern part of the state of georgia from epa regulations under its national ambient air quality standard naaqs for ozone measured during a period.see petition for reconsideration and withdrawal of findings of significant contribution and rulemaking for georgia for purposes of reducing ozone interstate transport,withdrawal rule.in epa called upon several states to revise their state implementation plans sips for attaining the naaqs for ozone by reducing emissions of oxides of nitrogen nox,a precursor of ozone.see finding of significant contribution and rulemaking for certain states in the ozone transport assessment group region for the purposes of reducing regional transport of ozone,nox sip call.following the remand in michigan epa,cert.denied,d,epa promulgated a rule that included only the northern portion of georgia in the nox sip call under the ozone standard.see interstate ozone transport response to court decisions on the nox sip call,nox sip call technical amendments,and section rules,remand rule.georgia inclusion was based on epa findings in the nox sip call that emissions from georgia were significantly contributing to of the ozone naaqs in birmingham,alabama and memphis,tennessee.see withdrawal rule.at.
upon the petition of an industry coalition,an intervenor here,epa reconsidered its inclusion of georgia in light of its determinations that recently birmingham,and earlier memphis,had attained the ozone standard.see id.north carolina now challenges the withdrawal rule as contrary to epa policy requiring states adherence to nox emissions budgets based on the ozone standard after the repeal of the standard,as nonconformance with the mandate in michigan epa,and as disparate treatment of georgia without lawful justification.we do not reach the merits of these contentions because we conclude that north carolina lacks standing,specifically that north carolina failed to show redressability.
nitrogen oxides nox emitted into the air react to form ozone,a pollutant with harmful health and environmental effects.ozone is an interstate issue because nox emissions and ozone cross into downwind states.see nox sip call.at.in,epa established the naaqs for ozone at ppm parts per million measured over a period the standard.michigan epa,at.in,epa lowered the ozone naaqs to ppm measured over an period the standard,but this standard was stayed in and was not before the court in michigan epa,id.at.in,epa transitioned from the standard to the standard in,epa lowered the ozone naaqs to ppm.
meanwhile,in,epa called for revisions to the sips of several upwind states the nox sip call.epa found that nox emissions in georgia significantly contributed to nonattainment of the ozone standard in birmingham and memphis,and to nonattainment of the ozone standard in north carolina.epa stay of the standard remove d the findings as a basis for the sip call.michigan epa,at.
on petition for review of the nox sip call,the court held in michigan epa that the record does not support creating nox emissions budgets based on the entire emissions of missouri or georgia,because only the fine grid modeling used for northern georgia and eastern missouri,and not the coarse grid modeling used for other parts of those states,showed emissions contributing to downwind pollution.michigan epa,at.on remand,epa revised the nox sip call by calculating nox emissions budgets based only on areas of georgia and missouri whose emissions had been modeled for the nox sip call with the technique.see remand rule.at.the remand rule was published april,with an effective date of june.however,epa had found,effective april,that birmingham and earlier,memphis had attained the ozone standard.in response to a petition from intervenor georgia coalition for sound environmental policy a group of businesses and companies,hereinafter industry,epa stayed the remand rule with respect to georgia during the notice and comment proceedings for industry petition to reconsider georgia inclusion in the nox sip call,in light of epa birmingham and memphis findings.in,epa finalized the withdrawal rule,removing georgia from the nox sip call.
in petitioning for review,north carolina claims that nox emissions from electric generating units egus in northern georgia are significantly contributing to north carolina inability to attain the naaqs under the standard due to georgia in the nox sip call,and that north carolina injury can be remedied by vacating the withdrawal rule in part.specifically,north carolina seeks partial vacatur of the withdrawal rule,reinstatement of the prior regulations and removal of the stay of the regulations with respect to georgia under subparagraph s of section,and instructions on georgia deadline for submitting a compliant sip.on the merits,north carolina challenges the withdrawal rule on three grounds epa noncompliance with a policy requiring states to adhere to emission budgets set under the standard after that standard was abolished epa noncompliance with the mandate in michigan epa,specifically by relying on new data in promulgating the withdrawal rule and epa disparate treatment of georgia as compared to missouri and other states in the original nox sip call.industry,however,challenges north carolina standing under article iii of the united states constitution,maintaining that epa correctly stated during the rulemaking that georgia may already be meeting the requirements of the nox sip call,see withdrawal rule.at,and that consequently north carolina can not show redressability.we turn to that threshold question.
in lujan defenders of wildlife,d,the supreme court described the article iii injury,causation,and redressability requirements for standing 
first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained injury has to be fairly trace able to the challenged action of the defendant,and not th e result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.third,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
id.at.alterations in lujan citations and footnote omitted.when the suit is one challenging the legality of government action or inaction,and a plaintiff asserted injury arises from the government allegedly unlawful regulation or lack of regulation of someone else and the plaintiff is not himself the object of the government action or inaction he challenges,then standing is not precluded,but it is ordinarily substantially more difficult to establish.id.at.emphasis and quotation marks omitted.
north carolina situation is similar in many respects to that of massachusetts in massachusetts epa,d.there the supreme court held that massachusetts had standing to challenge epa failure to regulate certain air pollutants,because massachusetts has interests in reducing air pollution and a procedural right to challenge epa under b.massachusetts epa,at.like massachusetts,north carolina is a state challenging epa rule pursuant to b in order to reduce its air pollution,which entitles north carolina to special solicitude in our standing analysis.massachusetts epa,at.in addition,w hen a litigant is vested with a procedural right,that litigant has standing if there is some possibility that the requested relief will prompt the party to reconsider the decision that allegedly harmed the litigant.id.at.
north carolina contends that because epa has recognized ozone as a harmful pollutant injury,and because epa recognized in that ozone from georgia contributed to north carolina of the ozone standard causation,and because northern georgia in the nox sip call would likely reduce georgia emissions redressability,it has established standing.nonetheless north carolina acknowledged during oral argument that notwithstanding any special solicitude to which it may be entitled as a sovereign state,it must demons
