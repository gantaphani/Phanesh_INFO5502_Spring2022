plaintiffs terri crandall and joann hubbard sued for injunctive relief against the city and county of denver under the provision of the resource conservation and recovery act of rcra,
a b.their concern is that aircraft deicing fluid adf,which can produce gas when it decomposes,endangers human health at concourse b of the denver international airport.the gates on concourse b are used almost exclusively by united airlines.crandall is a united employee,and hubbard is a former employee who now frequently uses concourse b as a passenger.plaintiffs seek to prohibit deicing at concourse b gates and to require other precautionary steps relating to adf.
following a bench trial,the united states district court for the district of colorado denied plaintiffs relief.it found that denver no longer permits deicing at the gates and held that plaintiffs had not shown that the current use of adf may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health,which is a prerequisite for rcra relief.a b the court also held that rcra does not govern all the adf by concourse b at the denver airport,but only the adf that flows in storm water into c oncourse b and degrades in concourse crandall city and county of denver,colorado,at in,vol.beginning at bench ruling.the adf that degrades outside the concourse,it said,was governed exclusively by permits issued under the clean water act cwa.
on appeal plaintiffs argue that the district court misconstrued rcra requirements with respect to injunctive relief.they also contend that the court erred in holding that the cwa,rather than rcra,governs some of the adf at the denver airport.we affirm the district court denial of injunctive relief.plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that adf at the airport whether it degrades inside or outside concourse b may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health.because relief under rcra would therefore not be available even if rcra governs the adf that degrades outside the concourse,we need not address whether such adf is governed exclusively by the cwa.
background 
rcra is a comprehensive statute designed to reduce or eliminate the generation of hazardous waste and to minimize the present and future threat to human health and the environment created by hazardous waste.b see id.a.to achieve this goal,the statute empowers epa to regulate hazardous wastes from cradle to grave,in accordance with rcra rigorous safeguards and waste management procedures.city of chicago envtl.def.fund.it also grants private citizens standing to enforce some of the statute provisions.see meghrig kfc western,inc.the rcra provision invoked by plaintiffs states 
a ny person may commence a civil action on his own behalf 
b against any person,including any past or present generator,past or present transporter,or past or present owner or operator of a treatment,storage,or disposal facility,who has contributed or who is contributing to the past or present handling,storage,treatment,transportation,or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste which may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.

adf and the denver airport 
plaintiffs do not challenge the district court rendition of the historical facts.we begin by discussing some pertinent science and then summarize the history of adf use at the denver airport and the problems that have and have not arisen.
the risks of adf 
adf is mostly propylene glycol.when propylene glycol degrades in an anaerobic environment where sulfur is present,gas can be produced.hydrogen sulfide has a characteristically offensive odor,which often accompanies sewage or rotten eggs.it can be smelled at very low concentrations in the air.some people can detect it at one part per billion,and almost all recognize it at parts per billion.much higher levels,however,are required before it has recognized health effects.eye irritation has been noted at between and parts per billion m arked eye and lung irritation occurs at parts per million and b reathing impairment and unconsciousness results at parts per million.bench ruling at.
conditions through early 
after adf is used to deice an airplane,gas can enter concourse b by two means.the adf may degrade outside the concourse and the resultant gas then infiltrates the concourse.or the adf may mix with storm water and flow down through cracks in the tarmac.because the concourse basement extends under the tarmac,this mixture can leak into the basement where the adf degrades,producing hydrogen sulfide.
until practices at the denver airport changed in,some planes could be fully deiced with adf while at their gates.beginning in,employees of united airlines and others who worked at concourse b filed a number of complaints about the smell and about health effects that are symptoms of exposure to hydrogen sulfide.some complaints linked the smell to degrading adf.maintenance logs and reports also indicated the presence of hydrogen sulfide in the basement,and one or two reports attributed the gas to adf.a study made numerous recommendations to control the runoff of adf into the denver airport system.
perhaps the most significant episode occurred in,when many people complained of a foul odor and burning eyes in the red carpet club in concourse air testing detected concentrations of hydrogen sulfide above one part per million.the health department found that the gas flowed from the basement level up to the red carpet club through the elevator shafts.a report by urs corporation,a consultant retained by denver,concluded that the hydrogen sulfide came from degrading adf.as a result,the elevator shafts next to the club were sealed and measures were taken to prevent adf from leaking into the basement of concourse denver began a program which was still in effect at the time of trial to seal cracks in the tarmac around the concourse,thus preventing adf from entering the ground.
despite these measures,in september maintenance logs reported toxic levels of hydrogen sulfide in a mechanical room in the basement of concourse b and stated that employees were advised not to enter the room without proper safety equipment.beginning about that time the record does not provide a precise date,denver limited the amount of deicing that could be conducted at the gates.planes were directed to deicing pads away from the gates and the concourse basement.gate deicing was restricted to a few portions of the plane in certain circumstances.the district court found the evidence insufficient to determine denver motives for moving deicing from the it was a response to this lawsuit or more a matter of efficiency and economics.in addition,in denver installed ventilation fans in two of the twelve basement sump rooms and,as of trial,it anticipated installing fans in the remaining sump rooms.
conditions after early 
even after deicing at the gates ceased at the denver airport,there were some reports of the odor of hydrogen sulfide in the basement of concourse b.but the complaints were much fewer and not supported by objective evidence.the center for toxicology and environmental health,an independent engineering firm,conducted five tests between november and march at many sites in the concourse,but no hydrogen sulfide was detected.the district court concluded that currently the evidence does not establish levels of either propylene glycol or hydrogen sulfide that are dangerous to human health in the basement of concourse id.at.
a united airlines official testified in april that united had no intent to request gate deicing after this litigation ends.he said that there had been discussions two years earlier about testing the use of vehicles at the gates,apparently to determine whether they could reduce the flow of adf into the environment after deicing.but united then decided not to spend the money necessary to acquire the vehicles.an airport official testified that denver had no plans to allow united to return to deicing at the gates.he explained that the airport had added deicing pads and that gate deicing could create traffic congestion as inbound aircraft waited for gates where deicing was taking place.he also said that gate deicing would require new infrastructure to collect overspray and runoff.
proceedings 
plaintiffs filed their rcra suit on february.they sought orders requiring denver to take various steps to protect people from hydrogen sulfide produced by degradation of adf,including a prohibition on deicing at concourse b gates.
after a bench trial in april,the district court entered judgment for denver,ruling that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that adf may present an imminent and substantial endangerment at concourse b.the court found that the evidence at trial was insufficient to establish that under current conditions at concourse b the amounts of adf were significant or that hydrogen sulfide was present at levels dangerous to human health.the court also determined that the evidence was too speculative to show a significant risk that denver would resume deicing at the gates.although there was some evidence that plaintiffs lawsuit contributed to ending gate deicing,the court noted that the decision was likely influenced by the following economic factors 
the construction of new deicing pads away from concourse b,greater capability in using the pads to deice,the impact of pad deicing on the speed and number of planes to be serviced,and a requirement of precedent testing,presumably environmental testing,as to the effect of deicing fluid,which united has been unwilling to perform.
in addition,the district court said that plaintiffs had not shown that resuming deicing at the gates would pose a health risk.denver was continuing a program to seal the tarmac around concourse b,had installed fans in two of the twelve mechanical rooms in the basement in,and had said that it planned to install fans in the remaining mechanical rooms in the concourse.the court noted that it was without evidence to balance the effect of future deicing against the effect of future fans.id 
ii.discussion 
a party requesting a permanent injunction bears the burden of showing actual success on the merits irreparable harm unless the injunction is issued the threatened injury outweighs the harm that the injunction may cause the opposing party and the injunction,if issued,will not adversely affect the public interest.fisher.health care,cir.w e review the district court grant or denial of a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion,sec pros int l,cir,reviewing underlying questions of law de novo,see att y of tyson foods,cir.the dispositive issue in this case is whether plaintiffs have established the merits of their claim,the first requirement for a permanent injunction.see prairie band potawatomi nation wagnon,cir.
to prevail under rcra provision,a plaintiff must prove that a solid waste may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.a b.plaintiffs contend that they proved their claims but that the district court erred in its interpretation of the meaning of imminent and substantial.aplt.br.at.although they do not dispute that the cessation of full aircraft gate deicing resulted in at least a partial abatement of the conditions giving rise to the risk of harm associated with the degradation of adf,reply br.at,they argue that the possibility of resumption of such deicing presents an imminent and substantial endangerment.they maintain that denver halted deicing at the gates because of this lawsuit,and they suggest that the practice likely will resume after the lawsuit if no injunction is issued.according to plaintiffs,the district court also erred in assuming that denver would install fans in the ten mechanical rooms.in plaintiffs view,the court should have ensured rather than assumed that denver would not return to deicing at the gates and that it would install the remaining fans 
we are not persuaded.our review of governing precedent persuades us that the facts here do not show that the adf at the denver airport may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health.a b.the leading case on the subject is the supreme court decision in meghrig.the issue in meghrig was whether a b provides a remedy to recover for past cleanup costs.see at.after kfc western,paid to clean up petroleum contamination on property previously owned by alan and margaret meghrig,it sought restitution from the meghrigs.see id.the court held that rcra provision does not provide a remedy for past contamination that no longer poses a danger.see id.at.it reasoned that a n endangerment can only be imminent if it threatens to occur immediately.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the language may present,it explained,implies that there must be a threat which is present now,although the impact of the threat may not be felt until later.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
we followed meghrig in burlington northern.burlington northern alleged that the defendant construction on his property had caused material tlm to migrate onto burlington northern property.see at.burlington northern removed the tlm from its property and constructed a berm on the property line to prevent future migration.see id.the district court granted summary judgment against burlington northern,ruling that it had failed to present a genuine issue of material fact on the imminent and substantial endangerment element of its rcra claim.id.quoting a b.the court concluded that 
imminency had not been established because burlington northern failed to point to any person who had been injured by tlm or to any study establishing the material threatened to immediately cause harm to a person or the environment,neither the oklahoma department of environmental quality or the environmental protection agency had ever ordered the tlm removed,and burlington northern monitored the alleged migration of the tlm onto its property for years without acting.
we disagreed with the district court analysis,stating that it was irrelevant when the tlm was deposited on the property and equally irrelevant how long burlington northern monitored the tlm before acting.id.we also stated that the focus should have been on the risk that harm would occur in the future,not on whether harm had occurred or was imminent.see id.we explained the meanings of the statutory terms a finding of imminency,we said,does not require a showing that actual harm will occur immediately as long as the risk of threatened harm is present.id.at.and we stated that the term endangerment mean s a threatened or potential harm,and that an endangerment is substantial when there is reasonable cause for concern that someone or something may be exposed to risk of harm by release,or threatened release,of hazardous substances in the event remedial action is not taken,id.at.thus,the statutory requirement could be satisfied even if the actual harm might not be likely to occur for a long time,so long as the defendant current or past actions create a present risk that the harm will eventually come to pass.see id.at.we emphasized that the operative word in a b is may a plaintiff need show only that the waste may present a threat of serious potential harm.id.at.noting the evidence in the record that tlm contained carcinogens at levels exceeding epa recommendations and that it threatened runoff and other waters,we reversed and remanded for further proceedings.see id.at.
most recently,in tyson foods we considered the same statutory language in reviewing whether the oklahoma attorney general was entitled to a preliminary injunction against tyson use of poultry litter which includes poultry bedding materials and feces as fertilizer in the illinois river watershed irw.see at.the state contended that bacteria in the poultry litter was contaminating the watershed.id.at.tyson responded that the bacteria in the irw came from other sources and that the processing of poultry litter kills the bacteria before the litter is spread on land.id.we agreed with the state that under rcra a plaintiff need not show proof of actual harm to health or the environment to establish endangerment,but rather injunctive relief is appropriate where there simply may be a risk of harm.id.at quoting burlington northern,at.nevertheless,we concluded that oklaho
