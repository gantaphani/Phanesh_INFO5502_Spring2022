this case involves an attempt to seek contribution for environmental costs from the parent corporations of previous owners of a facility.there is an additional attempt to prove coverage under three insurance policies.
facts and procedural background 
the city of augustine discovered the environmental contamination at issue when it,the current owner,sought to redevelop the site into a mixed use and marina complex.the epa identified atlanta gas light company aglc and the city as responsible parties under cercla.et.both parties negotiated with the epa and entered into orders to investigate and then to clean up the site.aglc now brings this suit seeking contribution from the defendants.
aglc was the most recent previous owner of the augustine manufactured gas plant mgp that was formerly located on the site.this mgp began operation in,using a new technology that involved superheating raw materials,such as coal,oil or pine knots,to produce a combustible gas.during this process,the mgp produced several,such as coal tar,which in recent times have been recognized as containing toxic materials.aglc argues that these were released into the ground throughout the operating history of the plant.when the mgp was shut down,the structures were simply buried and the property was converted to other uses.
the augustine gas and electric light company augustine gas was incorporated in.aglc argues that defendant ugi utilities directed operations from then until.ugi was a minority shareholder in augustine gas during this period,but nominated most of the local superintendents for the mgp and provided services to augustine gas,its subsidiary as described more fully below.senior ugi executives occupied several board and officer slots for augustine gas.
in,defendant centerpoint energy resources corporation acquired the stock of augustine gas.it replaced all of the board of directors with senior centerpoint executives.two years later,it entered into management and engineering contracts with augustine gas discussed more fully below.in,centerpoint assigned its contracts to a newly formed,mutual management corporation owned by centerpoint subsidiaries.centerpoint continued to indirectly own of augustine gas stock but because the management clearly was out of centerpoint hands,aglc does not contend that centerpoint is responsible after.
from to,defendant century indemnity company provided three liability insurance policies to augustine gas.the insurance policies covered accidents,and aglc contends that there were daily leaks and spills that would constitute accidents.
after aglc entered into the settlement with the epa,it sent demand letters to ugi and centerpoint,the alleged former operators of the site.both refused to participate in either the investigation or.after most of the was completed,aglc sued ugi,centerpoint and century insurance under cercla,seeking contribution.the defendants moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted.
the district court reasoned that aglc sought to impose liability on the utility defendants only on the basis of their operation of the facility not on the basis of ownership,but had not put forth enough evidence for a jury conclude that either ugi or centerpoint had operated the plant.after an examination of the record evidence,the district court determined that neither of the utility defendants relationships with the plant fell within the test outlined by the supreme court in united states bestfoods,d.turning to the claims against century,the court first held that century was not liable under the first two insurance policies because they were issued to aglc predecessor and because they contained clauses which blocked coverage for aglc.the third policy,however,covered a later period and aglc acquired ownership of this policy via a statutory merger.order at.that policy covered the period from february,to february.the court held that even assuming a leak could be an accident,aglc did not adduce enough evidence to establish a question of material fact that a leak occurred during that period.id.at.aglc expert had testified that leaks likely occurred during the operation of the plant ugi expert characterized aglc expert method as far too speculative and as having no firm grounding in science.id.the court agreed,holding that to find that leaks occurred during that particular year would require naked guesses.id.at.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
before we address the merits of this case,we must address ugi argument that we lack jurisdiction over this case under cercla.ugi cites cooper industries aviall services,d,where the court held that companies could not bring actions for contribution under f unless they had been sued under or themselves.however,as the second circuit in a case noted,it was possible for a party that settled to bring an action under f b if the settlement covered cercla claims.consolidated edison of ugi,cir.see also cooper,at.at indicating in dicta that f b provides an avenue for contribution after an administrative or judicially approved settlement that resolves liability to the united states or a state.here,aglc settled and the settlement covered cercla claims.we note incidentally that aglc did not specify in its complaint a particular subsection of under which it was bringing its claims.thus,we readily conclude that we have jurisdiction under f b.
b.the bestfoods standard.
in united states bestfoods,d,the supreme court recognized that liability for environmental can be imposed either on an owner or on an operator.in a situation involving an attempt to impose liability on a parent because its subsidiary owns a facility,the parent can be subjected to liability as an owner if the corporate veil can be pierced.aglc does not argue in this case that either ugi or centerpoint are liable as an owner,and does not seek to pierce the corporate veil.rather,aglc seeks to impose liability on these defendants as operators.
in discussing the operations sufficient to constitute direct operation by a parent of its subsidiary facility,and thus impose liability upon the parent,the court was sensitive to avoid a fusion of direct liability as an operator and the indirect liability of an owner.thus,the test of parental operation turns upon whether it operates the facility,and that operation is evidenced by participation in the activities of the facility,not the subsidiary.id.at.at.in evaluating a parent activities with respect to its subsidiary,it is relevant whether or not corporate norms are observed.id.at.at.for example,the court expressly held that overlapping officers and directors is not sufficient to expose a parent to liability for its subsidiary actions.id.at.at.indeed,the court established a presumption that the officers and directors of the subsidiary were acting in their capacities as officers and directors of the subsidiary,and not of the parent.id.at.at.the court ultimately articulated the following test to impose liability upon a parent as an operator under cercla with respect to a facility owned by a subsidiary,a plaintiff must prove that the parent as operator must have manage d,direct ed,or conduct ed operations specifically related to pollution,that is,operations having to do with the leakage or disposal of hazardous waste,or decisions about compliance with environmental regulations.id.at.at 
c.the claims against ugi 
to make its case against ugi,aglc points to ugi supervision of the plant through its centralized committees,the ugi management contracts with augustine gas,and the fact that ugi personnel occupied the majority of the director and officer positions at augustine gas.it also points out that ugi nominated substantially all of the local superintendents and regularly approved their salaries.finally,aglc notes that ugi received a fee for providing the services described in the contract and pursuant to the practices preceding the contract.
the court in bestfoods instructed that activities of a parent with respect to its subsidiary consistent with corporate norms should not give rise to liability under cercla.here,there is nothing unusual about the existence of overlapping officers and directors.indeed,bestfoods expressly holds that this is not sufficient to impose liability on a parent.id.at.at.similarly,it is not abnormal in the corporate world for a parent to receive a fee of the kind involved here,or to approve key salaries of a subsidiary.
our review of the record persuades us that the management contract between the two entities which apparently was executed in the later years of the relationship reflects the nature of the relationship all along.the contract explains the relationship between the two entities as being based on augustine ability to tap into ugi vast knowledge and resources.there is nothing in the contract that suggests that ugi was contracting to actively manage the augustine facility itself rather,the contract allows augustine gas to receive advice from ugi various skilled personnel,to have access to ugi network of professionals,and in general to benefit from access to ugi vast experience.for example,in article i,augustine gas retained ugi as its general operating,construction and financial advisor.throughout the contract,its contemplation was that ugi would provide recommendations to augustine gas.the only exception was that ugi would actually serve as augustine gas purchasing agent for significant purchases requested by augustine gas most significant for this case,there is nothing in the contract that suggests that ugi consultation work involved leakage or disposal of hazardous waste,much less any suggestion that ugi would be actually involved in operations involving leakage or disposal of hazardous waste.in other words,in the language of bestfoods,nothing in the contract suggests that ugi was to manage,direct or conduct operations specifically related to pollution,that is,operations having to do with the leakage or disposal of hazardous waste.id.at.at.similarly,there is nothing in the record suggesting that,prior to the time of such a contract between the two entities,ugi was engaged in such activities.to the contrary,the record suggests a similar advisory role finally,to the extent that kingsley patterson,who apparently was normally an ugi employee,managed the plant for a short while,he was appointed acting superintendent during that period,and thus is presumed to have been working on behalf of augustine gas,not ugi.id.at.at.his testimony that he practically rebuilt the plant in refers to that period during which he replaced an ill superintendent he is presumed to have been working on behalf of augustine gas.in sum,aglc had pointed to nothing in the record that would support a finding that ugi operated the augustine plant,let alone operated the sources.
for the foregoing reasons,we agree with the district court and conclude that a reasonable jury could not find from this record that ugi managed,directed or conducted operations of the augustine facility specifically related to pollution,leakage,or disposal of hazardous waste.accordingly,the judgment of the district court with respect to ugi is due to be affirmed.
d.the claims against centerpoint 
turning to the claims against centerpoint,aglc argues that centerpoint assumed the same relationship with augustine gas when it acquired all of the company stock in.in support of its claim against centerpoint,aglc argues that centerpoint replaced the augustine gas officers and directors with centerpoint senior executives and entered into a contract to manage augustine gas aglc also points to testimony from centerpoint employees alver traver and kingsley patterson 
looking at the facts through the prism of corporate norms,as required by bestfoods,it is clear that aglc has not adduced enough evidence of centerpoint management of the plant to hold it liable for costs under cercla.as mentioned in the context of ugi,the existence of overlapping officers and directors is not inconsistent with corporate norms.turning to centerpoint two contracts,it is clear that the services they contemplate are not in the nature of operating the plant itself and its polluting capacity.the first contract covers engineering,which in turn is divided into consulting engineering and engineering.the descriptions of the engineering work to be done contemplates general engineering advice and assistance on proposed additions,extensions and alterations,and design,supervision and construction on substantial additions,extensions and alterations.it does not contemplate operation of the plant.additionally,the contract reads the services above described are intended to cover work as listed which can be handled most efficiently and economically by engineers,leaving to local operating forces such work as they are qualified to do.while the contract does include a heading entitled miscellaneous engineering,that is defined as any engineering services not mentioned in the delineated engineering descriptions.at least in the absence of any evidence that centerpoint engineering activities actually involved operating activities related to leakage or disposal of hazardous waste,this is not enough upon which to base a holding that centerpoint managed or directed operations specifically related to leakage or disposal of hazardous waste.bestfoods,at.at.
although the other centerpoint contract is labeled a management contract,the details of the contract reveal that it contemplates a relationship very similar to ugi relationships with its numerous subsidiaries as aglc itself acknowledges.the details of the centerpoint contract reveal that it contemplates activities in the nature of advice and consultation.for example,the contract indicates that centerpoint will nominate directors or officers at the request of the company.however,the contract contemplates that the local officers,and not centerpoint,will operate the plant these officers will supervise and direct the management of the operations of the company.as noted above,it is presumed that such local office holders are acting on behalf of the subsidiary,and not the parent.although purchasing,preparation of tax returns and a few other administrative matters were to be centralized,the bulk of the management services contemplated by the contract consisted of advice and assistance.for example,with respect to technical services,the contract contemplated general engineering advice and assistance on special technical problems.the advisory and consultative nature of centerpoint services was also indicated by the testimony of traver,apparently an officer of centerpoint one or more of its subsidiaries.traver testified that he was the sponsor and engineer for the augustine gas plant during the relevant time.traver was living and working in jacksonville and serving as general manager of centerpoint jacksonville plant,which paid at least part of his salary.however,in addition to his jacksonville job,he indicated that he simultaneously served centerpoint,acting as sponsor and engineer for other subsidiaries of centerpoint,including augustine gas.he described his role in a manner consistent with the above description of the contracts.with respect to his duties for augustine gas,he testified that he consulted by telephone with the local management in augustine,sometimes twice a day,sometimes once a week,or about an average of times per week.he testified that he made an visit to the augustine plant approximately times a year,or perhaps a few more.it is clear from his testimony,and from the totality of the evidence in this record,that centerpoint did not operate the augustine facility itself,and certainly did not manage,direct or conduct operations specifically related to pollution,that is,operations having to do with the leakage or disposal of hazardous waste.bestfoods,at.at.
for the foregoing reasons,we agree with the district court and conclude that a reasonable jury could not find from this record that centerpoint managed,directed or conducted operations of the augustine facility specifically related to pollution,leakage or disposal of hazardous waste.accordingly,the judgment of the district court with respect to centerpoint is due to be affirmed
