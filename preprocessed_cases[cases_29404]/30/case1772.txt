in this mandamus proceeding,we are called on to determine whether a request for a hearing in an action alleging noncompliance with the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code et must be made in a writing filed with the court to avoid dismissal under section,subdivision a for failure to request a hearing within days of the filing of the petition.construing section as a whole,as we must,we conclude the answer to that question is yes.
because the petitioner here failed to file a written hearing request within the time allowed,its ceqa claims must be dismissed.accordingly,we will order that a writ of mandate issue directing the trial court to vacate its denial of the motion to dismiss at issue here and enter a new order granting that motion.
factual and procedural background 
on june,filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for quiet title and other relief in the sacramento county superior court relating to the county of sacramento approval of a project known as the landing and the final environmental impact report for the project.the first cause of action alleged violations of the county general plan and planning laws.the second cause of action alleged violations of ceqa.the third cause of action was for quiet title,the fourth for related declaratory relief,and the fifth was a taxpayer suit.the named the county as respondent and numerous other parties as parties in interest.among those other parties were syufy enterprises,llc bradshaw landing,llc and sywest development,llc.for convenience,we will refer to those three parties jointly as syufy.
having filed the petition and complaint on june,had until september to request a hearing on its ceqa claims.see,subd.a.
served the county with the petition and complaint on or about june.this gave the county until about august to prepare and certify the administrative record.see,subd.b.
in september,with the administrative record not yet prepared,county counsel drafted a stipulation to give the county until october to complete the record.see,subd.c.county counsel signed the stipulation on september syufy counsel signed it september and counsel signed it september.
in october,counsel prepared a second stipulation to give the county until november to complete the administrative record.this stipulation noted that had previously reserved a court date of january,on the writ petition.the stipulation provided for that court date to be moved to march instead.county counsel and syufy counsel signed the second stipulation on october.it was made a court order on october.
on november,served syufy and the county with notice of the march hearing on the writ petition.
the administrative record was finally certified on january,and lodged with the court on january.
on or about february,another one of the parties in interest bradshaw industrial park filed a relating to quiet title and declaratory relief causes of action.
on march,a status conference was held in the case,but then dropped and rescheduled for march due to the absence of attorney.in the meantime,the court ordered counsel to meet and confer regarding the order of trial on the quiet title and ceqa issues and on a briefing schedule.
syufy proposed to bifurcate and try the issues relating to quiet title claim before the ceqa issues.disagreed because it did not want to waive the precedence afforded to ceqa actions.
at the status conference on march,the court determined the ceqa claims should be litigated first.thereafter,on or about march,syufy filed a motion to sever the third and fourth causes of action for separate trial,and syufy and the county jointly filed a motion to dismiss the ceqa under ceqa section,subdivision a because did not request a hearing within days of filing the writ petition.in support of their motion to dismiss,syufy and the county asserted that did not request a hearing until on or about october,as part of the second stipulation to extend the time for preparation of the administrative record.in a declaration supporting the motion to dismiss,deputy county counsel noted that her files did not reflect that had requested a hearing in writing before the stipulation establishing the march hearing date,but she also conceded it was possible had reserved the january hearing date with the court verbally.
did not oppose the motion to sever but did oppose the motion to dismiss.in a declaration opposing the motion to dismiss,attorney asserted that before the deadline expired on september,he telephoned the court clerk and reserved a hearing on the merits for january.he further asserted that he and deputy county counsel later determined this date was premature,as the county was still having trouble preparing the administrative record.
on may,the trial court denied the motion to dismiss,concluding that subsection a of section,which is the portion of the statute that provides for mandatory dismissal,does not explicitly require that the request for a hearing be in writing.the court noted that subdivisions b and c of the statute do refer to the filing of a request for hearing.nevertheless,because d ismissal is an extreme sanction,because the portion of the statute that mandates dismissal does not explicitly require the request for hearing to be in writing in order to avoid dismissal,and because of the lack of case authority holding that an oral request to the court for a hearing date is insufficient,the court determined that ceqa claims were not subject to dismissal under subdivision a of section.
three weeks later,syufy and the county commenced the present proceeding by filing a petition for a writ of mandate in this court,seeking a writ directing the trial court to grant their motion to dismiss.we ordered the issuance of an alternative writ.
discussion 
section provides,in its entirety,as follows 
a in any action or proceeding alleging noncompliance with this division,the petitioner shall request a hearing within days from the date of filing the petition or shall be subject to dismissal on the court own motion or on the motion of any party interested in the action or proceeding.
b the petitioner shall serve a notice of the request for a hearing on all parties at the time that the petitioner files the request for a hearing.
c upon the filing of a request by the petitioner for a hearing and upon application by any party,the court shall establish a briefing schedule and a hearing date.in the absence of good cause,briefing shall be completed within days from the date that the request for a hearing is filed,and the hearing,to the extent feasible,shall be held within days thereafter.good cause may include,but shall not be limited to,the conduct of discovery,determination of the completeness of the record of proceedings,the complexity of the issues,and the length of the record of proceedings and the timeliness of its production.the parties may stipulate to a briefing schedule or hearing date that differs from the schedule set forth in this subdivision if the stipulation is approved by the court.
syufy and the county contend the trial court erred in denying their motion to dismiss ceqa claims because the request for a hearing required by section must be made in writing.although subdivision a of the statute does not specify a written request,they contend subdivision a must be interpreted together with subdivisions b and c,which clarify that the request for a hearing must be a document that is filed with the court,and served on all parties at the time of its filing.
