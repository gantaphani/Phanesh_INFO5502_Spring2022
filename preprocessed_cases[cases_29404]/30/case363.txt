the environmental conservation organization appeals the dismissal of its clean water act citizen suit against the city of dallas,texas,arguing that the district court erroneously concluded that its suit was barred under the doctrine of res judicata.we agree that the citizen suit should have been dismissed,but not for the reasons given by the district court.we hold that the citizen suit became moot prior to the district court entry of final judgment therefore,we vacate the judgment because it was rendered without jurisdiction.
facts and procedural background 
the city of dallas,texas city,operates a municipal separate storm sewer system that collects,channels and discharges storm water runoff into the trinity river and its tributaries.the city operates this separate storm sewer system pursuant to a clean water act permit the permit.see.the permit delineates permissible and impermissible discharges into the trinity river watershed and mandates the implementation of a storm water management program swmp.the swmp imposes planning and monitoring requirements to ensure that water and other pollutants are not discharged through the separate storm sewer system.see p.
the environmental conservation organization eco is a environmental watch group based in dallas,texas.some of eco members use the trinity river and its tributaries for recreational purposes.in september,due to problems with the city operation of its separate storm sewer system and the polluted appearance of some water bodies,eco notified the city that it would file a citizen suit in order to remedy alleged violations of the permit and the clean water act cwa or act.in accordance with the requirements of the cwa provision,eco simultaneously notified the administrator of the environmental protection agency epa and the texas commission on environmental quality tceq of the alleged violations and eco intent to initiate a citizen suit against the city if no corrective action was taken.see b.in october,eco sent a revised notification letter to the city,the epa administrator and the tceq,pressing its concerns regarding the alleged violations and reiterating its intent to bring a citizen suit.
in december,over sixty days after sending notice of the alleged violations,eco filed a cwa citizen suit against the city in federal district court.eco complaint alleged that illicit pollutant discharges from various facilities violated both the permit and the cwa because they constituted discharges from point sources without a permit.the complaint also alleged that the city violated its permit by failing to comply with the swmp requirements contained therein.eco sought civil penalties and injunctive relief under the cwa.
while neither the epa nor the state of texas commenced an enforcement action against the city prior to eco filing this suit,the epa had begun to investigate the city separate storm sewer system in february,the epa issued an administrative compliance order that identified various violations of the city permit and the cwa.see a.the compliance order instructed the city to rectify these violations or arrange a show cause meeting with the epa in order to explain why no enforcement action should be taken in regards to the alleged violations.shortly after the order was issued,the city and the epa began negotiating a settlement of the violations noticed therein.the epa encouraged eco to participate in the settlement discussions,but eco declined.ultimately,the city reached a settlement with the epa.
in may,the epa,joined by the state of texas,filed a cwa enforcement action against the city in federal district court the epa enforcement action.on the same day,epa filed a proposed consent decree that contained the terms of the settlement agreement.the filing of the consent decree triggered a public notice and comment period,during which eco was the only person or organization to submit comments.see.eco did not oppose entry of the consent decree,but expressed concern that the punitive provisions and some remedial provisions were inadequate.at the close of the public comment period,the epa responded to eco comments and moved for entry of the consent decree.in august,the district court granted epa unopposed motion to enter the consent decree.see united states city of dallas,
the consent decree is a lengthy and detailed document.it requires,among other things,that the city pay in civil penalties,undertake supplemental environmental projects totaling at least million,meet minimum staffing requirements in its environmental quality and sewer system monitoring departments,and provide ongoing compliance reports to the epa.the city is also subject to an audit of its storm water system within three years of the consent decree entry and must pay stipulated penalties if it is found to be in violation of any of its provisions.the decree appendices provide strict timetables for satisfaction of these provisions,which are posted on a website and available to the public.
during the time in which epa was investigating and negotiating with the city,eco citizen suit remained pending on the district court docket.after entering the consent decree in the epa enforcement action,the district court directed the city to file a motion for summary judgment in eco action so that the court could determine whether the consent decree precluded eco citizen suit.the city moved for summary judgment,arguing that eco suit should be dismissed because the final judgment in the epa enforcement action precluded of the same claims in a citizen suit.alternatively,the city argued that eco claims were mooted by the resolution of the epa enforcement action.eco opposed the motion to dismiss,arguing first that the language and statutory scheme of the cwa indicated that the res judicata doctrine and principles of mootness could not be invoked to dismiss a citizen suit.alternatively,eco argued that neither the elements of res judicata nor the test for mootness had been satisfied.
the district court relied on res judicata to dismiss eco citizen suit,rejecting arguments that both the privity and similarity of claims requirements were not met in its case.the court noted that even though the fifth circuit has never considered whether res judicata applies to a citizen enforcement action under the cwa,precedents from other circuits had applied res judicata to citizen suits under similar circumstances.envtl.conservation org.city of dallas,d.the district court did not reach the alternative argument regarding mootness.eco appealed here.

standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.greenwell state farm mut.auto.ins,cir.summary judgment may be granted only if the pleadings and evidence show that there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.the record must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party all justifiable inferences will be drawn in the favor.tig ins.sedgwick james of washington,cir.
this case also requires us to examine the district court jurisdiction.the city argues that eco claims were moot at the time that the district court entered summary judgment.we review questions of federal jurisdiction de novo,including arguments that a case or controversy has become moot.in re scruggs,cir.when the district court had no jurisdiction,our authority is not over the merits but exists merely for the purpose of correcting the error of the lower court in entertaining the suit new york life ins.deshotel,cir citation omitted.
mootness is the doctrine of standing in a time frame.the requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of litigation standing must continue throughout its existence mootness.ctr.for individual freedom carmouche,cir quoting parole comm geraghty,d.if a case has been rendered moot,a federal court has no constitutional authority to resolve the issues that it presents.in re scruggs,at.therefore,before considering any other matters raised by the parties,we are obliged to resolve the standing question as a threshold matter of jurisdiction.cole motors,cir.
the department of justice,participating in this appeal as amicus curiae,urges us to resolve this case on res judicata grounds and argues that recent supreme court precedent permits us to do so,pretermitting the mootness issue.see sinochem int l malaysia int l shipping,d.in sinochem,the supreme court held that a federal court may dismiss a case on grounds of forum non conveniens although jurisdictional issues remain unresolved.id.at.the court pragmatically recognized that where or personal jurisdiction is difficult to determine,and forum non conveniens considerations weigh heavily in favor of dismissal,the court properly takes the less burdensome course.id.at.the third circuit recently relied on sinochem in affirming the dismissal of a resident alien petition for habeas corpus on res judicata grounds,although the government also challenged the federal court jurisdiction to entertain the petition,cir unpublished.
we recognize that,in some limited instances,a federal court has leeway to choose among threshold grounds for denying audience to a case on the merits.sinochem.at internal quotation marks omitted.however,we do not think this is one of those instances.in this case,the res judicata analysis is no less burdensome than the standing inquiry.eco argues that the common law doctrine of res judicata can not be applied to cwa citizen suits,and there is some precedent to that effect.see sierra club.the city points to later authority that disagrees.see epa city of green forest,cir.even were we to resolve that argument in the city favor,we would still face an apparent circuit split regarding the proper privity analysis in the context of determining the preclusive effect of an consent decree on a cwa citizen suit.compare friends of milwaukee rivers milwaukee metro.sewerage,cir satisfaction of res judicata privity element requires showing of diligent prosecution with city of green forest,at applying res judicata without any discussion of diligent prosecution see ellis gallatin steel,cir expressly rejecting diligent prosecution requirement when applying res judicata to a clean air act citizen suit.
this is not a textbook case for immediate res judicata dismissal.sinochem.at.therefore,we turn to our threshold consideration was the district court bound to dismiss eco suit as moot 
mootness analysis 
a citizen suit may be dismissed as moot 
congress enacted the cwa with the express purpose of restor ing and maintain ing the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.a.among the myriad of mechanisms for achieving this goal,congress empowered private citizens to bring suit in federal court against alleged violators of the act.under the cwa provision,federal courts are authorized to enter injunctions and assess civil penalties,payable to the united states treasury,against any person found to be in violation of an effluent standard or limitation under the act.a friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d.the provision is a critical component of the cwa enforcement scheme,as it permit s citizens to abate pollution when the government can not or will not command compliance.gwaltney of smithfield,chesapeake bay,d.
however,congress placed some limitations on the commencement of citizen suits under the cwa.first,a citizen may not commence suit prior to sixty days after giving notice of the alleged violation to the epa,the state,and the alleged violator.b a.second,no citizen suit may be brought if the epa or state has commenced and is diligently prosecuting a civil or criminal action against the alleged violator.b b.the act is silent as to which mechanisms may be invoked to dispense with citizen eco that have been properly commenced under section b.
eco argues that courts should not employ mootness or res judicata doctrines to dismiss a properly filed citizen suit because this would conflict with congress statutory scheme under the cwa.eco invokes the canon of statutory construction expressio unius est exclusio alterius that instructs w hen a statute limits a thing to be done in a particular mode,it includes a negative of any other mode.christensen harris county,d.eco posits that because congress imposed certain express limitations on a citizen right to prosecute a cwa suit,all other methods of limiting that right are excluded.under eco theory,the decision to dismiss a properly commenced citizen suit due to mootness constitutes an impermissible judicial addition to congress enumerated limitations on such suits.
eco argument is flawed for two reasons.first,the thing to be done under section b is the commencement of a citizen suit,not the resolution of such a suit.second,and more importantly,mootness is part of the article iii standing inquiry applicable to all suits filed in federal court.see laidlaw,at.thus,when dismissing a citizen suit as moot,a court does not graft some doctrine onto the cwa.rather,a finding that the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing is not satisfied means the court has no constitutional authority to resolve the dispute between the citizen and the alleged violator.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.one court has noted that the provision confers standing to enforce the clean water act to the full extent allowed by the constitution.friends of the earth,gaston copper recycling,cir en banc.the full extent of the law does not extend beyond constitutional limits.accordingly,this court has recognized that developments subsequent to the filing of a citizen suit may moot the citizen case.see carr alta verde,cir 
having established that the jurisdictional mootness inquiry is required in the context of a cwa citizen suit,we turn to an application of mootness principles to eco suit.
standard for determining mootness 
as a general rule,any set of circumstances that eliminates actual controversy after the commencement of a lawsuit renders that action moot.carmouche,at.a case should not be declared moot a s long as the parties maintain a concrete interest in the outcome and effective relief is available to remedy the effect of the violation dailey vought aircraft,cir.but a case will become moot where there are no longer adverse parties with sufficient legal interests to maintain the litigation or when the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome of the litigation.in re scruggs,at.as the supreme court has noted,it is not enough that a dispute was very much alive when the suit was filed t he parties must continue to have a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit.lewis cont l bank,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
eco argues that,if the consent decree can moot its citizen suit,the test for mootness should be the traditional,stringent standard that was applied by this court in carr alta verde industries.according to carr,in order to have a case dismissed as moot,t he defendant must demonstrate that it is absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.at quoting gwaltney,at.some quotation marks omitted emphasis in original.under this standard,the party asserting mootness bears the formidable burden of showing that its alleged violations of the cwa can not reasonably be expected to recur.laidlaw,at.as such,eco argues that the city must prove that the consent decree actually stops all violations without any likelihood the violations will recur in order to have its citizen suit dismissed as moot.
however,the test for mootness that eco urges us to apply is derived from cases in which the defendant argued that its voluntary conduct mooted the plaintiff suit.see laidlaw,at.the only conceivable basis for a finding of mootness in this case is laidlaw voluntary conduct carr,at cattle feedlot voluntary improvements and application for cwa permit did not moot citizen suit.this stringent standard is appropriate when considering voluntary cessations of cwa violations because it protects plaintiffs from defendants who seek to evade sanction by predictable protestations of repentance and reform.gwaltney,at.quotation marks omitted.for example,if we were considering an argument by the city that eco claims were moot because the city voluntarily hired
