background 
founded in,grand canyon is a environmental organization dedicated to conserving the natural resources of the colorado plateau.the colorado plateau is not actually a plateau,but rather an enormous high basin centered roughly at the four corners where colorado,utah,arizona,and new mexico meet.the plateau is filled with plateaus,canyons,buttes,mesas,natural arches and other geological features.it contains over twenty national parks,national monuments,national landmarks,and national recreation areas.grand canyon,bryce canyon,and zion national parks are all within the plateau.
tucson electric is an electric utility company that serves the tucson,arizona,area.it is the sole owner and operator of the springerville plant,located within the colorado plateau.grand canyon asserts that springerville is an antiquated power plant that produces a large amount of pollution,thereby harming the air quality in the colorado plateau.grand canyon also asserts that springerville emissions would be significantly reduced if it were upgraded and operated using current technology.
in december,as it was required to do by the clean air act and epa regulations then in effect,tucson electric applied to the epa for a permit to construct the springerville plant.the resulting permit the permit authorized the construction of two steam electric generating units units and.at about this time,congress amended the clean air act.among other things,the amendments required that all new sources of air pollution use the most current,pollution controls.this requirement is known as the best available control technology bact requirement.b now codified at a.
in june,the epa incorporated the bact requirement into its regulations the regulations,but grandfathered permits that had already been issued,such as the permit for springerville.the regulations provided that permits would remain therefore not subject to the bact construction commenced by march.i ii.if,however,construction commenced after that date,the old permit would no longer be valid,and a new to the bact have to be obtained.id.i,j.the regulations provided that discontinuing construction for a period of more than eighteen months,or failing to complete construction within a reasonable amount of time,had the same effect as failing to commence construction by march.id.i iii.the apparent purpose of the regulations was to preserve settled expectations with respect to permits,while at the same time to prevent anyone from stockpiling construction permits previously granted under the former,relatively lax pollution rules.
tucson electric was well aware of the importance of commencing construction on springerville by march.a february letter from tucson electric to the epa asserted that it had commenced construction on springerville on january,because it had entered into a contract for construction of the boilers for springerville units and on that date.in another letter to the epa dated march,five days before the grandfathering electric listed the main activities underway with respect to the construction of springerville.it is undisputed that tucson electric completed construction of springerville units and in and,respectively,and that the units have operated ever since.
in spring,tucson electric publicly announced a plan the netting plan to construct two new units at springerville units and.under the netting plan,tucson electric sought to avoid the extensive review the epa applies to new sources and major modifications.under the plan,the epa would not analyze units and as units.instead,the epa would analyze units and as part of the existing springerville plant,merely ensuring that the plant as a whole would have no net increase in emissions once units and were added.for various reasons,including the fact that units and were to be the first new units on the colorado plateau in a decade,tucson electric announcement caught the attention of both grand canyon and the epa.prior to this time,grand canyon had not shown any particular interest in tucson electric permit for springerville despite the fact that one member of the grand canyon board of trustees since was also a member of the board of tucson electric from to.
grand canyon and the epa both undertook independent investigations of springerville.grand canyon concluded the units and of springerville were not fitted with the bact and were therefore discharging much more pollution than newer power plants.springerville,of course,was not required to comply with the bact requirement,so long as the permit was valid and was grandfathered under the regulations.thus,grand canyon began investigating the validity of the permit.as discussed above,the permit validity depended on the date on which tucson electric commenced construction on springerville units and,and the diligence and speed with which it continued that construction.see providing for the automatic cancellation of construction permits if,inter alia,construction does not commence by march.
based on its investigation,grand canyon contends that the permit was invalid.it brought this citizen enforcement action under the clean air act claiming that tucson electric did not commence construction of springerville by the date of march,that it discontinued construction for one or more periods of longer than eighteen months and that it did not complete construction within a reasonable time.if any of these claims is proved,the necessary implication is that the permit was rendered invalid by operation of the regulations,see id.i,i,and that tucson electric therefore built springerville units and without a valid construction permit.unauthorized construction of a power plant violates the clean air act and provides grounds for a citizen suit under the act citizen suit provision.see a empowering citizens to bring suit for injunctive relief and civil penalties against any person who constructs any new or modified major emitting facility without a valid permit.
tucson electric challenged the jurisdiction of the district court and defended itself on the merits.as to jurisdiction,tucson electric asserted that the validity of the permit was an issue over which the epa has exclusive jurisdiction.by statute,any final action of the epa may only be reviewed in the courts of appeals.b.the district court found that it had jurisdiction over the action.on the merits,tucson electric asserted that no genuine issue of material fact existed regarding the commencement of construction before march,and moved for partial summary judgment.the district court concluded that tucson electric had commenced construction in the drilling wells at the springerville site.the court therefore granted partial summary judgment in september to tucson electric.
meanwhile,the epa had conducted its own investigation and reached its own conclusion regarding the validity of the permit.unbeknownst to the district court,the epa had sent a letter in february to the arizona department of environmental quality in which the epa formally objected to tucson
