in new york epa,new york i,the court addressed the first of two rules promulgated by the environmental protection agency providing ways for stationary sources of air pollution to avoid triggering new source review nsr.the court upheld in part and vacated in part the first rule.id.at.we now address the second rule,the equipment replacement provision erp,which amends the routine maintenance,repair,and replacement exclusion rmrr from nsr requirements.under section a of the clean air act,a,sources that undergo any physical change that increases emissions are required to undergo the nsr permitting process.see also id,c id.a.the exclusion has historically provided that routine maintenance,repair,and replacement do not constitute changes triggering nsr.the erp both defined and expanded that exclusion.epa explained 
the rule states categorically that the replacement of components with identical or functionally equivalent components that do not exceed of the replacement value of the process unit and does not change its basic design parameters is not a change and is within the rmrr exclusion.
equipment replacement provision of the routine maintenance,repair and replacement exclusion,final rule see also.june,reconsideration.hence,the erp would allow sources to avoid nsr when replacing equipment under the cap notwithstanding a resulting increase in emissions.the court stayed the effective date of the erp on december.we now vacate the erp because it is contrary to the plain language of section a of the act.
the clean air act requires new and modified sources of pollution to undergo nsr,a permitting process that imposes specific pollution control requirements depending upon the geographic location of the source section a of the act describes when a source is to be considered modified 
the term modification means any physical change in,or change in the method of operation of,a stationary source which increases the amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source or which results in the emission of any air pollutant not previously emitted.
a emphasis added.since the inception of nsr,rmrr has been excluded from the definition of modification.see,june.heretofore,epa applied the rmrr exclusion through a determination by weighing the nature,extent,purpose,frequency,and cost of the work as well as other factors to arrive at a common sense finding.consistent with alabama power costle,which recognized epa discretion to exempt from nsr some emission increases on grounds of de minimis or administrative necessity,id.at,epa has for over two decades defined the rmrr exclusion as limited to de minimis circumstances.at.the erp provides a rule and expands the traditional scope of the rmrr by exempting certain equipment replacements from nsr.see,cc 
the government and environmental petitioners contend that the erp is contrary to the plain text of the act because the statutory definition of modification applies unambiguously to any physical change that increases emissions,necessarily including the equipment replacements excused from nsr by the rule.they maintain that the word any,when given its natural meaning,requires that the phrase physical change be read broadly,such that epa attempt to read physical change narrowly would relegate the word any to an insignificant role.
in evaluating the petitioners contention,we proceed under the familiar test of chevron,natural resources defense council,d.if congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.only if the statute is silent or ambiguous do we defer to the agency interpretation,asking whether it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.if a court,employing traditional tools of statutory construction,ascertains that congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,that intention is the law and must be given effect.id.at.
the petitioners and epa agree that the phrase physical change is susceptible to multiple meanings,each citing dictionary definitions.however,the sort of ambiguity giving rise to chevron deference is a creature not of definitional possibilities,but of statutory context.american bar ass ftc,quoting brown gardner,d see california indep.operator ferc,cincinnati ins.flanders motor,cir.as the parties point out,the ordinary meaning of physical change includes activities that make different in some particular,make over to a radically different form,or replace with another or others of the same kind or class.webster third new international dictionary.to say that it is physical,in this context,indicates that the change must be natural or material,rather than mental,moral,spiritual,or imaginary.id.the parties agree that in r,usage.at,physical change includes equipment replacements.they further agree that the erp would excuse from nsr requirements certain activities that epa has historically considered to be physical changes.see id.at.
the parties essential disagreement,then,centers on the effect of congress decision in defining modification to insert the word any before physical change.according to the petitioners,the word any means that the phrase physical change covers any activity at a source that could be considered a physical change that increases emissions.according to epa,any does nothing to resolve ambiguity in the phrase it modifies.epa maintains that because physical change is susceptible to multiple meanings,id.at,identifying activities that are changes for nsr purposes requires an exercise of agency expertise,the classic situation in which an agency is accorded deference under chevron,id.at.under this approach,once epa has identified an activity as a physical change,the word any requires that the activity be subject to nsr.we conclude that the differences between the parties interpretations of the role of the word any are resolved by recognizing that r ead naturally,the word any has an expansive meaning,that is,one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind,united states gonzales,d,and that courts must give effect to each word of a statute,see,trw,andrews,d.because congress used the word any,epa must apply nsr whenever a source conducts an activity that fits within one of the ordinary meanings of physical change.
in a series of cases,the supreme court has drawn upon the word any to give the word it modifies an expansive meaning when there is no reason to contravene the clause obvious meaning.norfolk rwy.kirby,d see also dep t of hous.and urban dev.rucker,d gonzales,at.indeed,the court has read the word any to signal expansive reach when construing the clean air act.in harrison ppg industries,d,the court resolved a jurisdictional dispute under section b by interpreting the phrase any other final action,which the court discern ed to have no uncertainty.id.at.the court never suggested that the term final action was itself devoid of multiple meanings depending on the context,but rather stated that when congress amended the act in,it expanded its ambit to include not simply other final action,but rather any other final action.id.at.i n the absence of legislative history to the contrary,the court held that the statutory phrase must be construed to mean exactly what it says,namely,any other final action.id.
although epa is correct that the meaning of any can differ depending upon the statutory setting,see nixon missouri mun.league,d,the context of the clean air act warrants no departure from the word customary effect.unlike nixon,the question of statutory interpretation here does not arise in a setting in which the supreme court has required heightened standards of clarity to avoid upsetting fundamental policies.see id.at.citing gregory ashcroft,d.epa points to no strange and indeterminate results,id.at.that would emerge from adopting the natural meaning of any in section a of the act.given congress goal in adopting the amendments of establishing a balance between economic and environmental interests,see wisconsin power reilly,cir wepco,it is hardly farfetched,nixon,at,for congress to have intended nsr to apply to any type of physi
