background 
recognizing the dangers of paint,congress passed the residential paint hazard reduction act of lead hazard act,title x,stat.codified at.the lead hazard act authorized the epa to promulgate regulations regarding the disclosure of paint hazards in target housing which is offered for sale or lease.lead hazard act a a.accordingly,the epa promulgated the real estate notification and disclosure rule disclosure rule in.lead requirements for disclosure of known paint paint hazards in housing final rule,codified at pt,subpart f and pt,subpart a.under the disclosure rule,lessors and sellers are required to provide lessees and purchasers of target housing with certain information.see.target housing is defined as any housing constructed prior to.the lead hazard act provides that a violation of the disclosure rule is considered a prohibited act under section of the toxic substances control act tsca.b.under tsca,the epa has the authority to seek civil penalties for failure to comply with the disclosure rule.id 
vidiksis,a resident of georgia owns multiple residential properties in york,pennsylvania.the violations on appeal relate to leases entered into for sixteen of these properties.the leases used by vidiksis contained the following notice 
lead paint notice.tenant acknowledges that the leased premises may have been constructed before,and may contain paint.ingestion of paint particles containing lead may result in lead poisoning which can cause major health problems,especially in children under years of age.in the event the tenant or any family members or guests should develop lead poisoning,and it is determined that corrective measures are required to remedy the source of the lead poisoning,the cost of such remedy shall be at the sole expense of the tenant.in the event that tenant is either unwilling or unable to perform corrective measures,tenant shall have the option at the discretion of the landlord to terminate the lease with a written day notice and providing landlord with written verification of source of lead.
the lease documents and disclosures were prepared by professional real estate agents in pennsylvania hired by the petitioner accompanying each lease was a pamphlet published by the epa that went into further detail regarding the dangers of lead poisoning.
the administrative complaint filed by the epa alleged violations of b requiring a lead warning statement with language regarding potential lead paint related health problems.section b specifically requires a lead warning statement with the following language 
housing built before may contain paint.lead from paint,paint chips,and dust can pose health hazards if not managed properly.lead exposure is especially harmful to young children and pregnant women.before renting housing,lessors must disclose the presence of paint paint hazards in the dwelling.lessees must also receive a federally approved pamphlet on lead poisoning prevention.
it was found that vidiksis notice did not contain this exact language,and therefore,violated the regulatory requirement.the penalty assessed in relation to these violations was.
the complaint also alleged that transactions utilizing leases with this notice violated b requiring a statement by the lessor disclosing the presence of known paint paint hazards in the target housing being leased or indicating no knowledge of the presence of paint paint hazards.the alj found,and the eab confirmed,that vidiksis notice did not effectively disclose his knowledge or lack of knowledge of paint.rather,vidiksis merely stated that there may be paint on the premises.the penalty assessed in relation to these particular violations totaled

discussion 
challenge to the validity of the regulations 
as a preliminary matter,vidiksis challenges the regulations at issue promulgated by the epa,b and as arbitrary and capricious.he claims that congress statutory mandates were not ambiguous,and that the agency failed to follow the plain language of the statute in creating the regulations at issue.he states that the purpose of the lead hazard act was to disclose the existence of paint and to warn of the dangers of that paint.see.according to the argument,the regulations promulgated by the epa did not fulfill this purpose.the epa responds by arguing that vidiksis is not permitted to make this argument because it has been either or waived.the epa attempts to portray the regulations as a rule promulgated under the tsca,which limits challenges to regulations to be brought not later than days after the date of promulgation.a a.as an alternative,the epa claims that the statute of limitations under the federal tort claims act applies.see a.the epa also believes that the challenge to the regulations is waived because vidiksis did not raise the argument in the administrative proceedings below.
even should vidiksis challenge to the regulations be permitted at this time,it has no merit.with respect to b,vidiksis seems to argue that the epa did not have the authority to craft a regulation requiring specific language in the lease.however,the lead hazard act contained specific language to be provided in sales transactions.a.the epa and the department of housing and urban development hud concluded that such language was necessary to include in leases as well.given that the stated purposes of the lead hazard act include ensur ing that the existence of paint hazards is taken into account in the development of government housing policies and in the sale,rental,and renovation of homes and apartments,as well as educat ing the public concerning the hazards and sources of paint poisoning,it is not arbitrary or capricious for the epa to have crafted regulations requiring a lead warning statement applicable to rental housing.
vidiksis also challenges the epa authority to promulgate b,which requires leases to include a statement by the lessor disclosing the presence of known paint in the target housing being leased or indicating no knowledge of the presence of paint b emphasis added.the lead hazard act authorizes the epa and hud to promulgate regulations requiring sellers and lessors to disclose to the purchaser or lessee the presence of any known paint in such housing.a b.vidiksis contends that the epa exceeded its authority by obligating lessors to make a no knowledge declaration because a b expressly requires only that the promulgated regulations require lessors to disclose to lessees the presence of any known paint.we believe that it was reasonable for the epa to require that lessors also make a no knowledge declaration if they did not know whether there was paint.the declaration provides lessees with more information than they would otherwise have.without the requirement,when the lessor made no declaration,the lessee would not know whether the lessor knew there was no paint or lacked knowledge as to whether there was any.the requirement prevents the silence of the lessor from being ambiguous.
contrary to vidiksis arguments,these regulations are not arbitrary or capricious.
ii.violations 
as outlined above,there are two basic categories of violations for the purposes of this appeal violations of b failure to include the specific regulatory language warning tenants of potential lead paint health problems,and violations of b failure to state either that lead hazards exist at the site or that the owner has no knowledge of any lead hazards.
failure to warn tenants of potential lead paint health problems 
the eab interpreted b to require lessors to use the exact language of the lead warning statement provided in the regulatory text.although the leases used by vidiksis did not contain the exact language stated in b,vidiksis contends that he complied with the requirement because his leases communicated all of the same elements outlined in the language of b.
the text of the regulation is clear.section b plainly states that e ach contract to lease target housing shall include a lead warning statement with the following language.emphasis added.vidiksis simply did not have that precise language in his leases,as required by the regulation.
vidiksis argues that the pamphlet was provided to the lessees,and that it contained the required language from b.however,as the eab found,and as the language of the regulation dictates,providing the federally approved pamphlet is a separate requirement.the regulation specifically states that l essees must also receive a federally approved pamphlet on lead poisoning prevention.emphasis added.the required lead warning statement can not be satisfied through the additional requirement of providing the pamphlet.see also final rule lead requirements for disclosure of known paint paint hazards in housing,describing the lead hazard information pamphlet as a separate component of disclosure.
the eab ruling in this regard was not clearly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.
failure to state knowledge of lead hazards present at the property 
the bulk of the violations were based on vidiksis breach of b,requiring the lessor to state either that lead paint is present at the property,or that the lessor has no knowledge of the presence of any lead paint at the property.the eab interpreted this provision to require the lessor to make one of two affirmative statements to either disclose what the lessor knows about paint in the housing or to affirmatively state that the lessor has no knowledge of the presence of paint hazards in the housing.vidiksis argues that his lead paint notice fulfilled his obligations under b.he also claims that the involvement of a property management agent somehow obviates his own responsibility for compliance.see a whenever a seller or lessor has entered into a contract with an agent for the purpose of selling or leasing a unit of target housing,the regulations promulgated under this section shall require the agent,on behalf of the seller or lessor,to ensure compliance with the requirements of this section.
similar to the analysis for b,b is also precise in its requirements for disclosure of the presence of lead paint or a statement of no knowledge.in the notice included in his leases,vidiksis stated only that the premises may contain paint,and therefore did not comply with b.a statement that the premises may contain paint is insufficient because it does not indicate to the lessee whether the lessor has knowledge of the presence of paint or does not know one way or the other.
while the regulations do place an onus on agents,this does not remove any responsibility from the lessor.the statutory language of a does not state that the agent responsibilities replace the seller or lessor obligations.in addition,the corresponding regulations include provisions specifically entitled lessor requirements.b.under these regulations,agents are required to inform the lessor of the obligations of.b.this requirement would be unnecessary should the agent responsibility supplant that of the lessor.furthermore,the eab has held that a passive owner defense is inconsistent with the purpose of the disclosure rule.see in re harpoon,eab.permitting an owner to transfer its reporting obligations to an agent would largely defeat the purpose of the statute.because the statute requires disclosure of known hazards,allowing a knowledgeable owner to transfer its responsibilities to a less knowledgeable agent could allow informed owners to avoid disclosure altogether,thereby undermining the purpose of the statute,and denying purchasers and lessees the very protection that congress intended the statute to provide.id.
again,the eab ruling in this regard was not clearly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.
iii.penalty assessment 
after determining that he was liable for all violations brought against him in the epa administrative complaint,vidiksis was assessed a civil penalty.the epa calculation of the penalty was based on the environmental protection agency,office of regulatory enforcement,section rule enforcement response policy for the lead paint disclosure rule erp.the erp establishes a process to calculate the appropriate penalty.first,a penalty is determined based on the nature of the violation,the circumstances of the violation,and the extent of harm that may result from the violation.second,the penalty is adjusted based on various factors,including the ability to pay,history of prior violations,and degree of culpability.
on appeal,vidiksis raises various arguments with respect to the penalty calculation.essentially,he claims that the epa did not consider all of the required statutory factors in assessing the penalty.these factors include the nature,circumstances,extent,and gravity of the violation or violations and,with respect to the violator,ability to pay,effect on ability to continue to do business,any history of prior such violations,the degree of culpability,and such other matters as justice may require.a b.
in completing the first step of the penalty analysis,the erp employs a matrix to establish the penalty gravity component that takes into account the violations extent.the matrix considers the ages of any children that were affected by the violations.since children under the age of six are most vulnerable to hazards,the presence of children under the age of six is considered a major extent factor.for the presence of children between the ages of six and seventeen,the epa assigned the violations a significant extent factor.and where there were no children
