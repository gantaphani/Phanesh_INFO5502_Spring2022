introduction 
greater yellowstone coalition,jackson hole conservation alliance,and wyoming outdoor council collectively gyc sent a letter to the united states forest service forest service and the united states bureau of land management blm requesting the agencies to undertake environmental analyses of wyoming elk feedgrounds located on federal land.in the letter,gyc alleged the environmental analyses were required pursuant to the national environmental policy act nepa.unsatisfied with the agencies response to its letter,gyc filed a petition for review of agency action in the united states district court for the district of wyoming.gyc alleged the forest service and blm violated nepa and various federal permitting regulations in connection with the feedgrounds authorizations.in addition to seeking review of the agencies actions,gyc requested injunctive relief requiring,inter alia,the forest service and blm to undertake environmental analyses of the feedgrounds.the district court denied the requested relief and entered judgment in favor of respondents.gyc then appealed to this court.exercising jurisdiction pursuant to,we vacate the portions of the district court order that have become moot and affirm the other portions.
ii.background 
each winter the state of wyoming feeds approximately elk at designated feedgrounds.all or part of twelve of the wyoming feedgrounds are located on federal lands administered by either the forest service or blm.the forest service authorizes use of the land in the national forest for eight feedgrounds alkali,fish creek,dog creek,dell creek,fall creek,forest park,upper green river,and muddy creek.the forest service also authorizes a program at the muddy creek feedground.this program was created to reduce brucellosis levels among elk that use feedgrounds.blm pinedale resource area hosts four feedgrounds scab creek,franz,bench corral,and finnegan.
gyc contends that in recent years substantial scientific information has emerged demonstrating the unnatural concentration of elk on feedgrounds significantly increases the incidence of disease outbreak among feedground elk populations.specifically,gyc points to research indicating brucellosis prevalence among elk averages percent at the twelve feedgrounds where the wyoming game and fish department wyoming vaccinates for the disease and percent at a single feedground where no vaccination is conducted.by contrast,brucellosis prevalence among wyoming elk not frequenting feedgrounds is only two percent.gyc also claims the unnatural elk concentrations on wyoming feedgrounds present a grave risk of a chronic wasting disease epidemic among the feedground elk populations.chronic wasting disease affects the central nervous system and ultimately results in the death of infected animals.
the forest service authorizes use of the national forest feedgrounds by the state of wyoming through a special use permitting system pursuant to.the state of wyoming operates the feedgrounds.at the time gyc brought this action,only four of the national forest feedgrounds,alkali,dell creek,upper green river,and forest park,had special use permits.the permits for the other four feedgrounds,fish creek,dog creek,muddy creek,and fall creek,had expired.in addition,three of the feedgrounds,dell creek,upper green river,and muddy creek,had never been subject to an environmental analysis the most recent environmental analysis of any of the five other feedgrounds occurred in.of these five environmental analyses,only two discussed wildlife disease.neither contained any discussion of chronic wasting disease.
like the forest service,blm allows the state of wyoming to operate feedgrounds on certain federal lands.in,blm and wyoming entered into a memorandum of understanding mou regarding wyoming use of blm lands for elk feedgrounds.no land use permits were issued for the use of this federal land.the only environmental analysis of the feedgrounds was prepared in connection with the mou.the environmental analysis did not consider any impacts of the feedgrounds.
on november,gyc sent a letter to the forest service and blm alleging various nepa and federal regulatory violations based upon the lack of permits and environmental analyses for the feedgrounds.when the agencies did not take the actions requested by gyc to remedy these violations,gyc filed a petition for review of agency action in the united states district court for the district of wyoming against various forest service and blm officials.the state of wyoming and the wyoming stock grower association were granted intervention as of right as respondents by the district court.
before the district court,gyc alleged the forest service was required under nepa to conduct environmental analyses of its eight feedgrounds and the program,and failed to do so the forest service authorization of certain facilities for operations and the program without issuing permits violated the agency special use permitting regulations and blm authorization of facilities for violated blm own permitting regulations and the lack of current environmental analyses of the feedgrounds violated nepa.gyc asked the court to award injunctive relief requiring respondents to undertake environmental analyses of the feedgrounds and enjoining authorization of the program until an environmental analysis of the program occurred.
on august,the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order rejecting gyc claims.first,with respect to the forest service feedgrounds for which permits existed,the district court refused to compel supplemental environmental analyses because it concluded the major federal action was completed when the permits were issued.second,with respect to the forest service feedgrounds without permits,the district court concluded gyc lacked standing to raise a nepa challenge and there was no final agency action sufficient to raise a claim under the administrative procedure act.third,with respect to the program at the muddy creek feedground,the district court concluded gyc lacked standing on the permitting claim and the nepa claim failed because the forest service authorization of the facilities was not a major federal action.finally,with respect to the blm feedgrounds,the district court rejected gyc permitting and nepa claims,concluding blm adequately authorized the feedgrounds pursuant to the mou.
on appeal,gyc seeks review of the agencies decisions not to conduct the requested new or supplemental environmental analyses of the feedgrounds.gyc also seeks to enjoin use of the facilities until an environmental analysis is undertaken and requiring the forest service and blm to undertake environmental analyses of the twelve wyoming feedgrounds.after the briefs were filed in this appeal,the forest service granted permits authorizing wyoming to use the four previously feedgrounds,including the program at muddy creek,for winter elk management activity in connection with the authorizations,the forest service undertook an environmental analysis of the alkali creek,fish creek,fall creek,muddy creek including the program,dog creek,and upper green river feedgrounds.the environmental analysis considered the risks and impacts of brucellosis and chronic wasting disease.
iii.discussion 
gyc brings its claims pursuant to,the judicial review provision of the administrative procedure act,which allows courts to review agency action and compel agency action unlawfully withheld.the district court exercised jurisdiction over the claims pursuant to.this court reviews the district court decision de novo.cattle growers ass fish wildlife,cir.we will not set aside an agency decision unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.utah envtl.congress russell,cir quotation omitted a.
respondents argue gyc claims as to the alkali creek,fish creek,fall creek,muddy creek,dog creek,and upper green river feedgrounds became moot in july when the environmental analysis of these feedgrounds was issued.gyc argues the claims fall within the voluntary cessation exception to the mootness doctrine.
under article iii of the constitution,federal courts may adjudicate only actual,ongoing cases or controversies.lewis cont l bank,d.to qualify as a case fit for adjudication,an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review,not merely at the time the complaint is filed.arizonans for official english arizona,d quotation omitted.if a party to an appeal suggests that the controversy has,since the rendering of judgment below,become moot,that party bears the burden of coming forward with the subsequent events that have produced that alleged result.cardinal chem.morton int l,d.vacatur is in order when mootness occurs through the unilateral action of the party who prevailed in the lower court.arizonans for official english,at.quotation omitted.
an exception to the mootness doctrine can occur when a defendant voluntarily ceases a challenged action.arw exploration aguirre,cir.this exception traces to the principle that a party should not be able to evade judicial review,or to defeat a judgment,by temporarily altering questionable behavior.city news novelty,city of waukesha,d.thus,the voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not render a case moot unless there is no reasonable expectation the wrong will be repeated.longstreth maynard,cir.
gyc brought this action alleging the lack of environmental analyses for the six feedgrounds in question violated nepa.gyc sought to compel the forest service to undertake environmental analyses of the feedgrounds,including the program at muddy creek,to address current disease risks.the forest service did exactly this in its july environmental analysis.thus,no live controversy exists with regard to these feedgrounds.
as to gyc contention that the forest service actions fall within the voluntary cessation exception to the mootness doctrine,there is no reasonable expectation the alleged wrongs involving the six feedgrounds in question will be repeated.the forest service has issued an environmental analysis addressing the threat of disease at these feedgrounds.it is thus impossible for the forest service to return to its allegedly illegal conduct of failing to conduct an environmental analysis addressing the brucellosis and chronic wasting disease risks at these feedgrounds.because these issues became moot as a result of the unilateral activity of the forest service,however,vacatur is appropriate.see arizonans for official english,at.we therefore vacate the portions of the district court ruling addressing the six feedgrounds assessed in the july environmental analysis.
b.the forest park and dell creek forest service feedgrounds 
gyc has live claims as to the forest park and dell creek forest service feedgrounds.nepa requires an environmental analysis of a project when the federal government involvement in the project is sufficient to constitute major federal action.vill.of los ranchos de albuquerque barnhart,cir quoting c.major federal action includes actions with effects that may be major and which are potentially subject to federal control and responsibility.
forest park 
the last environmental analysis of the forest park feedground occurred in.under c,agencies s hall prepare supplements to either draft or final environmental impact statements if i the agency makes substantial changes in the proposed action that are relevant to environmental concerns or ii there are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts.the supreme court has addressed the issue of when an agency must undertake a supplemental environmental analysis in the context of relevant new information or circumstances.if there remains major federal action to occur,and if the new information is sufficient to show that the remaining action will affect the quality of the human environment in a significant manner or to a significant extent not already considered,a supplemental environmental analysis must be prepared.marsh or.natural res.council,d emphasis added quotations omitted.
gyc contends circumstances have changed since the forest park environmental analysis as a result of the discovery of the brucellosis and chronic wasting disease threats at feedgrounds,and thus the forest service must undertake a supplemental analysis to address these changes.the forest service points out that the duty to supplement an environmental analysis under nepa ends after the major federal action is completed,and alleges the major federal action here was completed when the permit was issued.according to gyc,however,the elk feeding activities constitute an ongoing major federal action under nepa because the forest park permit states it may be amended in whole or in part by the forest service when,at the discretion of the authorized officer,such action is deemed necessary or desirable to incorporate new terms,conditions,and stipulations as may be required by law,regulation,land management plans,or other management decisions.
in norton southern utah wilderness alliance,the supreme court considered whether there was major federal action to occur or ongoing major federal action when allegedly new circumstances arose after blm approved a land use plan for federal lands it administered in utah,d.generally,a land use plan describes,for a particular area,allowable uses,goals for future condition of the land,and specific next steps.id.at.after noting that the secretary may issue management decisions to implement land use plans,the court concluded there was no ongoing major federal action or major federal action to occur.id.at.quotation omitted.the court distinguished an earlier case where it concluded a major federal action was not yet complete,explaining that in the earlier case 
that condition was met the dam construction project that gave rise to environmental review was not yet completed.here,by contrast,although the approval of a land use plan is a major federal action requiring an eis that action is completed when the plan is approved.the land use plan is the proposed action contemplated by nepa.there is no ongoing major federal action that could require supplementation 
id.at.discussing marsh,at.
here,the forest service approval and issuance of the forest park permit,like blm approval of the land use plan in norton,was the major federal action contemplated by nepa.under norton,that major federal action was completed when the permit was approved and issued.see also cold mountain garber,cir concluding no supplemental analysis was required for a facility operated by the state of montana on federal land pursuant to a forest service permit because the forest service nepa obligations ended when the permit was issued and approved.it is important to note the relevant nepa provisions expressly apply only to federal action.c.since issuance of the permit,the forest service has remained largely uninvolved in the operations of the feedground.that the forest service retains discretion to amend the permit does not alone lead to the conclusion there is ongoing major federal action or major federal action to occur.while the forest service could potentially amend the permit in such a manner as to constitute a major federal action,there is no allegation this has occurred.because the state of wyoming remains the only meaningful actor involved in the operation of the forest park feedground,there is no ongoing major federal action or major federal action to occur.thus,the forest service decision not to undertake an environmental analysis of the forest park feedground was not arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.we therefore affirm the district court denial of gyc request to compel an environmental analysis of the forest park feedground.
dell creek 
the forest service has never conducted an environmental analysis of the dell creek feedground.nepa implementing regulations state major federal actions may include new and continuing activities,including projects and programs entirely or partly financed,assisted,conducted,regulated,or approved by federal agencies.a.because gyc challenge to the forest service initial failure to conduct an environmental analysis of the dell creek feedground would presumably be barred by the relevant statute of limitations gyc argues the forest service involvement with the dell creek feedground is a continuing federal activity that satisfies the definition provided in a of a major federal action.this is so,according to gyc,because like the forest park permit,the dell creek permit provides the forest service may amend the permit when,at the discretion of the authorized officer,such action is deemed necessary or desirable to incorporate new terms,conditions,and stipulations.
in support of this argument,gyc relies primarily on two cases.in hart denver urban renewal authority,the united states department of housing and urban development hud entered into a loan and capital grant contract prior to nepa enactment,cir.this contract required hud to approve all acquisitions and dispositions of property.id.at.this court concluded hud handling of a certain structure within the project,which included treating this building separately in its negotiations and administratively as evidenced by the fact it was not demolished and has been contracted to be sold as a separate structure,was continuing federal action constituting a major federal action.id.at.
gyc relies heavily on this court statement in hart that,as long as agency decisions remain to be made or are open to revision,nepa should be applied.id.at.this statement,however,merely summarizes the holdings of two cases from other circuits in which the courts also were faced with whether or not to apply nepa to major agency actions ongoing at the time nepa became effective.id.the courts in those cases concluded that for projects ongoing at the time of nepa passage,congress intended nepa to apply unless the project had reached a stage of completion such that nepa application could be considered a retroactive application not intended by congress.swain brinegar,cir arlington coal.on transp.volpe,cir.contrary to gyc assertion,instead of merely considering whether there were agency decisions yet to be made or open to revision,this court in hart went on to identify the key inquiry in the analysis whether the actual,not potential,involvement of the federal government to date in the activity constituted a major federal action.see hart,at.
in the second case relied upon by gyc,morris county trust for historic preservation pierce,hud approved an urban renewal plan and entered into a loan and capital grant contract,again prior to the passage of nepa,cir.the contract required the local public agency to furnish hud promptly with documentary data concerning any proposed actions of the local agency pertaining to the project and authorized hud to inform the local agency in writing of its objection to a proposed step,and to refuse a requested payment if the agency proceeds without securing the prior approval of the secretary of hud.id.at.it was alleged that hud failed to comply with nepa because it never undertook an environmental analysis of the project.id.at.hud argued its inaction did not violate nepa because the effective date of nepa succeeded the signing of the contract and the approval of the urban renewal plan.id.after noting the district court finding that hud has remained meaningfully involved in the project,the court concluded nepa should be applicable to projects like the one in question which were initiated prior to but which remain subject to the authority of a federal agency to review the implementation of the project on a stage by stage basis.id.emphasis added.thus,like this court in hart,in reaching its conclusion the court analyzed the actual degree of ongoing federal involvement in the project.id.
the cases cited by gyc stand only for the proposition that if an agency began a project prior to the passage of nepa,that alone would not shield the agency from nepa compliance if the agency remained meaningfully involved in the project after nepa became effective.they are not,however,authority for the existence of a major federal action merely because an agency retains a degree of discretion in a project.the district court was thus correct when it opined that it would be a stretch to use these cases to stand for the proposition gyc desires.the projects in the cases cited by gyc involved continuing meaningful federal agency involvement at various stages.here,however,the state of wyoming manages the feedground and there is nothing in the permit mandating continuing,involvement of the forest service.
more relevant to this analysis is norton southern utah wilderness alliance,d.while norton involved the question of whether there was ongoing major federal action or major federal action to occur in a federally approved activity so as to require a supplementary environmental analysis,id.at,the court analysis is certainly relevant to the issue of whether there is a continuing federal action requiring an initial environmental analysis.in norton,although the secretary retained discretion to issue management decisions to implement the land use plan in question,the court held that the federal action was completed when the plan was approved.id.at.this holding indicates that,as with the forest park permit,the major federal action was completed when the forest service issued the dell creek permit in,and was not continuing see cold mountain garber,at.thus,the forest service decision not to undertake an environmental analysis of the dell creek feedground was not arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.we therefore affirm the district court denial of gyc request to compel an environmental analysis of the dell creek feedground.
c.the blm feedgrounds 
in,blm and wyoming entered into an mou.the mou stated its purpose was to recognize and coordinate management of those winter elk feeding programs which impact federal surface mineral estates in sublette county,wyoming.the agreement set forth the objectives and operating procedures of both agencies.blm agreed to a uthorize,through legal authority and this memorandum,the continued use of existing facilities falling on public lands by wyoming.it also agreed to a llow wyoming to maintain,reconstruct,or construct access roads,trails,facilities,as mutually deemed necessary by blm and wyoming.an environmental analysis of the feedgrounds was prepared in connection with the mou.
gyc claims nepa demands an environmental analysis of disease threats related to the four blm elk feedgrounds.gyc argues blm failure to issue permits for the use of the affected federal lands in contravention of constitutes major federal action triggering nepa requirements pursuant to the failure to act language of.respondents contend the district court correctly determined the mou was rightfully undertaken in lieu of the permitting procedures required by,and thus the failure to issue permits is not a major federal action requiring an environmental analysis.resolution of the issue depends primarily on the relationship between a provision of the federal land policy and management act of flpma,b,and blm permitting regulations for uses of the public lands at.
provides in relevant part 
b contracts and cooperative agreements 
subject to the provisions of applicable law,the secretary may enter into contracts and cooperative agreements involving the management,protection,development,and sale of public lands.
provide in relevant part 
authorized use 
any use not specifically authorized under other laws or regulations and not specifically forbidden by law may be authorized under this part.uses which may be authorized include residential,agricultural,industrial,and commercial,and uses that can not be authorized under title v of flpma land use authorizations shall be granted under the following categories 
b permits shall be used to authorize uses of public lands for not to exceed years that involve either little or no land improvement,construction,or investment 
unauthorized use 
a any use,occupancy,or development of the public lands,other than casual use as defined in k of this title,without authorization under the procedures in of this title,shall be considered a trespass.
according to gyc,because agreements authorized under b are subject to the provisions of applicable law,
