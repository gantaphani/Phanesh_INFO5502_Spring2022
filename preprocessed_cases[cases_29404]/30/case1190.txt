this case involves department of energy doe order,together with its manual and implementation guide,which provide among other things a process for determining whether certain radioactive waste streams are waste incidental to reprocessing that are not considered waste.the natural resources defense council,and the snake river alliance collectively,nrdc filed a petition for review in this court to set aside doe order.nrdc contends that the evaluation method adopted in the order,manual and guide redefines radioactive waste as or transuranic waste,contrary to the nuclear waste policy act of nwpa,and allows doe,rather than the environmental protection agency epa and the nuclear regulatory commission nrc,to determine whether to leave this reprocessing waste in nuclear waste storage tanks at doe hanford reservation,savannah river,and idaho national engineering laboratory sites 
as nrdc invokes our original jurisdiction pursuant to nwpa,a,we must first decide whether this is an agency decision over which a confers original and exclusive jurisdiction in the courts of appeals.nwpa judicial review provisions are not a model of clarity.however,we conclude that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because doe order pertains to management of radioactive waste at federal defense facilities and is not a decision under nwpa.accordingly,we shall transfer this petition to the district court for the district of idaho.
nrdc submits that review of doe order falls within a a.section a is nwpa provision for judicial review,and subsection a states 
the united states courts of appeals shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action 
a for review of any final decision or action of the secretary,the president,or the commission under this part 
this part part a of subchapter nwpa is entitled repositories for disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel.subchapter i is captioned disposal and storage of radioactive waste,spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste.part a establishes procedures for disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel in repositories,now sited solely at yucca mountain,nevada.see nevada department of energy,cir.the purposes of this part are to establish a schedule for siting,constructing and operating repositories to establish the federal responsibility for disposal of civilian waste and spent fuel to define the relationship between the federal government and state governments with respect to disposal of such waste and spent fuel and to establish a nuclear waste fund,composed of payments made by generators and owners of such waste.b.hanford,savannah and the idaho national engineering laboratory are federal facilities where waste is generated and stored they nwpa,and are not repositories.for these reasons,doe maintains that nwpa does not govern its waste management decisions at these installations thus,doe order is not a decision under nwpa that is subject to judicial review within this court original jurisdiction.
in the nwpa,congress created a comprehensive scheme for the interim storage and permanent disposal of radioactive waste generated by civilian nuclear power plants.indiana michigan power department of energy.section a provides that nwpa does not apply to any atomic energy defense activity or facility nrdc acknowledges that nwpa does not require defense waste to be disposed in a repository,but points out that it does require the president to evaluate potential methods for disposing of such waste.b.because the president determined on april,that a separate facility was not necessary for defense waste,nrdc notes that doe only has authority for disposal of defense wastes at yucca mountain 
while this may be true,doe order addresses management of wastes at doe facilities.the authority to do so comes from the atomic energy act aea,et the energy reorganization act era,stat,codified at et and the department of energy organization act deo,stat,codified at et.
the aea,enacted in,established a comprehensive regulatory scheme for military and domestic nuclear energy.it authorized the atomic energy commission aec now doe and establish instructions by rule,regulation,or order,governing possession and use of nuclear material and the operation of facilities used in conducting its activities when the aec was abolished in,its functions were transferred to the energy research and development agency erda,doe predecessor agency,and to the nrc.see energy reorganization act of era,stat,codified at.under the era,nrc was given commercial licensing and related regulatory functions the erda took over the rest of aec functions,except that the nrc must license erda facilities that are authorized for subsequent storage of radioactive waste generated by the administration.as the senate committee explained,i t is not the intent of the committee to require licensing of such storage facilities which are already in existence,reprinted in see also natural resources defense council,nuclear regulatory commission.in,congress abolished erda and transferred its functions to doe.see deo,a,stat,codified at a.this left control over existing government facilities and defense nuclear waste in doe.see a a,b,c,and e 
doe order was promulgated in accordance with the aea to replace a previous doe order on radioactive waste management,doe o a,and applies to the management of all waste,transuranic waste,and waste for which doe is responsible.it is not a decision about the siting of a repository,establishing federal responsibility for disposal of civilian radioactive waste,defining the relationship between the federal government and state governments with respect to disposal of such waste and spent fuel,or establishing a nuclear waste fund under part a of subchapter i of nwpa.see b.nor is doe order a decision under any other part of subchapter i,or of any other subchapter of nwpa therefore,this action does not seek review of any decision that is directly under this part.
nrdc does not argue otherwise rather,it posits that the manual and guide accompanying doe order state that all waste must be disposed pursuant to the nwpa.the manual provides that d isposal of waste must be in accordance with the provisions of the atomic energy act of,as amended,the nuclear waste policy act of,as amended,or any other applicable statutes.doe m at.the guide observes that b ackground and knowledge of both the nuclear waste policy act of,as amended,definition and the nuclear regulatory commission definition,at cfr part,is needed to ensure that waste that is to be managed as waste has been properly characterized to be waste.doe g at.from these statements nrdc infers that the nwpa is necessarily implicated whenever waste is disposed,and the aea does not exclusively control doe disposal of defense waste.
whether or not this is so,it does not follow that doe was making a decision under part a of nwpa for purposes of this court original jurisdiction over nrdc action.any other be implicated by a decision that is not under it for purposes of subject matter jurisdiction.
nrdc also points to nwpa overarching purpose of establishing federal policy for safely disposing of all wastes,a and contends that nwpa should be broadly construed to enfold any kind of disposal of waste.in its view,this would bring the order incidental waste process under the jurisdiction of the act because no matter what it is called,the waste continues to be waste resulting from reprocessing that must be disposed in accordance with nwpa.nrdc further suggests that reading the judicial review provision in nwpa to apply to the entire act,as the court did in general electric uranium management department of energy,compels us to take jurisdiction of this case.we disagree.
general electric arose in the quite different context of a doe rule establishing the basis upon which the agency would compute a fee for fuel spent to generate electricity prior to april.nwpa established a nuclear waste fund and specifically prescribed a fee for electricity generated by spent nuclear fuel.a.however,the provision for a fee is not within the same part as the judicial review provision and the subchapter of which it is a part itsel
