when a city council receives a voter initiative petition meeting elections code requirements,it must do one of three things adopt the initiative without alteration submit it to a special election or order an abbreviated report on the initiative.upon receipt of the report,it must then either adopt the initiative or hold a special election.several cases have held that provisions of the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et do not apply to land use initiatives proposed by voters and adopted at an election.in such cases,the abbreviated report provided for in the elections code furnishes the exclusive means of obtaining environmental review.see,devita county of napa cal th,d,devita stein city of santa monica d.stein.
the question here is whether the result should be different if a city chooses to directly adopt a initiative rather than hold a special election.the court of appeal distinguished between these two courses of action and held that a city may not adopt a voter initiative with potential environmental impacts unless it conducts a full ceqa analysis.the language and legislative history behind the elections code statutes do not support this interpretation.accordingly,the judgment is reversed.
background 
the relevant facts are undisputed.wal mart stores,wal mart operates a square foot store in the city of sonora city.in,wal mart sought to expand its store by approximately square feet.the new wal mart supercenter would sell groceries and be open hours every day.in december,the city circulated for public comment a draft environmental impact report eir for the expansion.after a hearing,the city planning commission unanimously recommended that the eir be certified and the project approved.
less than a week later,before the project was called for a vote,the city council council was served with a notice of intent to circulate an initiative petition.the wal mart initiative proposed to adopt a specific plan for the contemplated expansion.its apparent purpose was to streamline approval for construction and operation of the supercenter.the council postponed its vote while the initiative petition circulated.the petition was ultimately signed by over percent of the city registered voters.
on september,the council ordered that a section report be prepared to examine the initiative consistency with previous planning commission approvals for the wal mart expansion.at its next meeting,the council considered this report and countervailing arguments.after weighing its options,the council adopted the ordinance.
the tuolumne jobs small business alliance tjsba then sought a writ of mandate based on four causes of action.the petition first claim,which is the subject of this appeal,asserted that the council violated ceqa by adopting the ordinance without first conducting a complete environmental review.tjsba also challenged the validity of the initiative itself,on the grounds that it conflicted with the city general plan,improperly limited the city legislative power,and was impermissibly administrative,rather than legislative,in nature.
wal mart,the city,and initiative proponent james grinnell demurred.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to all causes of action except tjsba claim that the initiative improperly conflicted with the general plan.tjsba challenged these adverse rulings by writ petition in the court of appeal.that court granted the writ as to the first cause of action,holding that when a land use ordinance is proposed in a voter initiative petition,full ceqa review is required if the city council adopts the ordinance rather than submitting it to an election.it expressly disagreed with the only published authority on point,native american sacred site environmental protection city of san juan capistrano th,d.we granted review.
ii.discussion 
this case explores the intersection between the constitutional power of voters to enact laws by initiative and the environmental review generally required for laws potentially having a significant environmental impact.because we must decide a city government obligations in adopting a land use initiative proposed by voters we begin our analysis with the laws governing initiatives.
elections code provides the exclusive procedures for voter initiatives.
in,californians amended our constitution,reserving to themselves the powers of initiative and referendum.cal,art.iv,associated home builders,city of livermore cal d,associated home builders.voter initiatives have been compared to a legislative battering ram because they may be used to tear through the exasperating tangle of the traditional legislative procedure and strike directly toward the desired end.amador valley joint union high sch.dist.state bd.of equalization cal d.in light of the initiative power significance in our democracy,courts have a duty to jealously guard this right of the people and must preserve the use of an initiative if doubts can be reasonably resolved in its favor.associated home builders,at,see amador valley,at.
the legislature was authorized to establish procedures for city and county voters to exercise their right of initiative.cal,art.ii,associated home builders,supra,cal d at.it has done so.in contrast to statewide initiatives,which may be placed directly on the ballot,the legislature created an indirect process for city and county initiatives.these can only be submitted to voters if they have been presented to,but not enacted by,the local legislative body.thompson board of supervisors d.the intent of the legislature in granting solely indirect initiative power to voters at the county level was to create the opportunity to spare the expense of a public vote.citation,fn.omitted.
the procedures for municipal voter initiatives are found in section et under section when a local body receives an initiative petition signed by at least percent of the city registered voters,it must adopt the initiative,without alteration,within days after the petition is presented immediately submit the initiative to a vote at a special election or order a report pursuant to section.the report may examine the proposed initiative effects on land use,infrastructure,and a ny other matters the legislative body requests be included,subd.a.if ordered,the report must be prepared and presented within days after the petition was certified as satisfying the signature requirement,subd.b.within days after receiving the report,the legislative body must either adopt the ordinance or order an election pursuant to section b.c.
it is well established that ceqa compliance is not required before a legislative body submits an initiative to voters under section b.see devita,supra,cal th at,d,stein,supra,d at.the question here is whether the result should be different in the direct adoption context.that is,must the legislative body obtain full ceqa review before it may directly adopt a voter initiative under section a the answer is no.because ceqa review is contrary to the statutory language and legislative history pertaining to voter initiatives,and because policy considerations do not compel a different result,such review is not required before adoption of a voter initiative.a section report is the exclusive means for assessing the potential environmental impact of such initiatives.
statutory language precludes application of ceqa.
our primary task in interpreting a statute is to determine the legislature intent,giving effect to the law purpose.in re greg cal th,d,greg.we consider first the words of a statute,as the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.pineda williams sonoma stores,cal th,d.words must be construed in context,and statutes must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.citation.interpretations that lead to absurd results or render words surplusage are to be avoided.citation.citation.people loeun cal th,d.
the language of section makes no mention of ceqa.although this fact alone is not dispositive,the statutory language does not support imposing a ceqa requirement on the direct adoption procedures in section a.
requiring ceqa review before direct adoption would essentially nullify both subdivisions a and c.the plain language of section requires that city governments act quickly to either adopt a qualified voter initiative or hold a special election.a b.the only other option is to order a report exploring potential impacts of the initiative.c see.this report can only provide an abbreviated review because it must be produced within days after the initiative certification.b.once the city receives the report,it must either adopt the initiative within days or immediately order a special election.c.these short deadlines are consistent with other deadlines requiring public officials to act expeditiously on initiatives.for example,once a proposed initiative is filed,the city attorney has only days to prepare a ballot title and summary,and elections officials have only days to verify signatures on the petition.
in contrast to these condensed deadlines,ceqa review typically takes months.the process starts with a preliminary review,in which the lead agency has days to determine whether the proposed activity constitutes a p roject subject to ceqa.pub,tit.if the activity is a project,and not exempt from ceqa,the lead agency must next conduct an initial study to determine whether the activity may have a significant effect on the environment.regs.tit.depending on the extent and significance of potential environmental impacts identified in the initial study,the agency must prepare either an eir,a mitigated negative declaration,or a negative declaration,subds.c,d,tit.even if the lead agency determines a project is unlikely to have a significant environmental effect,ceqa requires public notice and a minimum of to days for public comment before a negative declaration can be adopted,subd.b.if an eir is required,the lead agency must notify all responsible agencies and the state office of planning and research.these agencies then have days to specify the scope and content of information to be included.pub,tit.with this input,the lead agency prepares a draft eir,and circulates it for public review and comment pub,tit.the time required to prepare a full eir varies.the public review period must be at least days,subd.a.the lead agency must then prepare written responses to the public comments and incorporate the comments and responses into a final eir,subd.d,tit.if significant information is added,the eir must be recirculated for another round of public review and comment before issuance of a final eir,tit.
considering the time necessary for agencies to review the potential environmental impacts of a project and allow public review and comment,it would be impossible for a city to complete ceqa review within days before adopting a voter initiative.a.although this period can be extended to days if the city obtains a section report,under no circumstances can a city delay action on a voter initiative beyond days.the deadlines in section are mandatory.as a result,if prior ceqa review is required,a city could never adopt a voter initiative under section a if that initiative had any potential impact on the environment.direct adoption would be severely curtailed and,for many initiatives,no longer an option,because it would be impossible for cities to comply with both ceqa and the section deadlines.devita,supra,cal th at,d,irreconcilable deadlines make it impossible to conduct ceqa review before holding election on a voter initiative.
requiring ceqa compliance before direct adoption would thus effectively nullify section a for all voter initiatives with potential environmental impact.it is a maxim of statutory interpretation that courts should give meaning to every word of a statute and should avoid constructions that would render any word or provision surplusage.california teachers governing bd.of rialto unified school dist.cal th,d,see people shabazz cal th,d.an interpretation that renders statutory language a nullity is obviously to be avoided.williams superior court cal th,d.adding ceqa review to the procedures in section a would render that provision inoperative for a great many voter initiatives.the impact also spreads beyond subdivision a.if full ceqa review were required before an initiative could be adopted,the abbreviated report provided for by sections and c would be superfluous.cities could still obtain such a report,of course.but,despite the plain language of section c allowing direct adoption,cities only practical option after obtaining a report would be to submit the initiative to an election.moreover,if a city undertook full ceqa review of a voter initiative,the more cursory review available under section would be duplicative and unnecessary.
the legislature is presumed to be aware of all laws in existence when it passes or amends a statute.citations.greg,supra,cal th at,d.when the legislature enacted ceqa in,the statutory procedures for enacting voter initiatives were firmly in place,having been codified at section a for nearly years.if the legislature had intended to require ceqa review before direct adoption,despite the section a deadlines,it could have easily said so.it did not.
moreover,although ceqa is the later enacted and arguably more specific statute,a conclusion that ceqa prevails over contrary elections code procedures would impliedly repeal section a.there is a strong presumption against repeal by implication.people park cal th,d.absent an express declaration of legislative intent,we will find an implied repeal only when there is no rational basis for harmonizing the two potentially conflicting statutes citation,and the statutes are irreconcilable,clearly repugnant,and so inconsistent that the two can not have concurrent operation.citation.citation.merrill navegar,cal th,d.courts have also noted that implied repeal should not be found unless the later provision gives undebatable evidence of an intent to supersede the earlier citation.western oil gas monterey bay unified air pollution control dist.cal d.evidence that the legislature intended ceqa to supersede direct adoption procedures is completely lacking.the legislative scheme accommodates the concerns underlying ceqa by providing abbreviated review under sections and c.see post,at.moreover,because the timelines for initiatives and ceqa review are fundamentally incompatible,a requirement of ceqa review before direct adoption would leave local governments no choice but to submit most initiatives to election.then,no additional environmental review would result.
finally,even if time constraints permitted ceqa review,cities would be powerless to reject the proposed project or to require alterations in the project that would lessen its environmental impact,no matter what the review showed.section requires that local governments either adopt qualified initiatives or submit them to voters without alteration.furthermore,initiatives adopted by a local government or voters may not be repealed or amended except by vote of the people,unless the initiative provides otherwise.
application of ceqa to voter initiatives is contrary to legislative intent.
to the extent statutory language is ambiguous or open to more than one reasonable interpretation,we may turn to legislative history for guidance.murphy kenneth cole productions,cal th,d.here,legislative history confirms that ordinances enacted by initiative,either directly or by election,are not subject to ceqa review.
devita,supra,cal th at pages,d,discussed two assembly bills that would have subjected initiative measures to environmental review.one would have required environmental review after the approval of any initiative that proposed activity constituting a project under ceqa.the initiative could then take effect only upon filing of an eir or other ceqa document.see devita,at,d,discussing assem.bill reg.sess,as introduced.another bill would have required an extensive environmental review and economic analysis by the governor office of planning and research before any local land use initiative could be submitted to voters.see devita,at,d,discussing assem.bill reg.sess.neither bill was enacted.devita,at,d.
although proposed legislation may fail for many reasons,and only limited inferences can be drawn when a bill fails se
