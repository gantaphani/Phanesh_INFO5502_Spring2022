dan reddell filed a petition for a writ of administrative and ordinary mandate and a complaint for damages and equitable relief against the california coastal commission commission.reddell sought an order requiring the commission to set aside its decision denying him a coastal development permit under the california coastal act pub,et coastal act the trial court denied the petition for writ of mandate and dismissed the complaint.we affirm.
statement of facts and procedural history 
the city of morro bay approved permits to allow a residential and commercial development on six lots on the bluffs above the city,in an area zoned for commercial uses.the project as approved by the city consisted of a three and mixed use building,with six commercial spaces on the ground floor and six residences on the upper floors.each residence has a garage,but no provision is made for parking for the commercial spaces.reddell offered to pay an parking fee to provide parking.the ratio of residential to commercial floor space is greater than.
in approving the project,the city applied an exemption for projects with a planned development overlay,which allows modification of or exemption from the development standards of the primary zone if it would result in better design or other public benefit.the city found the development would provide underground utilities,public sidewalks and,and the opportunity to master plan a development on six lots.
a third party filed a timely appeal of the decision to the commission pursuant to the coastal act.the appeal asserted that the project violates the city local coastal plan lcp and the coastal act because it is inconsistent with the designated zoning,has inadequate parking,violates height restrictions for development,and will block public views,lcp policies a.
on march,commission staff submitted a report for a hearing to be held on april.the staff report stated that the project approved by the city raised a substantial issue regarding conformance with policies in the city lcp regarding public views,neighborhood compatibility,primary zoning,parking,and bluff development.in meetings with staff,reddell proposed revisions to the project that would remove the fourth floor and increase some setbacks on the upper floors.the report noted the revisions proposed by reddell would not make the project consistent with the lcp.staff recommended that the commission approve the project with conditions designed to resolve issues regarding visual resources,neighborhood compatibility,parking,and consistency with underlying zoning.
at the hearing,a presentation was made by a representative of the development.her presentation included a slide show including the revisions proposed by reddell to reduce the height and scale of the building.she stated that the project came within the height limitation in the commercial zone and met the standards for bluff development in the city zoning code.she also stated that calculation of the ratio should not include the garage area.she pointed out that there were nine projects within a three block radius of the project site,and the project was in character with the community.reddell added a brief comment requesting approval of the project as revised.
a letter from the city mayor in favor of the project was read into the record.numerous residents spoke in opposition to the project.reddell representative responded to criticisms of the project.she pointed out that some of the slides showing a simulation of the building project were taken with a telephoto lens which distorted its height and bulk.she added that with the revisions proposed by reddell,the project would meet lcp and coastal act standards.
following the presentation,each commissioner commented on the project.they expressed concerns regarding the ratio of commercial to residential uses,lack of parking,and the height and scale of the project.the commission rejected the recommendation of staff that the project be approved with conditions,and voted unanimously to deny the project as inconsistent with the city lcp policies with respect to bluff development,visual resources,parking,priorities,and community character.
on june,the commission adopted revised findings prepared by staff supporting denial of the project.prior to the commission adoption of the revised findings,reddell submitted a lengthy written rebuttal to the proposed findings,including revised photographic simulations that corrected the purportedly distorted photographs presented earlier.
on june,reddell filed a petition for writ of administrative and ordinary mandate and a complaint for damages alleging violation of his right to due process and equal protection,and a regulatory taking of property.upon stipulation of the parties,the petition was severed from the complaint for hearing.the trial court denied the petition and subsequently granted the commission motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed the complaint.
on appeal,reddell contends the commission exceeded its jurisdiction because it approved the wrong project,misinterpreted lcp policies,and made findings that were not supported by substantial evidence.he also asserts the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint because his claim for damages survives denial of the petition for writ of mandate.
discussion 
standard of review 
in reviewing a decision denying a petition for administrative mandate,our role is identical to that of the trial court.we review the administrative record to determine whether the commission findings are supported by substantial evidence,california coastal com.th,d.to the extent the case involves the interpretation of a statute,which is a question of law,we engage in a de novo review of the trial court determination.ibid.courts may reverse an agency decision only if,based on the evidence before the agency,a reasonable person could not reach the conclusion reached by the agency.la costa beach homeowners california coastal com.th,d.
coastal commission regulatory authority 
in charles pratt const,california coastal com.th,d pratt,we described the regulatory hierarchy imposed by the coastal act.under the coastal act legislative scheme,the lcp and the development permits issued by local agencies pursuant to the coastal act are not solely a matter of local law,but embody state policy.the commission primary responsibility is the implementation of the coastal act.it is designated the state coastal zone planning and management agency for any and all purposes.once the commission certifies the lcp and all implementing actions become effective,the commission authority over coastal development permits is delegated to the local government,subd.a.t he commission has appellate jurisdiction to determine whether the development permit issued by the local government is consistent with the lcp and coastal access policies,subd.b.
although local governments have the authority to issue coastal development permits,that authority is delegated by the commission.the commission has the ultimate authority to ensure that coastal development conforms to the policies embodied in the state coastal act.in fact,a fundamental purpose of the coastal act is to ensure that state policies prevail over the concerns of local government.citation.the commission applies state law and policies to determine whether the development permit complies with the lcp.id.at,d.
the commission interpretation of lcp and coastal act provisions is reasonable,and substantial evidence supports its decision 
priorities 
the project is located within a commercial district with a planned development pd and special design criteria overlay.reddell asserts the commission erred in finding the project did not meet zoning standards and policies related to priorities.he contends in the alternative that the project is entitled to an exemption from zoning requirements because,as the city found,it will provide greater than normal public benefits.
the commission found in part the total amount of floor area space dedicated to commercial uses is square feet or roughly of the total enclosed building area.roughly square feet is dedicated to residential living space and another square feet for enclosed residential garages.there is also more than square feet of residential balconies,porches,walks,and decks proposed.though there are not any specific size limits for residential units in the district,the current ratio of residential to commercial use is more than.gross structural coverage attributed to the residential use approaches 
t he development is not consistent with the underlying zoning standard that allows a single apartment unit or security quarters only when secondary to permitted commercial uses and located on the rear of a lot or upper story.applicant suggests that establishing secondary uses is as simple as determining that all uses will be located on the second floor.the applicant fails to observe that the standard has two criteria and clearly states the residential use must be secondary and located on the rear of the lot or upper story,indicating that secondary implies some additional limitation on residential use.the descriptive terms single apartment unit or security quarter also imply a small residential unit.secondary uses as it is interpreted within the context of the entire standard,implies that they are inferior or subordinate to primary uses similarly,with respect to height and massing,the residential uses are not subordinate.even with respect to provision of parking,the residential uses are not subordinate to the commercial aspects of the project.
the city approval includes an exemption from the height limit for development within the commercial zone.in justifying the need to invoke the pd exemptions,the city found that the project provided an opportunity to master plan six parcels at once and obtain all of the street frontage improvements at the same time.the city also cited the project site design and creative architecture,agreement to underground utilities,as well as an opportunity to advance community goals promoting development that it believes will draw tourists from the embarcadero to the downtown area.
the city approval does not,however,demonstrate that the exemptions will result in greater than normal public benefits 
as noted above,these improvements may,in fact,benefit the public,but they do not appear to constitute greater than normal public benefits and could be expected to be required of any proposal 
as approved by the city,the proposed development is inconsistent with the underlying zoning standards of the lcp and a substantial revision of the project plans will be necessary to bring the project into conformance with the certified lcp.these revisions are beyond the scope of the commission ability to redesign the project for the applicant,but if undertaken by the applicant,should a more even balance between primary and secondary uses,address the overall height of the building,and limit the number of vertical stories on the primary elevations to ensure the project is consistent with the standards identified in the underlying visitor serving commercial zoning.
the trial court found the commission determined in its findings that the residential use of the project was not secondary to permitted commercial uses as required by the lcp the square footage of the project devoted to residential use was much greater than that devoted to commercial uses,even with reddell proposed modifications,and the square footage of the residential units were larger,on average,than the average square footage of a single family residence in morro bay.the commission also disagreed with the city decision that the project is entitled to a pd exemption from normal zoning because it would result in greater than normal public benefits.the commission found that increased commercial use would be a better way to revive the city revenue stream,the project obstructs significant coastal views of morro rock and the bay,the residential housing is not low cost,and that the exemption is not necessary to protect public access and sensitive habitats.
reddell argues that the commission interpretation of the applicable lcp policies is erroneous because it used the ratio of commercial and residential square footage to determine primary and secondary uses.reddell asserts that,despite the ratio of residential to commercial based on square footage,commercial is the primary use of the building because that use is on the ground floor,while the residential use is on the upper floors.reddell also asserts that including the square footage of the garages in the ratio is erroneous.
section of the city zoning code,incorporated into the lcp,states in part the purpose of the commercial district is to provide a district for commercial uses intended primarily to serve the needs of tourists and other visitors to the city and not to include commercial uses of a more general nature which are oriented towards residents.in the zoning code,table i states unless otherwise designated,the following uses,or other uses which are found to be similar and consistent with the general plan and local coastal plan may be allowed with the appropriate permits and licenses a single apartment unit or security quarters only when secondary to permitted commercial uses and on the rear of a lot or upper story.
we generally defer to an agency interpretation where the agency possess es special familiarity with satellite legal and regulatory issues dunn county of santa barbara th,d.therefore,while we exercise our independent judgment in reviewing the commission interpretation of the coastal act and lcp policies,we exercise that judgment giving deference to the determination of the agency appropriate to the circumstances of the agency action.citation.ibid.
absent a compelling reason to do otherwise,we strive to construe each statute in accordance with its plain language.collection bureau of san jose rumsey cal th,d.the plain language of the regulation indicates an intent is to limit development in the zone to commercial uses intended primarily to serve the needs of tourists and other visitors to the city.residential use is permitted only to the extent that it is necessary to facilitate maintenance of the commercial uses,a single apartment unit or security quarters.
whether the determination of primary and secondary uses is based on square footage or some other method,the project violates the letter and spirit of the zoning designation because it consists of six residential units,many more than the single apartment unit or security quarters permitted by the regulation,and these residential uses are not commercial uses intended primarily to serve the needs of tourists and other visitors to the city.
in the alternative,reddell asserts that the project should be approved despite its inconsistency with the primary zoning of the property because the city found that the project provides greater than normal benefits to the city.section a of the city zoning code states the purpose of the planned development pd overlay zone,is to provide for detailed and substantial analysis of development on parcels which,because of location,size or public ownership,warrant special review.this overlay zone is also intended to allow for the modification of or exemption from the development standards of the primary zone which would otherwise apply if such action would result in better design or other public benefit.
section d of the city zoning code states the standards for development within the pd overlay zone shall be those of the base zoning district,provided however,that standards may be modified by the planning commission or city council as they relate to building heights yard requirements and minimum lot area for dwelling units in the density range provided that any specific design criteria of the general plan and coastal land use plan,applicable to the property,is not exceeded modifications of standards shall only be approved upon a finding that greater than normal public benefits may be achieved by such deviations.such benefits may include,but are not limited to improved or innovative site and architectural design,greater public or private usable open space and provisions of housing for the elderly or income families,provision of extraordinary public access,provision for protecting environ
