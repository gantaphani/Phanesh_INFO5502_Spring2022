this case involves contested attorneys fees awarded to plaintiffs under the endangered species act esa.during the pendency of plaintiffs action,the result of other related litigation rendered the plaintiffs litigation moot.plaintiffs request for fees is based on the theory that their lawsuit was a catalyst to bringing about defendants voluntary change of conduct and defendants revised interpretation of section b of the endangered species act.
plaintiffs pursued this action against the secretary of commerce and the national marine fisheries service nmfs alleging that defendants had violated various provisions of the esa when the nmfs designated certain lands in california and in the pacific northwest as critical habitats without conducting an adequate economic impact analysis.the case was dismissed as moot,after defendants had settled a separate,but related case in another district,resulting in a remand of the designations of the very same critical habitats at issue in this case.plaintiffs filed a motion for attorneys fees and costs,arguing that although this case had been dismissed as moot,bringing the suit still resulted in plaintiffs having achieved their goals.plaintiffs argued that because this action was a catalyst in defendants decision to voluntarily remand the designations in the other case and a revised interpretation of esa section b,they are entitled to fees and costs pursuant to the provision of the esa.
the district court agreed and awarded plaintiffs in fees and in costs.defendants appeal that award and argue that the esa provision does not apply because this case was actually brought under the administrative procedures act,rather than the esa that even if the esa provision does apply,the supreme court decision in buckhannon board and care home,west virginia department of health,d precludes use of the catalyst theory and so plaintiffs are not entitled to fees because there was no judicial resolution to their case and that the district court awarded unreasonable fees and costs.
we hold that the district court correctly found that the esa provision applied in this case because plaintiffs brought this action to enforce the esa.we further hold that the district court correctly applied the catalyst theory and did not abuse its discretion in the amount of fees and costs it awarded.
procedural background 
plaintiffs,association of california water agencies,state water contractors,kern county water agency,and stockton east water district filed the original action on august.plaintiffs alleged that defendants,the secretary of commerce,the director of the nmfs,and the regional director,for the northwest region of the nmfs,had failed to conduct a proper economic impact analysis prior to issuing a final rule final rule designating critical habitat for nineteen evolutionary significant units esus of steelhead trout and salmon,that such failure was part of a pattern and practice of violating the esa requirement of conducting a proper economic impact analysis prior to designating critical habitats,and that defendants had failed to prepare an environmental impact statement eis as required by the national environmental policy act nepa.plaintiffs alleged that defendants violated section b of the esa,b,when the secretary designated the critical habitats without first balancing the economic effects of the designation against the benefits of specifying the areas at issue as critical habitats.
defendants answered,denying the allegations and moved for partial dismissal of plaintiffs complaint,contending that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the critical habitat designation for thirteen of the esus that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the esa citizen suit provision and that a nepa challenge was foreclosed under ninth circuit law.at a scheduling conference,both parties acknowledged that a legal dispute existed as to whether the final rule complied with section b of the esa and the requirements of nepa.before the oral arguments were heard,plaintiffs filed a notice of related case,alerting the district court that the national association of homebuilders nahb had filed a case in the district of columbia on december,which also challenged the government application of esa b in designating critical habitat for the salmon and steelhead trout in the nineteen esus.plaintiffs advised the district court that it was likely that their litigation would be resolved more quickly than the nahb case and,that an interdistrict transfer was not warranted.defendants neither disputed this assessment nor did they ever request a transfer or consolidation.
the district court held a joint scheduling conference on january,and determined that the case would best be resolved through the filing of cross motions for summary judgment and did not rule on the motion to dismiss.the time for filing the motions for summary judgment was extended from july to september.
plaintiffs filed their motion for summary judgment on september,and on september,defendants filed a motion for voluntary remand of the final rule and a motion to stay summary judgment proceedings.
on january,the district court entered an order ruling that it had jurisdiction,and plaintiffs had standing to challenge the critical habitat for six of the nineteen esus,as well as defendants interpretation of esa b.the court also denied defendants motion to stay the action and ordered defendants to file an opposition to plaintiffs motion for summary judgment by march.significantly,the district court stated in the order that the defendants decision to consider only the incremental economic effects of designating critical habitat,beyond the effects associated with the listing of the species,suggests that the defendants did not consider the economic impacts of the designations as required by esa b.
subsequent to that ruling,defendants entered into a consent decree in the nahb case to vacate and remand the final rule.on march,defendants filed a motion in this action to stay proceedings because,upon finalization of the nahb consent decree,the instant case would be moot.on may,defendants notified the district court in this action that the nahb consent decree had been entered.defendants then filed a motion to dismiss this case as moot.on august,the district court granted defendants motion and dismissed this action as moot.
on august,plaintiffs filed a motion for attorneys fees pursuant to the provision of esa,b,g.the district court heard oral argument on that motion on october,and on december,the court granted plaintiffs motion and awarded plaintiffs in attorneys fees and in costs.
defendants appeal that order and challenge the district court award of fees and costs.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review an attorney fee award for an abuse of discretion.a district court abuses its discretion if its decision is based on an erroneous conclusion of law or if the record contains no evidence on which it rationally could have based its decision.we review the underlying factual determinations for clear error and review de novo any legal analysis relevant to the fee determination.fischel equitable life assurance soc y,cir.
ii.esa fee shifting 
the endangered species act states that any person may commence a civil suit on his own behalf against the secretary where there is alleged a failure of the secretary to perform any act or duty under section of this title which is not discretionary with the secretary.g c.the final rule was enacted pursuant to b.the act further provides that t he court,in issuing any final order in any suit brought pursuant to paragraph of this subsection,may award costs of litigation including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees to any party,whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.g emphasis added.
defendants argue that the district court erred as a matter of law when it awarded fees pursuant to the esa.they contend that plaintiffs suit was cognizable only under the apa because they assert that defendants duty is discretionary.however,plaintiffs claims under the esa fall squarely within g.the supreme court has held in an analogous case that 
t he terms of b are plainly those
