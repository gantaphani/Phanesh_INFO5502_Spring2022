this appeal presents novel issues concerning removal of a state court case to federal court and the appealability of a federal court order remanding a case back to a state court.the issues arise on an appeal by buffalo and fort erie public bridge authority the authority from the october,order of the district court for the western district of new york john elfvin,district judge.that order remanded to the new york supreme court,erie county,a lawsuit filed in the state court by mark mitskovski,elizabeth martina,and thomas pisa the plaintiffs,which the authority had removed to the district court.although the plaintiffs had sought the remand on various grounds,the district court remanded on a ground identified by the court on its own authority failure to comply with a local rule requiring the submission of an index of documents filed in the state court.see a a.the precise issues presented are whether the remand order is appealable if so,whether the remand for noncompliance with the local rule was proper if improper,whether the court of appeals may consider the district court subject matter jurisdiction and,if so,whether the district court has subject matter jurisdiction.
we conclude that the remand order is appealable that the remand order was erroneously issued that,with the remand order properly before us on appeal,we may consider subject matter jurisdiction and that the district court subject matter jurisdiction was properly invoked.we therefore vacate the order remanding the case to the state court and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
background 
this litigation concerns the peace bridge over the niagara river between buffalo,and fort erie,ontario.the authority owns and operates the bridge.the authority was created by legislative acts of new york,the dominion of canada,and the united states.the plaintiffs are buffalo residents,who live in close proximity to the bridge.
on may,the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in new york supreme court,erie county,seeking to enjoin the authority from taking any further action on an international border infrastructure improvement project the project that the authority is undertaking with the federal government of canada.the project includes expansion of plazas on both sides of the international border.the plaintiffs contend that the authority has failed to comply with various new york statutes,including the state environmental quality review act.envtl.conserv.et mckinney.
on june,the authority removed the case to the district court pursuant to a,contending that the district court had federal question jurisdiction because,among other things,resolution of the plaintiffs claim that the authority is a new york state agency involves a construction of federal law,the international compact under which the authority was created.
on july,the plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the case to the state court pursuant to c,alleging that removal was improper for two of a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal,as required by a,and lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
on october,the district court granted the plaintiffs motion to remand.without ruling on either of the grounds for remand advanced by the plaintiffs,judge elfvin remanded the case because the authority had failed to comply with the district court local rule a a,which requires that an index of all documents filed in the state court be attached to the notice of removal.the authority then sought from the district court an order requiring the plaintiffs to show cause why the remand order should not be reconsidered and vacated pursuant to.e.judge elfvin declined to issue the show cause order and denied the request for reconsideration on the ground that the district court lacked jurisdiction to reconsider the remand order.he relied on d,which provides,with an exception not relevant to this case,that a n order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise see in re lowe,cir district court lacks jurisdiction to reconsider its remand order trans penn wax mccandless,cir same seedman united states district court,cir same.

discussion 
appellate jurisdiction 
our initial issue is whether this court has appellate jurisdiction over the appeal from the district court remand order despite the broad language of d limiting appeal of remand orders it is settled that section d precludes appeal only of remand orders authorized by section c.see quackenbush allstate insurance,d thermtron products,hermansdorfer,d hamilton aetna life and casualty,cir.section c provides,in pertinent part 
a motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within days after the filing of the notice of removal under section a.if at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction,the case shall be remanded.
we have interpreted section c to authorize a remand for either a procedural defect asserted within days of the filing of notice of removal or a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.see hamilton,at.such remands,because they are authorized by section c,are barred from review by section d.see id.however,an order remanding on procedural grounds either upon an untimely motion or sua sponte more than days after removal,since such order is not authorized by c,is reviewable.id.
in the pending case,the plaintiffs filed a timely motion asserting an alleged procedural defect,and the district court granted the motion,but did so more than days after removal and on a ground identified by the court on its own with a local rule.the plaintiffs contend that the remand order is not appealable because the district court granted a timely motion that had asserted a procedural defect.the authority responds that the remand order is appealable because the order was based on a ground identified by the court on its own motion more than days after removal.
we think the authority has the better of the dispute on this novel issue.the congressional scheme contemplated by the interplay between sections c and d emphasizes prompt return to the state court of cases improperly removed and prompt processing of cases in the federal court of cases not authorized to be remanded.toward that end,a motion asserting a procedural defect must be made within days of removal,and a court of appeals may not delay the litigation by reviewing the grant of such a motion.in the same vein,a district court may not act to remand on its own motion more than days after removal in the absence of a party timely remand motion,and if it does so,a court of appeals may review and correct the improper remand.it is more consistent with this scheme to review a remand order based on a ground identified by a district court more than days after removal than to preclude review because the court acted upon a timely filed motion asserting a procedural defect other than the one the court thought warranted a remand.we understand hamilton
