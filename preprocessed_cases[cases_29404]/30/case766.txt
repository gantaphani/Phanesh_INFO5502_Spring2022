factual and procedural background 
the project is a small project that involves understory thinning cutting and logging and.the project was approved by the forest service on september.
the project was initiated to benefit the middle fork judith wilderness study area wsa,and to mitigate wildfire danger,particularly to sapphire village.the project benefits the wsa by reducing the danger of crown to the project area.the wsa is particularly important because it provides adjacent cover for elk and other large game animals that may be temporarily displaced during project implementation.
the project also benefits sapphire village by reducing the risk of fire danger.sapphire village was already identified by the federal register as a high risk interface community,which has historically suffered from crown fires.the project was designed to restore the project area to its historical natural stand composition a more open understory maintained by more frequent,low intensity fires.
the absence of fire for more than years has significantly changed the project area conifers a high fuel load type of evergreen have become established in stands of ponderosa pine,and the fire condition of the project area has changed from condition class no deviation from natural vegetation to condition classes and moderate and high departure from natural vegetation characteristics.the project treatments are intended to help restore natural maintenance of the project area.
following an administrative appeal by native ecosystems council,the project was reduced in size so that the total area of treatment was decreased from acres to acres.thinning was reduced from acres to acres.all treatment in unroaded lands was eliminated.temporary roads were decreased by about so that only one half mile of temporary road was planned to be constructed,decommissioned and subsequently rehabilitated.the forest service estimated that the project would take six to ten years to complete.
in the district court for the district of montana,native ecosystems council challenged several aspects of the project on nepa and nfma grounds.count i of native ecosystems council complaint alleged that the forest service violated nepa when it failed to give renewed consideration to the native ecosystems council proposed alternative c,following the agency decision to reduce the scope of the project according to alternative counts ii through v of the complaint related to the effects of the project on elk habitat and hiding cover.specifically,count ii alleged that the project violated nfma because it allowed for logging in mapped elk winter range during the winter months,in violation of the lewis and clark national forest plan forest plan.count iii alleged that the forest service violated the nfma by failing to adhere to the forest plan when it neglected to analyze big game hiding cover at the drainage level.count iv alleged a companion nepa claim stating that the failure to analyze hiding cover at the drainage level meant that the forest service relied upon inaccurate or unreliable scientific information.count v alleged a nfma claim charging that the project would cause higher road density than the forest plan allows.
counts vi through viii dealt with the effects of the project on goshawk habitat count vi alleged that the forest service violated nfma because it failed to adhere to the forest plan monitoring requirements for the goshawk population.count vii alleged both nfma and nepa violations on the grounds that the forest plan failed to ensure that habitat is available to maintain viable populations of goshawks.it also alleged that the forest service failure to implement a scientifically reliable monitoring protocol also violated nepa requirement that the forest service act with scientific integrity in the nepa analysis.count viii alleged a nepa violation on the grounds that the agency arrived at inconsistent conclusions regarding the canopy cover and goshawk foraging habitat that will remain after the completion of the project.
on june,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the forest service.specifically,the district court held that native ecosystems council failed to present arguments addressing the claims set forth in counts i,vii,and viii of the complaint,and therefore,that such claims were deemed abandoned the district court then granted summary judgment to the forest service on the remainder of the claims,on the merits.native ecosystems council timely appealed on august.

elk hiding cover methodology 
native ecosystems council contends that the forest service aerial photo interpretation pi type methodology is invalid and unreliable because the forest service can slash and burn an understory without affecting what would be seen on an aerial photo due to canopy cover.native ecosystems council contends that the pi type methodology fails to consider the possibility that the removal of understory may not be cognizable aerially if a forest has very dense vegetation and thick canopy cover.
native ecosystems council challenge fails to prove that the forest service acted arbitrarily and capriciously in selecting the pi type methodology to analyze elk hiding cover.the forest service based its selection of the pi type methodology upon a rigorous and scientific elk logging study involving the use of a,two dimensional cutout of an elk in various types of forest stands the forest service noted the characteristics of each stand in the various areas in which hiding covered was measured.the stand characteristics were then classified into different pi types.based upon those descriptions,a montana rule was developed to calculate an average percentage hiding cover by type.for any given area,the percentage of effective cover was then determined by multiplying the acres of each pi type by the montana rule percentages,totaling the acres providing hiding cover,and then dividing by total acres.the montana rule percentages were tested for accuracy in the elk logging study of in that comparison of over sites,the montana rule estimated hiding cover at and actual observation determined hiding cover.based upon those findings,the forest service determined that pi type analysis,as applied using the montana rule,is reliable.moreover,and in addition to the classic pi rule analysis,in order to specifically address concerns that aerial photos would not reflect the effects of thinning on lower understory due to canopy cover,the forest service created new criteria for determining whether the understory treatments would change the pi types.these new criteria provided that pi type would also be changed by the existence of cutover,which was characterized as areas with obvious evidence of man recent cutting activities,such as cutting unit boundaries,characteristic roading systems,etc.
native ecosystems council fails to present any compelling evidence that the forest service reliance on the elk logging study was arbitrary or capricious.to the contrary,native ecosystems council fails to assert any distinguishing facts between the elk logging study and the instant case that would render the pi type methodology inapposite.native ecosystems council presented no evidence that understory removal had not occurred prior to in any of the sample areas analyzed in the elk logging study.moreover,native ecosystems council has not proffered any evidence that the pi type methodology is predicated on only assessing stands in which no understory treatment has occurred.in contrast,the forest service has demonstrated that the pi type methodology accounts for stocking levels and understory density because the pi rule calculation is determined by the number of trees in a given area.thus,regardless of whether the understory was previously treated,the forest service was not arbitrary or capricious in selecting the pi type methodology because it reasonably relied upon the elk logging study and the montana rule to conclude that the methodology adequately gauged stand density.
the mere fact that native ecosystems council disagrees with the methodology does not constitute a nepa violation.in reviewing native ecosystems council nepa appeal,we may not insert our opinions in the place of those of forest biologists.lands council,at.rather,we are required to apply the highest level of deference in our review of the forest service scientific judgments in selecting the elk hiding cover methodology.northern plains,at.given the paucity of native ecosystems council factual distinctions,and the substantial deference owed to the forest service determinations,we hold that the forest service selection of the pi type methodology did not violate nepa.lands council,at.
flawed conclusions in elk hiding cover analysis

logging and thinning 
native ecosystems council challenges the forest service commercial logging findings based on a silvicultural report on the impacts of the project that indicated that the project goal of reducing the risk of crown fire would be met by reducing canopy cover to less than percent.because the threshold between a moderately stocked stand and a poorly stocked stand is percent,and a change from moderately stocked to poorly stocked would result in a change in pi type,native ecosystems contends that the forest service conclusion that the logging and thinning aspects of the project would not change pi type is contradicted by the record.
we disagree.the forest service based its analysis of the impacts of logging and thinning on a revision of the original silvicultural report upon which native ecosystems council relies.the silvicultural report was thus superseded by the final version,which corrected previous and reflected more accurate data about the project impacts on canopy cover.in the final silvicultural report,which was subsequently incorporated into the third chapter of the ea,entitled affected environment and environmental consequences,the forest service specifically considered the direct and indirect consequences of past,present and reasonably foreseeable future project related activities based upon two different alternatives no agency action and proposed action by the project.in that chapter alone,the forest service cited over thirty different studies upon which it based its findings.based upon those studies and its own revised analysis in,the forest service thus reasonably concluded that the project goals could be accomplished by reducing canopy cover to percent or lower,and therefore it was not necessary to thin stands below the moderately stocked category.
moreover,a separate february report supplementing the elk hiding cover analysis confirmed the findings of the final silvicultural report included in the ea.there,the forest service concluded that the project would not change effective hiding cover for elk from the existing condition moderately stocked and that broadcast burning,as well as cutting and slashing,would not alter the pi type.
under lands council,the silvicultural report does not prove that the forest service conclusion was implausible because it was superseded by more accurate predictions.at.nor does the report demonstrate that the forest service reliance on the revisions or biologist report was contradicted by facts in the record because the forest service reasonably determined the and reports were based upon corrected and more recent data and various different studies.id.accordingly,because the forest service supported its findings with multiple different studies and analyses,we defer to the forest service conclusion that the slashing and thinning activities would not alter the pi of the project area.id.
prescribed burning 
native ecosystems council contends that the prescribed burning of the project area per se changes the character of the treated stand by altering its height and texture,thus changing the stand pi type.besides the outdated silvicultural report,native ecosystems council cites minimal evidence,if any,to support its position.it contends,based on the report,that removing trees indisputably alters their height.reducing stand density has the potential to alter the texture and stocking of the stand.however,native ecosystems council fails to appreciate that the project actually serves to preserve the distinguishing features of the pi types of the burned stands by removing the invasive fauna that has caused the increased fire risk.
specifically,native ecosystems council ignores the fact that the prescribed burns will occur only within and adjacent to meadows,which are assigned at pi type of nonforest,defined as having generally percent cover from shrubs,grass,riparian trees,such meadows and adjacent areas in the project area were actually threatened by the invasive conifers and shrubs causing the fire danger.thus,the forest service demonstrated that the prescribed burning would restore the status quo by limiting the shrubs and conifers presently invading the meadows.accordingly,we hold that the forest service conclusion that the prescribed burning preserves the meadow and does not change its pi type,is supported,rather than contradicted by the evidence in the record,and therefore does not violate nepa.lands council,at.
cutting and slashing 
native ecosystems council contends that hand slashing will produce stumps,and that stumps are evidence of man recent cutting activities,thus rendering project areas,and changing their pi type.however,the very document upon which native ecosystems council relies defines cutover as areas with obvious evidence of man cutting activities,such as cutting unit boundaries,characteristic roading systems,the mere fact that some stumps may exist does not rise to the level of rendering a stand cutover that is why the report emphasizes cutting unit boundaries,because the cutting has to be significant and widespread.we hold that the forest service is entitled to substantial deference in this interpretation of its own regulations.forest guardians,at.moreover,native ecosystems council has presented no evidence that some stumps would constitute true cutover.indeed,the record indicates that larger trees would be retained and the spatial arrangement horizontal structure would be irregular and random to feature groups of larger diameter trees of similar age.and contrary to native ecosystems council contentions,the temporary road to be constructed during the project would not constitute a roading system because it would be decommissioned and rehabilitated after the project is completed.
given these considerations,the forest service does not rely upon facts that are contradicted by the record rather,native ecosystems council attempts to distort the meaning of evidence of man recent cutting activities by ignoring the technical definitions of cutover in the ea.such logic fails to prove a nepa violation.lands council,at.accordingly,we hold that the forest service did not violate nepa in concluding that the slashing would not render the project area cutover.

flawed assumptions in elk hiding cover analysis 
native ecosystems council contends that the forest service elk cover hiding analysis violates nfma because it would reduce elk hiding cover beyond a threshold level,as required under the forest plan.specifically,native ecosystems council contends that because the project would change the pi type of treated stands,it would therefore reduce elk hiding cover in violation of the forest plan requirement that elk hiding cover be maintained.native ecosystems council relies upon the same three flawed assumptions challenged under nepa in their nfma claims regarding logging and thinn
