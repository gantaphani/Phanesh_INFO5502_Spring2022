introduction 
the roman catholic diocese of orange the diocese and kisco senior living,llc kisco,desire to build a living community for senior citizens on a parcel of real property,owned by the diocese the project,which is located in an unincorporated area of orange county the county.the county board of supervisors the board created a new zoning definition for senior residential housing,and applied it to the project site found the project was consistent with the county general plan and the north tustin specific plan sometimes referred to as ntsp and found the project complied with the california environmental quality act pub.resources code,et ceqa.foothill communities coalition,an unincorporated association of grassroots community groups and area homeowners foothill,challenged the board decisions by means of a petition for a peremptory writ of mandate.the trial court entered judgment in favor of foothill,and issued the requested writ.
appellants challenge the trial court conclusion that the board acts constitute impermissible spot zoning.we publish this case to clarify the law regarding spot zoning in two respects.first,spot zoning may occur whether a small parcel of property is subject to more or less restrictive zoning than the surrounding properties.second,to determine whether impermissible spot zoning has occurred,a court is required to conduct a analysis.after determining that spot zoning has actually occurred,the court must determine whether the record shows the spot zoning is in the public interest.
in this case,applying the required standard of review,which is deferential to the board,we conclude the boards findings that the project would be consistent with the countys general plan and with the north tustin specific plan are supported by substantial evidence.the creation of the new senior residential housing zone and its application to the project site were not arbitrary or capricious,or lacking in evidentiary support.although the boards actions constituted spot zoning,the spot zoning was permissible.the trial court erred in entering judgment in foothills favor and in issuing the writ of mandate.we therefore reverse.as explained in detail,post,we remand the matter for further consideration by the trial court of issues relating to ceqa.
our reversal of the judgment renders moot foothills appeal challenging the trial courts refusal to award it attorney fees as the prevailing party.costa serena owners coalition costa serena architectural com.th.
statement of facts,chronology,and procedural history 
in,the diocese received a gift of a acre parcel of undeveloped property in the north tustin area of the county.in,the diocese decided to develop the property as a senior residential community.the diocese retained senior living communities developer kisco to design and implement the project.in january,the diocese and kisco submitted to the county a project design proposing senior living units.
the project site is located within the area covered by the north tustin specific plan,which regulates the development of property within its boundaries and was adopted by the board in.under the north tustin specific plan,the project site is designated as residential.in july,the county issued a notice of preparation for the project environmental impact report eir.the draft eir was released in may for a day public comment period.the final eir was released by the county in december.
in january,the county planning commission conducted a public hearing on the project,at the end of which it recommended that the board approve the project and certify the final eir.the board conducted a public hearing on the project,after which it issued one ordinance and two resolutions approving the project and making necessary changes to the north tustin specific plan to permit its development.in ordinance,the board amended the north tustin specific plan to add a new zoning district for senior residential housing and to change the land use district for the project site to the new senior residential housing designation.in resolution,the board certified the eir for the project as complete,accurate,and in compliance with the requirements of ceqa.and in resolution,the board approved both a use permit for the project as a senior living facility,and a site development permit.in march,the board amended the north tustin specific plan to create a new zoning district the senior residential housing land use district which it applied to the project site.the same month,the county filed a notice of determination of the board approval of the project and certification of the final eir.
in april,foothill filed a verified petition for a writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory relief against the county and the board.in march,the trial court issued a minute order granting the petition.judgment was entered.foothill filed a motion for a new trial in order to clarify whether the writ and the judgment resolved the ceqa issues raised in the petition,which was denied.foothill,the diocese and kisco,and the county and the board filed separate,timely notices of appeal.
discussion 
the rezoning of property,even a single parcel,is generally considered to be a act thus subject to review under ordinary mandamus.the standard for review of a act is whether the action was arbitrary or capricious or totally lacking in evidentiary support.citations.avenida san juan partnership city of san clemente th,see arnel development city of costa mesa cal d,wilkins city of san bernardino cal d,wilkins.
in a mandamus proceeding,the ultimate question,whether the agency action was arbitrary or capricious,is a question of law.citations.trial and appellate courts therefore perform the same function and the trial court statement of decision has no conclusive effect upon us.citation.citation,dry creek joint elementary school dist.th.
the party challenging a zoning ordinance as arbitrary or capricious bears the burden of producing sufficient evidence from which the trier of fact may conclude that the ordinance is unreasonable and invalid.wilkins,supra,cal d at county of butte bach d.in this case,the burden of proof was on foothill 
appellants appeal decisions are exercises of the county police power.
it is well settled that zoning ordinances,when reasonable in object and not arbitrary in operation,constitute a justifiable exercise of police power,and that the establishment,as part of a comprehensive and systematic plan,of districts devoted to strictly private residences or single family dwellings,from which are excluded business or multiple dwelling structures,is a legitimate exercise of the police power.wilkins,supra,cal d at.
the project site is subject to both the county general plan and a specific plan.t he general plan is a constitution for future development citation located at the top of the hierarchy of local government law regulating land use citation.the general plan consists of a statement of development policies setting forth objectives,principles,standards,and plan proposals.citation.the plan must include seven elements land use,circulation,conservation,housing,noise,safety and open space and address each of these elements in whatever level of detail local conditions require citation.general plans are also required to be comprehensive and long term citation as well as internally consistent.citation.the planning law thus compels cities and counties to undergo the discipline of drafting a master plan to guide future local land use decisions.devita county of napa cal th,fn.omitted.
a specific plan,such as the north tustin specific plan,is usually more detailed than a general plan,and covers specific parts of the community.the approval of a specific plan does not create a vested right to develop property in a manner consistent with the specific plan,or to prevent development inconsistent with it.people county of kern d.a specific plan may be adopted or amended by resolution or ordinance of the appropriate legislative body.these sections of the government code recognize that a county needs necessarily change over time it follows that a county must have the power to modify its land use plans as circumstances require.napa citizens for honest government napa county bd.of supervisors th.despite foothill argument to the contrary,the north tustin specific plan does not constitute a contract entered into by the county.see,subd.a specific plans may be amended as often as deemed necessary by the legislative body.

the ordinance by which the new senior residential housing zoning district was created and applied to the project site reads,in relevant part,as follows the county,after balancing the specific economic,legal,social,technological,and other benefits of the proposed project,has determined that the unavoidable adverse environmental impacts identified may be considered acceptable due to the following specific considerations which outweigh the unavoidable,adverse environmental impacts of the proposed project,each of which standing alone is sufficient to support approval of the project the specific considerations identified by the county include the project addresses the housing element goals for senior housing set forth in the county general plan,the project is compatible with the character of the surrounding neighborhood,the project addresses and remedies existing issues with storm drains and runoff,the project would provide for a deed restriction to be imposed on the property,so that future owners would be prohibited from other incompatible uses,and the project allows for implementation of policies set forth in the north tustin specific plan.
spot zoning 
foothill contends the zoning change created an instance of impermissible spot zoning.the essence of spot zoning is irrational discrimination.avenida san juan partnership city of san clemente,supra,th at.spot zoning is one type of discriminatory zoning ordinance.citation.spot zoning occurs where a small parcel is restricted and given lesser rights than the surrounding property,as where a lot in the center of a business or commercial district is limited to uses for residential purposes thereby creating an island in the middle of a larger area devoted to other uses.citation.usually spot zoning involves a small parcel of land,the larger the property the more difficult it is to sustain an allegation of spot zoning.citations.likewise,where the spot is not an island but is connected on some sides to a like zone the allegation of spot zoning is more difficult to establish since lines must be drawn at some point.citation.even where a small island is created in the midst of less restrictive zoning,the zoning may be upheld where rational reason in the public benefit exists for such a classification.citation.arcadia development city of morgan hill th.
appellants correctly note that no published case in california has directly addressed the type of spot zoning at issue herewhere the small parcel is given greater rights than the surrounding property.we reject appellants argument that this means the zoning change by the board is not spot zoning.a spot zone results when a small parcel of land is subject to more or less restrictive zoning than surrounding properties.hagman et,cal.zoning practice,italics added.several published cases in california indirectly acknowledge that spot zoning occurs whether the spot is subject to more or less restrictive zoning than the surrounding property.in tandy city of oakland d,a propertys owners petitioned for a writ of mandate to compel the city to rezone the property from multiple dwelling to commercial,which would have made the petitioners property an island of less restrictive zoning.the appellate court rejected the petitioners request,not because it did not raise an issue of spot zoning,but because it was inappropriate for the courts to interfere with a distinctly legislative decision the propriety of rezoning plaintiffs single parcel from multiple dwelling to commercial while maintaining the remainder of the area in a multiple dwelling zone is a matter of legislative determination,and where,as here,there is room for difference of opinion on the subject,the courts will not interfere with the legislative determination.citations.id.at.
in case city of los angeles d,the owner of acres of land zoned c sought a change in zoning to the less restrictive c m for three and acres of its total acreage the remaining portion of the owners property would remain zoned as c.the trial court found that the ordinance by which the city made the requested zoning change violates good zoning practice and comprehensive zoning planning and does not satisfy or meet good zoning practice and was arbitrary and discriminatory with respect to owners of property similarly situated.id.at.the appellate court accepted that the zoning change was an example of spot zoning,but reversed a portion of the judgment because the plaintiffs who owned property that did not adjoin the rezoned property and did not share either the original or the amended zoning classification did not have standing to pursue their claim while ordinances for spot zoning and those which create monopolies are examples of illegal,unreasonable,arbitrary and discriminatory zoning citations,in an action for declaratory relief citation the court is authorized to determine and declare only the issues between the parties to the action.it having been found in the instant action that none of plaintiffs properties is similarly situated to that zoned by ordinance number,and that none of plaintiffs rights are infringed by it,the paragraph of said judgment from which defendants have appealed is a declaration concerning matters not properly in issue.id.at.
in wilkins,supra,cal d at page,the california supreme court agreed that spot zoning exists when the spot receives either more or less restrictive zoning,although the opinion implies that only the application of more restrictive zoning is problematic spot zoning results in the creation of two types of islands.as pointed out above,the objectionable type arises when the zoning authority improperly limits the use which may be made of a small parcel located in the center of an unrestricted area.the second type of island results when most of a large district is devoted to a limited or restricted use,but additional uses are permitted in one or more spots in the district.it is the second type of island that is presented in this case,and if there is any discrimination,it is in favor of the island since it may be devoted to a greater number of uses than the surrounding territory.it is clearly within the discretion of the legislative body of the city to determine whether such an island should be enlarged or not,and the mere fact that the owner may enjoy greater benefits,or that his property will be enhanced in value,if the size of the island is increased,can not entitle him to compel the allowance of such increase in size.in wilkins,the city had twice denied a property owners request that his property be rezoned from residential to business.id.at.the trial court,in ruling on the property owners declaratory relief claim,determined the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to that property owner,and enjoined its enforcement against him.id.at.
the supreme court reversed the judgment,and set forth two clear rules of law applicable to challenges to zoning decisions.first,t he courts can not write the zoning laws and can not say that the legislative body has erred in drawing the lines of the districts,or in restricting the territory devoted to business or to multiple dwellings,unless there is a clear showing of abuse of legislative discretion.wilkins,supra,cal d at.second,w here it is claimed that the ordinance is unreasonable as applied to plaintiffs property,or that a change in conditions has rendered application of the ordinance unreasonable,it is incumbent on plaintiff to produce sufficient evidence from which the court can make such findings as to the physical facts involved as will justify it in concluding,as a matter of law,that the ordinance is unreasonable and invalid.it is not sufficient for him to show that it will be more profitable to him to make other use of his property,or that such other use will not cause injury to the public,but he must show an abuse of discretion on the part of the zoning authorities and that there has been an unreasonable and unwarranted exercise of the police power.id.at.
many other jurisdictions have concluded that an amendment to a zoning ordinance that singles out a small parcel of land for a use different from that of the surrounding properties and for the benefit of the owner of the small parcel and to the detriment of other owners is spot zoning.see,yellow lantern kampground town of cortlandville,schubach zoning board of adjustment,balough fairbanks north star borough alaska,pharr tippitt.palisades properties,brunetti.
we hold the creation of an island of property with less restrictive zoning in the middle of properties with more restrictive zoning is spot zoning.this conclusion does not end our analysis,however,as spot zoning may or may not be impermissible,depending on the circumstances.the rezoning ordinance may be justified,however,if a substantial public need exists,and this is so even if the private owner of the tract will also benefit.pharr tippitt,supra,at.t he term spot zoning is merely shorthand for a certain arrangement of physical facts.when those facts exist,the zoning may or may not be warranted spot zoning may well be in the public interest it may even be in accordance with the requirements of a master plan.hagman et,cal.zoning practice,supra,see arcadia development city of morgan hill,supra,th at spot zoning may be upheld if public would benefit from it.
were the creation of the new zoning district and its application to the project site in the public interest,and were those decisions arbitrary or capricious,or devoid of evidentiary support 
foothills overriding argument is that the change in zoning of the project site was inconsistent with the north tustin specific plan.no zoning ordinance may be adopted or amended within an area covered by a specific plan unless it is consistent with the adopted specific plan.under the applicable standard of review,we consider the boards factual findings of consistency and defer to them unless no reasonable person could have reached the same conclusion on the evidence before it.endangered habitats league,county of orange th.
we note initially that the california legislature has encouraged the development of senior citizen housing by creating a percent density bonus for such projects,subds.b c,f.the boards approval of the project and change in zoning to permit the project to be constructed are consistent with statewide priorities.
the creation of the senior residential housing zoning district is in the public interest and consistent with the countys general plan and with the north tustin specific plan.in enacting resolution and,the board found,based on the facts in the administrative record,that t he proposed project would be consistent with the general plan,ntsp,as amended,and senior living ordinance.as defined in ordinance creating the senior residential housing district,only senior housing units,not other types of multidwelling uses such as apartment buildings,can be built on the project site.also,the development standards are consistent with the surrounding residential zoning district.we reach this conclusion based on our review of the many factual findings of consistency with the applicable general and specific plans,which are included in the administrative record.
the housing element,one of nine elements of the countys general plan,provides,in relevant part the special housing needs of seniors are an important concern in orange county.this is especially so since many retired persons are likely to be on fixed low incomes,at greater risk of impaction,or housing overpayment.in addition,the elderly maintain special needs related to housing construction and location.seniors often require ramps,handrails,lower cupboards and counters to allow greater access and mobility.in terms of location,because of limited mobility the elderly also typically need access to public facilities,medical and shopping and public transit facilities.in general,every effort should be made to maintain the dignity,and quality of life of mature residents in the county.in,there were owner households and renter households in unincorporated orange county where the householder was or older of these,elderly persons were living alone.many elderly persons are dependent on fixed incomes have a disability.elderly homeowners may be physically unable to maintain their homes or cope with living alone.the housing needs of this group can be addressed through smaller units,second units on lots with existing homes,shared living arrangements,congregate housing and housing assistance programs.
the housing element of the countys general plan also states that the countys provision of housing for seniors involves the following senior housing projects are a permitted use within any residential zoning district.the zoning code also provides a density bonus for the construction of senior housing projects through approval of an affordable housing or senior citizen housing incentive use permit section.the zoning ordinance is not considered to be a constraint to the development of senior housing because the regulations are the same as for other residential uses in the same districts.
the staff report of the communities planning unit to the county planning commission explains that the project is consistent with the housing element of the general plan the countys general plan includes a housing element.the housing needs assessment of the housing element acknowledges that the special housing needs of seniors are an important concern in the county of orange.the elderly maintain special needs related to housing construction and location.the housing element states that every effort should be made to maintain the dignity,and quality of life of mature residents in the county.this applies to mature citizens who prefer to stay in their own dwellings and those who relocate to a retirement community.according to the housing element,housing is one of the top five concerns among the senior population.according to the state of california,department of finance,in the total population of seniors in orange county,age years and older,was at,which comprised about of the total population.orange countys senior population increased to,comprising of the total population in.it is anticipated to increase to in,which is an estimated of the estimated total population this is approximately an increase within ten years.the proposed project is for a percent senior living community,and it will be deed restricted for those years of age and older.there are two types of living arrangements proposedindependent living and assisted living.some independent living units would be located in the main building.additionally,the bungalows would serve as independent living units,and are a good transition for people moving from larger homes to a senior living campus.the independent residential units do not require licensing from the state of california.the proposed project would not be a nursing facility and would not offer nursing service.this project provides two different housing types,thus enabling residents to age in one place and not have to move as circumstances change.
the staff report also explains how the project is consistent with the north tustin specific plan the project site is located within the ntsp.land use districts within the ntsp serve as the applicable zoning designations.the project site land use district is currently residential single family rsf.the prefix indicates a requirement of a foot frontage for each building site.permitted uses are single detached dwelling units per building site square feet minimum,noncommercial parks and playgrounds,riding and hiking trails,and community care f
