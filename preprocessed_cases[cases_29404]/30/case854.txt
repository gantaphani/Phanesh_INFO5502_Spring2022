the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act,cercla,requires certain polluters to pay for cleaning up contaminated sites.after identifying a contaminated site,the federal environmental protection agency epa and state environmental agencies typically negotiate with potentially responsible parties prps over their shares of comparative responsibility for cleanup response costs.cercla allows prps to seek contribution from one another in order to apportion response costs equitably.but cercla bars contribution claims against prps that have obtained administratively or judicially approved settlements with the government.cercla thus provides an incentive for prps to settle by leaving prps liable for all of the response costs not paid by the settling prps.
we consider a question that has split the federal courts may a prp intervene in litigation to oppose a consent decree incorporating a settlement that,if approved,would bar contribution from the settling prp we join the eighth and tenth circuits in holding that the answer is yes.
background 
investigation and negotiation 
the san gabriel basin is a groundwater reservoir in eastern los angeles county that serves as a source of drinking water for more than one million people.in,the epa discovered groundwater contamination in the basin.in,it designated much of the basin as a site on the cercla national priorities list for investigation and cleanup.the epa divided the site into eight operable units.the south el monte operable unit semou covers approximately eight square miles in the south central portion of the san gabriel basin.
the epa initial investigation determined that semou groundwater contained volatile organic compounds vocs that required containment and remediation.throughout the,the epa sent notice of liability letters to prps,requesting that they participate in a remedial investigation and feasibility study.prps participated in the process.by,the epa had completed the and had identified numerous industrial facilities in the semou that were potential sources of the vocs.
in september,the epa issued an interim record of decision irod based on the.the irod prescribed a remedial plan to clean contaminants from the groundwater and stop their spread.as part of the plan,local water providers water entities would pump the contaminated water,clean the water,and then sell the treated water to their customers.the epa projected the estimated cost of voc cleanup at million,plus an additional million for costs incurred by the state and federal governments.
in march,the epa sent special notice letters pursuant to e of cercla,e,to prps it had identified as current or former owners or operators of facilities in the basin that had used hazardous substances.the letters asked the prps to present good faith offers to comply with the irod remedial plan and to pay the epa past costs in the semou.
in the meantime,the water entities sought to require the prps to pay for the water treatment response costs.after lengthy negotiations,in july the water entities and thirteen prps group of entered into an agreement agreement.the agreement provided that the group of would pay million to fund voc cleanup in exchange for a standstill agreement under which the water entities would agree not to bring suit against the group during the period that the funds were being used.the water entities also agreed to use good faith efforts to support efforts of the group of to obtain an approved settlement that would bar contribution claims by other prps against group of members.
on august,the epa issued a unilateral administrative order to prps that had not yet entered into agreements or made good faith offers,requiring each of them to take remedial action.
the remedial plan contained in the irod addressed only voc contamination.soon after the issuance of the irod,the epa detected perchlorate in semou groundwater at concentrations higher than the state drinking water advisory levels.in,the epa issued an explanation of significant differences esd to update the irod remedial plan to address perchlorate contamination.
by,estimated response costs had increased substantially.the epa voc response cost estimate had increased from million to million.the esd estimated an additional million for perchlorate remediation.the estimated costs incurred by the state and federal governments had also increased from million to million.the total cost to clean up voc and perchlorate contamination in the semou groundwater was now estimated at million.
suits by the water entities semou cases 
while they were negotiating the agreement with the group of,the water entities filed four suits in the central district of california against other prps the semou cases on march,the district court consolidated the four cases.
under the terms of the agreement,the water entities could not sue the group of.however,the prp defendants in the semou cases were not so bound.the defendants filed complaints against the group of,as well as against other prps not sued by the water entities.their complaints sought contribution from the group of and the other prps.the defendants also filed counterclaims against the water entities.the district court appointed a special master to facilitate settlement.in october,the district court stayed discovery while the parties focused on settlement discussions.
agreement among the epa,the water entities,and the group of 
in march,ten prps from the group of group of entered into an agreement with the water entities,the epa,and the state agreement.the group of had become the group of when two members applied successfully for ability to pay status,see cercla g,g,and a third member declined to participate.the group of agreed to provide an additional million to pay for cleanup of perchlorate contaminants in the semou.
appeal in this case 
in october,the epa filed a suit in the central district of california against the group of,lodging a proposed consent decree incorporating both the agreement of and the agreement of.the consent decree,if approved by the court,would protect the group of from contribution claims by prps.the prp defendants in the semou cases were not parties to the epa suit.
the department of justice published notice of the proposed consent decree in the federal register on november,and provided a public comment period.see notice of lodging of two consent decrees.a group of prps,including most of the defendants in the semou cases,submitted comments objecting to the proposed consent decree.we will call this group applicants.applicants did not include any of the group of or the group of.applicants complained that the epa had not provided sufficient information about the proposed consent decree allocation of cleanup costs.applicants further complained that they were unaware as to whether a preliminary allocation of responsibility has been prepared by epa.in december,applicants submitted freedom of information act requests to the epa.they received some information in response on february.
in march,applicants moved to intervene as of right in the epa suit against the group of under federal rule of civil procedure a and i of cercla,i.the district court denied intervention and entered the consent decree the next day.
the applicants timely appealed,contending that the district court erred in denying their motion to intervene as of right under rule a and i.that appeal is before us in this case.
appeal in the semou cases 
in the semou cases,plaintiff water entities and defendants group of requested a judicial order in may approving a proposed settlement between plaintiffs and defendants that mirrored the proposed consent decree in the epa suit against the group of.defendants in the semou cases included the applicants who had sought to intervene to oppose the proposed consent decree in the suit brought by the epa against the group of.the district court in the semou cases entered judgment approving the settlement,dismissing with prejudice all claims against the group of,and barring any claims for contribution by prps.five of the defendants all of whom are applicants for intervention in the suit brought by the epa appealed
