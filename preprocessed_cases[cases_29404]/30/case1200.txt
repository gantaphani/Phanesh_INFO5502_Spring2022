plaintiffs okanogan highlands alliance oha and the confederated tribes of the colville reservation colville challenge the adequacy of the final environmental impact statement eis and record of decision rod prepared by the united states forest service forest service plaintiffs make three arguments the district court and the regional forester considered documents that were not part of the administrative record,in violation of the administrative procedure act apa,the eis contains an inadequate discussion of necessary mitigation measures,in violation of the national environmental policy act of nepa,and the apa and the forest service failed to select the most environmentally preferable,but still profitable,project alternative that it considered,in violation of and the organic act.colville also contends that the forest service violated the trust obligations that federal agencies owe to native american tribes.we affirm the district court ruling that the forest service did not violate nepa,the apa,the organic act,or its trust obligations.
factual and procedural history 
in,battle mountain gold company bmg submitted a proposed plan of operations to the forest service,the bureau of land management blm,and the washington department of natural resources for the development,operation,and eventual closure of a gold mine in an area on and around buckhorn mountain in washington.we will refer to this proposal as the project.bmg proposed to process about tons of ore and handle an average of tons of waste rock per day for eight years.bmg expected to remove about ounces of gold per year.the project would directly disturb acres of land,of which percent acres is administered by the forest service,percent acres is administered by the blm,percent acres is administered by the washington department of natural resources,and percent acres is owned by private parties.
the forest service issued an eis for the project.the forest service discussed seven project alternatives in the eis,including a alternative.relevant to this appeal are alternatives b and c.in alternative c,the forest service proposed that ore be extracted by underground methods only.the forest service determined that alternative c was the most environmentally preferable of the action alternatives.
alternative b,a version of bmg original submission,proposed to operate the mine hours a day,seven days a week,for eight years,with an added year at the start for construction and another at the end for reclamation.the forest service expected the operation to produce a mine pit that would fill with water,creating a lake that would cover acres and be up to feet deep.the operation would remove about million tons of rock,and gold would be extracted from the rock through a cyanide vat leach process.an average of cubic yards of waste rock per day would be placed in two permanent disposal areas.
the forest service,in its rod,approved alternative alternative c was not selected because of substantial impacts to mine economics,a reduction in mineral resource recovery,and because environmental effects associated with surface mining could be addressed fully or in part by reasonable reclamation,mitigation or compensatory requirements.
colville and oha appealed the selection to the regional forester,but the appeal was denied.oha challenged the eis and rod in federal district court,pursuant to the apa,naming the forest service and its officials as defendants.colville intervened as a plaintiff,and bmg intervened as a defendant.plaintiffs and defendants all filed motions for summary judgment.
the magistrate judge granted defendants motions the court made the following rulings that are relevant to this appeal the forest service discussion of mitigating measures in the eis conformed to nepa and was neither arbitrary nor capricious the forest service selection of alternative b did not violate the organic act requirement that the forest service decisions should minimize adverse environmental impacts and the forest service did not violate the trust obligations that it owed to colville.this timely appeal ensued.

discussion 
a.the administrative record 
plaintiffs contend that the regional forester and the district court relied on documents that were not part of the administrative record in making their decisions upholding the validity of the eis and rod.in particular,plaintiffs refer to an april economic analysis of alternative c and a march mitigation plan,both prepared by bmg and submitted to the regional forester as part of the appeal of the january rod collectively,the documents.we have reviewed the decisions of the district court and the regional forester and hold that neither the district court nor the regional forester relied on any materials outside the administrative record in their decisions.
it is undisputed that bmg submitted documents to the regional forester.a remand would be necessary,however,only if the agency journey outside the record worked substantial prejudice.marathon oil epa,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.we need not decide whether substantial prejudice existed in this case,because the regional forester took no journey outside the record at all.
the regional forester stated in his decision that he had reviewed the record provided by the forest supervisor,including his review of new information presented in the appeals.the regional forester then responded to each of the issues raised by the appealing parties,but did not base his conclusions that the eis and rod were adequate on the data found in either of the documents.the regional forester did note merely that the mitigation plan exists.in his response to plaintiffs concern that the rod was issued before a determination had been made that standards could be met,the forester noted that the eis requires the proponent to submit a mitigation plan consistent with the permitting requirements to obtain a national pollutant discharge elimination system permit.interested party comments from bmg indicate that a detailed water rights mitigation plan has been submitted to the washington department of ecology.
we do not believe that bmg comment informing the forester that it had taken steps to obtain a state permit,and the forester recognition of that fact,can be considered a journey outside the record.the appeal record,which consists of the documents upon which review of an appeal is conducted,is to include written comments by interested parties.the forester simply acknowledged bmg written comment that a plan existed he did not use the plan itself or the data therein as support for any of the eis or rod underlying conclusions.
our review of the district court decision also belies plaintiffs argument that the district court erred in relying on documents.plaintiffs are correct that judicial review of agency decisions is generally limited to review of the administrative record.morongo band,at.in this case,the district court said in finding that the forest service provided an adequate discussion of mitigation measures today decision is based solely on the discussion of mitigation measures provided in the feis and rod.the district court analysis and conclusions concerning the other issues relevant to this appeal also contain no hint of reliance on the documents.
we hold,then,that neither the regional forester nor the district court violated the apa by relying on documents.we turn now to the questions whether the eis or the rod themselves violate nepa,the organic act,or the trust obligations owed to the tribes 
requirements for discussing mitigation in an eis 
nepa requires federal agencies to prepare an eis for each major federal action significantly affecting the quality of human environment.c.the requirement ensures that federal agencies are informed of environmental consequences before making decisions and that the information is available to the public.inland empire pub.lands council united states forest,cir.nepa does not mandate particular substantive results,but instead imposes only procedural requirements.laguna greenbelt,united states dep t of,cir.we review an eis under a rule of reason to determine whether it contains a reasonably thorough discussion of the significant aspects of the probable environmental consequences,at.we must be satisfied that the agency took a hard look at the possible environmental consequences.idaho sporting,at.we must not,however,substitute our judgment for that of the agency.laguna greenbelt,at.

a mitigation plan need not be legally enforceable,funded or even in final form to comply with nepa procedural requirements.national parks conservation ass united states dep t of,cir.we need only be satisfied that the agency took the requisite hard look at the possible mitigating measures but,on the other hand,a perfunctory description is not adequate to satisfy nepa requirements.neighbors of cuddy mountain united states forest,cir.a mere listing of mitigating measures,without supporting analytical data,also is inadequate.idaho sporting,at.
plaintiffs argue that the eis and rod contain inadequate discussions of the measures necessary to mitigate the environmental consequences of the lake,the water overflow from the lake,and the dumps.plaintiffs contend that,although the eis does list potential mitigating measures,the eis fails to include supporting documentation as to the effectiveness,reliability,cost,and feasibility of the listed measures.plaintiffs also argue that the forest service violated nepa and the apa by transferring its duties to state permitting agencies.
discussion of mitigating measures in this eis 
the eis contains an extensive discussion of the potential effects of the project on water quality,both in the lake and in the ground water.the forest service conducted geochemical modeling by computer to predict a the quality of water that would accumulate in the pit and discharge from the lake and b the potential effects of the discharge.the eis predicts that the w ater that would fill and ultimately discharge from the open pit is predicted to exceed the washington fresh water chronic criteria for cadmium,copper,lead,mercury,and selenium and the washington state fresh water acute criteria for silver and selenium.the eis also concludes 
in light of the relatively low flow and short ground water flow path predicted the pit acts as a ground water sink,except for the extreme northeast corner,seepage from the open pit is expected to have a low overall impact on ground water quality in the vicinity of the pit.furthermore,due to the biased assumptions used in the pit water quality study,predicted pit lake pollutant concentrations may overestimate the concentrations that would be observed under field conditions.
the eis discusses monitoring measures that would be required in order to quantify any measurable environmental impacts impacts that result in violations of regulatory stipulations would require alterations of crown jewel project operations or additional mitigation actions.mitigation is discussed separately in section of the eis.the eis uses a rating system to determine the probable effectiveness in achieving the mitigation measures objectives.each mitigation measure is rated high achieves the desired results more than percent of the time,moderate achieves the desired results between and percent of the time,or logic dictates that it is more than effective,but no documentation exists,or low effectiveness is unknown or unverified,or estimated to be less than percent.the eis proposes that potential water discharge problems be mitigated in the following manner 
any water discharged from the crown jewel project site,including the mine pit or collection and infiltration ponds,must meet washington water quality permit requirements and federal water quality standards.if water quality requirements are not met,appropriate water treatment would be required.water treatment may include,but is not limited to 
precipitation and settling using lime,sulfide,ferricion,flocculents 
filtration 
ion exchange 
reverse osmosis 
electrodialysis 
air stripping 
biological precipitation or,
passive wetlands.
water quality problems may also be addressed by diverting discharges to the tailings facility during operations only,or special cap design and construction on waste rock disposal areas or tailings pond embankments.
if water quality problems develop,then several steps would be taken to achieve compliance.these are 
review of environmental impacts with the possibility of additional or increased frequency of monitoring 
implement an interim emergency or long term water management plan to stabilize the situation 
develop a conceptual engineering design of water treatment system alternatives that would be available to remedy the situation and select the most appropriate design for more detailed engineering 
the proponent would prepare a detailed engineering design of the selected alternative the agencies would review and revise,as appropriate,the environmental protection performance security required from the proponent 
undertake appropriate permitting of the selected water treatment system conduct review as appropriate 
construct the selected water treatment system 
operate and maintain the water treatment system to meet design goals 
monitor the water treatment system for compliance and,
achieve a demonstrated clean closure or maintain long term permanent treatment.
goal protect ground and surface water quality in case of unacceptable water discharges.
effectiveness high 
the eis discussion of the mitigating measures required for the lake takes a similar form.the eis notes that the water in the lake would be required to meet washington state aquatic life water quality standards and human health standards.the eis then lists a process for bmg to follow in case the water quality exceeds the state criteria for protecting aquatic life or human health.for example,the eis requires bmg to prepare a conceptual engineering design of water treatment system alternatives that would be available to remedy the situation as prescribed by modeling.the eis notes that any water treatment system implemented by bmg would be subject to agency review and revision and,possibly,to further nepa review.the eis gives those mitigating measures an effectiveness rating of.
the eis also contains a discussion of the possible environmental effects of,and the possible mitigating measures for,the dumps.the eis states that h umidity cell tests and confirmation geochemical testing indicated that to of the total waste rock material mined under alternative b would potentially generate acid and leach metals.potential effects include the leaching of dissolved metals,radionuclides,and nitrate into ground water and increases in sediment loading to streams.a more extensive analysis of the effects of the waste rock,based on computer modeling,is found in section of the eis at to.the eis states that,i f needed,an underdrain french drain system would be installed to intercept any spring and seep flow from the leaching of material.during operations,all water draining from,or through,waste rock areas would be collected in sediment traps.water collected in the ponds would be allowed to seep into the ground water system if quality is suitable.the eis concludes that impacts to ground water quality from the waste rock disposal areas are not expected to be substantial.impacts are expected to be somewhat less than during operations.
the eis discusses,in a format like the one previously described,potential measures to mitigate the adverse effects of the dumps 
the proponent would be required to develop a waste rock management plan as part of crown jewel project permitting.this plan would address the potential for formation of acid generating hot spots and prevention of acid rock drainage.the plan must be approved by the washington department of ecology,washington department of natural resources,blm,and forest service prior to approval of the npdes permit.the blm and forest service would require this waste rock management plan prior to movement of waste rock as part of the plans of operations.
the eis explains that the management plan must contain certain features,such as the procedures that would be used to handle,isolate,encapsulate blend waste rock that exhibits acid generating potential.those measures are given an effectiveness rating of high.
nepa analysis 
adequacy of the discussion of mitigating measures 
the trial court did not err in ruling that,under the applicable standard of review,the eis contains a reasonable discussion of mitigation.the eis contains a thorough discussion of the potential adverse environmental effects of the project.the forest service took the requisite hard look at those potential problems and required bmg to monitor the actual effects of the project throughout its life.the eis provides methods for ensuring that environmental problems do not develop.for example,if there is a decrease in water quality,the eis provides procedures for ensuring compliance with applicable standards.the procedures are in bullet form and are stated in somewhat general terms,but this format is not deficient in the circumstances the exact environmental problems that will have to be mitigated are not yet known because the project does not exist.the eis also requires bmg to post a security deposit to ensure compliance with environmental standards.
we realize that the line between an eis that contains an adequate discussion of mitigation measures and one that contains a mere listing is not well defined.in cuddy mountain,the eis for a proposed sale of timber contained the following discussion of mitigation measures s mall increases in sedimentation would be mitigated by improvements in fish habitat in other drainages offsetting mitigation would include such projects as riparian enclosures fences around riparian areas to keep cattle out and fish passage restoration removing fish passage blockages.these activities can be effective but can not be quantified with present data.at.we held that the forest service perfunctory description of the mitigating measures was inadequate.id.
by contrast,in methow valley,the supreme court analyzed the adequacy of an eis that examined the environmental impact of a proposed ski resort on national forest land.the eis stated that the proposed project would not have a measurable effect on existing air quality,but that the development of private land would have a significant effect on air quality.the eis then identified potential actions that could be taken by the county governments to mitigate those adverse impacts,including the development of an management plan.the circuit court held that the eis was inadequate because the effectiveness of the mitigation measures had not been assessed,and the measures themselves had yet to be developed.methow valley,at.the supreme court reversed.id.at.
the supreme court noted that an eis without a reasonably complete discussion of possible mitigation measures would undermine the function of nepa.id.at.there is a fundamental distinction,however,between a requirement that mitigation be discussed in sufficient detail to ensure that environmental consequences have been fairly evaluated,on the one hand,and a substantive requirement that a complete mitigation plan be actually formulated and adopted,on the other.id.the court concluded that,because the eis predicted that the environmental impacts would be minimal,the proposed measures can not be deemed overly vague or underdeveloped.id.at.
the difference between the discussion of proposed mitigation measures in methow valley and that in cuddy mountain appears to be one of degree.in cuddy mountain,this court read the eis as suggesting that the forest service did not even consider mitigating measures for the creeks actually affected by the sale.at emphasis added.by contrast,the eis in the present case suggests that the forest service did consider and take a hard look at the environmental effects and mitigating measures.the eis predicts that the environmental effects from the mine on ground water will be minimal,but extensive monitoring will be required nonetheless.the eis then proposes several ways to prevent overflow from the lake from affecting water quality.if those measures are unsuccessful,the eis then provides a process for achieving compliance with standards.similar processes are described for achieving compliance with standards in the lake itself and in the dumps.each mitigating process was evaluated separately and given an effectiveness rating.
it is true that the mitigating measures are described in general terms and rely on general processes,not on specific substantive requirements.in the forest service responses to comments from the environmental protection agency on the draft eis,the forest service explained that,
s ince it is not possible to predict exactly what water quality will be,it is difficult to predict what exact mitigation will be necessary.we have set up a procedure to determine specific mitigation or treatment,if any,is required.moreover,a performance security which assumes treatment of the pit discharge water is necessary,will be collected prior to development.
because the actual adverse effects are uncertain,and the eis considered extensively the potential effects and mitigation processes,we conclude that the present case is closer to methow valley.accordingly,we hold that the discussion of mitigating measures in the eis is adequate.
alleged delegation to state agencies 
next,plaintiffs argue that the forest service deferred to state agencies its responsibility for reviewing mitigation measures.the record and our case law answer that argument.
the eis sections on mitigating measures do refer,as a mere statement of fact,to state permitting agencies and requirements.see,eis at water in the pit lake would be required to meet washington state aquatic life water quality standards.however,those sections go on to consider and discuss mitigation responsibilities directly and at length.see,id.the proponent would prepare a detailed engineering design of the preferred alternative.
the fact that the eis acknowledges that the project will be forced to comply with pollution permitting requirements is not,by itself,arbitrary or capricious.city county of san francisco united states,cir noting that the navy decision not to prepare an eis was reasonable when the candidate eis noted that the lessee would be required to conform to all applicable pollution control laws and regulations as a condition of tenancy.such an acknowledgment does not,without more,shift the forest service responsibility to state agencies.
c.the organic act 
plaintiffs next argue that the forest service violated its duty to prevent destruction of the national forest system lands and to minimize adverse environmental impacts,as required by the organic act,and,and.plaintiffs contend that the organic act and required the forest service to select alternative c,the most environmentally preferable,but still profitable,project alternative.we disagree.
