opinion of the court 
portland generating station portland is a megawatt,electricity generating plant located in upper mount bethel township in northampton county,pennsylvania.portland is directly across the delaware river within feet of knowlton township in warren county,new jersey.the epa has found that portland emits sulfur dioxide in amounts that significantly interfere with the control of air pollution across state borders.sulfur dioxide is a toxic air pollutant that endangers life and health,causing burning of the nose and throat,difficulty breathing,and obstruction of the lungs and airways because of its location,portland sulfur dioxide emissions travel directly across the river into areas of new jersey.in response to a petition under the clean air act,the epa issued a rule imposing direct limits on portland emissions and a schedule of restrictions to reduce its contribution to air pollution within three years.genon rema,llc genon,the owner and operator of portland,challenges the epa rule as inconsistent with the agency authority under the clean air act and as arbitrary and capricious.we will uphold the rule and deny genon petition for review.
background 
statutory background 
the clean air act authorizes the environmental protection agency the epa to establish air quality standards and empowers the states to achieve those standards.concerned citizens of bridesburg epa,cir internal citations omitted.this cooperative federalism structure is a defining feature of the statute.appalachian power epa.the clean air act gives the epa authority to establish national ambient air quality standards naaqs for certain pervasive air pollutants to protect public health and welfare.under section of the clean air act,states are required to implement naaqs through state implementation plans sips that specify how naaqs will be achieved and maintained in the state.id.states must adopt and submit sips to the epa that provide for the implementation,maintenance,and enforcement of naaqs within their borders no later than three years after the epa promulgates a particular naaqs id.a.
if the epa approves the sips,they become enforceable as federal law.id.if the epa finds that a sip is inadequate to attain or maintain a naaqs or otherwise does not comply with the clean air act,the epa issues a sip call requiring the state to submit a revised sip to correct the inadequacies.id.k.the epa may also promulgate a federal implementation plan fip to establish direct federal controls on sources of air pollution if the epa disapproves a sip in whole or in part,or finds that a state has failed to submit either a sip or sip revision.id.c.
section b of the clean air act allows downwind states to petition the epa for a finding that a source in an upwind state affects the petitioning state attainment or maintenance of naaqs due to air pollution emanating from the source in the upwind state.see id.b.section b of the clean air act provides 
any state or political subdivision may petition the epa for a finding that any major source or group of stationary sources emits or would emit any air pollutant in violation of the prohibition of section a d ii of this title or this section.within days after receipt of any petition under this subsection and after public hearing,the epa shall make such a finding or deny the petition.
in turn,section a d i,also known as the good neighbor provision,prohibits sources or emissions activity within a state from emitting air pollutants in amounts that will 
i contribute significantly to nonattainment in,or interfere with maintenance by,any other state with respect to any such national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard,or 
ii interfere with measures required to be included in the applicable implementation plan for any other state to prevent significant deterioration of air quality or to protect visibility.
if the epa finds,pursuant to a section b petition,that the upwind state is violating the good neighbor provision of the clean air act,the polluting source must cease operations within three months of the epa finding.id.c.the epa may,however,allow the source to continue operations beyond three months if the source complies with such emission limitations and compliance schedules containing increments of progress as the epa deems necessary to reach the compliance requirements.id.
naaqs regulating sulfur dioxide emissions 
sulfur dioxide,or,is a highly reactive colorless gas that derives mainly from fossil fuel combustion.am.lung ass epa.it smells like rotten eggs and causes acid rain at elevated concentrations in the air.id.the presence of sulfur dioxide in the air creates adverse health effects,especially for people with asthma.id.on june,the epa revised the naaqs that had previously regulated sulfur dioxide emissions to enact stricter standards and ensure the continued protection of public health with an adequate margin of safety.primary national ambient air quality standard for sulfur dioxide,june,to be codified at pts,hour naaqs.specifically,the epa replaced the hour and the annual standards that had been in place with a new,more stringent standard that sets the level of sulfur dioxide emissions at ppb parts per billion per the hour.id.hour naaqs became effective on august.as part of the implementation process of the hour naaqs,states are required to submit their sips by june and to achieve attainment,implementation,maintenance,and enforcement of the naaqs by august.id.at.
c.the new jersey department of environmental protection section b petition 
on september,the state of new jersey department of environmental protection the nj department filed a petition under section b of the clean air act,b,the section b petition,requesting that the epa issue an order restricting sulfur dioxide emissions from portland.specifically,the nj department requested that the epa make a finding that the sulfur dioxide emissions from the nearby portland plant significantly contribute to nonattainment interfere with maintenance of the hour naaqs in new jersey.in support of its petition,the nj department submitted air quality and aerial dispersion modeling to show that emissions from portland cause violations of the hour naaqs in warren,sussex,morris,and hunterdon counties in new jersey.
on april,the epa published a proposed response to the nj department section b petition,finding that sulfur dioxide emissions from portland violate the interstate air pollution transport provisions of the clean air act and suggesting emissions limitations and compliance schedules to remedy the problem.see response to petition from new jersey regarding emissions from the portland generating station,to be codified at pt.proposed rule.the epa invited public comments on the proposed rule and announced a public hearing to be held on april,in warren county,new jersey.the epa received numerous public comments from inter alia,individuals,government officials,environmental groups,the pennsylvania department of environmental protection,the nj department,genon,and the american lung association of the mid atlantic.many of these comments favored the proposed rule.the pennsylvania department of environmental protection submitted a comment in which it acknowledged that residents of pennsylvania would realize public health and environmental benefits from a reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions but suggested some alterations to the proposed compliance schedule.
on november,the epa issued its final rule granting the nj department section b petition,which finds that portland sulfur dioxide emissions significantly contribute to nonattainment and interfere with maintenance of the hour naaqs in new jersey.see final response to petition from new jersey regarding emissions from the portland generating station,to be codified at pt.portland rule.the epa authorized the continued operation of portland but imposed emissions limits and compliance schedules to bring portland into compliance as expeditiously as practicable.
the epa based its finding on a review of the nj department air quality modeling,its independent assessment of the american meteorological protection agency regulatory model aermod dispersion modeling,and other highly technical analyses.portland rule.at.the portland rule requires portland to reduce its sulfur dioxide emissions by approximately at its two generating units within three years of the rule effective date and to adhere to interim sulfur dioxide emissions limits to ensure that portland demonstrates the requisite increments of progress towards achieving final compliance.portland rule.at.
genon petitioned for our review of the portland rule,challenging the epa authority to impose direct regulations on portland before the time that pennsylvania is required to complete its section sip process for the hour naaqs.genon contends that this action offends the cooperative federalism structure of the clean air act by undermining a state power to determine how to achieve air control standards.
ii.analysis 
this court has jurisdiction pursuant to section b of the clean air act,which allows us to review a final epa action that is locally or regionally applicable within our circuit.b see harrison ppg,penn power epa,cir.because the portland rule affects a facility located in the commonwealth of pennsylvania and its repercussions affect counties in the state of new jersey,we have jurisdiction to review this matter.although section l of the portland rule,entitled judicial review,indicates that petitions for review must be filed in the circuit,the parties agree that this was noted in error.jurisdiction in the circuit is appropriate only for specifically enumerated epa actions and for regulations with national scope or impact.id.the portland rule neither fits into the enumerated epa actions nor is of nationwide scope or effect that would make jurisdiction in the circuit proper.
we are asked to consider whether the prohibition against transmitting interstate air pollutants that is referenced in section b relates to emissions limitations that are specifically contained in the section sip of the upwind state or,more generally,to all interstate air pollution.genon and the utility air regulatory group uarg contending the former,view the section b petition process as expressly linked to the sip requirement of section a d i,arguing that there can be no valid section b petition until pennsylvania is afforded an opportunity to establish its sip for the hour naaqs and has failed to do so.the epa,however,agrees with the latter approach,claiming that it can make a finding on a section b petition without regard to the section sip process.
we follow the chevron framework when reviewing an administrative agency construction of a statute.hagans comm r of soc,cir.if the statute is clear,we give effect to the unambiguous expressed intent of congress.de leon ochoa att y of,cir citing chevron,natural res.def council.however,if the statute is silent or ambiguous regarding a specific issue,we move to step two and give deference to the implementing agency reasonable construction of the statute.id.
chevron step one 
we begin by determining whether congress has unambiguously expressed its intent by examining the plain and literal language of the statute.united states geiser,cir internal citations omitted.to determine whether the statutory language is ambiguous,we must examine the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.rosenberg xm ventures,cir internal citations omitted.we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence,but look to the provisions of the whole law,and to its object and policy.prestol espinal att y of,cir internal citations and quotations omitted.
the operative language of clean air act section b is that a petition under this section may be granted when a major source or group of stationary sources emits air pollutants in violation of the prohibition of section a d i.b.the language of section a d i states that each sip for primary or secondary naaqs shall contain adequate provisions prohibiting emissions activity within the s tate from contribut ing significantly to nonattainment in,or interfer ing with maintenance by,any other s tate with respect to such naaqs or interfer ing with measures required to be included in the applicable sip for any other s tate to prevent significant deterioration of air quality or to protect visibility.id.a d i.
while genon contends that the prohibition refers to a violation of an emissions limitation specific to the section sip of the upwind state,its argument fails to take into account the entirety of the statutory scheme.when we consider the applicable language of the clean air act in light of the overall statute and its interplay with other related sections,we conclude that the relevant language of the statute is unambiguous.
section b contains no temporal limitation on a state right to petition the epa.this section obligates the epa to grant or deny a section b petition w ithin days after receipt and after public hearing.id.b.this language demonstrates that the epa must act quickly on a section b petition and not wait the potential several years that it would take for states to fully adopt sips implementing new naaqs.as the epa has correctly expressed,nothing in the statutory language in section prohibits a downwind state from filing a section petition until after an upwind state,in which the source or sources are located,has submitted,or is required to submit,a section a d sip to the epa for approval.portland rule.at.we also agree with the epa that there is no indication anywhere in the text of section that a section b petition is conditional upon the initiation or completion of the sip process.if such a condition were present,section b petitions could stand still for several years until the sip relating to a new naaqs is adopted by a state,approved by the epa,and all necessary revisions to it have been made.such a result violates the statute requirement that the epa act on section b petitions within sixty days.
the language of section c also supports our view.this section provides that it shall be a violation of this section and the applicable implementation plan in such state for any major existing source to operate more than three months after such section b finding has been made with respect to it.c emphasis added.we agree with the epa that the underlined language would serve no purpose if we were to adopt genon view since there would have been no need for congress to separately state under section c that a section b finding constitutes a sip violation if operation of the polluting source continues.it is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute ought,upon the whole,to be so construed that,if it can be prevented,no clause,sentence,or word shall be superfluous,void,or insignificant.trw andrews,internal citations and quotations omitted.
our conclusion that the language of the statute is unambiguous is also supported by the circuit examination of three specific provisions of section b in appalachian power epa.in appalachian,several states submitted section b petitions requesting that the epa regulate sources emitting nitrogen oxide that contributed significantly to downwind air pollution in those states.id.at.the epa ultimately issued a rule under section b requiring upwind sources to conform to certain emissions limits and engage in an emissions trading program.id.at.at the time that the epa issued this rule,the upwind states were also subject to an ongoing section nitrogen oxide sip call previously issued by the epa,requiring deadlines by which these states had to revise their sips to comply with nitrogen oxide emissions reductions.id.at.certain petitioners contested the epa section b rule and,specifically,the epa interpretation of the interplay between sections and b of the clean air act.id.at.the petitioners contended that sections and b prevented the epa from making any section b findings while the nitrogen oxide sip call was ongoing because allowing the epa to act in these circumstances would amount to a violation of the cooperative federalism structure of the clean air act that gives states primary responsibility to address interstate transport in the first instance.id.the circuit rejected this argument.recognizing that states indeed retain the power under section to determine how to achieve naaqs and that the epa may not dictate to a state a specific means to do so,the circuit held that this principle can not be absolute in the face of,which contemplates that in at least some circumstances the epa will directly regulate sources within a state.id.at.
the court in appalachian reasoned that three critical provisions of would lose their force if,as the petitioners suggest,the lengthened timetable of the nitrogen oxide sip call were to suspend the process.id.at.first,section requirement that a source contributing to downwind nonattainment may not operate for more than three years after such finding would be eliminated if the epa had to wait for completion of the sip process to make section findings.id.the second reason is that section provides for relief independent of any action by the upwind state,while a sip revision requires action from that state.id.third,relief under section,unlike sip calls,is independent of the discretionary policy preferences of the epa since it must act on a petition within sixty days.id.these provisions support our view that the statute unambiguously allows the epa to make a section finding independently of the section sip process.
in response to the petitioners argument that the epa construction would effectively deprive section of its force by binding states to emissions limits set by the epa and not by their own sip,the court in appalachian responded that it has never been suggested that under section,states may develop their plans free of extrinsic legal constraints.id.sip development,like any environmental planning process,commonly involves decisionmaking subject to various legal constraints.that imposes one such limitation and it is surely not the only independent provision of federal law to do so does not affect a state discretion under.id.
this line of reasoning supports our conclusion that the language of the clean air act regarding the interplay of section b and section is unambiguous.the plain language of the relevant portions of the statute and the context in which such language is used convey that congress intended section b as a means for the epa to take immediate action when downwind states are affected by air pollution from upwind sources.any other interpretation would defeat the underlying objective of the section b petition process.for these reasons,we conclude that the plain language of the statute is unambiguous and supports the epa issuance of the portland rule.
given the novelty of the issue before us,we find it appropriate to engage in an in the alternative analysis where we conduct step two of chevron to determine whether the epa has reasonably construed the statute.see pennsylvania dep t of pub.welfare u.dep of health human,cir conducting the second step of the chevron analysis even after finding the statute unambiguous.even if the relevant language of the clean air act were deemed ambiguous,we still find that the epa action was proper.
chevron step two 
under step two of the chevron framework,we consider whether the epa interpretation is reasonable in light of the language,policies,and legislative history of the clean air act.united states riverside bayview homes.while genon and uarg argue that the clean air act legislative history emphasizes the concept of cooperative federalism,including states primary responsibility in implementing regulations promulgated by the epa,this view is not dispositive to our determination of reasonableness.we neither disagree that the clean air act is structured on cooperative federalism nor seek to minimize the essential role that the states play in this process.rather,we believe that reliance on the clean air act legislative history that promotes the concept of cooperative federalism does not assist us in examining the rationale behind the enactment of section b itself.
congress enacted section b as part of the clean air act amendments of,stat.in a report accompanying its version of the bill,the house of representatives recognized that the law prior to had inadequately addressed the problem of interstate air pollution and that an effective program must rely on the state that actually receives the pollution and has an incentive and need to act,at,reprinted in legislative history of the clean air act amendments of,at.the house of representatives report states that section b would remedy this problem so that any state could petition the epa for a finding that any new,modified,or existing stationary source in any other s tate is or would be emitting pollutants which cause or contribute to impermissible interstate air pollution.id.in doing so,the house of representatives acknowledged that the section mechanism would be a separate and alternative method for states to address interstate air pollution.id.at.
a section petition process is intended to expedite,not delay,resolution of interstate pollution conflicts t he committee intends to create a second and entirely alternative method and basis for preventing and abating interstate pollution.the existing provision prohibiting any stationary source from causing or contributing to air pollution which interferes with timely attainment or maintenance or a national ambient air standard or a prevention of significant deteriorating or visibility protection plan in another state is retained.a new provision prohibiting any source from emitting any pollutant after the administrator has made the requisite finding and granted the petition is an independent basis for controlling interstate air pollution.
id.emphasis added.
additionally,the house of representatives report indicated that an effective program addressing the problem of interstate air pollution must include a federal mechanism for resolving disputes which can not be decided through cooperation and consultation between the states or persons involved.id.at.
a report of the senate committee on environment and public works accompanying the clean air act amendments similarly explained that the previous structure that had been in place to address interstate pollution created a disadvantage for states that had stricter air pollution control requirements,at,reprinted in legislative history of the clean air act amendments of,at.the senate committee offered the example of the state of ohio,which,despite being ordered by the amendments to the clean air act to implement a plan to reduce emissions that would interfere with air quality standards,had not done so by.id.at.this situation caused emissions from plants in ohio to be transported across the ohio river to west virginia,which was forced to cope with pollution not generated by a source under its own control requiring more stringent control of west virginia sources to attain the ambient air quality standards.id.at.the committee concluded 
in the absence of interstate abatement procedures,those plants in states with more stringent control requirements are at a distinct economic and competitive disadvantage.section b is intended to equalize the positions of the states with respect to interstate pollution by making a source at least as responsible for polluting another state as it would be for polluting its own state.
this legislative history demonstrates that congress viewed the federal government as continuing to play an essential role in the fight against interstate pollution despite the fact that the states are the primary actors for implementing naaqs and formulating sips.congress recognized the importance of ensuring that the federal government maintain its role in managing interstate air pollution,as the entity that can and must provide the technical information and enforcement assistance that states and localities need.id.at.thus,we conclude that section b was intended to allow the epa,as a federal regulator,to intervene when states fail to adhere to the air pollution control process.this interpretation supports the epa construction of the statute.
existing case law also supports the notion that the epa has reasonably construed the statute.in new york epa,the circuit interpreted a section b
