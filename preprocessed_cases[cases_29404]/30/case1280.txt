plaintiff forest guardians brought this action under the freedom of information act foia,seeking to compel defendant federal emergency management agency fema to produce electronic mapping files that identify the location of structures insured under fema national flood insurance program nfip.the nfip is a federally subsidized program that provides flood insurance to property owners located in flood plain areas with the participation of private insurance companies.see b,c.fema administers the nfip and is responsible for,among other things,providing and updating flood maps.see id.f,g.the district court granted fema for summary judgment concluding that plaintiff foia request was exempt from disclosure under foia exemption,b,which excludes personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.plaintiff appeals,arguing the district court erred in concluding exemption applied.according to plaintiff,the substantial public interest in the information it requested from fema far outweighs any de minimis privacy interest that may exist.we have jurisdiction,review the district court foia determination de novo,see herrick garvey,cir,and affirm.
plaintiff is a organization devoted to promoting environmental conservation.the organization is currently studying the loss of endangered species in flood plain areas.plaintiff posits the nfip encourages excessive development in flood plain areas.specifically,according to plaintiff,the issuance of flood insurance policies under the nfip facilitates development that results in significant harm to new mexico natural resources.
plaintiff filed a foia request with fema in january foia request.in the foia request,plaintiff sought to obtain information regarding fema efforts to comply with numerous federal environment laws while allowing local communities to participate in the nfip.plaintiff requested the n ames and addresses of all insurance who obtain flood insurance via fema nfip.plaintiff limited its request to new mexico residents who have property within the floodplains of the rio grande and san juan river.fema partially granted plaintiff foia request.the agency explained it would not disclose policyholders names because such a disclosure would clearly invade the privacy of an individual under exemption.
in the alternative,however,fema provided plaintiff with sixteen geographic information system gis maps of the communities that have a flood hazard designated by fema where the flooding source is the san juan,animas,or rio grande rivers.in describing the information contained in the gis maps,fema specifically noted 
on these gis maps,fema has displayed digitized data showing the designated special flood hazard area sfha and geocoded flood insurance policy data.the geocoded flood policy information shows the general location of structures relative to the floodplain and whether the structure insured was constructed before or after the community participated in the nfip.these maps show the entire communities not just the floodplains located within them.
thereafter,plaintiff filed a second foia request with fema,which is the subject of this appeal,on april,foia request.in the foia request,plaintiff sought 
electronic gis files for the communities that have a flood hazard designated by fema where the flooding source is the san juan,animas,or rio grande rivers,showing all of the geocoded flood insurance policy data with names and addresses removed including the location of structures relative to the floodplain and whether the structure insured was constructed before or after the community participated in the nfip.please include the entire community,and not just the floodplains located within them.we are essentially requesting that your agency provide the electronic data equivalent to what we received in printed form from fema in response to our original january,foia request.
fema denied plaintiff second request under exemption.fema first indicated it had already provided plaintiff the information in printed form.second,fema claimed the electronic gis files contained personal identifying information and,even with the names and addresses redacted,could be used to determine the addresses of policyholders based on the gis point locations with a reasonable level of confidence.in particular,disclosure of the electronic files could lead to the discovery of an individual name,address,and ownership interest in property,the level of flood risk to property,and the type of insurance and financing on property.plaintiff sued fema after the agency denied its foia request,seeking to compel disclosure of the electronic gis files.
foia facilitates public access to government documents.united states dep t of state ray,d.a strong presumption exists in favor of disclosure under foia and the government bears the burden of justifying the withholding of any requested documents.sheet metal workers intern.ass united states air force,cir.public access to government information is not,however.id.access is permitted only to information that sheds light upon the government performance of its duties.id.internal citation omitted.
foia contains nine exemptions which,if applicable,preclude disclosure of certain types of information.b.exemption prohibits the disclosure of information in personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.b.similar files under exemption has a broad,rather than a narrow,meaning and encompasses all information that applies to a particular individual.united states department of state washington post,d.
we apply a balancing test to determine whether disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy under exemption.see united states dep t of defense flra,d.a court must balance the public interest in disclosure against the privacy interest congress intended the e xemption to protect.see also federal labor relations auth.united states dep t of defense,cir.if there is an important public interest in the disclosure of information and the invasion of privacy is not substantial,the private interest in protecting the disclosure must yield to the superior public interest.alirez nlrb,cir.if,however,the public interest in the information is virtually nonexistent or negligible,then even a very slight privacy interest would suffice to outweigh the relevant public interest.flra,at.see also dep t of defense,at.e ven a minimal privacy interest outweighs a nonexistent public interest.dep t of defense,at emphasis added.
the public interest to be weighed in exemption balancing test is the extent to which disclosure would serve the core purpose of foia.see flra,at.the core purpose of foia is,of course,to contribute to the public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.id.emphasis in original,internal citation omitted.t he purposes for which the request for information is made has no bearing on whether information must be disclosed under foia.bibles oregon desert ass n,d per curiam.rather,the relevant inquiry is whether the requested information directly relates to and would facilitate the primary purpose of foia,which is to let citizens know what their government is up to.sheet metal,at quoting united states dep t of justice reporters,d.
the type of privacy interests congress intended to protect under exemption encompass the individual control of information concerning his or her person.flra,at.internal citation omitted.such private information includes,for example,an individual name and home address.see id.at.indicating individuals have some privacy interest in their home addresses sheet metal,at recognizing a substantial privacy interest in personal identifying information,such as names and addresses dep t of defense,at same.the privacy interest in an individual home address becomes even more substantial when that information would be coupled with personal financial information.sheet metal,at.
