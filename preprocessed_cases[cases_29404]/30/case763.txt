in,the national marine fisheries service nmfs and the pacific fishery management council pacific council or council adopted changes to the fishery management plan for the trawl sector of the pacific coast groundfish fishery.the changes,adopted as amendments and to the pacificcoast groundfish fishery management plan,are designed to increase economic efficiency through fleet consolidation,reduce environmental impacts,and simplify future decisionmaking.
plaintiffs appellants pacific coast federation of fishermen associations,et plaintiffs are a collection of primarily fishermen associations and groups whose longtime participation in the fishery may shrink under amendments and.they argue that the amendments are unlawful under the magnuson stevens fishery conservation and management act msa,which imposes procedural and substantive requirements for managing fisheries,and the national environmental policy act nepa,which imposes purely procedural requirements for reviewing the potential environmental effects of proposed agency actions.
the district court,which had jurisdiction pursuant to d and,granted summary judgment to the defendants.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm.complied with the msa provisions,which required the agency to consider fishing communities but did not require it to develop criteria for allocating fishing privileges to such communities or to restrict privileges to those who substantially participate in the fishery.nmfs also complied with nepa by preparing a separate study for each amendment,analyzing a reasonable range of alternatives,adequately evaluating potential environmental effects,and adopting flexible mitigation measures designed,in part,to lessen the potential adverse effects of amendments and on fishing communities.the plaintiffs reasonably disagree with the balance nmfs struck between competing objectives,but they do not show that nmfs exceeded its statutory authority under the msa or ignored its obligations under nepa.
background 
statutory and regulatory.the msaa.fishery management plans 
the msa establishes eight fishery management councils composed of fishing representatives and government and tribal officials.the councils are charged with preparing fishery management plans for fisheries that require conservation and management.id.h.plans must contain measures to prevent overfishing and rebuild overfished stocks,id.a a,and assess and specify,among other things,the optimum yield from each fishery,id.a see also defining optimum yield.
to the extent measures are necessary to reduce overall harvest to prevent overfishing,a fishery management plan must allocate any harvest restrictions fairly and equitably among the commercial and recreational sectors that participate in the fishery.a.plans may include restrictions on fish catch or gear types,establish a limited access system in order to achieve optimum yield,or include any other measures determined to be necessary and appropriate for the conservation and management of the fishery.id.b.plans must comply with ten national standards.id.a,a c,a a.as relevant here,national standard requires that c onservation and management measures shall be based upon the best scientific information available.id.a see also b.national standard requires that 
c onservation and management measures shall,consistent with the conservation requirements of this chapter including the prevention of overfishing and rebuilding of overfished stocks,take into account the importance of fishery resources to fishing communities by utilizing economic and social data that meet the requirements of national standard,in order to a provide for the sustained participation of such communities,and b to the extent practicable,minimize adverse economic impacts on such communities.

limited access programs 
beginning in,the fishery management councils began to regulate certain fisheries by adopting programs limiting those who could enter and participate in the fisheries.see b authorizing limited access system s in order to achieve optimum yield.these programs were referred to as individual fishing quota programs,under which individual fishery participants received privileges to harvest a specific quantity of fish.
in,congress imposed a temporary moratorium on new quota programs until the national academy of sciences studied those programs and their effects on fishing communities,f,stat.the resulting report concluded that quota programs can be effective solutions to a host of problems,including economic inefficiency,overcapitalization too many resources directed at too few fish,and overfishing,but that such programs also can have serious adverse impacts on fishing communities.the report ultimately recommended lifting the quota moratorium,subject to the report guidance.the report noted that quota programs are most likely to be successful when their objectives are clear and there is broad stakeholder support and participation.finally,the report emphasized the need for quota programs to be designed on a basis.
in,congress reauthorized the msa and lifted the quota moratorium by adding a section that authorizes limited access privilege programs,stat,codified at.under such programs,of which quota programs are a subset,fishery participants receive privileges or,in the case of quota programs,quota shares to harvest a certain portion of the total catch allowed for a particular species.nmfs and the fishery management councils must structure limited access programs in accordance with various requirements,some of which concern fishing communities and form the basis of the plaintiffs arguments in this case.see infra discussion,a discussing c.

factual background 
the pacific groundfish fishery 
the pacific groundfish fishery extends miles into the pacific ocean,along the coasts of california,oregon,and washington,and includes more than species of fish that dwell near the sea floor.fishers use many different types of gear,including trawl nets nets dragged by boats along the sea floor,traps,and longlines,but trawls dominate.the trawl sector consists of two fisheries,one targeting pacific whiting hake and another targeting species.the sector includes fishers who use what is called fixed gear,such as longlines and pots,and primarily targets.
every two years,the pacific council establishes catch limits,called optimum yields or annual catch limits,which represent an annual quantity of fish that the groundfish fishery as a whole may catch.catch limits are divided among different sectors of the fishery,such as between trawlers and fixed gear fishers these divisions are called allocations.prior to amendments and,the council enforced catch limits primarily by regulating the number of fishing trips.the council also used gear restrictions and seasonal and area closures.through trip limits the council was able to measure and restrict harvests,but it was not able to comprehensively measure or limit bycatch,which refers to and often overfished species that are incidentally caught and discarded.indeed,before amendments and,bycatch was recorded on only of trawl fishing trips.
in fisheries like the pacific groundfish fishery,harvests of healthy species are constrained by measures to protect overfished species,even if those species are not targeted by any particular fishery.the result is harvests.between and,seven species were designated as overfished and have since had very low catch limits.see nrdc evans,d.the council has made various efforts over the years to achieve optimum yields in the trawl fishery while reducing adverse impacts to these overfished species.nonetheless,biological,social,and economic concerns have remained,and the fishery has continued to be viewed as unsustainable.
amendments and 
in,the pacific council set out to develop a program for better managing the pacific groundfish fishery.the council ultimately settled on a goal to 
c reate and implement a capacity rationalization plan that increases net economic benefits,creates individual economic stability,provides for full utilization of the trawl sector allocation,considers environmental impacts,and achieves individual accountability of catch and bycatch 
the council also set other goals,such as simplifying the process for making allocations and reducing pacific halibut bycatch.
work on a plan to achieve these goals began in earnest in,with public workshops,council meetings,and structuring of alternative courses of action.the council decided to divide its goals into two proposals,one for rationalization of the trawl sector and another for allocations and pacific halibut bycatch.accordingly,nmfs prepared a separate draft and final eis for each proposal,evaluating alternatives,considering the alternatives potential environmental and economic consequences,and discussing possible mitigation.the public was invited to comment on each version of each eis,as well as on all proposed and final rules.see pacific coast groundfish fishery management plan,amendments and,trawl rationalization program,codified at pt.
in august,nmfs approved preferred alternative as amendment,and various preferred alternatives as amendment.nmfs issued regulations codifying the amendments about two months later.at.amendment trawl rationalization divides the trawl fishery into three and then assigns a discrete number of fishing privileges within each sector.for the sector,privileges are initially allocated based on catch history and then become freely transferable after two years.liberal transferability is expected to yield economic efficiency and bycatch reductions,but it also may force out participants from local fishing communities by consolidating privileges and making them more expensive.all trawl vessels must employ observers who measure the number of target fish caught and the number of fish discarded as bycatch.finally,amendment includes various measures to reduce adverse impacts to fishing communities.see infra discussion,b.
besides limiting pacific halibut bycatch,amendment intersector allocation does various things to support amendment,the most important of which is to fix allocations of groundfish stocks among the various trawl and sectors.for other species,the pacific council will continue to assign allocations every two years.amendments and were implemented on january.see.at pacific coast groundfish fishery management plan,amendments and,trawl rationalization program,codified at pt.
procedural background 
the plaintiffs filed suit in october.in january,the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint alleging that amendment limited access program violated by failing to protect and promote the interests of fishing communities,specifically by failing to develop procedures that would have allowed such communities to receive an initial allocation of privileges the program violated by failing to restrict the authority to receive and hold privileges to those who substantially participate in the fishery nmfs violated various msa national standards in approving amendments and and nmfs violated nepa in studying the amendments.
the district court granted the plaintiffs request to expedite the case under f,and,after a hearing,granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all claims.pac.coast fed of fishermen ass locke,wl,unpublished.the court held that nmfs met its statutory obligations to fishing communities under the msa,was not required to restrict privileges to those who substantially participate in the fishery,followed applicable national standards,and complied with nepa.nmfs,the court wrote,could have gone about the process of developing amendments and differently and perhaps avoided at least some of the issues presently before the court.id.at.however,the court is not called upon to decide whether a different process might have been utilized or whether the path ultimately chosen is the wisest policy.id.

discussion 
nmfs complied with the msa.nmfs met its statutory obligations to fishing communities.
section c of the msa,entitled requirements for limited access privileges,contains various provisions related to fishing communities.among other things,to be eligible to participate in a limited access program,fishing communities must meet criteria developed by the relevant council and approved by the secretary and develop and submit a community sustainability plan.c a i.in developing participation criteria,the pacific council must consider factors such as traditional fishing practices,the cultural and social framework relevant to the fishery,economic barriers to access,and economic and social impacts from the limited access program on persons and businesses.id.c b.
section c also requires nmfs to establish procedures to ensure fair and equitable initial allocations of privileges.such procedures must include consideration of current and past harvests,employment in the harvesting and processing sectors,investments in and dependent on the fishery,and the current and historical participation of fishing communities.id.c a.in addition,nmfs must 
b consider the basic cultural and social framework of the fishery,especially through 
i the development of policies to promote the sustained participation of small fishing vessels and fishing communities that depend on the fisheries and 
ii procedures to address concerns over excessive geographic or other consolidation in the harvesting or processing sectors of the fishery.
id.c b.nmfs also must 
include measures to assist,when necessary and appropriate,and small vessel,captains,crew,and fishing communities through of harvesting allocations,including providing privileges,which may include or allocations of harvesting privileges,or economic assistance in the purchase of limited access privileges.
id.c c.finally,nmfs must ensure that limited access privilege holders do not acquire an excessive share of the total limited access privileges in the program by establishing a maximum share and any other limitations or measures necessary,and must authorize privileges to be held,acquired,used by,or issued under the system to persons who substantially participate in the fishery.id.c d e.
the plaintiffs argue that the preceding provisions required nmfs to develop criteria for ensuring that quota shares are distributed to fishing communities,and adopt other measures and policies to ensure the sustained participation of fishing communities.nmfs responds that c only required it to consider the sustained participation of fishing communities against other objectives,including by developing optional participation criteria or other measures,and that in any event amendments and adequately serve to protect fishing communities.
nmfs is correct.the allocation provisions of c require nmfs,in developing procedures to ensure fair and equitable initial allocations of quota shares,to includ e consideration of four specific factors and to consider the basic cultural and social framework of the fishery.id.c a b.these provisions do not require that fishing communities receive an allocation of quota or,as the district court explained,even be made eligible to do so.pac.coast fed of fishermen ass n,wl.similarly,the plain language of c says that fishing communities must do certain things t o be eligible to participate in a fishery,including comply with participation criteria for eligible communities that nmfs develops.c a b.but this language does not mandate that nmfs actually develop participation criteria.in short,requires nmfs to take fishing communities into account in fashioning a limited access program something nmfs did see infra it does not require nmfs to guarantee communities any particular role in that program.congress could have taken any number of steps to guarantee fishing communities a specific role,but it did not 
the plaintiffs rely on c legislative history to supply mandatory requirements not found within the msa itself.although there is no reason to resort to legislative history where,as here,the statute is clear,united states gonzales,see also am.rivers ferc,cir,legislative history nonetheless can be instructive,suzlon energy microsoft,cir.here,c legislative history actually underscores the fact that nmfs was required only to consider fishing communities in developing a limited access program,not guarantee them a certain type or level of participation in it.
for example,the house report on the bill that eventually would become states that the bill creates a discretionary authority and criteria for the allocation of shares to fishing communities and regional fishery associations,at.in keeping with this permissive language,the senate report for the corresponding senate bill states that the bill contains specific provisions that would authorize the issuance of quota to fishing communities,at emphasis added see also id.at explaining that limited access programs would be expanded to allow allocation of harvesting privileges to fishing communities emphasis added 
the plaintiffs alternatively argue that amendments and defy the national standard policy of fostering community participation in the fishery.but that standard requires only that conservation and management measures take into account the importance of fishery resources to fishing communities by utilizing the best available economic and social data.a emphasis added.as we have explained,t he national standards do not require any particular outcome with respect to allocations rather,they provide a framework for the council analysis.there is nothing in the msa that guarantees a particular group a directed fishery.fishermen finest,locke,cir see also b national s tandard does not constitute a basis for allocating resources to a specific fishing community nor for providing preferential treatment based on residence in a fishing community.
the question remains whether nmfs met its obligations to consider fishing communities in fashioning amendments and.it did.nmfs recognized that fishing communities must be considered under the msa surveyed the current status of fishing communities including observing that many are faltering under the status quo described the effects of quota programs and other management tools on those communities and explained how communities participated in the pacific council decisions.in addition,nmfs proposed,and the council adopted,various measures to mitigate the impacts of trawl rationalization on fishing communities,including,among other things an adaptive management program under which up to ten percent of quota shares would be reserved for communities a moratorium on share transfers a review that includes a community advisory committee and limits on the accumulation of shares by single entities.these measures will provide an equitable initial allocation of quota shares,assist participants and fishing communities,and prevent a single share holder from acquiring excessive shares.c a,c d.
it is true that,despite these measures,amendments and may weaken at least some fishing communities.yet nmfs was aware of the potential implications of approving amendments and.for example,nmfs explained in its final rule adopting the amendments 
while the trawl rationalization program would move the fishery toward some of its most important goals and objectives,in order for the program to realize those benefits,a large amount of consolidation would have to occur,resulting in fewer people employed in the fishery.the council acknowledged and expressed concern about the expected consolidation and its impacts,and noted the need to attend to the potential for disproportionate impacts on some communities the council also expressed an interest in maintaining the character of the fleet and a diversified industry.balancing the need for consolidation to generate adequate levels of benefit with the potential adverse impacts of consolidation was a major challenge.at the same time,continuation of status quo would have its own impacts,with both the buyback program and cumulative limits having caused significant consolidation in the fleet and a redistribution of vessels along the coast.
because of the high degree of concern about impacts on communities and maintaining some sharing of benefits both among harvesters and between harvesters,processors,and others dependent on the fishery the council made a number of tradeoffs in the trawl rationalization program that may prevent the program from reaching the full degree of economic efficiency that might otherwise be achievable through rationalization.for example,accumulation limits would help disperse fishery benefits,but would inhibit consolidation.additionally,some quota was set aside for use in an adaptive management program to address such objectives as community and processor stability,new entry,conservation,and other adverse consequences.a number of other measures were also considered as the council struggled to find a balance among sectors,states,vessels,ports,conservation obligations,and its responsibility to try to develop a regime that maximizes economic benefits while simultaneously realizing,recognizing,and honoring the social effects of its decisions.
in arguing that nmfs was required to adopt a policy that better protects the historic role of fishing communities in the groundfish fishery,the plaintiffs seek relief the msa does not require and this court is not empowered to grant.see motor vehicle mfrs.ass of the,state farm mut.auto.ins,a reviewing court may not set aside an agency rule that is rational,based on consideration of the relevant factors and within the scope of the authority delegated to the agency by the statute the scope of review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.
nmfs was not required to restrict quota shares to those who substantially participate in the fishery.
section c provides 
in general.any limited access privilege program to harvest fish submitted by a council or approved by the secretary under this section shall 
d prohibit any person other than a united states citizen,a corporation,partnership,or other entity established under the laws of the united states or any state,or a permanent resident alien,that meets the eligibility and participation requirements established in the program from acquiring a privilege to harvest fish,including any person that acquires a limited access privilege solely for the purpose of perfecting or realizing on a security interest in such privilege 
allocation.in developing a limited access privilege program to harvest fish a council or the secretary shall 
e authorize limited access privileges to harvest fish to be held,acquired,used by,or issued under the system to persons who substantially participate in the fishery,including in a specific sector of such fishery,as specified by the council.
transferability.in establishing a limited access privilege program,a council shall 
a establish a policy and criteria for the transferability of limited access privileges through sale or lease,that is consistent with the policies adopted by the council for the fishery under paragraph 
the plaintiffs argue that c and c require nmfs to restrict the authority to receive and hold quota shares to those who substantially participate in the fishery.nmfs,however,construes c d to be the sole provision setting forth who is excluded from acquiring quota shares,and c e to mean that those who substantially participate in the fishery must be among those eligible to acquire shares,but are not the only entities or person s who can receive shares.at.
nmfs has the better argument,for three reasons.first,reading c and c as the plaintiffs do requires inserting the word only or solely into subsection c.the courts,however,ordinarily resist reading words or elements into a statute that do not appear on its face.dean united states,see also stanton.assocs.lohrey,cir explaining that the court lack s the power to read into the statute words not explicitly inserted by congress.
second,while the msa refers to persons who substantially participate in the fishery in c,that phrase is not found in c d,which is the only provision that specifies who may not acquire quota shares,any person other than an american citizen,lawful permanent resident,or legal entity who meets the eligibility and participation requirements established in the program.c d.it is a general principle of statutory construction that when one statutory section includes particular language that is omitted in another section of the same act,it is presumed that congress acted intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.barnhart sigmon coal,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
third,limiting quota shares to those who substantially participate in the fishery would conflict with other parts of c.see.pub.serv.comm fcc,w here possible,provisions of a statute should be read so as not to create a conflict.section c d allows a quota share which is,once again,a type of privilege to be held by any person that acquires a limited access privilege solely for the purpose of perfecting or realizing on a security interest in such privilege.c d.this allowance is inconsistent with limiting shares to substantial participants in the fishery.similarly,c c directs nmfs to include measures to assist,when necessary and appropriate,captains,crew,and fishing communities through of harvest allocations,including providing privileges.id.c c emphasis added.persons and communities are,by definition,persons and communities who do not yet substantially participate in the fishery.though the plaintiffs are correct that persons may join through community and regional fishing associations,nothing in the msa limits them to those avenues 
despite this commonsense reading of the msa,the plaintiffs proffer four reasons why nmfs is obligated to limit quota shares to those who substantially participate in the fishery.first,the plaintiffs say it is significant that c d refers to the eligibility and participation requirements established in the program.the implication is that nmfs was required to adopt eligibility criteria that accord with how the plaintiffs read the msa.however,as the district court explained,the plaintiffs seek to graft a requirement for agency action onto an authorization for agency action.pac.coast fed of fishermen ass n,wl,emphasis added.that is,c d does not require,but rather simply contemplates,that eligibility and participation requirements may be established in the program.moreover,even if nmfs were required to establish eligibility criteria beyond those in the msa,there is no mandate that those criteria screen out everyone who does not substantially participate in the fishery 
second,the plaintiffs point to certain statements in c legislative history.again,legislative history is irrelevant where,as here,the statute is clear.am.rivers,at.in any event,the best history the plaintiffs can point to is a senate report that states s ection restricts the holding,acquisition,use,or issuance of privileges only to persons who substantially participate in a fishery,at emphasis added.however,this statement,when read in context,plainly is concerned not with whether those who have not historically participated in the fishery should receive privileges,but with the possibility a person might obtain a privilege and then fail to use it,thereby effectively reducing the total allowable catch.see id moreover,the corresponding house report states that a very similar provision to c authorize s all those who substantially participate in the fishery to hold a limited access privilege it does not say that the provision restricts privileges to that group,at july,emphasis added.
third,the plaintiffs refer to a november nmfs technical memorandum the pacific council considered when developing amendments and.the memorandum explains 
the msa does put some constraints on what the councils can choose to do.as previously discussed,c e links privileges to be acquired or held by persons to those who substantially participate in the fishery.
while the councils have some latitude in determining who may or may not acquire harvesting privileges,it is certainly more restrictive than the anybody can own criterion mentioned above,because of the citizenship requirements and the substantially participate in the fishery clause.
emphasis added.however,even this excerpt stands only for the proposition that privileges and participation are and must be link ed,a requirement nmfs has satisfied by making substantial participants eligible to receive quota shares.
the plaintiffs final argument is one of policy allowing persons who do not substantially participate in the fishery to acquire and hold quota shares leads to liberal transferability,which in turn can result in extreme or excessive fleet consolidation,regional shifts in fishing commerce,loss of employment,and other effects.however,as discussed above,nmfs was aware of these effects but decided to partially prioritize economic efficiency and fleet consolidation over the protection of existing fishery participants,a choice that required fewer restrictions on who could acquire and hold quota shares.the msa did not preclude nmfs from making that choice.
nmfs complied with nepa.
nmfs was not required to evaluate amendments and and in a single eis.
the plaintiffs argue that a single eis was required for amendments and under two nepa regulations a and a.section a states that p roposals or parts of proposals which are related to each other closely enough to be,in effect,a single course of action shall be evaluated in a single impact statement.section a,meanwhile,directs agencies to study connected actions in the same impact statement,and sets forth criteria for determining whether actions are connected.
as an initial matter,the plaintiffs argue that a single eis was separately required under both sections.however,a does not impose an independent test for determining when to study related actions in a single eis.klamath siskiyou wildlands ctr.blm,cir.rather,as the section full language makes clear,it directs agencies to to make that determination 
agencies shall make sure the proposal which is the subject of an environmental impact statement is properly defined.agencies shall use the criteria for scope to determine which proposal s shall be the subject of a particular statement.proposals or parts of proposals which are related to each other closely enough to be,in effect,a single course of action shall be evaluated in a single impact statement.
a emphasis added.thus,whether an agency must prepare a single eis for more than one proposal turns on the criteria set forth in 
turning to those criteria,the plaintiffs argue that amendments and are connected actions.actions are connected if they 
i automatically trigger other actions which may require environmental impact statements.
ii can not or will not proceed unless other actions are taken previously or simultaneously.
iii are interdependent parts of a larger action and depend on the larger action for their justification.
id.a.by contrast,w hen one of the projects might reasonably have been completed without the existence of the other,the two projects have independent utility and are not connected for nepa purposes.great basin mine watch hankins,cir the crux of the independent utility test is whether each of two projects would have taken place with or without the other citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
amendments and have independent utility,and thus are not connected actions under a.first,the two amendments have overlapping,but not,goals.whereas amendment goals are to increase net economic benefits,maximize allowable trawl harvests,consider environmental impacts,and improve individual accountability of catch and bycatch,amendment goals are to simplify allocation decisions,support amendment,and limit pacific halibut bycatch.similarly,whereas amendment is limited to trawling,amendment allocates catch limits between trawl and sectors.while it is true the record is replete with statements about how amendments and are linked,two actions are not connected simply because they benefit each other or the environment.see nw.res.info.ctr.nmfs,cir two actions were not connected merely because they both would benefit salmon sylvester army corps of eng rs,cir e ach action could exist without the other,although each would benefit from the other presence.
perhaps more important than parsing nmfs words or predicting whether it would adopt one amendment without the other is answering the question whether,in preparing separate eiss,nmfs evaded its duty to fully study the combined effects of amendments and.this is the real concern behind.see great basin mine watch,at the purpose of this requirement is to prevent an agency from dividing a project into multiple actions,each of which individually has an insignificant environmental impact,but which collectively have a substantial impact.citation and internal quotation marks omitted radio servs.glickman,cir explaining that nepa prevents an agency from illegally segmenting projects in order to avoid consideration of an entire action effects on the environment citing thomas peterson,cir finding connected actions under.
this divide and conquer concern is not present here.nmfs prepared lengthy eiss that thoroughly studied the direct,indirect,and cumulative effects of amendments and,individually and together.the plaintiffs nonetheless argue that studying the two amendments in separate eiss allowed nmfs to dismiss public comments on the basis that they were made on the wrong eis or were outside the scope of the particular amendment.however,the plaintiffs record citations,and indeed the record as a whole,show just the opposite nmfs clarified what each amendment did and substantively addressed the misdirected comment or referred the reader to the appropriate eis,where those issues were always addressed.nmfs decision to prepare two amendments,and hence two eiss,did not undermine its compliance with nepa.
nmfs studied a reasonable range of alternatives.
nepa requires an agency to study a range of reasonable alternatives to the proposed action.see c,westlands water dist.dep t of interior,cir.the alternatives analysis is the heart of an eis.ctr.for biological diversity dep t of interior,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.we review an agency range of alternatives under a rule of reason standard that requires an agency to set forth only those alternatives necessary to permit a reasoned choice.presidio golf club park,cir quotation marks,alteration,and citation omitted see also alaska envtl.ctr.kempthorne,cir under nepa,an agency consideration of alternatives is sufficient if it considers an appropriate range of alternatives,even if it does not consider every available alternative.quoting headwaters,blm,cir 
in this case,nmfs studied enough alternatives to permit a reasoned choice.in chapter of the amendment eis,nmfs studied in detail seven alternatives four primary alternatives,two of which had.these alternatives varied in many respects,ranging from how they managed catch,initially allocated privileges,and treated processors to the accumulation limits they set and the species they covered.the alternatives most important difference was their catch control tool whereas the no action or status quo alternative would have used trip and seasonal limits,the other alternatives proposed various types of quota systems or cooperatives.for amendment,nmfs studied six alternatives in detail,which differed primarily based on how they allocated groundfish stocks among different sectors.
the plaintiffs object that nmfs considered only quota programs in the amendment eis,with no variations at all from nmfs initial proposal such as community shares,auctions,limited term shares.in the plaintiffs view,nmfs was required to embrace the range of options an agency can lawfully pursue under its substantive mandates.this argument fails as a matter of law and a matter of fact.an agency need not discuss alternatives similar to alternatives actually considered,or alternatives which are infeasible,ineffective,or inconsistent with the basic policy objectives of the project.alaska envtl,at quotation omitted westlands water,at.nmfs identified amendment purpose and need as providing a trawl rationalization program that would improve economic efficiency and stability,consider environmental impacts,and reduce bycatch through individual accountability.nmfs reasonably determined that quota programs would be most effective in meeting these goals for most sectors,but it studied alternatives that differed in how those programs would be designed and implemented these alternatives allowed nmfs to fully vet the consequences of its actions.
moreover,nmfs did consider catch control tools besides quotas.most obviously,nmfs studied in detail a no action alternative that would have used trip and seasonal limits the pacific council current management tools in place of quotas.nmfs also studied in detail three alternatives that would have used cooperatives rather than quotas,although only for sectors not at issue in this litigation.nmfs also briefly considered and rejected auctions,allocations,and management.nepa permits agencies to eliminate alternatives from detailed analysis so long as they briefly discuss the reasons for their having been eliminated.a.
as for amendment,the plaintiffs complain that nmfs studied alternatives that uniformly were based on recent catch histories,with only minor variations in the allocation methodology.as with amendment,the plaintiffs overlook amendment purpose and need,which was to simplify management decisions by making fixed allocations,support trawl rationalization by eliminating the uncertainty of biennial allocations,and limit pacific halibut bycatch.thus,while the alternatives take the similar approach of making fixed allocations for certain stocks,they differ materially in how they would make those allocations,based on recent total catch percentages for some or all sectors,on historical landed catch for some sectors,or on recent catch with for certain species.these material differences allowed nmfs to thoroughly study the potential consequences of its action.
finally,the plaintiffs contend that nmfs decision was predetermined because nmfs had selected all of the key features of their proposed trawl quota program by september,before nmfs prepared the eiss.the plaintiffs are incorrect.nmfs identified preferred alternatives at various points in the nepa process,just as nepa requires.see e see also metcalf daley,cir nepa does not require that agency officials be subjectively impartial,only that projects be objectively evaluated.citation omitted.however,nmfs did not select alternatives until the conclusion of the nepa process.the planning and evaluation for amendments and took seven years,during which time nmfs appropriately winnowed its options.
nmfs adequately evaluated impacts on fish habitat and fishing communities.

excluding appendices,the amendment and eiss contain and pages of detailed effects analysis,respectively.the plaintiffs nonetheless complain that this analysis is inadequate because it focuses mostly on socioeconomic impacts only a small portion is devoted to the amendments environmental effects,and an even smaller portion to the amendments effects on groundfish habitat specifically.in the plaintiffs view,nepa requires more,especially since the amendments will,in their view,ensure the domination of trawling in the fishery and trawling is harder on fish habitat than fishing using fixed gear.
the plaintiffs are incorrect.amendments and will not necessarily favor trawling over fixed gear relative to current management.the eiss explain that trawling is permitted under the existing fishery management plan and is responsible for the majority of the catch.amendments and may actually decrease trawling dominance by consolidating the trawling fleet,allowing trawlers to switch to fixed gear,and allocating more fish to than they have caught in recent years.nmfs will amendment allocations every five years.
the record is candid that the effects of amendments and on groundfish habitat are less conclusive.the amendment eis discusses general shifts in fishing location that would translate to either an increase or decrease of trawling in certain areas.rationalization would allow for shifts between trawl gear and fixed gear.although fixed gear is thought to be less destructive to bottom habitat than trawl gear,and therefore could reduce the impacts to habitat that is currently trawled,that switch also could aggravate adverse impacts by exposing areas to fishing.the eis supports this discussion with modeling,incorporates by reference,pursuant to,a previous comparative analysis of the effects of different types of gear on fish habitat,and refers readers to amendment,which was specifically aimed at protecting fish habitat.see.may,codified,as amended,at pt.
as for amendment,nmfs explained that it would not provide more bottom trawl opportunity than status quo management measures and allocations,and in fact would provide higher allocations for most species than the status quo or any other alternative.thus,even if trawl gear has more impacts than fixed gear on fish habitat,potential adverse impacts from trawl gear could be expected to be lower under the proposed action than under current management or other alternatives.these discussions may be less robust than the discussions of socioeconomic effects,but nepa only requires agencies to discuss impacts in proportion to their significance.b.
the plaintiffs two remaining arguments lack merit.first,the amendment and eiss extensively discuss potential effects on communities.while the plaintiffs point specifically to the community of port orford,oregon,the amendment eis at least mentions that community at several points,and the plaintiffs make no showing that the eiss more general discussion of communities does not apply to port orford.
second,in arguing that nmfs failed to adequately study the impacts of trawling on groundfish habitat,the plaintiffs contend that nmfs also failed to comply with msa national standard,which provides that c onservation and management measures shall be based upon the best scientific information available,a,and with various other action forcing national standards that promote conservation,see id.a.nmfs,however,explained why amendments and comply with each of the national standards disclosed the potential impacts of trawling on habitat and identified uncertainty where it exists and ultimately settled on amendments that promote conservation by posting observers on all boats,improving economic efficiency and individual accountability,and reducing bycatch 
mnmfs adequately considered mitigation.

amendment contains two primary mitigation features.the first is an adaptive management program under which up to ten percent of the quota shares each year will be set aside to address unforeseen effects,such as harm to fishing communities and barriers to entry for new participants.in the record,nmfs discussed,but did not adopt,criteria for deciding when and how to allocate these reserve shares,and stated that shares not used for adaptive management would be proportionally distributed to privilege holders.the second mitigation feature is a quadrennial review to make sure the program is meeting its goals,with the first review occurring five years after program implementation.the review process includes a community advisory committee.amendment also contains other measures expected to meaningfully reduce the impacts of trawl rationalization on fishing communities,such as caps on the accumulation of quota shares and an initial moratorium on transferring shares.amendment contains a review provision,but no other mitigation.
the plaintiffs argue that these mitigation measures are vague,uncertain,and inadequate.however,we previously have found reasonably detailed mitigation evaluations like the ones at issue here to be sufficient.see,okanogan highlands alliance williams,cir city of carmel by the sea,at see also tillamook cnty.army corps of eng rs,cir while the agency was required to develop the proposed mitigation measures to a reasonable degree,it was not required to develop a complete mitigation plan detailing the precise nature of the mitigation measures.quoting wetlands action network,at.the plaintiffs also argue that there is no assurance that adaptive management reserve shares will be allocated to fishing communities.however,an assurance that a particular number of privileges will go to a particular purpose at a particular time is not only inconsistent with the notion of adaptive management,it is not required by nepa a mitigation plan need not be legally enforceable,funded or even in final form to comply with nepa procedural requirements.parks conservation ass dep t of,see also methow valley citiz
