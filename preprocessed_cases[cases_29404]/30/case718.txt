the league of wilderness mountain biodiversity project and the hells canyon preservation council collectively the lowd plaintiffs appeal from the district court denial of their motion to preliminarily enjoin the snow basin logging project.we have jurisdiction under a.we affirm in part and reverse in part the district court order,and remand the case to the district court for the entry of a preliminary injunction,the scope of which the district court should determine on remand.
the snow basin project area encompasses nearly acres of the whitman wallowa national forest the forest in northeast oregon,and the united states forest service usfs has been planning a logging project in this area since.a draft environmental impact statement eis was issued in march,and the final eis feis was issued in march.one way in which the feis differed from the draft eis is that one segment of the project,about acres of regenerative logging,had been removed from consideration in the feis.after the adoption of the feis,in april,the forest supervisor withdrew the forest travel management plan tmp,which had proposed to regulate motorized travel and reduce the amount of roads within the forest,and which had been mentioned in addressing environmental harms from the logging project.in july,the usfs issued a correction notice that said that group selection treatment was being considered for of the acres that had been removed from the draft eis and not considered in the feis.
the lowd plaintiffs filed suit seeking to enjoin the timber sale on the grounds that the usfs and the united states fish wildlife service usfws had violated the national environmental policy act nepa and the endangered species act esa.the district court held that the lowd plaintiffs were not likely to succeed on any of their claims,and that the balance of harms did not tip sharply in the lowd plaintiffs favor.the district court therefore denied the preliminary injunction.the lowd plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.

the lowd plaintiffs raise four challenges to the snow basin feis under nepa,and an additional challenge under the esa.under nepa,they argue that now that the tmp has been withdrawn,the feis reliance on the tmp in analyzing the impact of the project on certain species within the forest is invalid,and a supplemental eis must be completed the feis failure to consider the cumulative effects of the acre logging project in the correction notice was error the failure of the feis to analyze the cumulative effects of potentially increased stream temperatures and sedimentation was error and the feis did not properly explain why it found that bull trout were not present in the project area,and so did not analyze the project impact on bull trout.under the esa,the lowd plaintiffs challenge the usfs and usfws joint determination that bull trout,a threatened species,were not present in the project area.each of these challenges is addressed separately below.
nepa requires agencies to prepare a supplemental eis when t here are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts.c ii.when determining whether to issue a supplemental eis,an agency must apply a rule of reason,not supplementing every time new information comes to light but continuing to maintain a hard look at the impact of agency action when the new information is sufficient to show that the remaining action will affect the quality of the human environment in a significant manner or to a significant extent not already considered.marsh.natural res.council,internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.in klamath siskiyou wildlands center boody,cir,we required the bureau of land management to prepare a supplemental eis after it changed a policy upon which the original eis had relied.id.at.we noted that the bar for whether significant effects may occur is a low standard.id.at.that the policy change raise d substantial questions regarding the project impact was enough to require further analysis before allowing the project to proceed.id.at.
the snow basin feis opens its analysis of the project impact on the area elk population by stating that elk are the most popular big game in the area,and are an indicator of the quality and diversity of the general forested habitat,but that d isturbance due to roads is a major factor influencing elk distribution.after surveying the existing status of the habitat,it begins its analysis of road density.it notes that three parcels within the project area currently exceed the recommended road density,but that the tmp,will result in a net reduction of open roads within the project area,which will provide additional habitat that is free from disturbance from motor vehicles.it then goes on to say that,although the precise reduction in road density could not be quantified because the tmp was not final,the tmp would result in a substantial improvement in elk security habitat in the snow basin project area.it also includes a table,which calculates the road density in all affected parcels under each alternative.at oral argument,counsel for the usfs explained that this chart does not include the impact of the tmp within its calculations.later,under separate header,the feis discusses the potential impacts of other foreseeable future projects,including fire thinning,cattle grazing,and the tmp.
the lowd plaintiffs have shown it likely that they will prevail on their claim that with the tmp now withdrawn,the usfs must prepare a supplemental eis although parts of the usfs analysis do not consider the tmp,as a whole,its review of the snow basin project independent environmental impacts on elk and their habitat are interwoven with statements that explicitly rely upon the tmp to mitigate harms that the snow basin project will cause.when the public reviews an eis to assess the environmental harms a project will cause and weighs them against the benefits of that project,the public should not be required to parse the agency statements to determine how an area will be impacted,and particularly to determine which portions of the agency analysis rely on accurate and information,and which portions are no longer relevant.here,statements that the tmp will mitigate harms are interspersed with analysis that properly looks only at the snow basin project itself.
this lack of clarity likely renders the eis deficient.informed public participation in reviewing environmental impacts is essential to the proper functioning of nepa.see,dep t of transp.pub.citizen,describing one of the purposes of nepa as ensuring that the relevant information will be made available to the larger audience that may also play a role in both the decisionmaking process and the implementation of that decision.quoting robertson methow valley citizens council,san luis obispo mothers for peace nuclear regulatory comm n,cir noting that one of the purposes of nepa is ensuring that the public can both contribute to that body of information,and can access the information that is made public.without supplemental analysis of impacts absent the tmp,previously stressed in parts of the agency assessment,the public would be at risk of proceeding on mistaken assumptions.we conclude that the lowd plaintiffs are likely to prevail on their claim that a supplemental eis must be completed to show the environmental impact of the snow basin project on elk and their habitat now that the tmp has been withdrawn.
nepa implementing regulations require that when agencies prepare an eis,that document must consider the cumulative impacts of the action under consideration,and defines cumulative impacts as the incremental impact s of the action when added to other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions.a reasonably foreseeable future action is defined as an i dentified proposal,and an identified proposal exists where the agency has a goal and is actively preparing to make a decision on one or more alternative means of accomplishing that goal and the effects can be meaningfully evaluated.a.although projects need not be finalized before they are reasonably foreseeable,plains res.council,surface transp,cir,they must be more than merely contemplated,kleppe sierra club.when looking at whether a potential future action is an identified proposal,courts must focus upon a proposal parameters as the agency defines them.california.block,cir.
the lowd plaintiffs have not shown that they are likely to prevail on their claim that the acres of group selection treatment listed in the usfs correction notice meet the standard for an identified proposal for which cumulative impacts analysis must be done.the usfs may have a goal,but the likelihood of proceeding on that goal and a timetable on any such action are not yet defined.more importantly,there is no indication that the usfs is actively preparing to make a decision,a,but rather,they have disclaimed any intention to move forward on that logging in any particular time frame.as the record now stands,the usfs may permit this logging,or it may not take any action at all.environmental impacts of this possibility are at present inchoate and to a degree speculative.if the usfs proceeds,the agency will then be required to complete an independent eis,but we affirm the district court holding that the lowd plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the potential group selection treatment must be considered among the cumulative effects in the snow basin eis.
in the lowd plaintiffs second cumulative effects claim,they argue that the feis did not consider the symbiotic relationship between increased sediment in the streams that flow through the project area and the thermal stress that the stream high temperatures place on the fish that inhabit the streams.the eis notes that both little eagle creek and eagle creek exceed their target temperatures,which results in harms for both migration and spawning.it also notes that logging could add low to moderate amounts of sediment to those same streams.however,the lowd plaintiffs allegation misapplies the cumulative impact test.because the project will not have any impact on stream temperatures,any thermal stress on the fish is a part of the project environmental baseline.therefore,no cumulative effects analysis is required,and the lowd plaintiffs have not shown that they are likely to prevail on this claim.
federal agencies must undertake a full and fair analysis of the environmental impacts of their activities.this is a crucial cornerstone of nepa.nepa requires that a federal agency consider every significant aspect of the environmental impact of a proposed action and inform the public that it has indeed considered environmental concerns in its decisionmaking process.earth island inst.forest serv,cir alteration in original citation omitted.in order to accomplish this,nepa imposes procedural requirements designed to force agencies to take a hard look at environmental consequences.id.
in the feis,the usfs cited to a study of the project area by the oregon department of fish and wildlife.the oregon study indicates that,although bull trout were common in eagle creek in the and and continued to be documented there through the,snorkeling surveys conducted between and failed to find bull trout in eagle creek.the eis concludes that b ull trout have likely been extirpated from the eagle creek system since the,and as a result,the eis does not analyze the impact of the snow basin project on bull trout.while the feis does not engage with existing contrary scientific opinions about the potential presence of bull trout in eagle creek,it included all of the relevant scientific data and contains sufficient information to let the public make an informed determination of the environmental impacts of the snow basin project.
the lowd plaintiffs argue that the data relied upon by the usfs are too vague or stale to support the conclusions drawn from it.in some contexts,nepa hard look standard requires agencies to conduct new scientific studies in order to full y and fair ly analyze the impacts of a particular project.see,plains,at overturning reliance on year old aerial survey data lands council powell,cir holding that reliance on year old habitat studies was arbitrary and capricious.the snorkel surveys were aged more than years old by the time the final eis was released.nevertheless,there was no reliable evidence that showed their results were likely incorrect or that the status of bull trout in the project area had changed over time,so we can not say that the usfws and usfs reliance on the surveys was arbitrary and capricious.the lowd plaintiffs have not shown that they are likely to prevail on this claim.
the esa requires that agencies insure that any agency action is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat of such species.a.to accomplish this,agencies must ask the usfws if any endangered or threatened species may be present in the area of a proposed action,and the usfws is to determine the answer using the best scientific and commercial data available.c.in making this determination,the usfws must give the benefit of the doubt to the species.conner burford,cir quoting conf,st sess.at internal quotation marks omitted.the lowd plaintiffs advocate two key issues with the conclusion that bull trout are not present in eagle creek the first is that the data relied upon by the usfs and usfws are too vague or stale to support the conclusions drawn from it.the second is that the usfs and usfws arbitrarily ignored the contrary conclusions derived from that data in other reports.
the esa requirement that agencies use the best scientific and commercial data available,c,means that agencies must support their conclusions with accurate and reliable data.however,so long as an agency considers all relevant data,it may rely on that available evidence even when it is imperfect,weak,and not necessarily dispositive.see greenpeace action franklin,cir.because of the age of the snorkel surveys see part,infra,the evidence of the bull trout absence was relatively weak.nevertheless,for the same reasons that we found that reliance on the surveys was not a violation of nepa,we conclude that the evidence was sufficiently strong to meet the agencies burden under the esa.
the lowd plaintiffs argue that the usfs and usfws arbit
