appellants,california building industry association,coalition for urban renewal excellence,valley taxpayers coalition,and modesto chamber of commerce,challenge the validity of two rules adopted by respondent,san joaquin valley air pollution control district district.these rules,commonly referred to as indirect source review isr,are intended to encourage developers to reduce indirect pollution,mobile source emissions,caused by new development projects.under isr,the developer can reduce emissions by incorporating features in the project,or by paying a fee to fund projects that will reduce emissions,or by a combination of the two.
the trial court concluded that the district had the power to adopt regulations to mitigate the effects of indirect source pollution,which included the power to impose fees on persons who cause the pollution.the court further found that these fees were valid regulatory fees.
appellants contend the isr fees are development fees subject to the mitigation fee act,et and that they violate that act.appellants further argue that,even if the isr fees qualify as regulatory fees,they are invalid as such.according to appellants,the district did not employ a valid method for creating the fees,did not estimate or compute the total costs of the isr program,and does not have a basis for fairly apportioning the fees.finally,appellants assert that the district lacked the authority to impose these fees.
as discussed below,the district had the power to adopt the isr rules and the fees imposed pursuant to those rules are valid regulatory fees.accordingly,the judgment will be affirmed.
background 
the district authority and responsibilities.
two statutory schemes regulate air quality in california,the federal clean air act fcaa et and the california clean air act ccaa health et.under the fcaa,the environmental protection agency epa is authorized to issue national air quality standards setting the maximum allowable concentration of a given pollutant.safe air for everyone cir.to assure that these air quality standards are met,the states are required to attain air quality of specified standards and to do so within a specified period of time.train natural resources def.council.to accomplish this goal,states must develop state implementation plans sips proposing methods for maintaining air quality and submit those sips to the epa for review and approval.safe air for everyone,supra,at.a state may include an indirect source review program in its sip,subd.a a.epa approved sips have the force and effect of federal law.ibid.nevertheless,each state has the primary responsibility for assuring air quality within its entire geographic area.train natural resources def.council,supra,at.
the ccaa takes a regional approach to protecting ambient air quality.local and regional authorities,such as the district,have the primary responsibility for control of air pollution from all sources other than vehicular.the california air resources board carb is responsible for the control of vehicular sources of air pollution.nevertheless,air pollution control districts have authority to mitigate vehicle emissions in their use.for example,a district must adopt transportation measures is to pay particular attention to reducing the emissions from transportation and may adopt regulations to reduce the number or length of vehicle trips,subd.a.
california districts are also authorized to regulate indirect sources of air pollution,subd.a and must include provisions to develop indirect source control programs in their attainment plans,subd.a.further,the district is specifically required to assess fees on indirect sources of emissions in the san joaquin valley to recover the costs of district programs related to these sources.
the ccaa does not define the term indirect source.however,under the fcaa,indirect source is defined as a facility,building,structure,installation,real property,road,or highway which attracts,or may attract,mobile sources of pollution,subd.a c.
the district is responsible for controlling air pollution in the region formed by eight counties in the san joaquin valley valley.in,the valley was classified as serious nonattainment under federal standards for particulate matter with particle size less than or equal to microns.in,the valley was classified as extreme nonattainment for the federal ozone standards.can be directly emitted geologic material dust or can be formed when precursor emissions,such as nitrogen oxides nox and volatile organic compounds vocs,react chemically.ground level ozone smog is formed during summer months when nox and vocs react in the presence of sunlight.
due to the valley serious nonattainment federal classification for,the district was required to develop an attainment plan that included both a demonstration of future attainment and provisions to assure that the best available control measures would be implemented within four years,subd.b.the district concluded that the rapid valley growth,and concomitant increase in motor vehicle use,would result in increases in emissions.therefore,as part of its attainment plan,the district committed to adopt isr regulations to mitigate this increase.the epa approved this course of action as part of the district plan in.may.
the district was also required to implement all reasonably available control measures on ozone sources because of the valley extreme nonattainment ozone classification.this is reflected in the district extreme ozone attainment plan,which includes the isr commitment.
the district isr program.
the district adopted its indirect source review program,denominated rule,on december,to fulfill its and ozone plan commitments.rule,which provides the means for the district to recover its costs of administering and operating rule,was also adopted.the development process for these rules began in june and included public meetings and workshops.the district received and responded to public comments and conducted analyses of,socioeconomic impact,emissions reduction,and environmental impact.
the purpose of rule is to reduce indirect sources of nox and emissions from new development projects.an indirect source is defined as any facility,building,structure,or installation,or combination thereof,which attracts or generates mobile source activity that results in emissions of nox and.
rule requires a certain amount of emission reductions from each new development project.the district found that,although the number of vehicle miles traveled is increasing valley wide,the majority of new nox emissions are attributable to new development.however,to ensure that each developer is responsible for only its share of emissions,the district discounts each project nox emissions in two ways.first a percent emissions credit is given.this ensures that a development is only charged for the vehicle trips that would not have occurred but for the development.in other words,only trips from the site are counted.second,credit is given for the increasingly stringent state and federal vehicle tailpipe controls that will reduce nox over time.
in contrast,operational emissions dust from a project do not decline over time.accordingly,rule requires mitigation equal to half of the emissions after for years.the end result is that projects must reduce their operational nox emissions by percent and their operational emissions by percent over a period.
a developer can accomplish the required emission reductions by incorporating measures to reduce vehicle miles traveled,vehicle trips sources of emissions such as fireplaces,wood stoves and landscape equipment.alternatively,the emissions can be reduced through paying a fee to fund emission reducing projects.finally,the developer can use a combination of emission reduction measures and a fee to fund emission reduction projects.
under rule,the proponent of a new development project is required to submit an air quality impact assessment aia to the district before or at the project final discretionary approval by the approving public agency.either the developer or district staff prepares the aia by using an approved model to quantify the emissions attributable to the new development.the aia additionally identifies any voluntary reduction measures that are components of the project design.these reduction measures include increased energy efficiency,electrical landscape maintenance equipment,elimination of wood burning devices,increased residential densities,locating near public transit,incorporating mixed uses,transportation management demand programs,and incorporating pedestrian bicycle facilities.the incorporation of such measures can substantially reduce potential fees.
the project information,including any voluntary reduction measures,is input into the urban emissions model urbemis,a district approved computer model that quantifies nox and attributable to a development.another model calculates construction emissions.if the reduction measures do not reduce percent of the project nox emissions and percent of the emissions,the developer is required to pay a fee to the district for emission reduction projects.
fees paid under rule,if any,are directly proportional to tons of nox and that are not mitigated by the developer through features.the fees are based on the historical and projected cost to achieve reductions through district emission reduction programs.
rule fees can only be used for reduction programs.the collected fees are segregated by pollutant from other district revenue in a separate mitigation fund and are used only to buy emission reduction projects.for every ton of nox and not mitigated by the developer,the district purchases an equivalent reduction of that same pollutant.
before adopting the isr program,the district prepared a detailed spending plan demonstrating how mitigation fees collected under rule would be spent.at that time,the district identified more than million in projects that were available.
the underlying lawsuit.
appellants filed a complaint and petition for writ of mandate challenging the district adoption of the isr regulations,rules and.in their complaint and petition,appellants alleged that these rules imposed invalid development fees,regulatory fees,exactions,state agency fees,special taxes,were unconstitutional,and were adopted in excess of the district authority.following a bench trial,the court ruled in the district favor on all causes of action.
on appeal,appellants have raised only certain of these claims.appellants argue that the isr fees are invalid both as development fees and regulatory fees and that the district did not have the authority to impose the fees.

the isr fees are regulatory fees,not development fees.
there are three general categories of fees or assessments that are distinguishable from special taxes and thus can be imposed without a majority vote.sinclair paint state bd.of equalization cal th,sinclair paint.these categories are special assessments,based on the value of benefits conferred on property development fees,exacted in return for permits or other government privileges and regulatory fees,imposed under the police power.ibid.
a fee is considered a development fee if it is exacted in return for building permits or other governmental privileges so long as the amount of the fee bears a reasonable relation to the development probable costs to the community and benefits to the developer.sinclair paint,supra,cal th at.under the mitigation fee act,et,such a fee is defined as a monetary exaction other than a tax or special assessment that is charged by a local agency to the applicant in connection with approval of a development project for the purpose of defraying all or a portion of the cost of public facilities related to the development project,subd.b.when a fee is imposed as a condition of approval of a development project,the local agency must meet specific statutory requirements,including identifying the purpose of the fee and the use to which the fee is to be put,and determining how there is a reasonable relationship between the fee and the development project,subds.a and b.also,a fee imposed as a condition of approval of a proposed development or development project is limited to the estimated reasonable cost of providing the service or facility,subd.a.
in contrast,when a fee is charged for the associated costs of regulatory activities and does not exceed the reasonable cost of carrying out the purposes and provisions of the regulation,it falls within the category of a regulatory fee.california of scientists department of fish game th,california of scientists.regulatory fees are not dependent on benefits or privileges and are imposed under the police power.sinclair paint,supra,cal th at.
appellants contend that the isr fees are development fees subject to the mitigation fee act and that the fees violate the act.according to appellants,the isr fees meet the government code section,subdivision b,definition of development fees because they were imposed in connection with approval of a development project for the purpose of defraying the cost of public facilities,public services or community amenities,related to the development project.in other words,they are fees that alleviate the effects of development on the community.barratt american,city of rancho cucamonga cal th,barratt american.
however,a fee does not become a development fee simply because it is made in connection with a development project.barratt american,supra,cal th at.rather,approval of the development project must be conditioned on payment of the fee.capistrano beach water dist.taj development th.the mitigation fee act specifically limits its application to situations where the fee or exaction is imposed as a condition of approval of a development project,subds.a and b,subd.a,subd.c.
here,approval of a development project is not conditioned on the developer payment of the isr fees.the isr fees are not exacted in return for permits or other government privileges.thus,the isr fees are not development fees and,therefore,are not subject to the mitigation fee act.rather,the fees are regulatory in nature.they are designed to mitigate growth in air pollution from new development in order to achieve and maintain federal air quality standards.accordingly,this court need not decide whether the district complied with the mitigation fee act when adopting the isr regulations.
the isr fees are valid regulatory fees.
as discussed above,a regulatory fee is charged to cover the reasonable cost of a service or program connected to a particular activity.such a fee may be validly imposed under the police power for the purpose of legitimate regulat
