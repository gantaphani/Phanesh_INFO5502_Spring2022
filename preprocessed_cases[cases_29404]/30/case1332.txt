the coalition for sustainable resources coalition challenges the united states forest service failure to implement particular practices in the medicine bow national forest in wyoming,including increased timber harvesting.the coalition alleges that these practices would increase the amount of water in the platte river in nebraska and thereby promote the recovery of several endangered and threatened species utilizing that habitat.the district court dismissed the case as not yet ripe for review,and also found that the coalition had failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because the endangered species act does not require federal agencies to adopt particular conservation measures.
we hold that this case is not yet ripe,and we therefore lack jurisdiction.here,the coalition is challenging the forest service inaction,but this inaction is not sufficiently final for review.the forest service is currently a cooperating agency in developing a conservation strategy for the platte river species and is also revising its forest plan for the medicine bow.because the agency has adopted a reasonable timeframe to study this problem,given the complexity and urgency of the issues,we conclude that judicial review is not warranted at this time.we therefore affirm the district court dismissal for lack of jurisdiction and vacate its disposition on the merits.
background 
the endangered species act,is a comprehensive scheme for the protection of listed endangered and threatened species and their habitat,regulating the activities of both governmental and private entities.the act ultimate goal is conservation,bringing these species to the point where legal protections are no longer necessary.b.the department of the interior fish and wildlife service and the department of commerce national marine fisheries service share primary responsibility for administration of most parts of the act.b.at issue in this case,however,is a provision covering all other federal agencies,including the department of agriculture forest service.these agencies shall,in consultation with and with the assistance of the secretar ies of the interior and of commerce,utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of the endangered species act by carrying out programs for the conservation of endangered species and threatened species.a.
the platte river in nebraska is home to the whooping crane,least tern,pallid sturgeon,and piping plover,all species listed as endangered or threatened under the endangered species act,and part of the river has been designated critical habitat for the whooping crane.the coalition alleges that more water some per year is needed in the platte river to meet target flows established for the listed species.the coalition alleges that the fish and wildlife service has determined that a loss of as little as of water per year from the south platte river drainage in colorado is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of these species and adversely modify the designated critical habitat 
the department of the interior and the states of colorado,nebraska,and wyoming have signed a cooperative agreement for platte river research and other efforts relating to endangered species habitats along the central platte river,nebraska.the purpose of this plan is to study the listed species dependant on the platte river and implement a recovery plan.although it is not a signatory,the forest service is participating as a cooperating agency in the development of an environmental impact statement for the cooperative agreement.the record reflects that a program would be developed by the end of 
the coalition is a organization devoted to encouraging the recovery of endangered species using sound scientific,technological,and legal means in a manner that avoids unnecessary interference with private property rights.among its members are ranchers,farmers,and other in wyoming and colorado whose practices are subject to restriction to prevent harm to the platte river species.a declaration submitted for standing purposes indicates that the coalition also has a member who is an amateur photographer with an aesthetic interest in these species.
some miles west is the medicine bow national forest in wyoming,part of which lies within the platte river watershed.the coalition alleges that implementing certain vegetation and snow management techniques in the medicine bow and other nearby national forests could supply most or all of the water needed for the platte river species to recover.because denser forests yield less water,these techniques include increasing timber harvesting and allowing forest fires and insect outbreaks to proceed without human intervention.the forest plan for the medicine bow states that the forest could be managed so as to increase the forest yield of water by per year the coalition alleges and the forest service concedes that a substantial portion of this increase would accrue to the platte river,although it is not specifically alleged how much of this increased flow would benefit the listed species,given the water claims of the other water users in the river.the coalition alleges,however,that the medicine bow is being managed in a manner that increases forest density and therefore decreases the quantity of water produced by the forests.in particular,in recent years the total timber sale volume in the medicine bow has fallen short of the level prescribed in the forest plan.the forest service is currently revising the medicine bow forest plan and expects to finish by the fall of this revision will look at a broad range of alternatives for managing the forest,such as increas ing the acreage where natural disturbance events fire,insects and disease are tolerated.
the coalition sued defendants,who are responsible for managing the medicine bow,under the provision of the endangered species act,g,which states that any person may commence a civil suit on his own behalf to enjoin any person,including the united states and any other governmental instrumentality or agency,who is alleged to be in violation of any provision of the act it alleged that defendants violated their duty under a to carry out conservation programs in its management of the medicine bow.in particular,the coalition alleged that the agency failure to implement the techniques,specifically more aggressive its conservation duty.the coalition also implied that by allowing forest density to increase,the forest service was contributing to the decline of the platte river species as less water is produced by the upstream forests,greater restrictions are imposed on downstream such as the coalition members.the complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief.
the forest service moved to dismiss the complaint,arguing that the coalition lacked standing and failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.biodiversity associates,an environmental group,and donald duerr,one of its members,intervened as defendants and moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of ripeness.the district court found that the coalition had standing,at least for the purposes of a motion to dismiss,but that the claims were not ripe and the endangered species act does not require federal agencies to undertake particular conservation measures.coalition for sustainable resources united states forest,d.the coalition now appeals.
