this case involves a claim for breach of a contract for treatment of contaminated soil at a navy facility in stockton,california.the contractor,international technology corporation itc seeks to recover additional soil treatment expenses incurred by a subcontractor,terra kleen response group,tk,because of unexpectedly high concentrations of clay in the treated soil.the armed services board of contract appeals board held that itc was not entitled to an award of costs and also determined that itc was not entitled to damages for breach of the contract.we affirm.
background 
itc was awarded a contract on february,by the department of the navy.the contract was for environmental remediation services designed to remove pesticides and related chemicals at a variety of contaminated sites.the contract did not describe the services to be performed,but instead provided that services would be specified in a series of subsequent delivery orders.because the contract was awarded on a basis,the contract contained the limitation of cost provision of federal acquisition regulation far.pursuant to this clause,the estimated cost shown in the contract constitutes a ceiling on the government contractual liability,which can only be increased if the government modifies the cost ceiling.advanced materials,perry.in the absence of such a modification,the contractor is not required to continue performance or incur costs that exceed those estimated in the contract.id.the limitation of cost clause also contains a notice provision,requiring that the contractor notify the government in writing when it anticipates that within the next sixty days it will exceed percent of the estimated cost and provide a revised estimate.id.
the delivery order relevant to this case,delivery order number the do,was issued by the government on august.it called for treatment of soil at the naval communication station in stockton,california.the do also provided that the period of performance was september,through september,and stated an estimated cost,for purposes of the limitation of cost clause,in the amount of on approximately april,itc awarded a subcontract to tk to perform the soil treatment at the stockton worksite.
tk had developed a solvent extraction technology for the removal of certain contaminants,including the pesticide ddt,from contaminated soil,and had earlier demonstrated its technology in a pilot soil treatment program at the stockton worksite itself.the solvent extraction technology works by dissolving certain contaminants from the soil into a solvent in sealed treatment bins.the solvent is then drained and filtered to remove the contaminants,so that the solvent can be reused.two reports,entitled terra kleen solvent extraction technology evaluation report solvent technology report and focused feasibility study for soil feasibility study,prepared by a contractor,discussed and evaluated the results of tk pilot treatment program.tk provided technical input used in the preparation of both reports.
the solvent technology report and the feasibility study were not prepared pursuant to the government contract involved here.however,the do briefly referenced these reports.one section of the do presented a series of specific tasks the contractor should perform,each followed by descriptive paragraphs.the first of these tasks was entitled examine existing documents.it directed the contractor to e xamine the following documents and then listed the feasibility study and the solvent technology report.appellant supplemental,tab,at.this provision also contained the following note the contractor is not required to provide written responses to these documents.examining these items will assist the contractor in preparing the plans described in task of this delivery order.id 
a key focus in this case has been the content of the two reports,and in particular what they represented about the clay content of the soil at the site.the solvent technology report described the stockton site,tk solvent extraction technology,the procedures used,and the results of the pilot study.a single,figure in this report,table,entitled soil characteristics,presented characteristics for nine soil samples taken from the site during the pilot treatment program,including the classification of the soil type for each and the percent of sand,silt,clay,and gravel in each.for the nine samples,the clay content figures reported in table were,and.tk president and ceo,alan cash,was present and observed the manner in which at least six of these soil samples were collected.the solvent technology report also indicated 
solvent extraction cycles took much longer than expected due to the reduced soil permeability,thereby increasing treatment time and cost the soil also tended to form clay lumps when compacted.this resulted in the formation of soil aggregates which were difficult to saturate with solvent,resulting in less particle contact and lower ddt removal efficiencies.
appellant supplemental,tab,at.
the feasibility study compared the relative merits of several alternative methods for treatment or disposal of the contaminated soil at the stockton site,including use of tk solvent extraction technology.the appendix of the feasibility study included a number of tables reporting analyses of samples of the contaminated stockton soil before and after tk treated the soil in the pilot program.these tables referenced the soil composition,and indicated that some samples had a majority of clay,that is,substantially higher clay content than the figures in the solvent technology report.it is unclear whether the samples reported in the feasibility study were the same as the samples reported in the solvent technology report.
pursuant to its subcontract with itc,tk used its solvent extraction technology to treat the soil at the stockton worksite.however,tk experienced problems in treating the contaminated soil.in a progress report to the government dated february,itc noted that processing of the first increment of soil had been delayed,and attributed the delay in part to higher than expected levels of clay in the soil.tk took samples from soil in its treatment bins and from the stockpile of untreated contaminated soil for independent laboratory analysis of clay levels.the clay levels indicated for these samples ranged between approximately and,considerably higher than the clay content for the nine samples listed in the solvent technology report,though less than some samples described in the feasibility study.
all work under the do at the stockton site,including demobilization,was completed during the week of june.the government accepted the project as complete on june.during its performance under the subcontract,tk first made itc aware of the problems associated with clay in march,but submitted to itc a request for equitable adjustment based on the high clay content of the soil for the first time on november.
although itc had not provided compensation to its subcontractor,on its claim for an equitable adjustment,on january,itc made a formal request to the government for an equitable adjustment,seeking compensation to cover tk claim for equitable adjustment under the subcontract.in november,itc revised its claim to request for expenses under the subcontract,and an additional for itc own expenses,apparently representing itc efforts to investigate and substantiate tk claim.the contracting officer co issued a final decision denying itc claim on february.the co concluded that itc was not entitled to any equitable adjustment under the contract,because the cost would exceed the total cost under the limitation of cost clause,and itc had not followed the notice procedures under that clause or obtained a modification to cover these expenses before incurring them.
itc appealed this determination to the board.after a hearing,the board issued a decision,dated july,denying itc appeal.the board found that itc requested adjustment would exceed the cost ceiling of the limitation of cost clause and concluded that itc had not met its burden to prove either that it complied with that clause requirement to notify the government before exceeding the cost ceiling,or that itc was excused from doing so because the cost was unforeseeable.the board also concluded that itc would not be excused from providing the notice required by the limitation of cost clause just because the costs associated with tk request for equitable adjustment were uncertain and subject to itc investigation at the time itc first became aware of them.
finally,the board rejected itc alternative argument that the government had breached the do by inaccurately describing the clay content of the contaminated soil at the stockton site.first,the board determined that neither the solvent technology report,the feasibility study,nor any do provisions generally warranted soil content or soil conditions at the stockton sites,nor warranted a low clay content of the soil.indeed,both reports,when read as a whole,reflect information showing that certain soil samples were of relatively high clay and silt content.at.the board also concluded that tk could not have been misled about the soil conditions because tk earlier treated the soil from these same sites in the pilot study,and the solvent technology report indicated that tk had difficulties with low permeability of soil and with the clay at the sites at that time.id.the board determined that a breach claim requires,among other things,a showing of government culpability and concluded that itc had not made such a showing 
misrepresentation in the contractual context constitutes a knowing or negligent untrue representation of fact or failure to disclose,requiring proof of government culpability beyond showing a mere variation between conditions stated in the contract and those actually encountered.itc failed to make a case of misrepresentation on this record.

discussion 
when this case was before the board,itc sought to recover tk additional costs and its own related costs as a cost under the contract.the board rejected this claim because itc had not complied with the notice and approval provisions of the limitation of cost clause.we do not understand itc to challenge this holding on appeal.in any event,the board was correct that itc can not recover under a cost theory because of itc failure to comply with the notice provisions of the limitation of cost clause.
itc instead urges on appeal that it has a valid claim for breach of contract.itc asserts that the government inaccurately represented the site conditions in the do and that tk relied on this representation in bidding on the subcontract.itc contends that it is liable to tk under the fixed price subcontract and that the government is liable to itc on a pass through basis.itc does not argue that it reasonably relied upon and was misled by any representation in its contract with the government.
a claim allows a prime contactor to assert against the government a claim for harm caused by the government to a subcontractor where the subcontractor could hold the prime contractor liable for that harm.in a suit,a prime contractor that is liable for damages sustained by its subcontractor may bring claims against the government on behalf of the subcontractor.metric constructors united states.see generally john cibinic,et,administration of government contracts ed describing claims and the severin doctrine that governs the allowance of claims.if the prime contractor is liable to the subcontractor for the damages sustained by the latter caused by the government action,the prime contractor can show injury to it from the government action,and there is no basis for the government to object to the subcontractor claim due to lack of privity.mitchell constr.danzig.a typical example of a claim is a claim by a subcontractor,under prime and sub contracts,for delay that resulted in increased indirect overhead costs for the subcontractor.see id.at.
none of the cases called to our attention,however,deals with claims similar to the claim asserted here.itc theory in this case presents a number of difficulties,including whether a subcontractor claim can be based on representations appearing in the prime contract and whether the limitation of cost clause limits the prime contractor ability to assert a claim based on breach of the subcontract.we need not decide these issues,for we conclude that itc would not prevail in this case even if all of these issues were resolved in its favor.
itc contends that the government breached the do by incorrectly representing the amount of clay in the contaminated soil,and that tk relied on this representation to its detriment in formulating its subcontract bid.itc explains that the do referenced the solvent technology report,which in turn reported significantly lower clay content for certain soil samples than the clay levels that tk actually encountered in the contaminated soil while performing under the subcontract.cash testified that he relied on the clay content figures in table of the solvent technology report in preparing tk subcontract proposal,and tk proposal stated that has assumed that the contaminated soil contains an overall clay content of less than clay.at.
a misstatement as to site conditions in a government contract can support a claim for breach of contract.see hollerbach united states.the same requirements apply whether the contractor asserts such a common law breach claim or a type i claim under the differing site conditions clause,a clause which is common in government construction contracts,but was not included in itc contract with the government compare brown constructors,pena,listing elements for common law breach claim with renda marine,united states,listing elements for type i differing site conditions claim.see also maffei.wrecking united states,applying the same analysis to a common law breach claim and a type i differing site condition claim.
in order to prevail on such a site conditions claim,a contractor must establish four elements.first,the contractor must prove that a reasonable contractor reading the contract documents as a whole would interpret them as making a representation as to the site conditions.see renda marine,at a contractor must first prove,as a threshold matter,that the contract contained some identification of the conditions to be encountered at the site.mac,united states,explaining that the court place s itself into the shoes of a reasonable and prudent contractor and decide s how such a contractor would act in interpreting the contract documents.this is a question of contract interpretation reviewed de novo on appeal.mac,at.
second,the contractor must prove that the actual site conditions were not reasonably foreseeable to the contractor,with the information available to the particular contractor outside the contract documents,that the contractor reasonably relied on the representations.renda marine,at t he contractor must demonstrate that the conditions encountered were not reasonably foreseeable in light of all information available to the contractor when bidding and that the contractor reasonably relied upon its original interpretation of the contract.this issue is factual in nature,and review is deferential.see id.at.
third,the contractor must prove that the particular contractor in fact relied on the contract representation.see id.at.again,this is a fact issue reviewed under a deferential standard.see id.at.
fourth,the contractor must prove that the conditions differed materially from those represented and that the contractor suffered damages as a result,which is again a fact question.see id.at 
we conclude that the contractor here can not satisfy either the first or second of these requirements.
we note first that itc was required to demonstrate that a reasonable contractor would read the contract documents
