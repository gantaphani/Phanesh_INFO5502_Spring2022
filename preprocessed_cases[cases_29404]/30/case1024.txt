this is an expedited review of the environmental protection agency may,final approval of the san joaquin valley implementation plan plan.in approving the plan,the epa has set a new deadline for the valley to attain the national ambient air quality standard for pollutants,which are various airborne fine particles of less than ten microns in diameter.the new deadline is.
the petitioners,whose challenges have been consolidated,are the following groups and organizations association of irritated residents air,latino issues forum,medical advocates for healthy air,and the sierra club.they maintain that under the clean air act,the absolute outside deadline for areas to attain the air quality standard is.
petitioners raise a number of issues,but the most significant is the epa authority to set a deadline that extends past.we deny the petitions for review because we hold that the deadline was authorized within the structure of the act,and that petitioners other challenges to the plan do not warrant judicial intervention.
background 
the act establishes a comprehensive program requiring cooperation between states and the federal government to improve the nation air quality.the act also sets up a scheme under which the public is given significant opportunities to offer input and criticism at various stages of each state efforts to achieve better air quality.see.states carry most of the burden of furthering the act purposes by developing implementation plans after extensive public involvement.these petitioners have participated throughout this process for the valley at each opportunity for notice and comment.the valley efforts to control pollution over the past decade illustrate the flexible,cooperative and incremental nature of the act.see,a a.
california san joaquin valley is the heart of the state top agricultural region,producing a wide variety of fruits and vegetables.it is bordered on the west by the coastal mountain ranges,and on the east by the sierra nevada mountains including yosemite,kings canyon and sequoia national parks.unfortunately,the same fertile soil that has led the region to be known as the state salad bowl has also contributed to high population growth and industry which,together with the region topography,have resulted in severe air quality difficulties.
pollution results largely from agricultural operations and dust kicked up on roads.it is a serious problem in the valley.the epa has recognized that this pollutant can cause damage to lung tissue,chronic illness and premature death.august.july,see also vigil leavitt,cir.congress addressed this problem in when it amended the act to include specific provisions dealing with pollution,and set an attainment deadline of december,for seriously deficient areas.c.
pursuant to the amendments to the act,the valley was designated a moderate area by operation of law.see,march.california subsequently directed the san joaquin valley unified air pollution control district district,a state regulatory agency,to develop and adopt a comprehensive air pollution control strategy calling for the implementation,maintenance and enforcement of air quality standards in the valley.the district plans and plan revisions were eventually forwarded to the california air resources board carb for review and inclusion in the state air pollution plans.every state plan or plan revision must be adopted by the state after reasonable notice and hearing.see a.ultimately,the state adopts the plans and forwards them to the epa for approval.
in,after various exchanges between the district and the epa,the epa found that the valley could not practicably attain the standard by the statutory deadline for moderate areas,which was december.the epa thus reclassified the valley as a serious area.this reclassification meant that the valley attainment deadline was changed to december.c.at.california submitted a serious area plan to the epa in july.see.that plan included a request for a five year extension of the attainment date under e of the act.
in early,the epa indicated that it would disapprove the plan for the valley,so the state withdrew it.in july,the epa found that the valley had failed to attain the required standards by the december,deadline.july.the state was then required to submit plan revisions under d.the revisions had to provide for attainment,as well as for five percent annual reductions of pollutants.following the required notice and hearing,california adopted and submitted still another plan in august.
in may,after another notice and comment period during which petitioners,among others,raised most of the concerns at issue here,as well as many others,the epa approved the plan.that plan established a new attainment goal of december.the epa approval of the plan effectively certified that the new deadline complied with the act general provisions for changing attainment deadlines that have passed.that approval is the subject of this petition for review,in which the petitioners claim,inter alia,that the epa could not,as a matter of law,have approved the new deadline using those general provisions.there has been extensive briefing by all parties,including the district and carb,who have intervened in support of the epa plan approval.
the attainment deadline 
under the act,there are essentially two statutory pathways through which attainment deadlines may be changed.the first applies generally to all pollutants,and is the one that the epa relied on here in setting the deadline.the second applies only to pollutants.the petitioners argue that the existence of the second pathway forecloses use of the first for pollutants,and creates an outside attainment date of december.
under the administrative procedure act,the epa final action in this case may be set aside only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a see,vigil leavitt,cir.we deal with an issue of law.we conclude that the epa properly relied on the act general provisions in approving the deadline.we turn to the relevant provisions.
serious areas,such as the valley,that missed the december,deadline,were required to submit further plan revisions to bring about annual or precursor reductions of five percent.d.the section reads 
failure to the case of a serious nonattainment area in which the standard is not attained by the applicable attainment date,the state in which such area is located shall,after notice and opportunity for public comment,submit within months after the applicable attainment date december,plan revisions which provide for attainment of the air quality standard and,from the date of such submission until attainment,for an annual reduction in or precursor emissions within the area of not less than percent of the amount of such emissions as reported in the most recent inventory prepared for such area.
d.this section does not itself,however,establish any new attainment deadline dates.the epa thus looked to the method of deadline change generally set forth in d.that section reads 
d consequences for failure to attain within one year after the administrator publishes the notice under subsection c of this section relating to failure to attain,each state containing a nonattainment area shall submit a revision to the applicable implementation plan meeting the requirements of paragraph of this subsection.
d.section d then provides for a new attainment date five years from the date of the epa notice that an area has failed to attain any pollutant applicable standard.that section also provides that the five year period can be extended five additional years as follows 
attainment dates for nonattainment areas a the attainment date for an area designated nonattainment with respect to a national primary ambient air quality standard shall be the date by which attainment can be achieved as expeditiously as practicable,but no later than years from the date of the notice under section c,except that the administrator may extend the attainment date to the extent the administrator determines appropriate,for a period no greater than years from the date of the notice under section c,considering the severity of nonattainment an
