cooper was convicted by a jury on nine counts of knowingly discharging a pollutant from a point source into waters of the united states,in violation of the federal water pollution control act amendments of,as amended et,commonly known as the clean water act cwa or the act.he claims that the district court should have granted an acquittal for lack of sufficient evidence,in part because the government failed to prove cooper knew that he was discharging pollutants into waters of the united states.because the district court did not err,and because the cwa does not require the government to establish cooper knowledge as to the jurisdictional status of the waters he affected,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the cwa prohibits the knowing discharge of a pollutant from a point source to waters of the united states without a permit.see a,c a.the act defines discharge of a pollutant as the addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.id.the term pollutant includes sewage sewage sludge and biological materials discharged into water.id.the term point source denotes a confined and discrete conveyance,including any pipe from which pollutants are or may be discharged.id.navigable waters are defined as waters of the united states,id,which are defined by regulation to include,among other things,a ll interstate waters and the t ributaries of such waters.
defendant cooper has been operating a sewage lagoon at his trailer park in bedford county,virginia,since.in recent times the lagoon has served as the only method of human waste disposal for of the trailers in the park.the lagoon treats sewage according to the following process solid materials settle to the bottom of the lagoon,while the fluid level rises until it reaches an overflow structure in the middle of the lagoon,from which it flows through a pipe into a chlorine contact tank.in the tank,an electric pump dispenses a solution of water and granular chlorine,which mixes with the sewage.the chlorinated fluid then flows through a discharge pipe,down a channel of a few feet,and thence into a small creek.
the creek into which the treated sewage flows is a tributary of sandy creek,which is in turn a tributary of the roanoke river.the roanoke river flows from the foothills of the appalachian mountains in virginia,through north carolina,and into the albemarle sound.there is no dispute that,as a tributary of an interstate water,the small creek into which the lagoon discharges constitutes a water of the united states.see id.
the cwa provides that permits regulating discharge of pollutants other than dredge and fill material are issued under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program npdes.see a.it also provides that states may,upon epa approval,choose to administer their own permit program in accordance with the cwa.see id.b.the commonwealth of virginia maintains an virginia pollution discharge elimination system vpdes program,pursuant to which the virginia department of environmental quality deq issues permits that suffice for both state and federal discharge authorization.see ann.deq regulated discharges from the lagoon through a series of permits to cooper,the last of which issued in and remained in effect until march.
cooper permit regulated discharge from the lagoon in a number of ways.it fixed effluent limitations or permitted pollutant levels for various pollutants associated with sewage,and it set the degree to which the discharge was allowed to decrease oxygen levels in the creek.it required chlorination of the sewage in order to kill pathogens,as well as dechlorination,for which purpose deq instructed cooper to install dechlorination facilities.the permit also required cooper to sample the pollutant levels of the discharge and to report the results each month to deq.
between and,deq recorded over violations of the permit,including excessive levels of kjeldahl nitrogen,chlorine,and suspended solids and impermissibly low levels of oxygen in the creek.in response,deq took enforcement action which culminated in a consent order.under the consent order,cooper agreed to pay a fine for past violations.given that the sewage lagoon was incapable of meeting cwa standards in its existing form,the consent order gave cooper until august to choose among several courses of remedial action upgrading the lagoon replacing the lagoon with a treatment plant or a septic field,or closing the trailer lots served by the lagoon.the consent order gave cooper until august to implement his chosen course of action.
after the consent order,discharges from the lagoon continued to violate the permit.deq inspections of the creek found a strong sewage smell,decreased oxygen levels,dark solids,and a proliferation of bloodworms,organisms that thrive in environments like that provided by raw sewage.
in august,cooper violated the consent order by failing to elect a course of remedial action by the established deadline.this resulted in a amendment to the consent order,which imposed a fine,set a new deadline for a choice of remedy,and left in place the august implementation deadline.the amendment also set interim discharge limits that were less demanding than those of the permit but still deemed protective of the environment by deq.
in march,cooper discharge permit expired with cooper having failed to file the necessary paperwork to receive a new permit.after the expiration of the permit,deq treated the interim discharge limits in the amendment to the consent order as a de facto permit,until cooper again violated the consent order in august.at that time,not only had cooper failed to complete the required update to the lagoon,but the lagoon was still operating exactly as it had at the time of the consent order.in response,in october the state water control board canceled the consent order,and deq notified cooper that he was no longer operating with a valid discharge permit.
nevertheless,discharges from the lagoon into the creek continued.deq sent cooper many notices of violation and inspection reports stating that he was discharging illegally.after an administrative hearing,deq in july issued an order imposing a fine and ordering cooper to cease discharging.even after the order,the discharges continued,and deq continued to send cooper inspection reports and notices of violation.
in late,the environmental protection agency criminal investigation division cid began to investigate discharges from the lagoon.on various dates between august and october,deq inspectors observed the lagoon,estimated the volume of the discharge,sampled the discharge ph and total residual chlorine,collected samples for fecal coliform analysis,and completed inspection reports that were mailed to cooper.a number of the samples were found to have the maximum quantifiable concentration of fecal coliform,a type of bacteria present in human feces.
on october,in an interview with cid special agent matthew goers,cooper admitted that he was discharging from the lagoon into the creek without a permit and that deq had notified him that these discharges were in violation of the vpdes program.cooper acknowledged that he might go to jail.he told goers that he had hired an attorney to fight on his behalf and stated,i going to fight as long as god gives me the power to fight.
on october,cooper was indicted on thirteen felony counts of knowingly discharging a pollutant into waters of the united states without a permit,in violation of a and c a.after his indictment,cooper finally ceased discharging from the lagoon.he hired a septic hauling company to collect sewage and ultimately disconnected most of the trailers from the lagoon.
before trial,the government sought a ruling on the admissibility of evidence of cooper dealings with deq from until the start of the charging period in.the district court allowed the evidence,finding that it was relevant to the charged offenses and that it was admissible under federal rule of evidence b as evidence of intent and the absence of mistake or accident.
during jury deliberations,the jury sent a question to the judge,asking for clarification on how to weigh certain evidence relating to laboratory analysis of the discharge samples.the court declined to give direction,explaining that doing so would constitute an inappropriate encroachment upon the jury role as.
after a jury trial,on april,the jury found cooper guilty on nine counts.the district court sentenced cooper to months imprisonment,plus a fine for each count of conviction,resulting in a total fine of.defendant appeals.
we briefly address at the outset cooper challenge to the district court evidentiary rulings.cooper argues that the district court erred in admitting evidence under federal rule b of cooper interactions with deq from to.reviewing the district court ruling for abuse of discretion,see united states hedgepeth,cir,we find that the court did not err in admitting this evidence.
rule b prohibits the introduction of evidence of prior acts for the purpose of proving the character of a person.b.rule b only applies,however,to evidence relating to acts extrinsic to the conduct being prosecuted.see united states lipford,cir.evidence intrinsic to the story of the crime does not fall under rule b prohibition.see id.evidence served to complete the story with respect to conspiracy charge.even where evidence predates the time period of the indictment,the government is allowed to provide context relevant to the criminal charges.united states kennedy,cir.
in this case,the extended history of cooper dealings with deq is inextricably intertwined with the cwa violations alleged at trial.the deq evidence describes longstanding conditions at the lagoon and cooper awareness of those conditions,a fact relevant to his mens rea under the cwa.at the very least,the evidence explains how cooper came to be without permission to discharge into the creek,a necessary predicate to his being charged with discharging pollutant without a permit.see id.testimony about city drug investigation relevant to prosecution arising from later federal investigation.
even if this evidence were within the ambit of b,it would,as the district court noted,still be admissible.rule b explicitly allows evidence that furnishes proof of the defendant knowledge and the absence of mistake or accident.see.b.the deq evidence is both relevant to and necessary for establishing cooper mens rea.see united states uzenski,cir.in this case,the government had to prove that the defendant knowingly discharged a substance that is regulated as a pollutant from the lagoon pipe into the creek.see a,c a united states wilson,cir united states sinskey,cir united states ahmad,cir united states hopkins,cir united states weitzenhoff,cir.the deq evidence demonstrates that cooper did not act mistakenly or accidently but knew that he was discharging sewage and was doing so into the creek.the very existence of the deq permit established that cooper was aware that the lagoon discharge contained raw sewage and that it flowed into the creek.from to,multiple deq violation notices informed cooper that pollutant levels in the discharge were excessive.deq notified cooper repeatedly that he was in violation of his permit and,later,that he did not have a permit.given the government burden of proof,the deq evidence was relevant,reliable,and necessary to its task.see united states queen,cir.
nor did the potential for unfair prejudice or confusion outweigh the probative value of the deq evidence.see id.rule exclusion should be invoked rarely,because t he general policy of the federal rules is that all relevant material should be laid before the jury.mullen princess anne volunteer fire,cir.the deq evidence,while it may provoke disgust,is undoubtedly probative in a cwa prosecution for the discharge of insufficiently treated human sewage.evidence of criminal acts is of course by nature prejudicial,but the standard for exclusion under rule is unfair prejudice.see united states williams,cir.it was not unfair for the government to present this evidence.if unsavory evidence were excludable on that account,the prosecution could hardly prove its case.
cooper also argues that the district court erred in its answer to a query put to it by the jury during deliberations.the jury asked whether it was reasonable to consider numerous quality control issues of lab sufficient to render all results of the lab questionable.the court declined to give further instruction on the ground that it would constitute an inappropriate invasion of the jury province as.here,too,the district court did not abuse its discretion.see united states smith,cir responses to jury questions on points of law left to the sound discretion of the district court.in fact,the trial court must take care,in responding to a jury question,not to encroach upon its power.see united states ellis,cir.it can hardly be error for the district court to have accorded the jury this respect.
cooper also contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal for lack of sufficient evidence under federal rule of criminal procedure.cooper argues that the government failed to prove that cooper knew the waters into which he discharged pollutants were a tributary of a navigable water,or adjacent to a navigable water,or had a significant nexus to a navigable water.the premise of this claim is that,under a and c a,the government had to prove that cooper was aware of the facts that establish the federal government jurisdiction over the water for purposes of the cwa.for the reasons explained below,we reject this contention.
cooper was convicted of knowingly discharging a pollutant without a permit from a point source to navigable waters,which are defined as waters of the united states.see a,c a.waters of the united states in this statutory scheme operates as a jurisdictional element.a jurisdictional element of a federal offense states the basis of congress power to regulate the conduct at issue its primary purpose is to identify the factor that makes the conduct an appropriate subject for federal concern.united states yermian,d.without a jurisdictional basis for its exercise of its authority,congress would be acting beyond its enumerated powers under article i,section of the constitution.waters of the united states in the cwa is a classic jurisdictional element,which situates congress authority to enact the statute in its traditional jurisdiction over waters that were or had been navigable in fact or which could reasonably be so made.solid waste agency of cook county army corps of eng rs,d.
it is well settled that mens rea requirements typically do not extend to the jurisdictional elements of a the existence of the fact that confers federal jurisdiction need not be one in the mind of the actor at the time he perpetrates the act made criminal by the federal statute.united states feola,d yermian,at.this court has long recognized this principle in construing jurisdictional elements of federal criminal statutes.see,united states langley,cir conviction under statute does not require knowledge of firearm interstate nexus united states darby,cir conviction for transmitting threatening interstate communications does not require proof of knowledge that threatening telephone call was interstate united states squires,cir conviction under national stolen property act does not require proof of knowledge of interstate nature of transportation of counterfeit securities united states green,cir per curiam conviction under firearms statute does not require knowledge that dealer was federally licensed united states lefaivre,cir conviction under travel act does not require proof of knowledge that cashing of checks involved use of interstate facilities.
congress legislates against this backdrop,aware that jurisdictional elements generally assert federal jurisdiction but do not create additional statutory elements as to which defendants must have formed the appropriate mens rea in order to have broken the law.see feola,at.squires,at interstate transportation element merely jurisdictional green,at federal licensure element jurisdictional only lefaivre,at interstate facilities requirement nothing more than the jurisdictional peg on which congress based federal jurisdiction.
