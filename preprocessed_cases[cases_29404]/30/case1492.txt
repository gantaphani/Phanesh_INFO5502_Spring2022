the general motors corporation gm petitions for review of may,letters from an enforcement official at the environmental protection agency epa regarding nascent enforcement actions based on a regulatory interpretation that automobile manufacturing paint purge solvents are solid waste under the resource conservation and recovery act of rcra,et,upon exiting the spray painting unit.we dismiss gm petition for lack of jurisdiction.
subtitle c of rcra,see,establishes a cradle to grave federal regulatory system for the treatment,storage,and disposal of hazardous wastes.american portland cement alliance epa.the statute defines a hazardous waste as solid waste that may pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly treated,stored,transported,or disposed of,or otherwise managed.solid waste is defined as discarded material,including solid,liquid,semisolid,or contained gaseous material resulting from industrial,commercial,mining,and agricultural operations.id.epa regulations subject such waste to stringent standards,including,as relevant here,part subpart j,id,on tank systems,and subparts bb and cc,id,on air emissions from equipment and tanks that handle hazardous waste.hazardous waste may also be subject to standards under state regulations,see,and while an authorized state may enforce its hazardous waste program in lieu of the federal program,id.d,epa has dual enforcement authority under rcra,id,and may engage in action or file a complaint without its state counterpart,so long as it notifies the authorized state.id.a.
under rcra,epa has broad investigatory and enforcement authority.epa may require hazardous waste facilities to disclose particular information,id,or to monitor and test for hazardous waste,id,and epa may inspect such facilities.id.upon discovery of rcra violations,epa engages in action by issuing an inspection report or a notice of violation to the facility.see id.the facility may be afforded an opportunity to show cause why epa should not proceed with an enforcement action.absent such opportunity,or if epa is unconvinced by the facility showing,epa can commence an enforcement action by filing an administrative complaint alleging violations of subtitle c requirements and proposing a compliance order,suspension or revocation of the facility permit,and a penalty.see id.a parts.the owner or operator of the cited facility is entitled to a hearing before an administrative law judge,and upon an adverse decision,may appeal to the environmental appeals board board.see b.the board decision,as the final epa decision,is judicially reviewable.see b d.alternatively,epa can file a complaint directly in the federal district court for injunctive or other appropriate relief,see a,h parts,including,in certain instances,fines and imprisonment.see d.
the underlying dispute between epa and gm and the amici concerns the point of generation of rcra solid waste in the automobile manufacturing industry paint purge solvent processes.shortly after the effective date of the subparts bb and cc requirements,by letter of july,elizabeth cotsworth,the acting director of the epa office of solid waste responded to a letter from an attorney representing an unnamed client that uses solvents to clean automated spray painting guns when changing paint color the cotsworth letter stated that,based on the system described,the used solvent is waste once its leaves the spray painting unit,and thus the equalization tank and associated piping are subject to hazardous waste regulatory requirements.after stating this general interpretation of the federal regulations,the cotsworth letter also advised that the authorized state agency is responsible for interpreting its own regulations and making site specific regulatory determinations.in july,epa issued a copy of the cotsworth letter as a supplement to the rcra permit policy compendium,which became available online to the regulated public in september on the rcra website hereinafter rcra policy compendium.
beginning in,epa issued notices of violations,based on inspection reports,to several automobile manufacturing facilities,including gm plants in doraville,georgia and kansas city,kansas,as well as the ford motor company ford avon lake,ohio plant,for failure to assure that the solvent piping systems used to convey purge solvents to solvent recovery tanks met the requirements under rcra subtitle c.in september,epa filed an administrative complaint against ford for failure to comply with the requirements under subparts j,bb,and cc of the regulations,alleging that h azardous waste is generated at the facility when paint lines and equipment are cleaned with solvents.the following year epa issued a notice of violation to the toyota motor manufacturing plant in princeton,indiana.similar notices of rcra violations were issued by epa in july to the bmw manufacturing corporation bmw plant in spartanburg county,south carolina,and in february and november to gm plants in linden,new jersey and bowling green,kentucky.epa invited gm bowling green plant to show cause why epa should not take formal enforcement action against gm pursuant to a of rcra,a.
by letter of march,the alliance of automobile manufacturers aam,which had been in discussions with epa officials about epa enforcement initiative,expressed concern about recent interpretations applying bb cc requirements to the automobile industry paint and purge processes.aam claimed that the interpretation in the cotsworth letter was based on an incomplete picture of such processes.urging a categorical position that the automotive manufacturing painting system is a process that includes the use of purge solvent throughout the process,aam argued that the point of generation of solid waste does not occur until the solvent is discarded when it exits that process upon reaching the solvent recovery tank.further,by letter of july,aam claimed that epa recent enforcement actions represent an entirely new interpretation of the rcra requirements,and that s uch changes in regulatory interpretation and policy should be addressed on their merits before enforcement actions are undertaken.aam therefore requested that epa place a hold on rcra enforcement proceedings relating to automotive solvent recovery systems.letters from the governors of several states and their environmental officials also expressed concern about the cotsworth interpretation and its application at specific plants.
in response to aam letters and inquires from two automobile manufacturers,eric schaeffer,the director of regulatory enforcement wrote on august,that the applicability of subparts j and bb to piping systems conveying solvents from spray painting units is quite clear.the schaeffer letter advised that epa has consistently articulated this viewpoint,referencing the rcra policy compendium.indicating that epa was willing,if there was data to support aam categorical position,to consider revising the rule in light of industry viewpoint that the requirements offer no environmental benefit,the schaeffer letter advised that members of the industry still must resolve liability for past violations,and urged resolution of compliance issues on a basis.
aam responded by letter of september,that it welcomed a meeting to focus on needed environmental policy changes,and that it would provide information to demonstrate that epa current regulatory interpretation and the corresponding enforcement initiative do not stand to produce environmental benefits.aam cautioned,however,that i n this case,a regulatory change may not be the most or innovative approach.seven months later,by letter of april,aam wrote to three epa administrators,including steven shimberg,the associate assistant administrator of the epa office of enforcement and compliance,in order to bring to a conclusion our continuing efforts to resolve the issue of purge solvent regulation in the automobile industry,and to present epa with a comprehensive resolution in response to epa proposal of a consent agreement without regulatory change that included fines to recoup the economic benefit of noncompliance 
on may,steven shimberg of the office of enforcement and compliance wrote to aam and several of its members,including gm hereinafter the shimberg letters.the shimberg letter to gm stated in relevant part 
the epa continues to stand by its determination on the point of generation for hazardous waste at spray paint operations and,as such,ancillary equipment transporting the hazardous waste purge solvent from the painting operations and the storage tanks to which the mixture is conveyed are subject to rcra the agency has spent considerable time and resources listening to and reviewing information presented by members of the automobile industry before reaching its position on the issues.in the hope that there is still a possibility to negotiate a settlement with individual members of the industry,i would like to reaffirm the settlement offer and acknowledge a change in one of the terms that is designed to address the industry concern with the compliance deadline for subpart bb for any member of the industry that does not wish to discuss the settlement offer,epa will proceed with conventional inspections and enforcement 
the shimberg letter to aam similarly stated that epa disagreed with aam categorical critique of its enforcement initiative,that epa continues to stand by its determination on the point of generation for hazardous waste at spray paint operations,and that the enforcement matters should proceed and be resolved through settlements or adjudications involving individual manufacturers 
the epa office of enforcement and compliance assurance sent an email on may,to regions that included a copy of the shimberg letters.following federal and state inspections,epa issued,on may and august,inspection reports to gm and notified gm of rcra violations relating to the purge solvent piping systems at its plants in spring hill,tennessee and doraville,georgia.epa directed the spring hill facility to correct the violations and advised the georgia department of natural resources that epa had classified the doraville plant as a significant.
gm filed a petition in this court on august,for review of epa final agency action regarding the rcra classification of purge solvents in the automobile manufacturing industry,as expressed in a may,letter from epa to the aam and separately in a similar letter sent on may,to gm.gm,joined by amici,contend in their briefs that epa attempt in the shimberg letters to regulate purge solvent piping systems unlawfully expands epa rcra jurisdiction based on a novel characterization of purge solvents that ignores their performance of solvent functions after cleaning the spray painting unit.epa filed a motion on october,to dismiss gm petition for lack of jurisdiction.while rejecting the attack on the applicability of subtitle c to purge solvent piping systems,epa repeats in its brief that,as a threshold matter,the court lacks jurisdiction because the shimberg letters are not regulations reviewable under rcra a,a,gm lacks standing,and gm petition is untimely or unripe.as a court of limited jurisdiction,we begin,and end,with an examination of our jurisdiction.see utility air regulatory group epa.
section a of rcra,a,limits the jurisdiction of the court to review of action of the administrator in promulgating any regulation,or requirement under this chapter or denying any petition for the promulgation,amendment or repeal of any regulation under this chapter.hence,the court has jurisdiction over only final regulations,requirements,and denials of petitions to promulgate,amend or repeal a regulation.molycorp,epa,see also american portland cement,at.three criteria determine whether a regulatory action constitutes the promulgation of a regulation the agency own characterization of the action whether the action was published in the federal register or code of federal regulations and whether the action has binding effects on private parties or on the agency.see molycorp,at.the first two criteria serve to illuminate the third,for the ultimate focus of the inquiry is whether the agency action partakes of the fundamental characteristic of a regulation,that it has the force of law.see also croplife america epa,general electric epa,american portland cement,at.
in several recent opinions,the court has had occasion to address what type of epa action is judicially reviewable,eschewing the notion that labels are definitive.thus,in general electric,at,and appalachian power epa,the court held that epa guidance documents imposing new requirements were reviewable as final agency action.such documents both marked the consummation of the agency decision making process and determined rights or obligations of involved parties.see general electric,at appalachian power,at.the court in appalachian power explained 
if an agency acts as if a document issued at headquarters is controlling in the field,if it treats the document in the same manner as it treats a legislative rule,if it bases enforcement actions on the policies or interpretations formulated in the document,if it leads private parties or state permitting authorities to believe that it will declare permits invalid unless they comply with the terms of the document,then the agency document is for all practical purposes binding.
at see also general electric,at.similarly,in croplife,at,the court held that an epa directive released in a press release was judicially reviewable the directive was a final agency determination because epa changed position had immediate effect and thus was binding on it and the petitioners,and the petitioners would be afforded no additional opportunity to make the arguments to the agency that they present ed in th eir petition for judicial review.id.at.
gm seeks to bring the shimberg letters within the folds of appalachian power and croplife on either of two theories of finality.first,gm contends,because the regulatory status of paint purge solvents was an unresolved question that industry had discussed with epa for several years,the interpretation in the shimberg letters was a crystallization of epa position.second,gm contends,even if epa had previously resolved the solvents regulatory status,epa reopened the issue and renewed its adherence to its earlier interpretation in the shimberg letters.under either theory,gm contends that the text of the shimberg letters is unequivocal that epa decision on the regulatory status of purge solvents is final and that epa intends it to be binding.petitioner br.at.the shimberg letters are binding in the field gm claims,as evidenced both by the may,email to the regions attaching the shimberg letters,and by the guidance issued to the regions at the end of after gm filed its petition for review additionally,as evidenced by the subsequent enforcement actions against gm plants,gm maintains epa is explicitly basing enforcement action on the regulatory interpretation formulated in the shimberg letters.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.gm therefore contends that epa,in order to regulate purge solvent piping systems,attempted to amend the rcra regulations through the shimberg letters without providing notice and comment as required by the administrative procedure act,see,and thus its action is unlawful.
contrary to gm theory,the shimberg letters can not accurately be characterized as the culmination of epa position on the applicability of subparts j,bb,and cc to purge solvent piping systems.the shimberg letters reflect neither a new interpretation nor a new policy.see general electric,at.epa general regulatory interpretation was stated as early as in the cotsworth letter.that interpretation was published to the regulated community by september in the rcra policy compendium,see appalachian power,at,and was applied to gm plants in and again in.in response to industry inquiries,epa repeated its regulatory interpretation without change in the schaeffer letter of august,and again in the shimberg letters of may.nothing in the record indicates that the paint purge solvent issue was unresolved rather,epa position was settled long before the shimberg letters.
under gm alternative theory,epa reopened the paint purge solvent issue by making itself available in response to industry requests to
