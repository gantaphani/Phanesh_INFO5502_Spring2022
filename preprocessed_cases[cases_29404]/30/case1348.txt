sierra club brought this action against the army corps of engineers corps after the corps granted rinker materials and other mining concerns miners clean water act cwa permits.et.the miners sought to extract limestone from the lake belt stretch of wetlands between the florida everglades and the northwest edge of metropolitan miami.to mine the lake belt wetlands,however,the miners had to first secure cwa permits from the corps.the corps,in reviewing whether to issue permits,had to follow procedures required by the national environmental policy act nepa,et,endangered species act esa,et,and cwa.after the corps granted the permits,sierra club brought suit,alleging inter alia that in granting the permits the corps performed its nepa,esa,and cwa duties arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the administrative procedure act apa.the miners intervened as defendants,and all parties moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the appellees motion and found that,for numerous reasons,the miners permits were due to be vacated.this appeal followed.after reviewing the voluminous record,reading the parties briefs,and having the benefit of oral argument,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment and remand this case to the district court to apply the proper apa standard of review to the corps environmental analysis.
background 
south florida lake belt comprises acres of wetlands just east of everglades national park and northwest of metropolitan miami.the miners own a substantial portion of the lake belt and wish to mine their lands.in the late,at the miners urging,the corps investigated the propriety of issuing cwa permits to mine acres of the lake belt.in,the corps issued a draft environmental impact statement eis pursuant to nepa,which recognized the proposed project negative environmental impacts.the corps took public comment on the draft,and critics,including multiple federal agencies,raised serious environmental,technical,and legal concerns.nonetheless,the corps issued a final eis the following year largely following the draft eis.in the final eis the corps noted that environmental effects could be mitigated by placing special permit conditions on the miners.for example,one suggested permit condition contemplated a percentage of mining profits be used to purchase wetlands in the pennsuco area,adjacent to the lake belt,for public conservation.
after issuing the final eis,the corps released a cwa public notice that it planned to issue the mining permits.part of the notice indicated that the corps would not engage in esa formal consultation with the fish and wildlife service fws because the corps determined that issuing the permits would have no effect on any species protected by the esa.the public and several federal agencies heavily criticized the public notice.in particular,the fws refused to concur in the corps no effect determination because fws concluded that the mining might have a detrimental impact on the wood stork.the fws therefore requested that formal consultation begin between fws and the corps.
also after the eis,the corps received information regarding the northwest county primary source of drinking the pennsuco wetlands.the information showed that the northwest wellfield was far more vulnerable to contamination than was known at the time the corps approved the permits.the information showed that property values had risen in the pennsuco area,such that the mitigation contemplated by the wetlands for public conservation to replace the destroyed lake belt no longer economically feasible.
in,the corps responded to the overwhelming criticism and new information by limiting the permits,issuing a new public notice suggesting permits covering only acres.this limited proposal also received heavy criticism,including the same fws criticism regarding the impact on the wood stork.responding to fws concerns,the corps drafted a biological assessment ba concluding that the lake belt mining would have no effect on the wood stork because the wood storks that formerly foraged in the lake belt area had shifted locations.in,the fws accepted the corps ba and concurred in the corps no effect finding.
the appellees requested that the corps draft a supplemental eis seis to address the new information and criticisms,and then reevaluate the permits.the corps instead granted the permits in a final record of decision rod.the rod described the criticisms and new information,but in the end found that the mining plan would have no significant effects not already discussed in the eis 
shortly after the rod,the appellees brought this suit against the corps challenging the permits.the miners intervened,and eventually the parties all moved for summary judgment.the court granted the appellees motions for summary judgment on several claims and their voluntary motions to dismiss their other claims.the court then remanded to the corps for further development,but retained jurisdiction for the purpose of determining an appropriate remedy.de at hereinafter summary judgment order.after the court entered judgment,the corps moved to dismiss as moot the claims relating to esa formal consultation with the fws because the corps and fws subsequently engaged in formal consultation related to the lake belt permits effect on the wood only esa relief appellees sought.the corps otherwise followed the court judgment,and began work on an seis to address the issues the court had raised.
the court denied the motion to dismiss and entered a remedies order supplementing the summary judgment order and addressing remedies.de de.the court held that the permits must be vacated,but stayed the vacatur of some permits pending the corps release of its seis.specifically,the court stayed the vacatur of any permits licensing mining outside the range of the northwest wellfield the miners appealed.the corps did not appeal,choosing instead to comply with the district court judgment and to appear in this appeal as amicus curiae.
ii.jurisdiction 
putting aside the other jurisdictional grounds asserted,we conclude that we have injunction jurisdiction over this case under a.for an order to be appealable pursuant to a,it must be a clear and understandable directive from the district court,it must be enforceable through contempt proceedings,and it must give some or all of the substantive relief sought in the complaint.alabama army corps of eng rs,cir.the district court remedies order contains clear,enforceable directives that sierra club requested in its complaint.see de at issuing specific orders to miners de at requesting injunctive relief in amended complaint.for example,the court stated 
in other words,all devegetating,demucking,scraping,blasting,and harvesting of limestone from the aquifer must stop in the range immediately no later than on tuesday,july.
de at see also id.at ordering cessation of other activity specific to each mining company.sierra club points to the district court express declaration that it was not issuing an injunction,de at,but we conclude this is an instance where substance should control over form.the district court issued commands of such specificity and breadth that no litigant would dare violate them.if the miners had violated the commands,the district court could have initiated contempt proceedings,and it is not clear to us that the court would accept but you said it was an injunction as a defense.in short,we adhere to the adage if it walks like a duck,quacks like a duck,and looks like a duck,then it a duck.bmc,barth,cir tjoflat.
we furthermore accept pendent jurisdiction over the district court grant of summary judgment.like in cable holdings of battlefield,cooke,cir,the summary judgment grant provided the basis for the injunction.consequently,we can not properly exercise our jurisdiction under a without also reviewing the grant of partial summary judgment.id.
iii.merits discussion 
the summary judgment order and its supplemental remedies order together span pages containing footnotes.de de.we commend the district judge for his thorough analysis,but the orders must be vacated and the case remanded because he failed to grant the corps the level of deference contemplated by the apa.though other portions of the district court analysis may be correct,and may alone support a finding that the corps acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner,the district court made clear that it remanded to the corps because of the cumulative effect of the corps errors.de at.on remand the district court should review the corps environmental analysis using the proper level of deference,and again determine whether the cumulative effect of any errors requires vacating the permits.
judgments underlying the injunction 
first,we must determine precisely which judgments we must address.the four claims in sierra club amended complaint on which the district court granted summary judgment were,in short an claim against the corps,because the corps erroneously held that no practicable alternatives existed,because the corps improperly balanced the project benefits and detriments,and because the corps failed to hold a public hearing,claim i an esa claim against the corps,because the corps ba erroneously concluded that the mining would have no impact on the endangered wood stork,claim iii an claim against fws for concurring in the corps no impact determination,claim iv and an claim against the corps,because the eis failed to meet nepa requirements,claim v.after the district court granted summary judgment,but before the court issued the remedies order,the corps and fws undertook esa formal only relief sierra club requested for claims iii and iv.it was therefore improper for the district court to rely on those claims judgments in crafting a remedy the claims were moot thus,the district court could rely only on its judgments on claims i and and judgments against the issuing the injunction.we therefore review those judgments.
standard of review 
the apa provides for judicial review of agency decisions like the corps decision to grant cwa permits to the miners and the corps nepa decisions during the permitting process.the reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law or found to be without observance of procedure required by law.t his standard is exceedingly deferential.fund for animals,rice,cir.the court role is to ensure that the agency came to a rational conclusion,not to conduct its own investigation and substitute its own judgment for the administrative agency decision.preserve endangered areas of cobb history,peach army corps of eng rs,cir.
nepa establishes procedures that a federal agency must follow before taking any action.the agency initially must determine whether the action to be taken constitutes a major federal action that is,an action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c see major reinforces but does not have a meaning independent of significantly.if the agency determines that a proposed activity is a major federal action,the agency must discuss certain issues in a detailed eis.id.on the other hand,if the agency determines that a proposed activity is not a major federal action,it must produce a finding of no significant impact fonsi,a document briefly presenting the reasons why an action will not have a significant effect on the human environment.
in some cases,after an agency publishes a fonsi or an eis,but before any action is taken,the proposed action changes,or the agency receives additional information.in that situation,the agency must make an additional nepa determination the agency must determine whether the changes create,or the information reveals,significant effects on the quality of the human environment not previously considered.marsh or.natural res.council,d see also c.if new,significant effects are shown,the agency must prepare an seis.c.when the change to the proposed action is a minimizing measure,however,the agency is not automatically required to redo the entire environmental analysis.sierra club army corps of eng rs,cir.this is because a minimizing measure effects on the environment will usually fall within the scope of the original nepa analysis.see id.holding that road realignment to minimize environmental impact was within the scope of original eis.
nepa only requires that an agency follow this procedure it does not mandate any particular result.if the adverse environmental effects of the proposed action are adequately identified and evaluated,the agency is not constrained by nepa from deciding that other values outweigh the environmental costs.robertson methow valley citizens council,d.moreover,an agency nepa decisions are only reviewed under the apa highly deferential standard.dep t of transp.pub.citizen,d.yankee nuclear power natural res.def.council,d.
here,the corps originally studied the propriety of issuing permits.because the corps found that issuing those permits would be a major federal action,it prepared an eis.ar.after severe,objections regarding the possible contamination of the northwest wellfield and possible detrimental effect on the protected wood corps adopted a minimizing measure it reduced the permits duration to years and limited the permits acreage.after adopting the minimizing measure and receiving the new information,the corps issued a fonsi,ar at,best read as an addendum to the eis,rejecting the notion that the new information and change in the project were such that an seis was required.three nepa issues were therefore before the district court whether the corps determination that the permits would have no significant effect outside the scope of the original eis was arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion,ar environmental assessment containing corps fonsi whether the corps determination that new information regarding contamination of the northwest wellfield and effects on the wood stork did not necessitate an seis was arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion,ar and whether the permit eis met nepa requirements,ar.
a court can only find a federal agency attempted nepa compliance inadequate where it is arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion in violation of the apa.yankee,at.this standard requires substantial deference to the agency,not only when reviewing decisions like what evidence to find credible and whether to issue a fonsi or eis,but also when reviewing drafting decisions like how much discussion to include on each topic,and how much data is necessary to fully address each issue.the district court here frequently condemned corps actions based on simple disagreement,rather than based on a finding that the actions violated the apa deferential standard 
moreover,nepa is procedural,setting forth no substantive limits on agency.robertson,at.simply put,whether the federal agency ends up taking the major federal action at issue has nothing to do with nepa compliance nepa only requires that the agency follow a certain process in deciding whether to take the action.id.in this case,it would not violate nepa if the eis noted that granting the permits would result in the permanent,irreversible destruction of the entire florida everglades,but the corps decided that economic benefits outweighed that negative environmental impact.that capricious decision might run afoul of a duty imposed by a different statute,but it would not violate any duty imposed by nepa.id.at.i t would not have violated nepa if the forest service,after complying with the act procedural prerequisites,had decided that the benefits to be derived from downhill skiing at sandy butte justified the issuance of a special use permit,notwithstanding the loss of percent,percent,or even percent of the mule deer herd.other statutes may impose substantive environmental obligations on federal agencies,but nepa merely prohibits than action.footnote omitted.
the district court nepa analysis erroneously focuses on the corps decision to take the major federal the the adequacy of the mitigation measures on which the corps conditioned the permits substantive issues like whether to grant the permits and what mitigation conditions to adopt are irrelevant to nepa compliance.the following passage highlights the district court flawed belief that nepa places substantive limits on federal action 
if these permits had been issued as fifty year permits,the court would have invalidated the permits and directed the corps to deny the permits rather than simply remanding the case for further study.such a conclusion would have been required under nepa and the cwa because of the significant adverse effects and the corps insufficient mitigation and other analyses.
de at emphasis added.nepa can never provide grounds for a court to direct a federal agency substantive decision.
we offer no opinion as to whether the corps complied with nepa during the permitting process.we must,however,vacate the district court orders and remand for the nepa issues to be decided by the district court in the first instance because the court failed to grant the corps the proper level of deference and because the court failed to recognize nepa limited operation as a procedural,rather than substantive,command to federal agencies.on remand,the district court should address the issues with an eye toward the proper deferential apa standard and nepa limited,procedural scope.
the same pervasive lack of deference infects the district court analysis as with its nepa analysis,the court failed to view the cwa claims through the deferential lens of the apa the judgment on the claim also is vacated.
iv.conclusion 
the district court seems to have predetermined the answer to the ultimate issue,concluding that the corps should not permit mining in the lake belt,and analyzed the permitting process with that answer in mind.indeed,the court made its predetermination of the ultimate issue explicit in its conclusion 
regardless,however,of whether new studies may soon indicate that the aquifer is not being harmed by the mining activities,or that the groundwater seepage effects can be minimized,or even if a more probing analysis reveals that there truly are no practicable and environmentally preferable alternatives to mining in this precious resource,the court conclusion would be unchanged.
de at.in other words,no matter what the corps concluded,and no matter what evidence supported that conclusion,the court would have banned mining because of its own conclusion that mining in the lake belt is a bad thing.id.at.the discretion to grant or deny cwa permits,however,is first given to federal agencies,not federal courts.
again,we offer no opinion as to whether the corps complied with nepa or the cwa during the permitting process we instead remand to the district court to answer those questions in the first instance,applying the proper standard of review the judgment,the judgment,and the remedies order are vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
vacated and remanded.
although i agree with much of the majority opinion,i must respectfully dissent from its judgment.specifically,i agree that we have jurisdiction,that the endangered species act claim was mooted,and that the district court nepa analysis was erroneous.but i would affirm the district court disposition of the clean water act claim,as well as its remedial decisions.
first,i agree with the majority that we have appellate jurisdiction over the summary judgment and remedies orders.the latter order is,in substance,both an injunction,for the reasons explained by the majority,and a final order,because any new mining permits issued in response to the district court vacatur and remand would be based on a different administrative record,and might well have different terms and conditions.thus,after the remedies order,there was nothing more to be done in the district court with respect to these permits.
second,the majority is also correct that the endangered species act claim was mooted by the corps consultation with the fish and wildlife service.unlike the majority,however,i believe we should resolve on this appeal whether the mining companies are entitled to vacatur of the esa judgment.the district court rejected a motion to vacate the esa claim as moot,and there is no reason to believe the equities have changed since then.because i would reach this issue,i would hold that the mining companies are not entitled to vacatur.as the leading supreme court case makes clear,vacatur of a judgment on appeal is an equitable remedy,and the predominant equitable consideration is whether the mootness is brought about by the party seeking appellate review,by the prevailing party below,or by happenstance.bancorp mortgage bonner mall,d.in particular,when a case becomes moot by the voluntary action of an appellant,vacatur is typically not appropriate.see id.at.this rule does equity because when an aggrieved party moots his appeal by his own conduct,he not only abandons his right to appellate review but also forfeits any argument that the preclusive effect of the judgment against him ought to be erased.
here,the corps mooted the esa claim.the summary judgment order determined the corps was in dereliction of its duties under the endangered species act by failing to consult with fws about the effects of the instant mining on the wood stork.the corps acquiesced in this determination by undertaking the consultation required by the esa.were it a party to the appeal,the corps could not obtain vacatur because it mooted the claim.granted,the mining companies,not the corps,are the parties now requesting vacatur.but as against the plaintiffs,their equities are no better than those of the corps,whose decision they benefit from and are defending.the plaintiffs brought this litigation,in part,to force the corps to comply with the esa.they won,obtaining summary judgment.the corps then fulfilled its procedural obligations rather than seek review here.equity entitles the plaintiffs to maintain their judgment,with the preclusive effect and prevailing party status which accompany it.see,district director,citizenship and immigration,cir discussing prevailing party status.accordingly,i would expressly deny the vacatur sought by the mining companies.
next,i turn to the national environmental policy act claims.again,i agree with the majority that although the district court cited the correct nepa standard of review,it applied substantially the wrong one.the district court did find procedural faults with the permitting process,and those faults may be a sufficient basis to conclude that the corps violated nepa.but the district court evaluation of procedural nepa compliance is so intertwined with a substantive critique of the corps decision that it is simply impossible for a reviewing court to separate harmless from prejudicial errors.
yet the district court nepa errors are not fatal to its judgment.because i believe the district court correctly determined that the corps violated the clean water act in the permitting process,i would affirm on that basis the district court judgment vacating the permits.thus,i respectfully dissent from the majority decision to the contrary.although the district court made some misstatements of law in its cwa analysis,i believe they are harmless error and that the record contains a sufficient basis to affirm the judgment i would affirm the district court disposition of the cwa claim because the corps erred i by failing to apply the presumption of practical alternatives and ii by relying on the larsen report to establish an absence of practical alternatives without undertaking independent verification of its accuracy 
the pertinent cwa regulations prohibit granting permits if there is a practical alternative to the proposed discharge which would have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem,so long as the alternative does not have other significant adverse environmental consequences.a.a presumption that practical,environmentally preferable alternatives exist arises if the activity associated with a discharge which is proposed for a wetland does not require access or proximity to or siting within the wetland in question to fulfill its basic purpose is not water dependent.a.the presumption that practical,environmentally preferable alternatives exist applies until the proponent of the discharge clearly demonstrate s otherwise.id.further,all practical alternatives to discharge in wetlands are presumed to have less adverse impact,unless clearly demonstrated otherwise.id.thus,where the presumption applies,the permit applicant bears the burden of providing detailed,clear,and convincing information proving that an alternative with less adverse impact is impracticable.greater yellowstone coalition flowers,cir further,such information provided by a permit applicant must be independently verified by the corps.id.
given the language of the regulation,a correct statement of the project basic purpose affects whether the presumption of practicable alternatives applies,and thus the extent of the applicant burden.see wildlife federation whistler,cir determining project purpose is central to practicable alternatives analysis.the corps has discretion to characterize the project basic purpose in the first instance,including whether to accept or reject the applicant characterization of that purpose.in so doing,the corps must take the applicant goals and purposes into account.louisiana wildlife federation york,cir.but an applicant can not define a project in order to preclude the existence of any alternative sites and thus make what is practicable appear impracticable.sylvester army corps of engineers,cir.if an applicant did so and the corps adopted the applicant characterization of the project purpose,the corps would have abused its discretion.
in other words,the question is how specifically to construe the project basic purpose.in its record of decision,the corps stated that the basic purpose of this project is to extract limestone,but the overall project purpose is to provide limestone from county.in the language of the regulation,the activity associated with the discharge,limestone mining,does not require siting within the wetland in question to fulfill its basic purpose,extracting limestone.see a.limestone mining in general is not.national wildlife federation norton,d.neither does securing a limestone supply from south florida require the project to be situated in wetlands,as there are other deposits of limestone located in south florida it is only mining this particular limestone that would require the project to be situated in wetlands.
the district court concluded that the corps,following the lead of the mining companies,construed the project purpose in an artificially narrow fashion to avoid the presumption of practical alternatives,thereby abusing its discretion.i agree.the corps effectively construed the project basic purpose as mining this limestone out from underneath these wetlands.so construed,a conclusion of is inevitable.but such a formulation of a project purpose could no doubt be formulated for every permit application,and routine acceptance of such formulations would emasculate the presumption,defeating its purpose.moreover,such a formulation of a project basic purpose appears inconsistent with the corps formulation of project purposes in other cases.two simple examples illustrate the point.when an applicant seeks to build houses with boat docks,his project basic purpose is to build housing,which need not occur on wetlands.the boat docks are incidental to the basic purpose.shoreline marsh,aff.cir.in contrast,when a project basic purpose is only to build a boat dock,it is.whistler,at.a project is not simply because an applicant asks to do it on wetlands,but only where it literally can not be done elsewhere.
of course,limestone mining has to occur where limestone deposits are.so if the lake belt contained the only deposits in south florida,then perhaps a conclusion of would be justified.but even assuming that limestone sources from other states and nations are irrelevant to the alternatives analysis,it is conceded that there are limestone deposits elsewhere in south florida.in my view,that ends the issue,regardless of whether the other deposits are inaccessible or of inferior quality.the corps formulated the project purpose as simply extracting limestone,or as securing a limestone supply from south florida.plainly,there are potential alternative sites to achieve these purposes if those alternatives are infeasible,the mining companies should be able to make their case that there are no practical,environmentally preferable alternatives.but they should have to bear the higher burden of proof necessary to rebut the presumption of practical alternatives in so doing.in my view,the corps failure to apply that presumption warranted summary judgment against it on the cwa claim.
regardless of whether the presumption applies,i would also hold that the corps erred in relying on the larsen report to establish the absence of practical alternatives without independent verification.the larsen report was a study prepared by a consultant to the mining industry,and it was the primary source relied upon by the corps in concluding that no practical alternatives existed to mining in the lake belt.many of its conclusions are repeated nearly verbatim in the record of decision.there is no indication in the record that the corps independently verified the information or conclusions in the larsen report.meanwhile,appellees have challenged the report as biased,arguing that the data underlying it is and provided by mining company officials,rather than gleaned from independent evaluations of the market for limestone products.
the district court,correctly in my view,concluded the corps erred by relying on the larsen report without undertaking independent verification of its reliability,or at least explaining on the record why,in its expert judgment,it considered the report conclusions reliable.the corps does not err simply because it relies on data submitted by a permit applicant.see,friends of the earth hintz,cir.indeed,an applicant will frequently be the only party with an incentive to develop such data.moreover,since the applicant is seeking to obtain a discretionary benefit from the government,it is appropriate for it to bear the cost of developing the data necessary to justify its proposal.but as the cases also reflect,when information submitted by an interested party is specifically and credibly challenged as inaccurate,the corps has an independent duty to investigate.van abbema fornell,cir see also greater yellowstone coalition,at.it is arbitrary and capricious for an agency to rely on such challenged submissions without undertaking some form of independent verification or evaluation.the corps own regulations require as much and an agency failure to follow its own regulations and procedures is arbitrary and capricious.see,simmons block,cir citation omitted.courts demand independent verification not to encourage duplication of effort,but to ensure that the corps process is reliable and that deference is afforded to the corps only where its expertise is meaningfully implicated in the decision to adopt an applicant conclusions.
of course,the corps retains its customary discretion in determining the scope and depth of independent verification when it is required,or in explaining why independent verification is unnecessary.for example,in some cases an report may have indicia of reliability within its four corners,or the challenge to its accuracy may not be credible.nonetheless,the corps discretion is not unbounded a reviewing court must be satisfied that the agency made a reasoned decision.a conclusory decision to place decisive reliance on contested data submitted by an interested party is not reasoned,and therefore deserves no deference.yet that appears to be what happened here.
to be clear,i express no view on the accuracy of the larsen report.neither this court nor the district court is equipped to decide that question the corps is.the larsen report may well be scrupulous and fair.but for all the corps has explained in the record,it is a classic expert report painted over with a thin veneer of rigor because plaintiffs raise arguments,unaddressed by the corps,that the larsen report is biased in favor of the mining industry,and because that report was the primary basis upon which the corps justified its finding that no practical alternatives exist,i agree with the district court that the corps acted arbitrarily and ca
