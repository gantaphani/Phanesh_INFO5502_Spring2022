the committee for green foothills,a california nonprofit corporation,committee brought a petition for a writ of mandamus to enforce the california environmental quality act ceqa pub,et against the county of santa clara county and its board of supervisors board.the litigation arose from the board december,resolution approving an agreement to be entered with the board of trustees of leland stanford junior university stanford to satisfy condition of a general use permit approved in gup.the condition required stanford to dedicate easements for,develop and maintain portions of trails,identified as the and trails on the santa clara countywide master plan,that crossed stanford lands.the december resolution selected a final alignment for the trail from among several potential alternative routes,certified the trail alignment environmental impact report eir and made ceqa findings for the trail alignment,determined no further ceqa review is required by the county prior to execution of the agreement for trail easements,construction,management and maintenance and grant of easements trails agreement with stanford insofar as the agreement concerned the and trail alignments,and approved the execution of the trails agreement.among other things,the trails agreement authorized portions of the trail to be developed outside santa clara county in san mateo county and the town of portola valley instead of within the county,provided those other jurisdictions cooperated,and declared that the agreement execution satisfied gup condition.
the committee makes no claim of wrongdoing with respect to the trail.the gravamen of the committee claims is that the board resolution approved activities with respect to the trail without the requisite ceqa environmental review and that environmental review was improperly deferred and left to other jurisdictions even though the board approval committed the county to a definite course of action that conflicted with gup condition requiring the development of a trail within the county.
respondents successfully demurred on statute of limitations grounds.the committee appeals from the judgment of dismissal entered following the superior court order.the principal issue before the trial court was whether the statute of limitations set forth in either section or government code section,subdivision c,barred the proceedings.we conclude that the court incorrectly sustained the respondents demurrer without leave to amend on the ground the proceedings were necessarily.

procedural history and background 
on june,the committee filed a petition for writ of mandamus challenging the approval of the changes to the trail alignment on the ground the approval violated ceqa because no environmental review had been conducted prior to the decision.it sought to compel respondents to set aside the portion of the board december,resolution that deems stanford to have complied with gup condition and allows the relocation of the trail alignment to a location generally on the west side of san francisquito creek in the county of san mateo and the town of portola valley it also sought injunctive relief precluding respondents from engaging in any activity pursuant to the approval of the trail alignment in the above described resolution,until the environmental review complies with ceqa and the trail alignment complies with ceqa.
respondents and the real parties in interest demurred to the petition on the ground that it failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action code civ,subd.e in that it was time barred under section,subdivision c,action alleging that an eir does not comply with ceqa must be commenced within days of filing the notice of determination and california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision c.they successfully asked the court to take judicial notice of the board december,resolution,the december,notice of determination,and revised december,notice of determination.
in the preamble to the resolution,the board made the following factual statements.stanford university applied for a community plan and general use permit gup to allow development of an additional square feet of academic development and housing units at stanford,which the board of supervisors approved on december.gup condition requires stanford to dedicate easements for,develop,and maintain the portions of two trail alignments which cross stanford lands shown in the santa clara countywide trails master plan routes and.d ue to complexities with the alignment,including but not limited to a lawsuit between the county of san mateo and property owners along a portion of the alpine road within or near the alignment,in the board directed county staff and stanford to suspend work on the alignment and to proceed with the alignment to avoid any further delay in implementing the alignment.a supplemental eir for the trail alignment assesse d the environmental consequences of constructing one of the two trails that stanford is required to dedicate as a result of a mitigation measure identified in the gup eir and analyze d the environmental effects of three potential primary trail alignments,which are identified as,and,and several alternative segments within the primary alignments 
as to the trail route,the resolution preamble stated stanford has completed the portions of the alignment that are within santa clara county.b ecause the remaining portions of the alignment lie within the jurisdiction of san mateo county and the town of portola valley,necessitating their cooperation,stanford has agreed to provide funding to san mateo county million and portola valley million for trail construction and environmental compliance and to dedicate to those jurisdictions any easements that are needed for the trail across stanford land.
in the portion of the resolution addressing ceqa compliance,the environmental review process to date was described.the resolution recognized that the gup eir had identified a significant environmental impact resulting from stanford development,which would reduce availability of recreational facilities but increase demand.it stated that a mitigation measure identified in the gup eir required stanford to dedicate trail easements shown on the county trails master plan in order to provide more recreational opportunities.it also referred to gup condition,which required stanford to dedicate easements for,and develop and maintain the portions of the two trail alignments which cross stanford lands shown in the santa clara county countywide trails master plan routes and.
in its resolution,the board certified the final supplemental eir for the actions described in this resolution and the final seir,the selection of the alternative alignment bicycle lane along deer creek road and approval of the agreement for trail easements pertaining to that alignment.the board made other ceqa findings with respect to the alignment.its resolution stated that t he seir supplements the gup eir and the santa clara county countywide trails master plan update seir,which are both considered program eirs under ceqa.
in regard to the and trails,the resolution stated the trails master plan seir is a program eir that evaluates,at a broad level,the environmental effects of implementing the county policies for the planning,acquisition,design,operations,and maintenance of countywide trails and trail facilities the trails master plan recognizes a variety of types of trail routes and acknowledges that some routes may extend beyond the borders of santa clara county.no reference was made to the gup eir or to any supplemental eir for the trail alignment.the board did not make any detailed ceqa findings for the trail alignment as it had done for alignment in its resolution.the board did not state that the approved activities with regard to the trail had been examined in light of the gup eir and the countywide trails master plan eirs or that any determination had been made that those activities were within the scope of those program eirs.
the board then made the following determinations with regard to the and alignments with regard to the and trail routes,the county approval of the agreement for trail easements does not constitute county approval of construction,operation or maintenance of specific trail improvements along those routes.the agreement for trail easements contemplates that,prior to any trail improvements,detailed construction plans will be reviewed and considered by the jurisdictions of san mateo county,town of portola valley and town of los altos hills,and that those jurisdictions will have discretion to consider whether and how to improve trail improvements.accordingly,the board finds that no further ceqa review is required by the county prior to execution of the agreement for trail easements.
the board found with respect to stanford compliance with gup condition based on stanford commitments as reflected in the agreement for trail easements,the board finds stanford to be in compliance with condition of the general use permit.the board delegated to the director of the county parks and recreation department the authority to take all further actions by the county that are necessary or appropriate to approve and fully implement the,and trail alignments in accordance with the agreement for trail easements,following approval by county counsel as to form and legality and approval by the office of the county executive.
an unsigned copy of the trails agreement was attached as exhibit to the board resolution.the agreement to be executed recited condition of the gup condition implements the community plan and the trails master plan and provides stanford shall dedicate easements for,develop,and maintain the portions of the two trail alignments which cross stanford lands shown in the trails master plan routes and,according to the following timeline a.in consultation with the county parks and recreation department,stanford shall identify trail easements and complete agreements for trail easements within one year of gup approval.for purposes of this condition,the term easement includes any other equally enforceable mechanism acceptable to the county board of supervisors.stanford shall work with the county parks and recreation department to identify responsibilities for trail construction,management and maintenance.an agreement regarding these issues,including but not limited to a time frame for implementation,shall be reached within one year of gup approval.
the trails agreement further recited that t he parties intend that by entering into this agreement,stanford satisfies condition of the gup.the agreement explicitly declared execution of this agreement satisfies condition of the general use permit.stanford shall perform its covenants contained in this agreement it also declared the and alignments described in this agreement are consistent with the trails master plan.stanford has identified trail easements for the portions of these alignments that cross its lands in consultation with the county parks and recreation department.
in regard to implementation of the trail,the trails agreement required stanford to provide,at no cost,copies of its engineering plans of possible improvements to,and a possible trail alignment of,the trail in the county of san mateo and the town of portola valley.it further stated that the alignment shown on the existing plans is only one possible alignment for the trail and provided that stanford,the county of san mateo and town of portola valley will jointly determine the final alignment.
in addition to provisions implementing the trail alignment,the agreement provided stanford will also fund improvements to the and trails identified in the trails master plan that are located within unincorporated san mateo county,the town of portola valley,and the town of los altos hills.stanford will also dedicate easements for the portions of the alignment that cross its lands in san mateo county and the town of portola valley.it obligated stanford to make specified funds available to the county of san mateo and the town of portola valley.in regard to dedication of trail easements,the agreement provided upon request and contemporaneous with the initial payment to each or at another time acceptable to the other jurisdictions,stanford shall dedicate to san mateo and portola valley public easements reasonably necessary for the trail that cross sic stanford lands,and for the widening and improvement of it according to plans 
the trails agreement recognized the possibility that other jurisdictions might not enter into agreements to construct trail improvements,a condition precedent to stanford obligation to fund improvements by those jurisdictions,or other jurisdictions might not timely complete construction.in those eventualities,stanford obligation to fund trail improvements converted to an obligation to pay santa clara county in accordance with the agreement.the county was required to use those funds received from stanford under this substitute provision in some unspecified way to mitigate the adverse effect on recreational opportunities for existing or new campus residents and facility users that will be caused by the housing and academic development approved by the gup,which will reduce the availability of recreational facilities while increasing the demand for such facilities,provided the funds shall not be used for facilities on stanford lands without stanford consent.
the original notice of determination made no mention of the trail alignment.the notice project description and project location referred to only the trail alignment.the only eir mentioned in the notice was the eir for the trail alignment.the notice stated that t he project will not have a significant effect on the environment,an eir had been prepared for the project,approval of the project was conditioned upon mitigation measures,and f indings were made pursuant to section of ceqa.the stamp on the environmental declaration of the santa clara county shows the notice was posted december,through january.
the revised notice of determination changed the project description to include the board actions with respect to the and trail alignments.it referenced the eir for the trail alignment,the gup eir,and the countywide trails master plan.the notice statement of project location specified that the alignment was located generally on the west side of the creek in san mateo county and the town of portola valley,along the alpine road from rural lane to arastradero road approximately mi.the notice statement of project description included the county of santa clara approved the agreement for trail easements with regard to the and trail routes,but the agreement does not constitute county approval of construction,operation or maintenance of specific trail improvements along these routes.the agreement contemplates that,prior to any trail improvements,detailed construction plans will be reviewed and considered by the jurisdictions of san mateo county,town of portola valley,and town of los altos hills for their discretion of how to improve the trail improvements.italics omitted.like the previous notice of determination,it stated that t he project will not have a significant effect on the environment,an eir had been prepared for the project,mitigation measures have been made a condition of approval of the project,and f indings were made pursuant to section of ceqa.the stamp on the environmental declaration of the santa clara county showed the notice was posted december,through january,sic.
the committee successfully asked the court to take judicial notice of the following a december,memorandum to the board from the director of the county department of parks and recreation a september,memorandum to the board from the planning office of the county department of planning and development a public comment letter and response in the trail alignment eir and the november countywide trails master plan map.
the december memorandum stated that the trail alignment concept noted in the gup,and as depicted in the countywide trails master plan map,is to create a trail near san francisquito creek on stanford lands in santa claracounty.italics added.the memorandum described the difficulties encountered in attempting to implement this alignment due to potential environmental impacts to a riparian habitat and stanford rejection of an interior alignment.it indicated the current proposal was to build a new trail,or renovate the existing trail,in a location generally west of san francisquito creek in san mateo county and the town of portola valley.the memorandum acknowledged that such an alignment would require cooperative agreements with those jurisdictions.as to ceqa compliance,the memorandum indicated that a supplemental eir for the trail alignment had been prepared and recommended that the board certify it,select the alternative alignment,and make related ceqa findings.the memorandum did not indicate any environmental review had been done with regard to the proposed changes to trail alignment but acknowledged that t he details of the alignment must be further analyzed in the ceqa study 
the september memorandum made staff recommendations relating to the trail alignment to the board.it indicated that staff was following the board direction to proceed with and to address at a later date.
the response to the public comment,which complained about locating a trail in san mateo county,clarified the route is not within the scope of this seir.the countywide trails map shows proposed trail routes within the county and possible points of connection to trail routes in adjacent counties.
the trial court sustained respondents demurrer with leave to amend.
the committee filed a new pleading,denominated first amended petition for writ of mandamus.it alleged in december,the county of santa clara,by and through its board of supervisors,respondents adopted the stanford university plan cp and general use permit gup,and certified the stanford university environmental impact report gup eir.the gup provided the leland stanford junior university and the board of trustees of the leland stanford junior university stanford or real parties with entitlements for development of over two million square feet and over housing units,subject to implementation of specified environmental mitigation measures and permit conditions of approval.mitigations and conditions of approval included the dedication of the and trails as specified in the santa clara countywide trails master plan scc trails plan.this condition was known as gup condition.according to the gup eir,the mitigation measures were required in order to mitigate environmental impacts associated with stanford development because the will reduce the availability of recreational facilities while increasing the demand for such facilities.the gup eir states that stanford shall also dedicate the trail easements shown on the county trails master plan.gup condition requires that stanford dedicate,develop and maintain the trail identified in the scc trails plan.
the amended petition alleged that the scc trails plan does not call for trail to be located in san mateo county portola valley and the approval of the trail in san mateo county and portola valley,agencies over which respondents have no jurisdiction,does not meet gup condition.it stated in december,stanford had proposed to satisfy gup condition pertaining to the trail by constructing a trail in the county of san mateo first and if agreements could not be made with the involved jurisdictions county of san mateo,city of menlo park and the town of portola valley,stanford would commit to providing a trail near the east side of san francisquito creek in the county of santa clara.no agreement was ever reached between stanford and the county of san mateo or the town of portola valley.it alleged that approval of relocating segments of the trail to the county of san mateo and the town of portola valley without any environmental review violated ceqa.the petition averred unlike the approval of the trail,there was no environmental review prepared for the proposed trail in the county of san mateo and the town of portola valley.
the amended petition asserted that the board approval of the trail in san mateo county and the town of portola valley in its december resolution is subject to environmental review under ceqa because its approval is a project under ceqa.it stated that the eir does not review the environmental impacts of the proposed trail in san mateo county and the town of portola valley and the eir explicitly stated the trail route is not within the scope of the seir.this petition further alleged that the board of supervisors abused its discretion by approving the trail outside of its jurisdiction without preparing any environmental review.
according to the petition,t he trail,as provided for in the gup and as depicted in the scc trails plan,is designed to create a trail near san francisquito trancos creek on stanford lands in the county of santa clara.it stated that the agreement does not result in full compliance with the permit condition since the agreement does not result in construction of the trail designated in the county master trails plan as required by gup condition.
in a first cause of action,the committee sought declaratory relief in the form of a judicial declaration that both notices of determination had no force and effect or validity as they relate to the trail because respondents never determined whether the proposed trail may have a significant effect on the environment in a second cause of action,the committee alleged that respondents county and board had violated ceqa and abused their discretion by failing to perform environmental review for the approval of the trail in the county of san mateo and the town of portola valley.the committee sought a writ of mandamus compelling respondents county and board to set aside the board resolution insofar as it deems stanford to have complied with gup c ondition and allows construction of the trail on the west side of san francisquito creek in the county of san mateo and the town of portola valley and compelling them to comply with ceqa.it also sought injunctive relief preventing respondents from engaging in any activity pursuant to the proposed trail as approved in the board december,resolution until respondents conduct environmental review and comply with ceqa.
in a third cause of action,the committee alleged that,among other things,ceqa and the ceqa guidelines require that mitigation measures be fully enforceable through permit conditions,agreements and other measures,condition requires the trail to be built in accordance with the county trails master plan,and respondents county and board have a mandatory duty to require compliance with condition.the committee sought a writ of mandamus compelling respondents to enforce gup condition.
respondents filed a demurrer to the first amended petition on the ground it was time barred by section,subdivisions c and e,and by government code section,subdivision c.they argued that the ceqa statute of limitations barred any claim by the committee that the county did not comply with ceqa when it adopted the resolution approving the trails agreement and government code section,subdivision c,barred any claim challenging the county determination that stanford was in compliance with gup condition.
the committee countered that when an agency fails to make any determinations whether a project will have a significant affect sic on the environment,the statute of limitations is days under section,subdivision a.it also contended that its petition for mandamus was simply an action to enforce an approved permit condition that had not been amended and,therefore,the day limitation period under government code section,subdivision c,was inapplicable.
the committee asked the trial court to take judicial notice of the may annual report prepared by the santa clara county planning office regarding stanford university compliance with the conditions of the general use permit.the trial court denied the request in ruling on the demurrer,however,the trial court took judicial notice of the documents submitted with the prior demurrer but asserted it was taking notice of the existence and filing of the documents and not the truth of the matters stated therein.
the trial court found that the notices of determination did not lack any of the material information required and were at a minimum in substantial compliance with ceqa guidelines the court stated that the petition allegations that the county failed to conduct environmental review for the trail are contradicted by the judicially noticed documents and are disregarded.the court also indicated that it would disregard allegations contradicting the statement in the board resolution that gup condition had been complied with and,therefore,the committee could not state facts sufficient to justify relief.it found that the mandamus proceeding to enforce gup condition most closely resemble d a ceqa claim and was subject to the limitations period under section,subdivision e.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,finding that all challenges to the county action were required to be filed within days from the filing of the second notice of determination under section,subdivision b,c,or e,that is no later than january,and the defects could not be cured by amendment 
a judgment of dismissal was entered and the committee appealed.

in this case,the revised notice of determination,of which the trial court took judicial notice,specified a number of eirs the stanford university trail alignment eir,the gup eir,and the countywide trails master plan.the board december resolution,of which the trial court took judicial notice,identified the gup eir and countywide trails master plan seir as program eirs under ceqa and the trail alignment eir as a supplement to those program eirs.

in addition to identifying the significant environmental effects of a project,two of the specific purposes of an eir are to identify alternatives to the project and to indicate the manner in which those significant effects can be mitigated or avoided,subd.a see,ceqa guidelines.under ceqa,a public agency must consider measures that might mitigate a project adverse environmental impact,and adopt them if feasible.mountain lion foundation fish game com.cal th,d.a decisionmaking agency is prohibited from approving a project for which significant environmental effects have been identified unless it makes specific findings about alternatives and mitigation measures.see also environmental council board of supervisors d.id.at.the requirement ensures there is evidence of the public agency actual consideration of alternatives and mitigation measures,and reveals to citizens the analytical process by which the public agency arrived at its decision.citations.under ceqa,the public agency bears the burden of affirmatively demonstrating that,notwithstanding a project impact on the environment,the agency approval of the proposed project followed meaningful consideration of alternatives and mitigation measures.citation.ibid.
a public agency must provide that measures to mitigate or avoid significant effects on the environment are fully enforceable through permit conditions,agreements,or other measures.conditions of project approval may be set forth in referenced documents which address required mitigation measures or,in the case of the adoption of a plan,policy,regulation,or other public project,by incorporating the mitigation measures into the plan,policy,regulation,or project design,subd.b.the public agency must adopt a reporting or monitoring program for the changes made to the project or conditions of project approval,adopted in order to mitigate or avoid significant effects on the environment.the reporting or monitoring program shall be designed to ensure compliance during project implementation,subd.a.
in this case,the amended petition allegations,which we must accept as true for purposes of demurrer,and the properly noticed official acts suggest that respondents county and board viewed development of the and trails as distinct subsequent activities or smaller projects under the program eirs subject to separate environmental review and approval,they determined any environmental review of a trail route was premature,and they conducted environmental review of only the proposed subsequent activities concerning the trail alignment.those allegations also indicate that the trails agreement did not entirely conform to gup condition with respect to the trail alignment and in effect modified the permit condition and the larger development project authorized by the gup.it appears that the committee may be able to allege facts showing that the proposed changes with respect to the trail alignment were sufficiently substantial to require an eir subsequent or supplemental to the gup eir.see ceqa guidelines,see also ceqa guidelines,subd.f the provisions of ceqa guidelines sections,and apply when the project being analyzed is a change to,or a further approval for,a project for which an eir was previously certified vineyard area citizens for responsible growth,city of rancho cordova,supra,cal th at,d,to the extent a subsequent subdivision proposal relies on different water sources than were proposed in the specific plan it implements,or the likely availability of the intended water sources has changed between the time of the specific plan and the subdivision application or more has been learned about the impacts of exploiting those sources,changes in the project,the surrounding circumstances or the available information would exist within the meaning of section,requiring additional ceqa analysis under that section concerned citizens of costa mesa,dist.agricultural,supra,cal d at,some changes allegedly made in a stadium project by a contract between a district and a builder could be characterized as substantial enough to require the district to file a subsequent eir to assess their environmental effects.in addition,the committee may be able to state facts indicating that the proposed subsequent activities with regard to the trail alignment should have been examined in light of the program eirs to determine whether the activities were within the scope of the project covered by the program eirs and whether those activities had potential environmental effects not fully examined in those eirs and a new initial study leading to either another eir or a negative declaration should have been prepared prior to any discretionary approval of those activities.ceqa guidelines.
the noticed documents do not negate any critical allegations of the amended petition.if anything,they support them.even though the revised notice of determination stated in preprinted language that a n environmental impact report has been prepared for this project pursuant to the provisions of ceqa and t he project will not have a significant effect on the environment,the comments in the project description section of the revised notice of determination,as well as in the board resolution,reasonably imply that the county and its board formally determined that the time was not yet ripe for environmental review with respect to the trail alignment activities and no ceqa review was conducted with respect to those activities.the noticed documents do not disclose any determination that the potential environmental impacts of the changes regarding the trail alignment had been already analyzed at the programmatic level or any recognition that approval of changes to a project already approved may itself constitute approval of a project subject to ceqa and necessitate further environmental review.
nevertheless,we recognize that a statute of limitation operates conclusively with respect to all causes of action regardless of merit.norgart upjohn cal th,d.t he ceqa limitations period depends upon the nature of the alleged ceqa violation on which the governmental action is being challenged.international longshoremen warehousemen union board of supervisors d.the committee is not asserting that any of the identified eirs failed to comply with ceqa or that the significant effect determination regarding the trail were improper.thus,as framed by the amended petition,this is neither a n action or proceeding alleging that a public agency has improperly determined whether a project may have a significant effect on the environment,subd.b nor a n action or proceeding alleging that an environmental impact report does not comply with ceqa,subd.c,which leaves subdivisions a and e of section since respondents do not dispute that subdivision d projects not subject to ceqa is inapplicable here.in substance,subdivision a pertains to an action charging the public agency with approving or undertaking a project having a significant effect on the environment without any attempt to comply with ceqa and subdivision e is a provision governing an action based on any other failure of the public agency to comply with ceqa.international longshoremen warehousemen union board of supervisors,supra,d at.

the above descriptions are consistent with the language of section,subdivision e,which applies to a n action or proceeding alleging that another act or omission of a public agency does not comply with ceqa italics added.another in this context most reasonably means different or distinct from the one first named or considered.webster third new international dictionary,unabridged ed,that is those actions or proceedings specified in subdivisions a through d of section.thus,if this proceeding comes within the language of subdivision a,the limitation period under subdivision e is inapplicable even if a notice of determination was filed.
we recognize that one of the enrolled bill reports stated t his bill provides for a statute of limitation on any discretionary determination made by a public agency on a project if the basis of such challenge is either that there has been an improper determination on potential significant effects or that the prepared environmental impact report is inadequate.thus,essentially any determinations made by public agencies under the environmental quality act will be subject to a or day challenge limitation,provided a notice of determination has been filed.if no notice is filed or utilized,a period of limitation applies.water resources board,enrolled bill on assem.bill reg.sess.february.while courts have routinely found enrolled bill reports,prepared by a responsible agency contemporaneous with passage and before signing,instructive on matters of legislative intent elsner uveges cal th,fn,d,we find this enrolled bill report unpersuasive since it conflicts with the language of the statute and is not echoed elsewhere in the legislative history see people garcia cal th,d,we look first to the plain meaning of the statutory language,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning and i f there is no ambiguity in the statutory language,its plain meaning controls we presume the legislature meant what it said.
furthermore,when different words are used in contemporaneously enacted,adjoining subdivisions of a statute,the inference is compelling that a difference in meaning was intended.people jones cal d.the legislature has demonstrated that it knows how to explicitly impose a shorter limitations period for certain actions following the filing of a notice of determination and yet it did not expressly require an action or proceeding alleging that a public agency has approved a project that may have a significant effect on the environment without having determined whether the project may have a significant effect on the environment to be commenced within days of the filing of a notice of determination,subds.b e.the longer limitations period for challenging approvals lacking any determination of potential significant effect is entirely consistent with ceqa fundamental purpose of compelling meaningful.
we conclude that there is a reasonable possibility that the committee can allege facts sufficient to bring this proceeding within the purview of section,subdivision a,that is the board approved changes and subsequent activities with respect to the trail alignment that may have a significant effect on the environment without having determined whether the project may have a significant effect on the environment,subd.a.if we were to reach a contrary conclusion,we would not be interpreting the applicable law in a manner affording the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language.see muzzy ranch solano county airport land use com n,supra,cal th at,d,a court must bear in mind that t he foremost principle under ceqa is that the legislature intended the act to be interpreted in such manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language but see the legislature express intent is that courts,consistent with generally accepted rules of statutory interpretation,shall not interpret this division or the state guidelines adopted pursuant to section in a manner which imposes procedural or substantive requirements beyond those explicitly stated in this division or in the state guidelines.
lastly,even though committee attempts to characterize the county obligation to enforce gup condition as a present and continuing duty enforceable through a writ of mandamus,it is in essence a ceqa claim as well.under the allegations of the amended petition,the board resolution must be viewed a de facto modification of that permit condition and the only alleged basis for the resolution invalidity is the board failure to conduct environmental review
