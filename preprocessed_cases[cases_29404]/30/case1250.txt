plaintiff utah environmental congress uec brought this action alleging that defendants,representatives of the united states forest service forest service,violated federal law by authorizing six separate projects in four national forests in the state of utah.the district court entered judgment in favor of defendants.uec now appeals.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to,affirm the district court decision affirming authorization of three of those projects,reverse the district court decision affirming authorization of the remaining three projects,and remand to the district court with directions to vacate the forest service approval of those latter three projects.
statutory and regulatory framework 
the forest service,an agency within the united states department of agriculture,manages the national forest system under several federal statutes and accompanying regulations.we begin our review of this appeal,as we recently did in a similar case filed by plaintiff uec,by outlining the specific statutory and regulatory framework applicable to the issues raised by uec.utah envt l cong.bosworth,cir uec iii.
national forest management act nfma 
the national forest management act of nfma requires the forest service to develop a land and resource management plan,commonly known as a forest plan,for each unit of the national forest system.uec iii,at citing a,e,g b.each forest plan envisions the forest will be used for multiple purposes,including outdoor recreation,range,timber,watershed,wildlife and fish,and wilderness.id.at quoting e.at the same time,the forest plan provides for diversity of plant and animal communities based on the suitability and capability of the specific land area.id.quoting g b.in turn,the forest service implements each forest plan by approving or disapproving particular projects,each of which must comply with the applicable forest plan.id.
the nfma implementing regulations 
before a forest plan may be created,nfma explicitly requires the secretary of agriculture to issue regulations that set out the process for the development and revision of land management plans for units of the national forest system,and regulations that establish management planning standards and guidelines id.quoting.of particular concern in this case are planning rules the forest service adopted in and revised in,codified at,which govern forest service management at both the programmatic and project levels.id.in november,the forest service substantially amended these regulations,known as the planning rules,replacing them with the planning rules,codified at.id.
as part of the planning rules,the forest service added a new regulation,entitled transition,that attempted to outline how responsible officials within the forest service were to transition from the rules to the rules.section indicated that the forest plan for each unit of the national forest system would be revised pursuant to a schedule established by the chief of the forest service.g.consistent with that goal,a announced an indefinite transition period,begin ning on november,and end ing upon the completion of the revision process for each unit of the national forest system.importantly,for purposes of this case,b created a grace period during which responsible officials within the forest service could,at their discretion,revise forest plans utilizing either the planning rules or the planning rules.
with respect to the implementation of forest plans,a provided that,d uring the transition period,responsible officials would be required to consider the best available science in implementing and,if appropriate,amending the forest plans,forest plans that had yet to be revised.at the same time,however,d also stated decisions made by the responsible official years from november,and afterward must be in conformance with the provisions of this subpart.thus,responsible officials were left to resolve the tension between a mandate that they consider the best available science in implementing existing forest plans during the transition period,and d provision that decisions did not have to conform to this subpart,including,presumably,a,until november,and thereafter.
in may,the forest service publicly noted that field personnel had raised concerns regarding their ability to comply with the rules in terms of making decisions.fr.at that time,the forest service indicated that it expected to address these concerns by removing the requirement or extending the original transition date for projects.id.after publishing a proposed revision on december,the forest service issued an interim final rule on september,amending d to read the date by which decisions made by the responsible official must be in conformance with the provisions of this subpart is extended from november,until the department promulgates its final planning regulations in doing so,the forest service acknowledged that t here wa s a lack of clarity about how projects we re to be compliant with the rule,and that t his uncertainty and lack of clarity could have pose d an unreasonable analysis burden on field units when planning for project decisions.fr.unfortunately,the forest service extension of subsection d grace period did nothing to eliminate the tension between subsections a and d.indeed,as exemplified by some of the projects at issue in this appeal,the september,interim final rule could have been interpreted by responsible officials as an indication that they were not obligated to apply the best available science standard to decisions,including project approvals,until the final regulations were promulgated.
on september,the forest service issued a final rule to clarify the intent of the transition section of the planning regulations,regarding the consideration and use of the best available science to inform project decision making that implement ed a land management plan fr.in doing so,the forest service acknowledged that c onsiderable uncertainty ha d arisen regarding the transition provisions,and that t his uncertainty ha d affected the ability of the forest service to utilize fully the provisions of paragraph a to consider the best science available in project decision making.id.at.the final rule ultimately added an appendix appendix b to the end of adding clarifying language.id.at.
these transition provisions remained on the books until january when the new rules were finally implemented.uec iii,at citing to,and.the rules retained the best available science standard,requiring the responsible official to take into account the best available science by document ing how the best available science was taken into account in the planning process,and evaluating and disclosing substantial uncertainties and risks in that science.id.quoting a emphasis added.
national environmental policy act nepa 
the national environmental policy act nepa requires federal agencies such as the forest service to analyze environmental consequences before initiating actions that potentially affect the environment.id.at.in conducting this analysis,the forest service must prepare one of the following an environmental impact statement eis,an environmental assessment ea,or a categorical exclusion.id.at.
of these three,a n environmental impact statement involves the most rigorous analysis,and is required if a proposed action will significantly affect the quality of the human environment.id.quoting c and.an environmental assessment is considerably less detailed,and may be prepared i f an agency is uncertain whether the proposed action will significantly affect the environment id.at citing.an environmental assessment provides sufficient evidence and analysis to determine whether a proposed project will create a significant effect on the environment.id.quoting.if so,the agency must then develop an environmental impact statement if not,the environmental assessment results in a finding of no significant impact,and no further agency action is required.id.quoting.
occasionally,a proposed action will fall within a categorical exclusion,those actions predetermined not to individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment.id.quoting.in such circumstances,the agency is not required to prepare either an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement.id.
b.the national forests and the associated projects at issue 
at issue in this case are six separate projects encompassed within four different national forests in utah.the projects,categorized by the national forest of which they are a part,are discussed in detail below.
the national forest 
the national forest wcnf encompasses two of the six projects at issue the bear hodges ii timber sale and the east fork fire salvage projects.the forest plan for the wcnf,which was revised in,states,in pertinent part,that management indicator species mis are required under cfr,app.at,and are used to assess the effects of a management activity on wildlife.id.at.for purposes of managing the wcnf,the forest plan designates beaver,snowshoe hare,and cutthroat trout as mis id.at.the forest plan indicates that these mis are to be monitored in the following manner 
beaver beaver populations across the forest are to be monitored.id.at.these populations are to be measured by the n umber of active dams.id.the measurement and reporting frequency is order huc hydrologic units per year after baseline establishment.id.
snowshoe forest plan requires s nowshoe hare presence and population index to be determined.id.this is to be performed by way of p ellet counts along transects.id.the measurement and reporting frequency is first yrs e stablish baseline.annual update.evaluated at intervals.id.
cutthroat forest plan requires the forest service to obtain c utthroat trout population estimates.id.at.these estimates are to be made by way of the fish condition index.id.the measurement and reporting frequency is one order huc per year.id.
a the bear hodges ii timber sale.this project involves a harvest of approximately million board feet of timber from twelve separate units comprising approximately acres in and adjacent to the daniels experimental forest,located in the bear hodges area of the logan ranger district,all of which are part of the wcnf.id.at.the project,which involves both permanent and temporary road construction in the project area,is intended to provide research and demonstration opportunities on the utah state university daniel experimental forest through testing and demonstrating different silvicultural methods,maintain the mature character of the forest in the near future while beginning to develop more age class diversity,and provide a merchantable product for the timber industry id.at.
the forest service first prepared an ea for this project,followed by an eis.id.at.the project record of decision rod issued on may,and concluded,in pertinent part,that the project was consistent with the forest plan.id.at.the eis concluded that,with respect to the three relevant mis there are no wetland or riparian areas,and thus no beaver habitat,within the project area,id.at,snowshoe hare habitat exists within the project area,but the project would not significantly impact snowshoe hare populations or their habitat because project treatments were designed to maintain habit used by the species,id.at,and bonneville cutthroat trout are not present in the project area,id.at.
b the east fork fire salvage project.the forest service planned this project in response to a fire that burned approximately acres of the evanston ranger district in the wcnf in late june and most of july.id.at.the project includes the harvest of fire killed trees,in twenty units totaling acres.id.at.the project also includes the maintenance and improvement of drainage on about miles of existing roads in the project area.id.the purpose of the project is to provide timber for commercial harvest and to capture economic value of timber killed by the f ire consistent with goals for watershed health,sustainable ecosystems,biodiversity and viability and opportunities.id.
an eis was prepared for this project,and the project rod issued on june.the eis concluded,with respect to the mis beaver activity within the project area was stable or increasing,and the project would have no effect on beaver habitat because no salvage activity is proposed within riparian areas,id.at,there was no snowshoe hare population within the project area because the fire that precipitated the project destroyed the hares habitat,and the salvage sale would not have any adverse effect on the reestablishment of that habitat,id.at,and population trends for bonneville cutthroat trout within the project area were flat,and the project included mitigation measures designed to reduce the potential for sediment from buffer strips on two salvage units from negatively impacting streams,id.at.
the sal national forest 
the sal national forest mlnf covers two projects at issue in this appeal the sitla and the south manti timber salvage projects.the forest plan for the mlnf was approved on november.id.at.although the forest plan does not expressly cite to the planning rules,it lists various mis,including macroinvertebrates id.at.macroinvertebrates,which are found in the forest in stream fisheries,lakes,reservoirs,tunnels and canals,are ecological indicator species in aquatic habitats and the ability of that habitat to support fisheries.id.at.they are monitored and reported every five years using biotic condition index bci and the habitat condition index hci.id.at.bci is a tool for assessing overall health.id.at.the forest plan standard for bci is or greater.id.at.however,the forest plan provides no direction about where to sample or the desired density of sampling sites across the forest,and t he majority of stream systems on the forest have not been sampled or monitored.id.at.and,with respect to those streams that have been sampled,it appears that the resulting data is so sparse that it is or at least was not really possible to calculate a statistically valid trend with three to four data points.id.at.
in an undated forest monitoring report contained in the administrative record,it is noted that freshwater macroinvertebrate communities go through cyclical highs and lows relating to natural conditions,and,d ue to the natural year to year variability of these conditions,several years of data are required to establish adequately the range of variation in community structure and productivity and to distinguish between natural variability and that due possibly to land uses or activities.aa,vol.at internal quotation marks omitted.the report further notes that t he forest plan provides no direction about where to sample or the desired density of sampling sites across the forest,and that t he majority of the stream systems on the forest have not been sampled or monitored.id.at.
a the sitla project.the state of utah school and institutional trust lands administration sitla owns certain located on east mountain in the sal nf,approximately miles northwest of huntington.at.sitla applied to the forest service in order to obtain permanent road access to the se in order to facilitate the harvest of up to five million board feet of timber on two sections of its land,and the construction of one exploratory natural gas well on a separate section of its land.id.the project incidentally would provide access to an additional proposed exploratory natural gas well on national forest lands by prima oil and gas company.id.the project involves road construction and reconstruction on national forest lands in and outside the boundaries of the east mountain inventoried roadless area ira and aggregate pit development within the ira boundaries.id.
an eis was prepared for the project.id.at.the rod issued on july,id.at,and concluded,in pertinent part,that the project would not affect drainages with aquatic macroinvertebrate habitat,and therefore there would be no affect sic to aquatic macroinvertebrates or their habitat.id.at.
uec filed an administrative appeal challenging the rod.the forest service denied that administrative appeal on september,aa,vol.at,concluding in pertinent part that they ha d complied with the monitoring provisions of the nfma.id.at.
b the south manti timber salvage project.the south manti timber salvage project was initiated in response to epidemic spruce beetle activity across the south manti landscape.app.at.the project area includes approximately acres of national forest lands within the southern portion of the wasatch plateau on the and sanpete ranger districts of the mlnf.id.because a n abundance of dead trees can predispose an area to the occurrence of a large,intense wildland fire,id.at,the purpose of the project is to reduce the potential for such wildfires by salvage harvesting approximately to million board feet of dead and dying timber id.at.the project also includes reforestation across a total range of to acres id.
an eis was prepared for the project and completed in may.id.at.it noted,in pertinent part,that macroinvertebrate m onitoring stations we re located at the forest boundary on ferron,muddy,and twelvemile creeks,all of which were in the project area.aa,vol.at.although the eis noted that w ater quality in twelvemile creek appear ed to have improved steadily since landslide and flooding events in and,it stated that d ata results for ferron creek and muddy creek we re so variable that there wa s no apparent trend.id.the eis further noted that the p rimary effects of concern when assessing timber treatment projects are increases in sediment to streams,which degrades habitat diversity of aquatic.id.at.the eis concluded that,with respect to three of the four alternatives being considered,h arvest activity in the watersheds would increase sediment yield,and affect aquatic habitat,thereby resulting in d eclines in macroinvertebrate species id.at.
the rod was issued by the forest supervisor on june.app.at.the rod notes,in pertinent part,that t emporary increases in sedimentation will be expected from temporary road construction,reconstruction,maintenance,and decommissioning.id.at.over the,however,road reconstruction,maintenance,and decommissioning associated with the project will result in reductions in sediment.id.further,the rod notes that n o harvesting or mechanical entry will be permitted within feet of each side of perennial streams,seeps,lakes,reservoirs,or wetlands.id.although the rod briefly discusses the effect of the project on some of the mis listed in the forest plan,it does not mention macroinvertebrates.instead,in a separate section,the rod simply states that t he diversity index dat will be maintained at or above,the standing crop at or above and the biotic condition index at or above,and that if these indicators fall below set levels then evaluation of cause of sediment source would be done and corrective measures taken as soon as possible.id.at.
uec appealed from the rod,claiming in part that the forest service failed to meet the mandate of the nfma by failing to adequately maintain monitoring data id.at.in responding to this appeal,the forest service noted that t he nfma regulations cfr provide d the specific monitoring requirements.id.the forest service further noted that the forest plan d id not indicate any specific project level monitoring requirements,and that,a s with goals and objectives,no single project can provide monitoring information that meets all of the requirements for the forest plan.id.thus,the forest service emphasized,t he direction to monitor applies to the national forest,not individual projects.id.
uec also appealed the rod claiming that the forest service failed to meet its mandate under nfma to collect required quantitative population trend data and determine relationships between management activities or habitat changes and population trend changes for macroinvertebrates id.at.in response,the forest service noted 
the forest plan monitoring report states that stream conditions across the forest generally appear to be improving based on macroinvertebrate sampling data and the biotic condition index 
macroinvertebrate inventories from are in the project record and were used to make the determination that for all streams and reservoir habitats,macroinvertebrate indices would not be expected to fall below forest management plan standards final environmental impact statement feis,aquatic macroinvertebrate monitoring report.
c the uinta national forest 
the uinta national forest unf covers the white river salvage sale project.the forest plan for the unf,which was revised in,lists the colorado river cutthroat trout crct as one of several mis.id.at.the forest plan indicates that,for the crct,population estimates must be conducted annually on at least of the streams in the unf but reported only every five years.id.the forest plan further provides that,for the crct,habitat conditions must be monitored and reported every five years.id.as of the time the forest plan was amended in,s elected streams ha d been inventoried for crct monitored in conjunction with the utah department of wildlife resources,and a f monitoring protocol was being developed.id.
the white river salvage sale project,located within the left fork of the white river drainage in the spanish fork ranger district,encompass es the sale of approximately acres worth of mixed conifer stands.id.at.the purpose of the project is to reduce the amount of tree mortality and deformity caused by the beetle and dwarf mistletoe,and to restore a more natural variability of age classes and vegetative composition in the forested stands within the treatment area.id.at.temporary roads and skid trails would be utilized to access stands,and would be rehabilitated following completion of harvest activities.id.at.in addition,portions of two national forest system roads in the project area will be maintained to bring the m closer to objective maintenance levels to address erosion and concerns.id.at.
on december,a report regarding cutthroat trout population trends in the unf was published.id.at.that report stated that p opulation trend data using indices of overall condition for crct indicate d a slight increase in the overall condition of crct during the period between and,but no observable change during the time period between and id.this data was subsequently incorporated into a february,report entitled cutthroat trout population national forest fy.id.at.this report indicated that during fiscal year,unf staff conducted population inventory monitoring surveys on eight streams containing crct,which equate d to percent of the crct populations on the forest.id.at.
an ea was prepared for the project and published in march.id.at.it noted,in pertinent part,that p opulation trend data in the project area indicate d that the overall condition of crct was lower in than in,even though trend data show ed no observable change in the overall condition of crct populations.id.at.the ea further noted that t he existing high sediment loads,stream channel instability,and impacted riparian areas may currently be restricting the rate of recovery of crct populations in the project area.id.although the ea noted that existing roads we re major contributors of sediment in the project area,it stated it wa s not anticipated that the timber harvesting associated with the project w ould increase risks to the crct within the project area beyond those currently present under existing environmental conditions.id.at.the ea also stated that the project was not likely to either result in a trend toward federal listing of the species or affect their viability.id.
on march,a decision notice and finding of no significant impact fonsi was issued by the forest service for the project.id.at.the fonsi stated,in pertinent part,that a fter considering the environmental effects described in the ea,the forest service ha d determined that the project w ould not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment considering the context and intensity of impacts,and that,in turn,an eis w ould not be prepared for the project.id.at.
uec filed an administrative appeal from the decision notice,asserting in part that the forest service ha d failed to be consistent with the nfma and the forest plan because they ha d not gathered quantitative mis trend or determined its relationship to habitat changes.app.at.the forest service,in response,began by noting that s urveys for crct occurred in the white river system in,and,and that physical habitat data was also collected.id.the forest service further noted that t he monitoring direction in the forest plan for aquatic species wa s not project level specific,but wa s used in an adaptive management approach to validate assumptions made during the forest planning process and as an information source for adaptive management.id.the forest service also noted that the revised forest plan was signed april and monitoring to satisfy plan requirements wa s expected to begin in,and thus i t wa s premature to determine consistency with forest plan monitoring requirements since they we re in their first year and ha d not yet been initiated.id.thus,the forest service concluded,t he district ranger who made the rod had the benefit of existing data from surveys in,and to make a reasonable analysis and decision.id.
d the dixie national forest 
the dixie national forest dnf covers the dark valley vegetation management project.the forest plan for the dnf lists as mis bonneville cutthroat trout bct and other types of trout.id.at.monitoring of these mis is to be conducted and reported annually.the forest plan also provides,however,that i f fish population data is not available for a particular water body,the macroinvertebrate biotic condition index bci will be used to assess fish habitat capability.id.
the dark valley vegetation management project encompasses the commercial harvest of douglas fir,spruce and ponderosa pine trees on approximately acres located in the ranger district of the dnf.id.at.the purpose of the project is to reduce vegetation densities in order to protect the area from insect infestations and potential stand replacing wildfires.id.the project area has a of fuels and some insect and disease outbreaks that include mistletoe,spruce beetle,beetle,and root rot.id.the proposed treatments are needed to reduce stand densities,reduce fuel loads,and protect forest health.id.to access areas needing vegetation management,about mile or less of temporary road construction will be required.id.at.
a decision memo approving the project issued on october.id.at.in analyzing the project,the forest service concluded that potential habitat and existing populations of bct or other trout varieties did not exist in the project area.id.at.according to the parties,the project was categorically excluded under nepa.aplt.br.at.
case procedural history 
uec initiated this action on october.on february,uec filed an amended complaint alleging that the forest service approval of the six projects at issue was contrary to nfma,its implementing regulations,and the apa.on july,the district court issued a memorandum decision rejecting all of uec claims and entering judgment in favor of defendants.uec has since filed a timely notice of appeal.
standards of review 
because neither nepa nor nfma provide a private right of action,this court reviews the forest service approval of the projects at issue as final agency action s under the apa.uec iii,at.under that standard,we will not overturn the agency decision unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.id.quoting a.an agency decision will be deemed arbitrary and capricious if the agency entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.id.quoting motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.likewise,an agency decision will be deemed arbitrary and capricious if the agency failed to base its decision on consideration of the relevant factors,or if there has been a clear error of judgment on the agency part.id.
does the rule apply to the forest service approval of the six projects 
in its first issue on appeal,uec argues that the district court committed reversible error by applying the planning rules,and their best available science standard,to each of the six projects at issue,rather than the planning rules and their focus on mis.we review the district court decision on this issue de novo.uec iii,at.in doing so,however,we must grant substantial deference to the agency interpretation of its own regulations.id.we may reject the agency interpretation only when it is unreasonable,plainly erroneous,or inconsistent with the regulation plain meaning.id.quoting bar mk ranches yuetter,cir.
defendants argue that,under the rule transition provisions,the rule did not apply to decisions,such as the six projects at issue.aplee.br.at.instead,defendants argue,the forest service was required to consider best available science during the transition period that began in november,and t he remainder of the rule did not apply until the expiration of the transition period.id.at.according to defendants,t he transition period ended in january,with the repeal of the rule and the promulgation of the rule.id.defendants also assert that uec argument that the rule is controlling is contrary to the forest service september,interpretative rule explaining the rule.id.that interpretative rule,defendants assert,unequivocally stated that,during the transition period,the rule did not apply to decisions.id.
we accept in part and reject in part defendants arguments.three of the six projects at issue were intended to implement forest plans that the planning rules the sitla and south manti timber salvage projects,both of which implemented the sal national forest plan,and the dark valley vegetation management project,which implemented the dixie national forest plan.neither of those two forest plans explicitly reference d or adopt ed of the planning rules,concerning the selection and monitoring of management indicator species.uec iii,at.thus,u nder the transition provision of the regulations,the forest service was required to consider the best available science when implementing the three projects within those two forest plan s.the ecology,united states forest,cir citing a.
the remaining three projects,the bear hodges ii project,the east fork fire salvage project,and the white river salvage sale project,present a different situation.these three projects were intended to implement two forest plans that were revised in in accordance with the planning rules,the national forest plan and the uinta national forest plan.by its plain language,a was inapplicable to those projects.that is,a mandated application of the best available science standard to the implementation of current plan s,which we construe,in the context of the transition provision as a whole,as encompassing only plans that the planning rules thus,we look to see what standards were incorporated in the two revised forest plans.as expressly authorized by b,both of the revised forest plans incorporated the old mis standards,rather than the best available science standard.indeed,the national forest plan expressly referenced the planning rules.accordingly,it was the mis standards,rather than the best available science standard,that was applicable to these three projects.to the extent that defendants contend to the contrary,we conclude their position is inconsistent with the plain language of and our existing precedent see uec iii,at indicating that if a forest plan explicitly references or adopts of the planning rules,a project implementing that plan has to comply with the mis monitoring requirements set forth in the planning rules,notwithstanding the fact that the project at issue was approved after the september,final rule.
did the district court err in considering data 
in its second issue on appeal,uec argues that the district court erred in considering,rather than striking,documents in the administrative record that contained information about particular mis in the national forest that the dates when the projects on this forest were approved.aplt.br.at.according to uec,this includes t he bulk of the snowshoe hare data,as well as p data for bonneville cutthroat trout id.uec argues that these documents should have been stricken for purposes of review because they were not before the at the time of approval of these projects id.at.
we agree with uec.as discussed in greater detail below,the planning rules required the forest service,prior to approving a particular forest project,to gather quantitative population data on the various mis listed in the particular forest plan at issue,determine population trends for those mis,and determine the likely effect of the proposed project on those mis.obviously,data regarding the population numbers trends of a particular mis is irrelevant to whether the forest service properly fulfilled these obligations prior to approving a particular project.thus,the district court should not have taken any data into account in determining whether defendants violated federal law in approving the projects at issue.
sufficiency of the forest service mis monitoring 
in its third issue on appeal,uec argues that the forest service lacked adequate mis population trend data at the time it approved each of the projects at issue.at the outset,we summarily reject uec argument with respect to the sitla,south manti,and dark valley projects.as we have already concluded,those three projects were,pursuant to a,subject to the best available science standard.thus,uec specific challenges to those projects are inapposite.
turning to uec challenges to the remaining three projects,we begin by first reviewing the requirements imposed on the forest service under the planning rules.section of the planning rules provided,in pertinent part,as follows 
fish and wildlife habitat shall be managed to maintain viable populations of existing native and desired vertebrate species in the planning area.for planning purposes,a viable population shall be regarded as one which has the estimated numbers and distribution of reproductive individuals to insure its continued existence is well distributed in the planning area.in order to insure that viable populations will be maintained,habitat must be provided to support,at least,a minimum number of reproductive individuals and that habitat must be well distributed so that those individuals can interact with others in the planning area.
in order to estimate the effects of each alternative on fish and wildlife populations,certain vertebrate invertebrate species present in the area shall be identified and selected as management indicator species these species shall be selected because their population changes are believed to indicate the effects of management activities.
planning alternatives shall be stated and evaluated in terms of both amount and quality of habitat and of animal population trends of the management indicator species.
population trends of the management indicator species will be monitored and relationships to habitat changes determined.this monitoring will be done in cooperation with state fish and wildlife agencies,to the extent practicable.
in utah environmental congress bosworth,cir uec i,we held that the provisions of,although primarily applicable to the development of forest plans,also apply to the forest service authorization of individual projects implementing a forest plan.further,we held in uec i that requires the forest service to use actual,quantitative population data to effectuate its mis monitoring obligations.id.at.more specifically,we concluded 
that in order to effectuate its mis monitoring duties under the language of the planning rules,the forest service must gather quantitative data on actual mis populations that allows it to estimate the effects of any forest management activities on the animal population trends,and determine the relationship between management activities and population trend changes.
national forest 
uec contends that,with respect to the two projects within the national forest bear hodges ii and east fork fire salvage,defendants failed to gather adequate data regarding three mis species snowshoe hare,beaver,and bonneville cutthroat trout.uec specific arguments regarding each of these species will be addressed below.
a snowshoe hare 
uec complains that there was insufficient data collected regarding snowshoe hare because a the forest service itself acknowledged that survey data it collected in and was not sufficient to determine population trends,b data cited in the forest plan monitoring report is primarily from an area distant to the bear hodges ii project area,and c although the monitoring report references data taken from one transect by a utah department of wildlife resources employee,the report itself acknowledges that data from only one transect is insufficient to draw conclusions on population trends habitat relationships.aplt.br.at.
defendants first respond by arguing that uec has overlooked their specific findings respecting the lack of impact of the two projects on snowshoe hare populations and habitat.aplee.br.at.as for uec specific complaints,defendants argue that,because the data wa s to be evaluated at intervals under the revised forest plan,and given that the revised forest plan issued in,the first evaluation of snowshoe hare population data was not yet due when the bear hodges ii eis issued in.id.further,defendants argue that even though they did not yet have the benefit of the first population trend analysis contemplated by the forest plan when the bear hodges ii and east fork rods issued in,the available data indicated that snowshoe hare populations ha d been stable across the forest over a substantial swath of time.id.at.defendants also point to data that they say supports the conclusions they reached at the time of the rods.id.at.
we find defendants arguments,other than their reliance on data,persuasive.turning first to the bear hodges ii project,we conclude the forest service effectively complied with the forest plan requirement to determine s nowshoe hare presence because,in the rod,it noted that snowshoe habitat existed in the project area,and in turn assumed that a snowshoe population also existed.it is true that the forest service did not have an estimate of the precise snowshoe hare population in the project area or,for that matter,in the forest as a whole,at least in part because the forest plan was revised only a year prior to the project approval,and the annual survey results for snowshoe hare had not yet been received however,uec has failed to establish how the presence of such data could have altered the forest service decision regarding the impact of the bear hodges ii project.as previously noted,the forest service concluded that the project would not significantly impact any snowshoe hare populations or habitat in the project area because the project treatments were designed to maintain habitat used by the species.the fact that the forest service was unaware of the precise numbers of snowshoe hare in the project area does not,in our view,undermine this,for that matter,does uec expressly suggest that it does.
with respect to the east fork project,uec arguments overlook the fact that the fire that precipitated the project effectively destroyed all available snowshoe hare habitat and,in turn,left no snowshoe hare population in the project area.in light of these facts,defendants reasonably concluded that the project would not have a negative impact on snowshoe hare population or habitat in the project area.moreover,any failure on the part of defendants to adequately monitor snowshoe hare populations in other portions of the forest is irrelevant in light of these findings and conclusions.
uec argues that there was insufficient data regarding beaver because a the monitoring report indicates that beaver populations were estimated per square mile based on potential habitat,and such extrapolation is not permitted under the plan or the planning rules,b in approving the bear hodges ii project the forest service improperly relied on the analysis of aerial photos uec argues that photo interpretation of habitat or population trends is subjective and inexact,and c data from one mountain range within a forest can not be used to determine the effects of management activities in a separate mountain range within the same forest as uec alleges occurred with respect to approval of the east fork fire salvage project.
we conclude that uec claims lack merit.to begin with,the forest plan indicates that beaver populations are to be measured by the number of active dams,and is silent with respect to the precise method of measurement.in a subsequent final environmental impact statement,the forest service concluded that monitoring of beaver populations could be done from the ground or the air app.at.although uec objects to the forest service measuring beaver populations from the air,it has not persuasively established why this method is deficient,and we conclude we must defer to the defendants on this technical issue.uec i,at noting that choices of suitable scientific methodology are entrusted to the agency.thus,we conclude that defendants use of aerial photos was proper under the plan.further,because defendants specifically monitored by air the beaver populations in the two project areas concluding with respect to the bear hodges ii project that there was no beaver habitat and thus no beaver population,and concluding with respect to the east fork fire salvage project that the beaver population in the project area was either stable or increasing,and in turn concluded based on that monitoring that the two projects would not negatively impact beaver populations or habitat conclusions which uec does not specifically challenge,it is irrelevant whether or not defendants adequately monitored beaver populations in other,areas of the forest.see uec i,at we conclude that data is not required if the forest service can determine the viability of the mis at issue without a survey.
c bonneville cutthroat trout 
lastly,uec complains that,with respect to bonneville cutthroat trout,a there was insufficient quantitative population trend data to predict trends for this species uec notes that most of the streams in the wcnf have only been sampled once or twice in the past twenty years,and b the most recent data regarding the bear hodges ii project area is from,even though the forest plan requires such data to be collected annually.
we find uec arguments unpersuasive.in uec i,we held that the forest service must make good faith efforts to determine the absence or presence of an mis species in order to fulfill its mis monitoring obligations under.at.if the forest service has made this good faith effort to determine whether or not an mis is present,however,it is not otherwise required to attempt to track species where no population thereof exists id.internal quotation marks omitted.that is precisely the situation presented here.defendants assert,and uec does not dispute,that no bct reside in the bear hodges ii project area,and that the project area in fact contains no habitat suitable for bct.accordingly,we conclude it was unnecessary,and indeed impossible,for defendants to have produced quantitative population data for the bct in the project area.see utah envt l cong.bosworth,cir uec ii reaching similar conclusion where the forest service concluded there was no sagebrush habitat within project area uec iii,at concluding forest service did not have to collect data on bct because no streams and lakes exist ed within the cumulative effects area.in turn,uec has not offered any persuasive reasons why defendants were wrong in concluding that the bear hodges ii project would have no effect on the bct.
uinta national forest 
uec contends that,with respect to the uinta national forest and the white river salvage sale project within it,defendants failed to collect adequate population trend data for the colorado river cutthroat trout in the left fork of the white river the project area is in the left fork white river watershed.although uec acknowledges that the forest service and the utah department of wildlife resources collected annual data on crct between and,uec argues that the two agencies used various survey protocols in different locations,thus making it impossible to precisely determine population trends as required by the forest plan.id.at.further,although uec admits that defendants collected population data for crct in,this did not include any data for the left fork of the white river.because it is undisputed there is no migration between crct populations within the forest from stream to stream,uec argues that the data can not serve to satisfy the requirements of the forest plan.nor,uec asserts,can the habitat trend data cited by the district court satisfy the requirements of the forest plan and the nfma.
defendants argue,in response,that the data cited by uec does,in fact,have scientific utility.aplee.br.at.in particular,defendants assert that the available data indicate s that during the time period between and the overall condition of cutthroat trout within these sites show ed no observable change.id.at.as for their alleged failure to obtain data for the left fork of the white river in,defendants argue that they did,in fact,attempt to obtain such data but the stream channel was dry when monitored that particular year.id.at.defendants also dispute uec assertion that the forest plan requires each of the four conservation populations of crct to be separately monitored.in fact,defendants argue,the plan does not identify these four conservation populations as separate mis populations.id.at.lastly,defendants deny that they used habitat data from the left fork of the white river as a proxy to satisfy the requirements of the forest plan and the nfma.instead,defendants assert,this habitat data was used to satisfy the plan requirement for measuring habitat conditions every five years,as well as considering of sample streams annually to determine crct population estimates.id.at.
we find defendants arguments persuasive.although in uec i we interpreted as requiring quantitative population data,we otherwise imposed no specific requirements on the type of data that must be collected.in this regard,defendants conclusion that the available population data was scientifically useful is neither arbitrary nor capricious.see uec iii,at noting that d eference to the agency is especially strong where the challenged decisions involve technical or scientific matters within the agency area of expertise.as for uec assertion that defendants failed to gather quantitative data for the left fork of the white river in,defendants have persuasively demonstrated that they made a good faith attempt to collect such data but that it was impossible to do so because the stream channel was dry that particular year.given the defendants good faith effort,we therefore conclude,consistent with our decision in uec i,that no more was required of the forest service.
defendants failure to apply the best available science standard 
although we have concluded that the forest service was bound to apply the best available science standard in approving the sitla,south manti,and dark valley projects,it is obvious from the record on appeal that the forest service failed to do so.in particular,it is beyond dispute that the forest service relied solely on analysis in approving these three projects.further,we are not persuaded,as the district court apparently was,that the forest service failure was harmless,that the forest service reliance on other available data effectively satisfied the best available science requirements.see the ecology,at concluding,under similar circumstances,that forest service failure to apply best available science standard was not harmless.we therefore conclude,consistent with our decision in the ecology center,that it is necessary to vacate the forest service approval of these three projects and remand so that the forest service can have the first chance to apply the proper standards.id.at see sec chenery.noting that the propriety of an agency determination must be judged solely by the grounds invoked by the agency forest watch forest,cir vacating forest service approval of project under similar circumstances.
in reaching this conclusion,we have given careful consideration to the procedural history of this case.in the district court,uec challenged the sitla,south manti,and dark valley projects on the grounds that the forest service failed to collect the requisite mis data.the forest service,in response,made no mention of the planning rules or the best available science standard.instead,the forest service argued that it had gathered sufficient quantitative data to satisfy the planning rules.
the district court,in its memorandum opinion and decision rejecting uec claims on the merits,was the first to mention the planning rules and their best available science standard.in particular,the district court concluded that the planning rules required the forest service to consider the best available science standard in implementing the projects at issue.in turn,the district court,in upholding these three project decisions,concluded that the forest service had effectively complied with the best available science standard by considering only data.that is,the district court affirmed the three project approvals based on its own application of the best available science standard.
uec,in challenging the district court ruling on appeal,correctly points out that the forest service itself never applied the planning rules in approving the projects at issue.for example,in its opening brief,uec notes that the district court incorrectly held that the nfma regulations were applied in the approval for each project,aplt.br.at,and that e vidence that the forests elected to apply the regulations and never elected to apply the nfma regulations can be found throughout the administrative record.id.at.similarly,in its appellate reply brief,uec notes that the administrative record is silent in regards to the new best available science standard because it was not applied or adhered to in the planning or approval of these projects.aplt.reply br.at.in turn,uec argues had the forest service responses to uec administrative appeal points been premised on the best available science standard uec would have had the option to challenge these projects under this rule.but this was not the case.id.although the forest service on appeal asks us to adopt the same approach as the district court and conclude that the analysis actually engaged in by the forest service effectively satisfies the best available science standard,uec takes this position to task,correctly noting that a reviewing court may not supply the basis for the agency decision that the agency itself has not given.id.at see chenery,at.holding that a reviewing court is powerless to affirm the administrative action by substituting what it considers to be a more adequate or proper basis the ecology center,at concluding that a reviewing court can not properly affirm an administrative decision when the issuing agency clearly failed to apply the proper standard forest watch,at same.
the procedural posture of this case thus distinguishes it from uec iii.unlike uec iii,uec in this case clearly argued,and after reviewing the administrative record we agree,that the forest service acted arbitrarily and capriciously by failing to apply the applicable regulations.thus,consistent with the supreme court decision in chenery,we may not affirm the project approvals on a basis not set forth in the record with such clarity as to be understandable.at.accordingly,the only solution is to vacate the project approvals and remand so that the forest service,in the first instance,may apply the proper standard.
we affirm the district court order affirming authorization of the bear hodges ii timber sale,east fork fire salvage,and white river salvage sale projects,reverse the district court order affirming authorization of the sitla,south manti and dark valley projects,and remand to the district court with directions to vacate the forest service approval of the sitla,south manti and dark valley projects.
the majority reverses the district court and overturns an agency decision on the basis of an argument never made by the plaintiff in this case.i therefore respectfully dissent from the portions of the decision reversing and remanding the sitla,south manti,and dark valley projects.
this case involves six unrelated forest projects in four national forests in the state of utah.all were challenged by utah environmental congress uec on the ground that the forest service had failed to collect adequate data regarding management indicator species mis,as required by the planning regulations and the forest plans.the forest service defended on two primary grounds that the planning regulations have been superseded by a new requirement that forest managers employ the best available science for the purpose of forest management decisions,and,in the alternative,that the projects satisfied the requirements of the planning regulations.the district court upheld all six projects on the first theory,holding that the best available science than the planning.at no point has plaintiff uec argued that the projects violated the best available science standard.both in district court and on appeal,uec sole argument has been that the forest managers were required to comply with the planning regulations,and did not.
in a careful analysis of the regulatory landscape,the majority concludes that the best available science standard applies to the sitla,south manti,and dark valley projects,but that the forest plans applicable to the bear hodges ii,east fork,and white river projects incorporate specific mis data collection requirements.i agree with this analysis.the majority also concludes that bear hodges ii,east fork,and white river project data collection satisfies those requirements.i also agree with those conclusions having rejected uec argument that the mis data requirements of the planning regulations apply to the sitla,south manti,and dark valley projects,and given that uec has not argued that these projects failed to comply with the best available science standard,that should be the end of the matter.
remarkably,however,the majority reverses the district court and overturns these projects on the basis of an argument never made by the plaintiff although we have concluded that the forest service was bound to apply the best available science standard in approving the sitla,south manti,and dark valley projects,it is obvious from the record on appeal that the forest service failed to do so.op.at.the majority then proceeds to apply harmless error plain error analysis,and not waiver the issue,and concludes without further discussion that the error was not harmless.
this violates principles of appellate review.harmless error analysis is reserved for cases in which the appellant properly objects to an error at trial,the appellate court finds there was error,and the appellee contends that the decision should nonetheless be affirmed.see,polys airlines,cir united states rivera,cir.here,uec never objected to the error,if it was error.thus,at most,we should be applying plain error review.id.moreover,in its opening brief to this court,uec did not challenge the district court conclusion that the disputed projects satisfied the best available science standard.uec argued only that the district court erred in concluding that the best available science standard was applicable.uec statement of issues reads as follows 
did the district court properly apply the correct regulations under the national forest management act 
did the district court properly allow the inclusion of population information for various management indicator species mis into the record and can this information be used to support the forest service decision 
did the forests have adequate quantitative population trend data for management indicator species mis pursuant to the forest plans and regulations,under the national forest management act nfma,that were used by the various forest service decisionmakers when they made their original decisions approving these projects 
appellant br.at.conspicuously absent from the statement of issues is any argument in the alternative that even if the district court was correct to apply the best available science standard,it nonetheless erred in its application of that standard to this record.nor can any such argument be teased out of uec opening brief.
it follows that the issue was waived.dubbs head start,cir perry woodward,cir.to be sure,when manifest injustice would otherwise result,this court can reach issues that were not specifically raised on appeal.sussman
