defendant polymer applications,and its sole shareholder and president,defendant kevan green,appeal from the district court refusal to vacate a default judgment against them.defendants argue that the district court should have set aside the default judgment as void under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.alternatively,defendants assert that the district court should have vacated the default judgment under rule b because they did not willfully disregard their obligation to answer the complaint,they raised meritorious defenses,and plaintiffs would suffer no prejudice if the judgment were vacated.defendants also seek a hearing on damages.
for the reasons that follow,we hold that the district court did not err in refusing to set aside the default judgment,and accordingly,we affirm.
background 
this appeal is the latest chapter in a struggle between state and federal environmental officials and kevan green and his company,polymer applications,polymer,over environmental and remediation at polymer phenolic resin manufacturing plant in the town of tonawanda,erie county,new york the site.the history of events leading to this lawsuit is described in detail in the district court decision,and there is no need to repeat it at length here.see new york green,wl,at,june,dist.lexis,at.it suffices to say that the site has a lengthy history of releases of hazardous substances dating from the.in july,a fire destroyed a significant portion of polymer facility,resulting in the release of an estimated gallons of phenol solution and solvents,and forcing polymer to cease operations at the site.during the next ten years,state and federal environmental authorities studied the site to assess the extent of contamination.in,after finding significant soil,surface water and ground water contamination,the state of new york developed a plan to remediate the site.then,in,after having spent two unsuccessful years trying to get polymer to implement the remediation plan on its own,the state decided to proceed with remediation using state funds.however,defendants refused to allow the state access to the site,preventing remediation of the site and prompting this lawsuit.
on march,the state of new york and erin crotty,commissioner of the new york state department of environmental conservation collectively,the state filed this action against polymer and green in the united states district court for the western district of new york.suing under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla,et,and new york common law of public nuisance and restitution,the state sought access to the site for remediation and a determination that defendants were liable for the costs of remediation.defendants were personally served with the complaint on march.however,defendants never filed an answer to the complaint or formally appeared in the lawsuit,even though they were represented by an attorney,jeffrey blum,at least until july.
on may,the state moved under rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure for entry of default against defendants for their failure to appear or defend the lawsuit.the clerk of the court entered the default that same day,and on the following day,mailed notice of the entry of default to both polymer and green.thereafter,for nearly a year,neither party took any further action in the lawsuit until the district court issued an order to show cause on february,requiring a written statement as to why the case should not be dismissed for failure to prosecute under the district court local rules.the district court order prompted the state to file a motion for default judgment on april.
the motion for default judgment sought an order granting the state access to the site for remediation,requiring defendants to pay the state unreimbursed response costs to date of,and declaring defendants liability for all future response costs incurred by the state in cleaning up the site.the affidavit of counsel submitted with the state motion for default judgment recited that defendants had been served but had not responded to the complaint or submitted a motion for extension of time.the affidavit also described in detail the state communications with defendants and their lawyer,blum,following the filing of the complaint and up until july,when defendants ceased all communications with the state and its counsel.it is undisputed that the state did not provide defendants with written or oral notice that it had filed a motion for default judgment.
the district court heard the state motion for default judgment on may.neither defendant nor any attorney on their behalf attended the hearing.the district court inquired of counsel for the state whether she had heard at all from green or anyone on behalf of polymer,to which the state counsel responded as follows 
we do get correspondence regarding efforts to float different remediation plans,things of that nature,but there has neither been a formal or informal request on the part of kevan green or polymer applications to extend the time to answer in this case,and we are not aware of any answer in this case.

that same day,may,the district court granted the state motion and entered a default judgment against defendants.among other things,the default judgment ordered defendants to provide the state with access to the site,entered judgment against defendants in the amount of,and declared defendants liable for all response costs incurred in the future in remediating the site.on may,the clerk mailed notice of entry of the default judgment to both defendants.
nearly a full year passed before green,proceeding pro se as defendant ceo of polymer applications,moved the district court on may,to vacate the default judgment on grounds that defendants had not received notice of the motion for default judgment and they had meritorious defenses to the state complaint.the state opposed defendants motion,and defendants ultimately retained counsel who filed appearances on their behalf.the district court denied defendants motion in a lengthy opinion on june.this appeal followed.
discussion 
rule of the federal rules of civil procedure provides a process for obtaining a default judgment.the first step is to obtain a default.when a party against whom affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend,a plaintiff may bring that fact to the court attention,and rule a empowers the clerk of the court to enter a default against a party that has not appeared or defended.having obtained a default,a plaintiff must next seek a judgment by default under rule b.rule b allows the clerk to enter a default judgment if the plaintiff claim is for a sum certain and the defendant has failed to appear and is not an infant or incompetent person.see.b.in all other cases,rule b governs,and it requires a party seeking a judgment by default to apply to the court for entry of a default judgment.
a court may set aside any default that has entered for good cause shown,and if a judgment has entered on the default,the court is authorized to set the judgment aside in accordance with the provisions of rule b.c.under rule b,a district court may vacate a judgment for any of the following reasons 
mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect newly discovered evidence fraud,misrepresentation,or other misconduct of an adverse party the judgment is void the judgment has been satisfied,released,or discharged,or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated,or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application or any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.
b.a motion to vacate a default judgment is addressed to the sound discretion of the district court.state street bank trust inversiones errazuriz limitada,cir quoting sec mcnulty,cir.however,we have expressed a strong preference for resolving disputes on the merits.powerserve int l,lavi,cir citation omitted.as the district court rightly recognized in its opinion denying defendants motion to vacate,a default judgment is the most severe sanction which the court may apply.cody mello,cir citations omitted.a trial court desire to move its calendar should not overcome its duty to do justice.id.accordingly,in ruling on a motion to vacate a default judgment,all doubts must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from the judgment in order to ensure that to the extent possible,disputes are resolved on their merits.see powerserve,at.
in this case,defendants argue that the district court should have set aside the default judgment for two reasons first,the judgment was void under rule b because defendants never received notice of the state motion for default judgment second,and in any event,the judgment was voidable under rule b because defendants did not willfully fail to answer the complaint,they have meritorious defenses to the state action and the state would not be prejudiced by vacating the judgment.we review a district court denial of a motion to vacate a default judgment for abuse of discretion.see state street,at.however,we review de novo a district court legal interpretation of the federal rules of civil procedure and review for clear error any factual findings that underlie the court resolution of a rule b motion.see id.at jarvis ford motor,cir unicorn tales,banerjee,cir.
in arguing that the default judgment was void under rule b,defendants invoke language from rule b that requires a party seeking a default judgment to provide at least three days advance written notice to any party that has appeared in the action and against whom judgment is sought.see.b if the party against whom judgment by default is sought has appeared in the action,the party or,if appearing by representative,the party representative shall be served with written notice of the application for judgment at least days prior to the hearing on such application.there is no dispute in this case that the state failed to provide advance notice of its motion for default judgment to defendants.according to defendants,that failure renders the default judgment void under rule b.
by its terms,rule b requires advance written notice only if the party against whom a default judgment is sought has appeared in the action.b.ordinarily,an appearance in an action requires a formal submission to the court.see key bank of maine tablecloth textile,cir.and defendants acknowledge,as they must,that they never formally appeared in this action before the state obtained the default judgment.however,defendants argue that their telephone calls and correspondence with the state and its counsel following the filing of the complaint amounted to an informal appearance that was sufficient to trigger the notice requirement of rule b.
circuits are divided on whether anything less than a formal appearance is necessary to actuate the notice requirement of rule b.the prevailing view is that the notice requirement contained in rule b applies not only to parties who have formally appeared,but also to those parties who,although delaying in a formal sense by failing to file pleadings within the period,have otherwise indicated to the moving party a clear purpose to defend the suit.livermore aktiengesellschaft gebruder loepfe,per curiam see also rogers hartford life accident ins,cir key bank,at in re roxford foods,cir lutomski panther valley coin,cir per curiam.this approach appears to have been adopted first by the district of columbia circuit in livermore,which found it consistent with the policy underlying the modernization of federal procedure,namely,the abandonment or relaxation of restrictive rules which prevent the hearing of cases on their merits.at.
the seventh circuit,by contrast,has rejected this broad interpretation of rule b and strictly construes the term appearance to require a party to make some presentation or submission to the district court in the pending action.zuelzke tool eng g anderson die castings,cir emphasis in original.in the view of the seventh circuit,it is a disservice to the legal system to distort the meaning of a concrete term such as appearance in order to provide a mechanism to save a party from a default judgment.see also town country kids,protected venture inv.trust,requiring a submission to the court citing zuelzke,at.
we find it unnecessary in this case to resolve this issue.for every court that has embraced the concept of an informal appearance under rule b has required,at a minimum,that the defaulting party,in communicating with the moving party,express a clear intention to defend the suit.in re roxford,at see also rogers,at key bank,at lutomski,at livermore,at.in this case,however,defendants communications with the state fell far short of this threshold.therefore,even if an informal appearance would entitle a party to advance notice under rule b and we expressly do not decide that communications with the state in this case did not rise to the level of an appearance under rule b even under the most liberal construction of that term.accordingly,defendants were not entitled to advance notice of the state default judgment motion under rule b.
the district court described the communications between defendants,and their counsel,and the state as follows 
in june,green sent plaintiff counsel a document entitled polymer applications,proposed remediation actions which essentially consisted of an unsigned narrative of possible remediation actions,but contained no documentation of any funding sources to cover the cost of cleanup.plaintiff counsel responded to the document by sending blum a letter reiterating that the state would not discuss any plan for remediation with green absent documentation showing his ability to cover the cost of doing so.there were several other communications between blum and plaintiff counsel,wherein blum claimed that he did not understand what the state wanted.the state again reiterated that it was seeking evidence of green financial ability to pay for the cleanup.in a letter dated july,blum told the state that green would endeavor to provide additional documentation as it becomes available.blum never provided the requested documents.that was the last communication between blum and the state.
nine months later,on or about april,defendant green sent a letter to the state proposing to lease a warehouse on the contaminated site.the letter was forwarded to state counsel,who responded expressing concern for the safety of the tenant.
green,wl,at,dist.lexis,at 
as is apparent from the foregoing summary,at no point during the period from march when this lawsuit was filed to may when the district court heard the state motion for default judgment did defendants ever assert any defense to the state claims,point out any weaknesses in the substance of the state lawsuit,or in any other way express an intent to defend the suit.at best,defendants informed the state of their willingness to settle the action,rather than their intent to defend against it.although in certain circumstances courts have been willing to find that a party had informally appeared in an action based on settlement discussions,in each of those cases the defendant clearly indicated to the plaintiff that if settlement negotiations failed,the defendant would diligently defend the suit.see key bank,at letter made clear defendant understanding that if plaintiff determined that negotiations had failed,it would notify defendant so it could retain counsel and file the appropriate pleadings livermore,at letter indicated that if appellant knew the negotiations were not taken seriously by the appellee,appellant would join issue in court promptly.here,there was no such indication in any of the parties letters and phone calls.in fact,there is ample support in the record for the district court finding that defendants overtures to the state simply appear to have been part of defendants overall plan to delay the proceedings and remediation of the site,rather than any sincere attempt to settle the action.green,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
as noted in the state affidavit in support of the default judgment,defendants counsel did on one occasion raise the possibility with the state that defendants might seek an extension of time to respond to the complaint.however,there is no merit in defendants su
