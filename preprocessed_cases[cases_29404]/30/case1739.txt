in mackinnon truck ins.exchange cal th mackinnon,our supreme court determined that the standard pollution exclusion clause in a comprehensive general liability cgl policy was intended to exclude coverage for injuries resulting from events commonly regarded as environmental pollution.the court therefore rejected a broader,literal interpretation of the clause that would foreclose coverage for any and all injuries arising from harmful substances.id.at.so construed,the court further held that it was unlikely a reasonable policyholder would think that the activity in question namely,the normal but negligent spraying of pesticides around an apartment building in order to kill yellow jackets was an act of pollution.id.at.
today we are asked to decide whether mackinnon interpretation limiting the scope of the pollution exclusion in a standard cgl policy to environmental pollution also governs the interpretation of a comparable pollution exclusion in a first party property insurance policy.we conclude that it does.
we must further decide whether the disturbing of asbestos during the scraping of acoustical popcorn ceilings in a,unit residential building,in which asbestos fibers were released into the air,the common area hallways and stairwells,individual units,and out to the common areas and public spaces and a private street outside building,constitutes environmental pollution.we likewise conclude that it does,and hence the pollution exclusion in the first party property insurance policy of appellant the villa los alamos homeowners association association did apply to preclude coverage for remediation cleanup work.accordingly,we affirm the judgment in favor of respondent state farm general insurance company state farm.
background 
a.the association and its policy 
the association is a california nonprofit corporation whose purpose is to manage,operate,maintain and repair the association unit condominium complex.state farm insured the association under a policy for the period january,through january.this was a comprehensive policy that provided both coverage for first party property losses,as well as third party business liability claims,subject to the policy exclusions and limitations.
under section i of the policy,state farm agreed to insure for accidental direct physical loss to buildings and structures and business personal property owned by the association and caused by an insured loss,unless specifically limited or excluded by the policy.this is an open peril form of policy,analogous to an policy,in which the insurer provides coverage for all losses not specifically excluded by the policy.julian hartford underwriters ins.cal th,fn.the coverage language in this type of policy is thus deemed to be quite broad.zurich american ins.cal th.section i exclusions included the following pollution exclusion.we do not insure under any coverage for any loss caused by one or more of the items below the presence,release,discharge or dispersal of pollutants,meaning any solid,liquid,gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant,including vapor,soot,fumes,acids,alkalis,chemicals and waste 
scraping of acoustical ceiling 
in the association contracted with cal coast construction cal coast to scrape the acoustical popcorn ceilings and stairways in building,a,unit affair.the association leadership was aware that there was some asbestos in the ceiling,and a resident was privy to a report that alleged the acoustical material saam contained less than one percent asbestos.cal coast commenced its work in june and in the process disturbed asbestos contained in the acoustical ceilings,releasing asbestos fibers into the air,the common area hallways and stairwells,individual units in building,and the common areas and public spaces outside the building.the bay area air quality management district district responded to building,cited cal coast and removed the company from the project.it ordered the association to perform a comprehensive abatement of the building,including all common areas and separate interest areas,individual units,and residents personal property.
the association retained forensic analytical to investigate the nature and extent of the contamination and to make recommendations for remediation.the firm confirmed that comprehensive abatement was needed.its investigation revealed the presence of saam debris throughout building,including corridors,stairwells,in the residential units,hvac system,and in the front portion of the exterior grounds of the building.the saam debris outside building was present in the rock gardens,on sidewalks,in bushes and grass in front of the building,and in parking lots and a private street.laboratory testing confirmed the debris contain ed asbestos trace to chrysotile.
forensic analytical recommended evacuation of all tenants in building the cleaning and testing of all contents removal and proper disposal of all carpets removal of remaining saam in the hallways and stairwells the cleaning of all vertical and horizontal surfaces as well as the hvac systems and the cleaning of the front areas of the building rock garden,sidewalks,parking lot,and street.
the association hired a contractor to perform the protocol outlined by forensic analytical,and pursuant to district requirements.
litigation 
meanwhile,the association demanded that cal coast retain an environmental hygienist and abatement company to clean and abate building,but the company refused.without success the association also tendered claims to state farm,its insurance carrier.the insurer denied coverage under the first party property provisions as well as the business liability portion of the policy.ultimately the association paid to fully clean and abate building.
the association sued cal coast cal coast against the association and golden pacific association management golden pacific,the association property manager and golden pacific tendered the to the association for defense.the association in turn tendered the,and golden pacific request for defense,to state farm,and asked for reconsideration of the initial denial of the first party coverage claim for remediation expenses.correspondence flurried back and forth from mid through early,with the association repeatedly providing additional requested information and asking state farm to accept tender of the third party claims and reevaluate first party coverage.in the end state farm denied coverage for both sets of claims,asserting as to the property damage claims that the total pollution exclusion and faulty workmanship exclusion barred coverage.
thereafter the association sued state farm,asserting causes of action for breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and declaratory relief.in the meantime,the association action against cal coast went to trial it won a judgment of over,but the contractor was insolvent and its insurance carrier denied coverage because the policy contained an asbestos exclusion disclaiming coverage for any injury 
state farm moved successfully for summary adjudication in the instant action as to the first party claims.the trial court granted summary adjudication on the first party claims,ruling that the test for whether the pollution exclusion excludes coverage is based upon the type of pollutant and whether it is released in a way that constitutes environmental pollution.according to the court,this state considers asbestos to be a pollutant,and more significantly,that it is a pollutant is a fact of common knowledge of which the court may take judicial notice.as to the manner in which the asbestos was released,the court concluded it is irrelevant whether it was negligent or intentional or a incident.what appears relevant is the scope of the degradation,was it contained inside or did it reach the outside environment the undisputed facts establish that the asbestos release created environmental pollution as it was airborne and was found in the street,driveways,gardens,sidewalk.
the association dismissed with prejudice its third party claims,the parties stipulated to the dismissal and the court entered judgment in favor of state farm.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review interpretation principles 
we review de novo the trial court decision on summary adjudication.california school of culinary arts lujan th.as pertinent here,we undertake our review of the lower court interpretation of the insurance policy under our familiar rules of contract interpretation,supra,cal th at.
the overarching aim of contract interpretation is to give effect to the parties mutual intentions at the time of contracting.we infer this intent,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.the clear and explicit meaning of policy language governs our interpretation unless such interpretation leads to an absurd end.we construe the words of a policy in their ordinary and popular sense unless the parties use them in a technical sense or a special meaning is ascribed to them by usage.
a policy provision is ambiguous if it is susceptible to more than one reasonable construction.helfand national union fire ins.th.but,we will not strain the language to create an ambiguity,or label a provision ambiguous simply by isolating phrases and regarding them in the abstract.ibid.rather,courts will construe the provision in relation to the whole of the instrument,and may explain the policy by reference to the circumstances of its making,and the matter to which it pertains,supra,cal th at.the correct inquiry is whether the provision is ambiguous in the context of the policy at hand and the circumstances of the particular case.ibid.
finally,we interpret insurance coverage broadly in order to afford the insured the greatest possible protection,and conversely interpret exclusionary clauses narrowly against the insurer moreover,exclusionary clauses can not be unclear.mackinnon,supra,cal th at.a ny exception to the performance of the basic underlying obligation must be so stated as clearly to apprise the insured of its effect.ibid.it is the insured burden to show that a particular claim falls within policy coverage,but the insurer bears the burden of showing that such claim is excluded by clear and unmistakable language.ibid.a court examining an exclusionary clause must attempt to put itself in the position of a layperson and understand how he or she might reasonably interpret the exclusionary language.id.at.
b.the pollution exclusion precluded coverage 
the association is adamant that mackinnon,a coverage case,applies to its first party claim,and that under that authority,the pollution exclusion does not pertain to a single,negligent,localized asbestos release.accordingly,it urges reversal.some background is in order.
mackinnon and its progeny 
mackinnon was the owner of an apartment building who,at the request of a tenant,hired a pest control company to eradicate yellow jackets at the apartment.the company treated the building several times and the tenant died from pesticide exposure.her parents sued mackinnon tendered defense to his insurer,which concluded that the pollution exclusion precluded coverage.suing his insurer,mackinnon lost at the trial and appellate court levels on grounds that the pollution exclusion was clear and unambiguous and there was no potential for coverage.
reversing,our supreme court first attended to the historical background of the pollution exclusion,noting that in congress substantially amended the clean air act in an effort to protect and enhance the quality of the nation air resources the passage of these amendments,which included provisions for cleaning up the environment,imposed greater economic burdens on insurance underwriters,particularly those drafting cgl policies in the wake of these events,the insurance industry became increasingly concerned that the policies were to cover most injuries.to that end,changes were suggested,and the industry proceeded to draft what was to eventually become the pollution exclusion mackinnon,supra,cal th at,quoting from an illinois supreme court opinion,american states ins.koloms.
the court went on to explain that these efforts resulted in an endorsement to the cgl policy adopted in as exclusion f.mackinnon,supra,cal th at.then in,following significant and extensive litigation over the precise meaning of certain words in exclusion f,the insurance industry drafted a new version of the exclusion,referred to as the absolute pollution exclusion.mackinnon,supra,cal th at.the motivation for the amended exclusion was twofold,namely to eliminate coverage for gradual environmental degradation and cleanup such as superfund response cost reimbursement.id.at,quoting stempel,reason and pollution correctly construing the absolute exclusion in context and in accord with its purpose and party expectations tort ins.
next,the mackinnon court looked at the specific coverage language of the policy,in order to understand the insured reasonable expectations apart from the exclusion.the policy at issue was a standard cgl policy obligating the insurer to pay damages that the insured is legally obligated to pay for bodily or personal injury,or property damages.this language established a reasonable expectation that the insured will have coverage for ordinary acts of negligence resulting in bodily injury.mackinnon,supra,cal th at.the court rejected the insurer insistence on a literal reading of the pollution exclusion and discernment of meaning with reference to dictionary meanings of key words such as discharge and irritant,a reading that would embrace virtually all acts of negligence involving substances that can be characterized as irritants or contaminants.ibid.as well,the insurer approach does not necessarily yield the ordinary and popular sense of the word if it disregard ed the policy context.ibid.rather,in divining the meaning of certain key words in the policy such as irritant,pollutant,discharge,and release,the court must attempt to put itself in the position of a layperson and understand how he or she might reasonably interpret the exclusionary language.ibid.moreover,the full implications of the insurer approach easily could lead to unreasonable and absurd results such that,for example,applying iodine with an eyedropper onto a cut could be characterized in a literal sense as the discharge of an irritant,within the wording of the pollution exclusion.id.at.
concluding that the insurer interpretation of the pollution exclusion was overbroad,lead to absurd results and ignored familiar connotations of the words used in the exclusion,the court held that a reasonable policyholder would understand the policy to exclude injuries arising from events commonly thought of as pollution,environmental pollution.mackinnon,supra,cal th at.it held that the common understanding of the word pollute indicates that it is something creating impurity,something objectionable and unwanted.id.at.further,limiting the scope of the exclusion was consistent with the clause choice of the terms discharge,dispersal,release or escape,which,used in conjunction with pollutant,commonly refer to the sort of conventional environmental pollution at which the pollution exclusion was primarily targeted.id.at.this interpretation was also consistent with the history and purpose of the clause.ibid.
finally,the court emphasized that its interpretation limiting the exclusion to environmental pollution was reasonable in view of the purposes of cgl policies,namely to afford the insured the broadest spectrum of protection against liability for unintentional and unexpected personal injury or property damage mackinnon,supra,cal th at.
cases following its analysis have upheld applicability of the exclusion in a variety of settings involving cgl policies.garamendi golden eagle ins.cal.app th,golden eagle the widespread dissemination of silica dust as a of industrial sandblasting operation would commonly be thought of as environmental pollution and thus came within the exclusion,the court also noting that there need not be wholesale environmental degradation to constitute pollution ortega rock quarry golden eagle ins.th,ortega pollution exclusion precluded coverage for rock quarry operator activities of placing dirt and rocks in creek bed dirt and rocks were pollutants subject to the exclusion american casualty of reading,miller th,miller layperson reasonably would understand release of methylene chloride into public sewer is a form of environmental degradation coverage precluded even if triggering event was a negligent release cold creek compost,state farm fire casualty th,pollution exclusion barred coverage for offensive and injurious odors coming from a compost facility and spreading over a mile away.
mackinnon applicability to first party property coverage claims 
although the trial court acknowledged state farm position namely,that mackinnon does not control the outcome here because mackinnon was decided in the context of principles specific to policies that insure against third party liability claims which have no analog to first party property coverage claims it did not directly decide the matter.rather,it determined that under the mackinnon test as explicated in miller,supra,th,the pollution exclusion ruled out coverage.as a threshold matter,we resolve that the general principles announced in mackinnon concerning the pollution exclusion also pertain in the context of a coverage dispute over first party property insurance claims based on an analogous pollution exclusion.
we are mindful that there are analytical differences between first party property and third party liability policies.our supreme court in garvey state farm fire casualty cal d,framed the distinctions well t he right to coverage in the third party liability insurance context draws on traditional tort concepts of fault,proximate cause and duty.this liability analysis differs substantially from the coverage analysis in the property insurance context,which draws on the relationship between perils that are either covered or excluded in the contract.in liability insurance,by insuring for personal liability,and agreeing to cover the insured for his own negligence,the insurer agrees to cover the insured for a broader spectrum of risks.in an all risk policy or open peril first party property policy such as the one at issue,generally the risk of physical loss is covered and the exclusions thus become the limitation on loss coverage.ibid.on the other hand,under a third party liability policy,the focus initially is on the insured obligation to pay for injury or damage arising from an occurrence.id.at.
it is also true,as state farm points out,that in ascertaining the meaning of the pollution exclusion,the mackinnon court highlighted the coverage language of the cgl policy,which insured against negligent acts by the insured that caused bodily injury and property damage to third parties.this language established a reasonable expectation of coverage for ordinary acts of negligence causing injury.mackinnon,supra,cal th at.in view of this expectation,coverage would be forthcoming unless the pollution exclusion conspicuously,plainly and clearly apprises the insured that certain acts of ordinary negligence,such as the spraying of pesticides,will not be covered.ibid.further,the chosen interpretation limiting the exclusion to environmental pollution was in keeping with the purpose of cgl policies to afford the broadest scope of protection against liability for unintentional personal injury and property damage resulting from the conduct of the insured business.id.at.the broad interpretation advocated by the insurer would undermine that purpose and exclude virtually all injuries entailing substances that cause harm.ibid.
we part ways with state farm,however,in its insistence that mackinnon restriction of the pollution exclusion to traditional environmental pollution has no application to losses arising under an open peril first party property insurance policy.coverage language in an all risk or open peril policy is quite broad,generally insuring against all losses not expressly excluded,supra,cal th at.moreover,we broadly interpret coverage language to give insureds the greatest possible protection,while narrowly interpreting exclusionary clauses against the insurer.mackinnon,supra,cal th.
in the present case,the exclusion in the first party coverage section of the policy bans coverage for any loss caused by the presence,release,discharge or dispersal of pollutants,while the exclusion pertinent to third party claims removes coverage for injuries arising out of discharge,seepage,migration,dispersal,spill,release or escape of pollutants.these clauses,for all practical purposes and in all material respects,are identical to one another and to the exclusion at issue in mackinnon.there is no principled reason,based on versus distinctions,to reject mackinnon fundamental directive that the pollution exclusion is aimed at environmental pollution,and instead adopt a,literal language approach to divining whether the coverage decision here was correct.
as a sister state court has well stated,t he commonly understood meaning of the pollution exclusion language in question should not be held to be different depending on whether it is used in a or policy.vigilant ins.technologies.there the insured company was in the business of fractionating whole blood plasma into component parts,using refrigerated centrifuge machines.the blood plasma was damaged by seepage of the coolant ethylene glycol,a chemical.the policy in question excluded any loss from the release,discharge or dispersal of pollutants,which,by definition included chemicals.construing the exclusion according to common speech and the reasonable expectation of the insured business person,the court held that no one would say that the insured was a polluter,because the ordinary meaning of the term would not apply.neither can it be said that the words release,discharge or dispersal apply here,since in the context of pollution,those words connote a spread beyond containment in the owner premises,to the outside air,land or water.id.at.
moreover,here,as is common,first and third party coverage is provided in a single policy.state farm in effect asks us to interpret the pollution exclusion differently depending on whether first party or third party coverage is implicated,notwithstanding that the same type of act or event could trigger a claim under either section of the policy.a reasonable insured,purchasing one policy containing both kinds of coverage,each with a pollution exclusion identical in all material respects,would not expect that the words in the two exclusions would be interpreted differently,and with different legal outcomes,depending on where they appeared in the policy.
and more to the point,when construing a first party homeowners insurance policy as opposed to a cgl policy,we do not abandon the cardinal rule that courts are to give effect to the meaning of words in their ordinary and popular sense.
further,state farm has not produced any argument or evidence that the pollution exclusion in first party policies has an historical track and derivation that differs from that in third party policies.
for all these reasons,we conclude that a reasonable insured would expect both exclusions to apply to environmental pollution.this conclusion is bolstered by the common history and the fact that the all peril property policies likewise broadly cover losses unless specifically excluded or limited.
the release of asbestos constituted environmental pollution 
reading the exclusionary language in accord with mackinnon as pertaining to environmental pollution,the question remains did the accidental release and airborne dissemination of asbestos fibers in this case amount to what is commonly regarded as environmental pollution 
threshold issues.we first attend to two threshold matters is asbestos a pollutant within the policy exclusion,and what was the mechanism by which it caused harm in this case 
asbestos is a pollutant.the court in golden eagle,supra,th answered this question in a similar context involving exposure to silica,another natural product like asbestos.it held that even if silica were not smoke,vapor,soot,fumes,acid,alkalis,chemicals or waste,per the enumerated items listed in the policy definition of pollutant,that listing was not exclusive and silica dust came within the broad definition of any solid,liquid,gaseous,or thermal irritant or contaminant.id.at.the
