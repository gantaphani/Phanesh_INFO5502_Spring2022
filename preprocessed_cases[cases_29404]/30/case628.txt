plaintiffs,a putative class of over current and future residents of a geographic area near a former lead smelter and refinery hereinafter the site or the asarco site located in omaha,nebraska,appeal from a final judgment entered in the united states district court for the district of nebraska dismissing for lack of subject matter jurisdiction their third amended complaint against asarco,asarco,the owner and former operator of the site.see trimble asarco,d judgment.for reversal,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in holding that it lacked federal question jurisdiction over plaintiffs claim for recovery of response costs under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act cercla,et,and that it lacked diversity jurisdiction over plaintiffs remaining state law claims.see id.may,memorandum and order.
the notice of appeal was timely filed pursuant to fed.a.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
background 
on september,plaintiffs brought this class action against asarco,pursuant to,alleging that their properties have been contaminated by pollutants from the asarco site.on december,plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint,setting forth the cercla private claim,as well as state law claims for trespass,nuisance,negligence,strict liability,unjust enrichment,and medical monitoring.see joint appendix,vol.i,at second amended complaint.the named plaintiffs purported to represent thousands of individuals who own or rent property in a specified area surrounding the site.see id.at.plaintiffs asserted that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to federal question,diversity of citizenship,and supplemental jurisdiction.in its answer,asarco admitted that,from time to time in the past,asarco smelting and refining operations at the site caused lead and other particulates to be emitted into the air.see answer to second amended complaint,filed,asarco maintained,however,that particulates emitted into the air from the site did not have adverse public health effects.see.asarco also moved to dismiss the second amended complaint pursuant to.b,for failure to state a claim,and,alternatively,pursuant to.b,for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
focusing on asarco rule b motion,the district court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs cercla claim because plaintiffs failed to allege facts sufficient to show that they had incurred response costs consistent with the national contingency plan ncp.see slip op.at,memorandum and order.however,the district court granted plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint to address the deficiency.see id.at 
the district court further held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs state law claims.the district court reasoned that,for jurisdiction to be predicated upon,plaintiffs were required to show that they each individually satisfied the requirement.see id.at.the district court held that plaintiffs had not made such a showing,but again granted plaintiffs leave to do so in the third amended complaint.see id.at 
plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint on january.on january,asarco renewed its motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.asarco argued in its renewed motion to dismiss that subject matter jurisdiction could not be based upon because plaintiffs had failed to allege essential elements of their private cause of action under cercla.see d at may.in particular,asarco argued that plaintiffs could not establish the third element of their cause of action under a b,that they had incurred necessary response costs see id.at.the district court characterized asarco motion as a factual attack on subject matter jurisdiction.id.at.the district court thus reasoned that factual findings related to the third element of plaintiffs cercla claim were findings of jurisdictional fact,which the district court could decide according to the preponderance of evidence standard and which this court would review solely for clear error.see id.at citing osborn united states,cir osborn reversing dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction which was predicated upon jurisdictional statute of limitations defense.the district court then noted it is clear from the record that the plaintiffs in this action,both the putative class members and the class representatives,have not personally spent any money whatsoever for investigation or remediation.see id.at footnote omitted.the district court explained that only plaintiffs attorneys,not plaintiffs themselves,had paid for the brief sampling of soil near the site,and,moreover,plaintiffs would not be liable for reimbursement of the attorneys expenditures unless they were ultimately successful in the litigation.see id.at.the district court thus concluded 
w hether the plaintiffs have incurred necessary costs of response within the meaning of a b of cercla,presents a mixed question of fact and law.the court finds and concludes that the plaintiffs have incurred no liability and no costs that the plaintiffs have,therefore,failed to allege an essential element of a private cause of action under cercla and that subject matter jurisdiction of this action can not be predicated on.
regarding diversity particular,the district court opined that,under nebraska law,an award for property damage would be limited by the nebraska supreme court to the fair market value of the property immediately preceding the damage.see id.at.the district court explained 
this court believes,and,therefore,predicts that the nebraska supreme court,if faced with the issue today,would adopt the rule set forth in keitges vandermeulen,and l investments,lynch,limiting the recoverable costs of restoration or remediation to the market value of the property.
id.at.the district court then determined that the cost to remediate plaintiffs properties,limited by their market values,plus any damages arising from incidental burdens associated with such remediation,could not meet the jurisdictional requirement for each plaintiff.see id.at.
finally,the district court rejected plaintiffs argument that they were entitled to damages for the costs of future medical monitoring and could thereby satisfy the requirement under.see id.at.because the cercla claim had been dismissed,the only possible basis for plaintiffs medical monitoring claim was state law.the district court then reasoned 
t he plaintiffs have cited no authority,and the court has found none,which would suggest that nebraska law recognizes either a cause of action for medical monitoring or a remedy involving the creation of a medical monitoring fund.there exists no pending or prospective legislation to authorize a cause of action or a remedy for medical monitoring,and the court finds it improbable that the nebraska courts would judicially fashion such a right or remedy.
thus,the district court granted asarco motion to dismiss the third amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,and judgment was entered for asarco.see id.may,judgment.plaintiffs timely appealed.
discussion 
dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under 
we address,as a threshold matter,the district court reliance on lack of subject matter jurisdiction as its basis for dismissing plaintiffs cercla claim.as noted above,asarco originally moved to dismiss the second amended complaint on grounds of both lack of subject matter jurisdiction under.b and failure to state a claim under.b.in its order dated december,however,the district court discussed the motion solely in terms of subject matter jurisdiction.consequently,after plaintiffs filed their third amended complaint,asarco asserted only lack of subject matter jurisdiction as the basis for its renewed motion to dismiss.
asarco argues that the district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was consistent with the rule of bell.hood,because there can be no subject matter jurisdiction under if a substantial federal question has not been presented.asarco further maintains that federal courts routinely treat these issues as matters under rule b lack of subject matter jurisdiction,as well as rule b failure to state a claim.as an example,asarco cites holloway gaylord chemical,holloway dismissing cercla claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiffs had failed to allege costs satisfying the statutory meaning of necessary response costs 
in bell hood,the supreme court explained 
jurisdiction is not defeated by the possibility that the averments might fail to state a cause of action on which petitioners could actually recover.for it is well settled that the failure to state a proper cause of action calls for a judgment on the merits and not for a dismissal for want of jurisdiction.whether the complaint states a cause of action on which relief could be granted is a question of law and just as issues of fact it must be decided after and not before the court has assumed jurisdiction over the controversy.if the court does later exercise its jurisdiction to determine that the allegations in the complaint do not state a ground for relief,then dismissal of the case would be on the merits,not for want of jurisdiction.the previously carved out exceptions are that a suit may sometimes be dismissed for want of jurisdiction where the alleged claim under the constitution or federal statutes clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or where such a claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.
at.footnote and citations omitted.
consistent with bell hood,a motion to dismiss a federal claim,if predicated on failure to establish an essential element of the cause of action,should generally be analyzed under.b,unless it can be shown that the challenged claim clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or where such a claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.id.at.o nly the most extreme cases will fail the jurisdictional test of substantiality.lasalle trust ecm motor,cir lasalle national trust where district court dismissed cercla claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,reversing and remanding for further proceedings because the plaintiffs had not alleged cercla claims that were so implausible,patently without merit,or insubstantial that they failed for jurisdictional purposes.only in such rare instances is dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction appropriate.the question,then,is whether this is one of those rare instances.
as noted above,asarco relies on holloway,a decision from the district court for the eastern district of louisiana,as support for the district court dismissal of plaintiffs cercla claim in the present case.in holloway,the district court dismissed cercla claims after concluding that the element of responsecosts had not been adequately pled.at first glance,holloway does appear to deviate from the general rule that motions to dismiss federal claims,where based upon the plaintiff failure to establish an essential element,should be analyzed under.b.however,that apparent deviation can be explained by the unusual way in which subject matter jurisdiction was addressed by the district court in holloway.in that case,the district court was faced with dozens of consolidated cases arising out of a single accident in the city of bogalusa,louisiana,in which a cloud of nitrogen tetroxide gas escaped from a tank car on private property and caused several sections of the city to be evacuated.some of the consolidated cases had originally been filed in the district court,while others had been removed from state court by the defendants.both the original plaintiffs and the removing defendants asserted federal subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that the complaints were seeking,among other things,response costs under cercla.see.at.although none of the defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a viable cercla claim,the district court recognized the potential legal inadequacy of the plaintiffs response costs allegations and sua sponte ordered the parties to brief that element.upon concluding that the plaintiffs had not adequately pled response costs as a matter of law,the district court invoked its powers under.h and dismissed the consolidated cases.see id.at.thus,aside from the fact that holloway carries no authoritative weight in this circuit,holloway is distinguishable from the present case because none of the defendants in holloway moved to dismiss,and the district court was compelled to resort to its broad powers under.h to dismiss the litigation sua sponte for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
in our opinion,lasalle national trust is more instructive.in that case,the seventh circuit very aptly explained why it is important to distinguish dismissals under.b from dismissals under.b.
i t is obviously possible that a plaintiff may successfully invoke federal jurisdiction,for purposes of,and yet may lose on some other ground,such as a failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted or failure to prove the merits after a full trial.a plaintiff claim may appear to be sufficient on its face,but a defendant may have a compelling affirmative defense.in some cases,the distinction between a claim that is wholly frivolous for jurisdictional purposes and a claim that is doomed on the merits may seem medieval in its fineness,and may be of little practical importance.nonetheless,the distinction is one that the supreme court has always recognized,and it rests on both sound policy grounds as well as practical considerations.from a policy standpoint,it underscores the importance of giving a full hearing to those who are attempting to raise claims in federal court,even if those claims are eventually unsuccessful.from the more pragmatic side,the way in which the facts are handled under.b differs significantly from the correct approach for purposes of rule b,and the rule procedures differ again from those used for rule.
at citing bell hood.
we agree with the seventh circuit that making the distinction between a claim that is wholly frivolous for jurisdictional purposes and one that is doomed on the merits is neither merely academic nor unnecessary.the distinction is based on longstanding policy and practical considerations which are not trivial and can not be overlooked.in the present case,plaintiffs cercla claim does not clearly appear to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction,nor is it wholly insubstantial and frivolous.thus,the district court should not have dismissed the claim under.b,for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the district court should instead have analyzed asarco motion to dismiss under.b see,godfrey pulitzer pub,cir reversing and remanding for erroneous jurisdictional analysis where the district court granted the defendant.b motion,which essentially challenged an element of the plaintiffs cause of action under the act holding the district court should instead have treated the issue as a matter under.b,cert.denied,d.
in lasalle national trust,the seventh circuit also explained how these dispositive motions are to be treated differently 
it is plain that the factual posture of these kinds of pretrial dispositive motions can be critical.in the b case,the district court is entitled to find jurisdictional facts itself in the b case,the court is required to keep the case if there is any set of facts under which the plaintiff might prevail and for rule,all disputed material facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion,although that party has the burden under celotex catrett,d,to come forward with evidence showing the genuineness of any factual disputes that it asserts must be tried.
at citing conley gibson,d.
conversion to summary judgment matter 
in the present case,matters outside the pleadings related to response costs were presented to,and not excluded by,the district court.accordingly,asarco motion to dismiss not only should have been treated initially as a motion under.b,but also should have been converted to a summary judgment matter under.see.b even though the district court did not follow the correct procedural path,the district court nevertheless provided the parties with a full opportunity to present all pertinent materials outside the pleadings regarding the issue of response costs,and the parties created a complete record on the issue.we therefore may now proceed to the summary judgment question,even though the district court did not.see,united states sager,cir we could of course remand to the district court for it to determine this question in the first instance,but the record is complete,and the issue has been fully briefed,and we see no reason for such a circuitous procedure,cert.denied,d.
the question now before us is whether the record,when viewed in the light most favorable to the party,shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c celotex catrett,d anderson liberty lobby,d.in the present case,we may affirm the district court dismissal of plaintiffs cercla claim albeit through a different procedural analysis if viewing the record in the light most favorable to plaintiffs shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and asarco is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see phillips v.the marist society,cir it is well settled that a court of appeals may affirm on any ground supported by the record,whether or not that ground was addressed by the district court.where the unresolved issues are primarily legal rather than factual,disposition on summary judgment is particularly appropriate.see crain board of police comm rs,cir.
response costs as an element of plaintiffs cercla claim 
plaintiffs must establish the following elements in order to prove their cercla private claim under a the site is a facility,there has been a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance from the site,the release or threatened release has caused plaintiffs to incur necessary response costs,and asarco falls within one of four categories of responsible persons under cercla.see,united states aceto agric.chems,cir the district court concluded that plaintiffs claim fails as a matter of law on the third element because they can not show that they have incurred necessary costs of response,as required under a b.see d at may.as stated above,the district court reasoned that none of the plaintiffs had personally spent any money investigating or remediating contamination on his or her property and,even assuming the expenditures paid by plaintiffs attorneys qualify as response costs within the meaning of cercla,plaintiffs had not incurred such costs merely because they may be obligated in the future to reimburse their attorneys if the litigation ends successfully.in the present appeal,plaintiffs argue that their contingent liability to their attorneys for reimbursement of response costs is legally sufficient to establish that they,themselves,have incurred response costs within the meaning of the statute.
we assume,for the sake of argument,that some investigation and remediation has taken place to address soil contamination caused by asarco we also assume,without deciding,that some of those expenditures are,by their nature,necessary costs of response under cercla.see key tronic united states,d interpreting necessary costs of response johnson james langley operating,cir same.
it is not genuinely disputed that plaintiffs attorneys,not plaintiffs themselves,paid those expenditures and,moreover,that plaintiffs will be obligated to reimburse their attorneys for such expenditures only if plaintiffs ultimately prevail in this litigation.in other words,if,in the end,plaintiffs are unsuccessful,then they will have made no payments for response costs and will have no legal obligation to do so.
the district court determined that the mere possibility that plaintiffs will be obligated in the future to pay for response costs is insufficient as a matter of law to satisfy the response costs element of their cercla claim.that determination is a matter of statutory interpretation,which we now review de novo.see gussack realty xerox,cir per curiam gussack realty we review the district court statutory interpretation as to the compensability of various response costs de novo.
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred because this court has explicitly held that a party can incur expenses even if he or she does not actually pay for them.brief for appellants at citing farmland,commodities,cir farmland industries.in farmland industries,a commodities broker successfully defended a lawsuit brought in federal court by one of its customers and thereafter sought an award of attorneys fees under a provision in the brokerage contract.this court held that the broker had incurred the attorneys fees within the meaning of the brokerage contract,even though the broker parent company had actually paid the attorneys fees,because the attorneys represented the broker and the broker was liable for the fees.see farmland industries,at.plaintiffs also cite quarles petroleum united states,quarles,for the proposition that one can incur expenses without actually paying for them.in quarles,the court of claims held that the plaintiffs could recover environmental costs under the federal water pollution control act fwpca even though their insurer had actually paid the costs.plaintiffs quote quarles for its statement to incur means to become liable for or subject to it does not mean to actually pay for.see brief for appellants at quoting quarles,at footnote omitted.plaintiffs further argue c ase law interpreting the fwpca is relevant because cercla defines the ncp by referring to the ncp mandated by the fwpca.id.quoting united states northeastern pharm.chem,cir,cert.denied,d.plaintiffs thus conclude that the district court erroneously believed that incur means actually pay for,in mistaken reliance upon in re dant russell,cir dant russell,which concerned a monetary award under cercla to pay for the costs of future work see id.at.by contrast,plaintiffs argue,they are seeking to recover the costs of work that has already been done.
the cases upon which plaintiffs rely do not support the statutory interpretation they urge.first,none of the cases cited actually interprets the pertinent statutory provision,a b.second,and more importantly,they are distinguishable from the present case on their material facts.as stated above,plaintiffs have no existing obligation to reimburse their attorneys for the response costs allegedly incurred.no such obligation will arise unless and until plaintiffs obtain a final judgment against asarco,and then only to the extent of that judgment.by contrast,in farmland industries,the defendant brokerage firm was obligated to pay the attorneys fees in question regardless of whether those fees could be recovered from the plaintiff through litigation.see at.in quarles,the plaintiffs themselves had hired the environmental clean up companies and,moreover,the plaintiffs were at all relevant times liable to pay those entities for their services,even though the plaintiffs insurer made the payments.see at.indeed,immediately following the language quoted by plaintiffs the quarles opinion provides 
the facts in the instant case clearly demonstrate that the plaintiffs through their own actions were liable for the costs resulting from the clean up operations.it was the plaintiffs general manager who negotiated assistance in cleaning up the spilled oil.as a result,the plaintiffs were liable to pay the persons and companies which had provided the goods and services in removing the spilled oil.the fact that the plaintiffs were insured and that the plaintiffs insurer paid out the total cost of the clean up operations is immaterial under.
we do not dispute plaintiffs point that a party may be found to have incurred a cost without having actually paid for it.as recognized in farmland industries and quarles,a finding that a cost has been incurred may be based upon an existing legal obligation.however,the mere possibility,even the certainty,that an obligation to pay will arise in the future does not establish that a cost has been incurred,but rather establishes that a cost may be incurred,or will be incurred.thus,dant russell is instructive,as the district court recognized.in dant russell,at,the ninth circuit observed under cercla scheme for private action,response costs may not be recovered when there has been no commitment of resources for meeting these costs.section a b permits an action for response costs incurred not to be incurred.accord gussack realty,at reversing award for future costs of cleaning up property because future response costs are not compensable under cercla.we therefore hold,upon de novo review,that plaintiffs have failed as a matter of law to assert a legally viable private claim under cercla,a 
plaintiffs also point out that their cercla claim contains a request for declaratory judgment pursuant to g.see joint appendix,vol.i,at third amended complaint,seventh cause of action.section g expressly provides that,in an action brought under,declaratory judgment may be granted to establish liability for future response costs.see g in any such action described in this subsection,the court shall enter a declaratory judgment on liability for response costs or damages that will be binding on any subsequent action or actions to recover further response costs or damages.however,a plaintiff can not obtain declaratory relief pursuant to g without having incurred response costs within the meaning of a b.see dant russell,at these sections and envision that,before suing,cercla plaintiffs will spend some money responding to an environmental hazard.they can then go to court and obtain reimbursement for their initial outlays as well as a declaration that the responsible party will have continuing liability for the cost of finishing the job.gopher oil bunker,cir reversing the district court dismissal of the plaintiff cercla claim where,just prior to the appeal,the epa had initiated a action which ripened the plaintiff request for a declaration of the prior owners liability to the extent of the plaintiff liability to the epa however,recognizing that the district court may not have had subject matter jurisdiction at the time of its hearing because,at that time,the plaintiff had not itself incurred response costs and the government had not yet brought a action against the plaintiff.in sum,plaintiffs have no legally viable claim against asarco at this time under either a or g.
we hold that the district court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs cercla claim.
dismissal for lack of diversity jurisdiction under 
as stated above,the district court dismissed plaintiffs state law claims pursuant to.b,holding that subject matter jurisdiction could not be predicated upon where no members of the plaintiff class could meet the requirement.on appeal,plaintiffs argue that the district court erroneously held that supplemental jurisdiction could not be exercised pursuant to for members of the plaintiff class who could not satisfy the requirement nebraska does not recognize common law liability for medical monitoring and,even if it did,plaintiffs individual claims could not be aggregated to satisfy the requirement plaintiffs recoveries for restoring their properties would be limited under nebraska law to the properties market values and none of the individual members of the plaintiff class could meet the requirement on their cognizable claims under applicable state law 
whether or not plaintiffs satisfy the requirement under is a jurisdictional issue.jurisdictional issues,whether they involve questions of law or fact,are for the court to decide.osborn,at.w hen a federal complaint alleges a sufficient amount in controversy to establish diversity jurisdiction,but the opposing party or the court questions whether the amount alleged is legitimate,the party invoking federal jurisdiction must prove the requisite amount by a preponderance of the evidence.missouri western sur,cir.the complaint will be dismissed if it appears to a legal certainty that the value of the claim is actually less than the required amount.see larkin brown,cir.n o presumptive truthfulness attaches to the plaintiff allegations,and the existence of disputed material facts will not preclude the trial court from evaluating for itself the merits of the jurisdictional claims.osborn,at.if the district court dismisses for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based upon the complaint alone,or the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts evidenced in the record,the appellate court review is limited to determining whether the district court application of the law is correct and,if the decision is based on undisputed facts,whether those facts are indeed undisputed.id.if,however,the district court makes findings of disputed jurisdictional facts,the appellate court must then review those findings under the clearly erroneous standard.id.interpretations of state law are reviewed on appeal de novo.see salve regina college russell,d.
we first address plaintiffs challenge to the district court interpretation of the applicable federal jurisdictional statutes,upon which the district court concluded that each and every member of the plaintiff class must satisfy the requirement in order to remain in the litigation.in,the united states supreme court held in snyder harris,d,that,in a class action suit,individual class members separate and distinct claims could not be aggregated to satisfy the requirement under.in,the supreme court held in zahn international paper,d zahn,that,in a class action suit brought pursuant to.b,each member of the class must satisfy the requirement or must be dismissed from the case.in other words,under zahn,a district court can not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over claims of class members who do not,themselves,satisfy the jurisdictional requirement.repeating the words of the lower court,the supreme court observed o ne plaintiff may not ride in on another coattails.id.
in the present case,the individual members of the plaintiff class are asserting separate and distinct claims related to their properties,and thus,under snyder,their claims can not be aggregated to satisfy the requirement.see,mehlenbacher akzo nobel salt,cir mehlenbacher citing snyder and holding that,in property owners class action suit against owner of collapsed salt mine,class members could not aggregate claims based on damage to properties and economic losses in order to meet requirement.moreover,if zahn applies,then each and every member of the plaintiff class must meet the threshold in order to remain in federal court.if zahn does not apply,and supplemental jurisdiction may be exercised,then plaintiffs need only show that at least one member of the class meets the jurisdictional requirement.
plaintiffs argue that congress overruled zahn by its enactment of.subsection a of that provision states the following general rule 
a except as provided in subsections b and c or as expressly provided otherwise by federal statute,in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction,the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution.such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.
a.notably,the statute goes on to enumerate several specific exceptions to the general which class action suits under.is not one.subsection b provides 
b in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on,the district courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection a over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under rule,or of the federal rules of civil procedure,or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under rule of such rules,or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under rule of such rules,when exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section.
a few federal courts of appeals have considered impact on zahn,and they have reached divided conclusions.compare stromberg metal works,press mechanical,cir holding that overrules zahn free abbott labs.in re abbott labs,cir free abbott labs.same,aff by an equally divided court,d per curiam,with leonhardt western sugar,cir leonhardt holding that does not overrule zahn.as the second circuit noted in mehlenbacher,at,the supreme court failed to resolve the circuit split when it affirmed the fifth circuit decision in free abbott labs.by an equally divided court see,d per curiam.
the eighth circuit has yet to address the question of whether overrules zahn.in the present case,plaintiffs urge us to follow the fifth and seventh circuits and hold that,if the district court has original diversity jurisdiction under over the state law claims of any member of the plaintiff class in this case,arguably the class representatives,then the district court has supplemental jurisdiction under over all remaining members of the plaintiff class,even if they themselves do not have claims.in reaching such a conclusion,the fifth and seventh circuits focused on the absence of any reference to.class actions in b list of exceptions.
upon careful de novo consideration,however,we agree with the district court that the tenth circuit decision in leonhardt states the better view.the tenth circuit reasoned as follows.
u nder the historical interpretation of,any plaintiff in a diversity class class representative or putative class does not meet the jurisdictional amount in controversy must be dismissed from the action,and if no plaintiff can meet the amount in controversy,the entire class action must be dismissed.at issue here is whether the enactment of,concerning supplemental jurisdiction,altered the historical aggregation rules under for class actions.
if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,we normally find that language conclusive.if the language is ambiguous,however,we may resort to legislative history as an aid to interpretation.
in determining that nothing in the language of limited the broad grant of authority conferred by a so as to preserve the historical aggregation rules for class actions under,the fifth and seventh circuits focused only on the absence of rule from the exceptions enumerated in b.those exceptions,however,concern only the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction over claims against defendants who are made parties to a diversity action under certain rules and claims by plaintiffs who seek to be added to an diversity action.we are concerned,however,with whether congress intended to change the rules about when a plaintiff can bring an initial class action under rule,where the court original jurisdiction is based upon.the omission of rule from b has no bearing on that question.
in our view,a literal and textually faithful reading of a leads to the opposite conclusion from that of the fifth and seventh circuits.section a specifically addressed any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction.emphasis added.it then provides for supplemental jurisdiction over transactionally related claims.section is what confers original jurisdiction over diversity cases and it expressly requires that the matter in controversy exceed the sum or value of.while does not expressly refer to class actions,the supreme court has noted that periodic congressional amendment of the diversity statute to alter only the amount in controversy evidences congressional agreement with the court holding that matter in controversy does not encompass the aggregation of separate and distinct claims.thus,congress in a expressly excepted claims brought under and its definition of matter in controversy.
furthermore,b itself supports this interpretation of a.section b sets forth various situations in which a court,sitting in diversity,can not exercise supplemental jurisdiction where the exercise of such jurisdiction would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of.that very language evidences a concern for preserving the historical and rules of diversity.the fact that b prohibits the addition of claims and parties which would destroy diversity supports our interpretation of a as also fully respecting the rules of diversity in cases invoking the original jurisdiction of the federal courts.
thus,in our view a and b can be read literally,and unambiguously,to require each plaintiff in a class action diversity case to satisfy the zahn definition of matter in controversy and to individually meet the requirement.
at footnotes and citations omitted.recognizing the statute arguable ambiguity,the tenth circuit went on to consider the legislative background of and concluded that the legislative history further supports the view that zahn remains good law.see id.at.
we agree with and adopt the reasoning of the tenth circuit in leonhardt.we hold that the rule of zahn remains viable notwithstanding congress enactment of.in the present case,therefore,the members of the putative plaintiff class must each satisfy the jurisdictional requirement under for the district court to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over their cognizable state law claims.if no member of the plaintiff class satisfies the jurisdictional threshold,the state law claims were properly dismissed in their entirety by the district court.accord morrison allstate indem,cir if the plaintiffs do not prove that there are class members whose individual claims satisfy the amount in controversy requirement,the district court must dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.
we now turn to the district court determinations that the nebraska supreme court would not recognize common law liability for medical monitoring and,even if it would,plaintiffs claims could not be aggregated to satisfy the jurisdictional threshold.the district court rejected plaintiffs medical monitoring claim based upon the following reasoning 
regarding the causes of action asserted under nebraska law,the plaintiffs have cited no authority,and the court has found none,which would suggest that nebraska law recognizes either a cause of action for medical monitoring or a remedy involving the creation of a medical monitoring fund.there exists no pending or prospective legislation to authorize a cause of action or a remedy for medical monitoring,and the court finds it improbable that the nebraska courts would judicially fashion such a right or remedy.consequently,in the absence of authority that nebraska law recognizes a claim or remedy for the costs of future medical monitoring,the court declines to speculate that the allegations of the third amended complaint seeking the creation of a medical monitoring fund furnish the jurisdictional amount otherwise absent in this action.
plaintiffs now contend that the district court should have waited for asarco to file a motion for summary judgment challenging the medical monitoring claim,and then provided plaintiffs a full opportunity to argue the legal viability of that claim.instead,plaintiffs argue,the district court sua sponte dismissed the medical monitoring claim prematurely and in violation of its own order of december.
plaintiffs still have not cited any nebraska authority for the proposition that damages may be awarded for future medical monitoring costs in the absence of a present physical injury.thus,our recognition of such a cause of action would,in effect,expand substantive liability under nebraska law.under the circumstances,it would be both imprudent and improper for us to allow plaintiffs to pursue their medical monitoring claim.tucker paxson mach,cir in diversity case under missouri law,rejecting plaintiff argument for adoption in federal court of expanded strict products liability doctrine under state law,on ground that the trend was not well established accord birchler gehl,cir when we are faced with opposing plausible interpretations of state law,we generally choose the narrower interpretation which restricts liability,rather than the more expansive interpretation which creates substantially more liability.pearson john hancock mut.life ins,cir plaintiffs who chose federal forum can not justifiably complain if the federal court manifests great caution in blazing new trails villegas princeton farms,cir federal court is not the place to press innovative theories of state law.having agreed with the district court,on de novo review,that plaintiffs have not asserte
