we consider in this appeal a challenge by fishing industry groups and the states of oregon and washington to a federal regulation that increased the amount of pacific whiting fish allocated to four indian tribes.we affirm in part and reverse in part,with instructions to the district court to remand to the agency for more specific findings.
isaac stevens,washington first territorial governor and the first superintendent of indian affairs of the washington territory,negotiated a series of treaties in the involving a number of indian tribes located in the northwest 
these treaties,commonly referred to as the stevens treaties,reserved to the signing tribes certain fishing rights.the treaties at issue in this action are the treaty of neah bay,a treaty with the makah tribe and the treaty of olympia,a treaty with the quinault,quileute and hoh tribes.as to the right of the makah tribe,the treaty of neah bay provided that 
t he right of taking fish and of whaling or sealing at usual and accustomed grounds and stations is further secured to said indians in common with all citizens of the united states,and of erecting temporary houses for the purpose of curing,together with the privilege of hunting and gathering roots and berries on open and unclaimed lands provided,however,that they shall not take shellfish from any beds staked or cultivated by citizens.

more than a century after the execution of the stevens treaties,congress responded to concerns about preservation of the nation fishery resources and enacted the fishery conservation and management act,the act or the act.the purpose of the magnuson stevens act was to protect united states fisheries by extending the exclusive fisheries zone of the united states from to miles and to provide for management of fishing within the zone.state charterboat ass baldrige,cir citing,sess,reprinted in.
the act vested the national marine fisheries service nmfs of the department of commerce with the authority to issue fishery management regulations,see generally daley,cir.however,under the act,fishery management regulations must be consistent with applicable law defining native american treaty fishing rights.see,parravano babbitt,cir.in,the nmfs promulgated a regulation the framework regulation that established a limit on the total number of pacific whiting fish to be taken in any year and a framework for allocating these fish to the hoh,makah,quileute,and quinault tribes.the regulation stipulated coordinates that identified usual and accustomed fishing areas u as for the tribes,extending about forty miles into the ocean off the coast of washington.daley,at.in so doing,the nmfs recognized that the stevens treaties reserved rights to harvest pacific whiting in the tribes u as.the framework regulation also made a specific allocation of metric tons of pacific whiting to the makah tribe for.
shortly after the regulation was enacted,midwater trawlers,west coast seafood processors,and the fishermen marketing association collectively,the state of oregon,and the state of washington challenged the regulation and its annual allocations of pacific whiting to the makah.the action originally was brought in the oregon federal district court,but was transferred to the federal district court in washington.in,the district court dismissed the plaintiffs claims for failure to join the tribes as necessary and indispensable parties.in,this court reversed the dismissal of the claims and remanded for further proceedings.see daley,at.
in,midwater and oregon challenged in oregon federal district court another nmfs regulation,which increased the amount of pacific whiting allocated to the makah tribe to metric tons.may.this case was transferred to washington federal district court and consolidated with the suit pending on remand.the federal government moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted in for all the cases.the washington district court held that the federal defendants did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in recognizing the tribes right to harvest pacific whiting,because the stevens treaties are other applicable law under the act the secretary of commerce did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in recognizing the u a fishing areas beyond the territorial limit off washington coast and the nmfs allocation of whiting in was not arbitrary and capricious.midwater and oregon appealed.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.robi reed,cir.under section f of the act,f,which adopts the standard of review set forth in the administrative procedure act apa at,regulations promulgated by the secretary may be set aside only if they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.our only task is to determine whether the secretary has considered the relevant factors and articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.crab producers,mosbacher,cir.
midwater lacks standing to challenge that portion of the framework regulation that identified u a areas for the hoh,quileute,and quinault tribes beyond three miles.in order to have standing,a plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest that is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.hays,d.although none of the tribes disclaims its right to seek an allocation through the framework regulation in the future,the nmfs has not allocated any pacific whiting to them.thus,any injury midwater suffered in connection with the hoh,quileute,and quinault tribes was conjectural or hypothetical rather than actual or imminent.in short,midwater has not suffered the requisite injury in fact and lacks standing to challenge the portion of the regulation identifying u as with respect to the hoh,quileute,and quinault tribes.thus,the only tribal allocation properly at issue is that to the makah tribe.
midwater argues that tribal treaty rights to pacific whiting could not be recognized as applicable law at the time the framework regulation was adopted,because no express judicial adjudication of tribal treaty rights to pacific whiting had been made.contrary to midwater contention,we need not determine tribal fishing rights under the stevens treaties on a case by case,fish by fish,basis.indeed,to do so would contravene settled law of this circuit and prior supreme court determinations.indeed,we previously rejected this notion in shellfish ii.there,the state of washington had argued to the district court that the tribes should be required to prove their historic fishing for shellfish.we rebuffed the argument as inconsistent with the language of the stevens treaties,the law of the case,and the intent and understanding of the signatory parties.as explained by the district court in shellfish i and adopted by us in shellfish ii 
at treaty time,the tribes had the absolute right to harvest any species they desired,consistent with their aboriginal title the fact that some species were not taken before treaty because they were inaccessible or the indians chose not to take not mean that their right to take such fish was limited.because the right of taking fish must be read as a reservation of the indians rights,and because the right to take any species,without limit,the stevens treaties,the court must read the right of taking fish without any species limitation.

our reasoning in shellfish ii was a natural outgrowth of the supreme court detailed analysis of tribal fishing rights under the stevens treaties in.state commercial passenger fishing vessel ass n,d.in that case,the court concluded 
in our view,the purpose and language of the treaties are unambiguous they secure the indians right to take a share of each run of fish that passes through tribal fishing areas.
