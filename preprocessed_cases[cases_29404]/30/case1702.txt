masonite corporation masonite appeals from a judgment denying its petition for writ of mandate to set aside approvals by mendocino county county of the kunzler terrace mine project project to be developed by granite construction company granite granite and the county are hereafter referred to collectively as respondents,and the final environmental impact report eir for its project,for failure to comply with the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et.
masonite argues the approval process and the eir were deficient in several ways.the county was required to recirculate the eir because the project as approved had significantly greater impacts than the one originally proposed.recirculation was also required because the eir disclosed a new significant impact on the foothill yellow tailed frog frog that was not adequately mitigated.the county erroneously determined that conservation easements and fees were not feasible ways to mitigate the loss of prime farmland due to the project.the eir did not adequately analyze the project cumulative impacts on agricultural resources.the county failed to adopt adequate measures to mitigate significant impacts from truck traffic along a private road associated with the project.and finally,that the eir failed to adequately evaluate project alternatives.
we agree with masonite contentions involving recirculation for comment on possible mitigation measures that can protect the frog the infeasibility of agricultural conservation easements and fees discussion of cumulative impacts on farmland and mitigation measures for truck traffic.accordingly,we reverse the judgment denying the petition for writ of mandate,with directions that the county set aside its certification of the eir,and prepare and circulate a supplemental eir that addresses the errors we identify.
background 
the project is a sand and gravel quarry to be developed on acres approximately one mile north of ukiah.the site is bordered on the north by ackerman creek,on the east by the russian river,on the south by property owned by masonite,and on the west by kunzler ranch road.most of the site is cultivated as a vineyard,with an open space portion in the northeast and a truck maintenance shop at the northwest corner.acres of the site acres are classified as prime farmland,but the site has been zoned for industrial use since.it is surrounded by a lumber mill to the north of ackerman creek,agricultural land to the east of the russian river,masonite industrial property to the south described as vacant on area maps,and industrial and commercial properties to the west.
granite plans to extract million tons of aggregate from acres of the site over a year period.the mine is designed to operate,six days a week,hours a day the mining will be done in phases to allow for concurrent site reclamation,and five years of reclamation are planned after the mining operations are complete.following reclamation,the northwestern portion of the property will be available for future industrial uses,and the rest of the site will be open space ponds.
granite submitted an application to the county for approval of a conditional use permit and reclamation plan for the project in february.the county determined that an environmental impact report was required,solicited comments from government agencies in april,and noticed preparation of a draft environmental impact report draft in october.the draft was released for public and agency review in september.among those who commented critically on the draft and the project were scs engineers on behalf of masonite,and russian riverkeeper,an organization dedicated to protection of the russian river environment.
the eir was released for review on may.the eir identified two significant and unavoidable project impacts,the permanent loss of prime farmland,and traffic problems that would develop by the year.the eir came before the county planning commission on may.after considering public comments,including those on behalf of masonite,the planning commission certified the eir and approved the use permit and reclamation plan.the planning commission adopted a statement of overriding considerations noting,among other things,that the project would provide a reliable year supply of construction aggregate in the mendocino county area.
masonite and russian riverkeeper appealed the planning commission decisions to the county board of supervisors.the appeals were heard by the board on july.the day of the hearing,masonite filed a page letter brief challenging the eir on approximately grounds.the board denied both appeals.
masonite and russian riverkeeper filed petitions for writ of mandate seeking to overturn the county approval of the project due to violations of ceqa.the petitions were denied,and masonite and russian riverkeeper appealed from the judgments.russian riverkeeper appeal was dismissed after settlement.
ii.discussion 
scope of review 
in reviewing an agency compliance with ceqa the courts inquiry shall extend only to whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.citation.such an abuse is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.citations.
an appellate court review of the administrative record for legal error and substantial evidence in a ceqa case is the same as the trial court the appellate court reviews the agency action,not the trial court decision in that sense appellate judicial review under ceqa is de novo.citations.we therefore resolve the substantive ceqa issues by independently determining whether the administrative record demonstrates any legal error by the county and whether it contains substantial evidence to support the county factual determinations.vineyard area citizens for responsible growth,city of rancho cordova cal th,fn.omitted vineyard.
recirculation of the eir 
arguments and standards 
masonite contends that the eir should have been recirculated for public review because the project as approved was different markedly from the one analyzed in the draft and had more severe environmental impacts,and because the eir identified a new significant impact on the frog.
a lead agency is required to recirculate an eir when significant new information is added to the eir after public notice is given of the availability of the draft eir for public review but before certification,tit,subd.a the ceqa guidelines in,tit,et are hereafter cited as guidelines pub.resources code.t he addition of new information to an eir after the close of the public comment period is not significant unless the eir is changed in a way that deprives the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment upon a substantial adverse environmental effect of the project or a feasible way to mitigate or avoid such an effect.laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal th,laurel heights ii see also vineyard,supra,cal th at,quoting laurel heights ii.significant new information includes a disclosure showing that a new significant environmental impact would result from the project guidelines,subd.a.
project alterations 
the project was changed in two respects from the one originally envisioned.
a pond river connection in lieu of a weir and fuse plug 
granite application for the use permit and reclamation plan recognized that,because of its proximity to the russian river and ackerman creek,the project site has valuable aquatic and riparian habitats adjacent to it.the aquatic habitat supports chinook salmon and steelhead,both listed as threatened species under the endangered species act.the primary concern for these species relative to the proposed project is the potential for fish entrapment in the pit during floods high enough to inundate the site.the application noted with respect to hydrology and drainage that,as an alluvial terrace adjacent to the russian river and ackerman creek,the project site is subject to periodic inundation extensive hydrologic modeling was conducted to design an overflow structure that would minimize the potential for fish to become entrapped in the pit,and prevent erosion of pit banks and walls during a year flood event.
granite application proposed to address the potential for flooding and trapped fish with construction of a flood control weir and fuse plug.the armored overflow weir gives the creek and river a controlled access and drainage point for flood waters without eroding the mining buffer,while the erodable sic fuse plug limits potential fish entrapment.in may,comments on the project,the national marine fisheries service nmfs of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration stated that reconnecting the pit to the stream would provide better protection for endangered salmonids than the proposed weir and fuse plug.granite study of the nmfs proposal,attached as appendix f to the draft,concluded that it would be preferable to use a connection channel between the mine pond and the russian river in lieu of the weir and fuse plug.
the project as proposed in the draft provided for use of the weir and fuse plug,but the connection channel design was presented as alternative it replaced the weir and fuse plug with a culvert or culverts suitable for the project life rather than as a permanent structure as under the proposed project,and eliminated the need for ongoing maintenance of the weir and fuse plug.the draft determined that stranding or entrapment of salmonids would be a potentially significant impact if the project were constructed with the weir and fuse plug.however,mitigation measures that included salmonid rescue and relocation programs implemented in consultation with nmfs and the department of fish and game fish game,would make this impact l ess than significant.the draft further stated that if alternative was implemented,it would reduce the potential significance of pit capture and salmonid entrapment and eliminate the need for the rescue plan.
in november,comments on the draft,nmfs expressed concern that when pit mining operations resulted in ponds of standing groundwater more than feet deep,anaerobic conditions would threaten the vitality of any salmonids trapped in the ponds,and the depths of the reclaimed ponds would need to be regulated to achieve suitable habitat.
the county determined in the eir that alternative was environmentally superior to the weir and fuse plug,and the nmfs supported alternative in comments submitted prior to planning commission approval of the eir.as approved,the project included the connection in lieu of the weir and fuse plug reflected in the revised reclamation plan appended to the eir.
although the draft stated that the connection would eliminate the need for a salmonid rescue program,the eir retained a rescue program during the mining phase of the project.the draft set forth two options for the reclamation phase.option a provided for construction of the connection unless nmfs and fish game staff determined that the potential adverse water quality within the pit would outweigh the connection expected benefits to salmonid habitat.option b required granite to continue the salmonid rescue program until nmfs and fish game said it was no longer needed in the eir,option b was unchanged,and option a was amended to provide simply for construction of the connection.the deference to nmfs and fish game concerns over water quality in the pit was replaced in the eir by more detailed mitigation requirements,set forth in new mitigation measure alt,to address concerns raised in nmfs november letter.specifically,the eir stated that granite would limit the depth in the reclaimed ponds to feet as nmfs stated would be acceptable,or deeper if acceptable pursuant to a future water quality assessment 
b floodplain benching 
the term floodplain benching refers to a proposal by granite in the project application,to widen the ackerman creek and russian river channels to improve channel hydraulic capacity and winter rearing habitat for salmonids above what is currently available which,in turn,will increase annual winter juvenile salmonid survivability in the project vicinity.this floodplain benching was incorporated into the draft,along with mitigation measures for its impact on salmonids and riparian habitat.
in its comments on the draft,scs engineers for masonite criticized the floodplain benching.scs wrote artificial and unwarranted improvements such as those proposed by granite serve to upset the equilibrium of the fluvial system for the financial benefit of one landowner.this proposed channel widening is not only unneeded under current conditions,such channel manipulations have the potential to destabilize downstream banks and to shift the position of the channel thalweg with potentially negative impacts to downstream landowners.such negative impacts may include increased potential for flooding or other unanticipated,responses that may occur as a result of the proposed unwarranted mechanical manipulation of the channel t here is little or no geomorphic or other scientific justification for such a proposal and many potential pitfalls.the mendocino county water agency also expressed concerns that erosion would occur in the floodplain bench area.in response to these comments,alternative was revised in the eir to eliminate floodplain benching from the project.the eir also observed that removal of floodplain benching would not create any flooding impacts relative to the baseline condition.
after close of the period for public comment on the draft,the california department of conservation office of mine reclamation wrote a letter to the county noting that floodplain benching was conspicuously absent from the most recent version of the reclamation plan.the department of conservation doc thought that floodplain benching likely would provide a great benefit to the wildlife and riparian habitat along the active drainages and may provide some flood control benefit.the plans to complete the floodplain enhancement should be put back in the reclamation plan,or a reasonable justification for removing this enhancement work should be provided.granite responded that floodplain benching was only a voluntary component of the project that added no net environmental benefit and was being removed to avoid potential environmental impacts.
county staff observed that floodplain benching was not tied to any specific environmental mitigation for the project,essentially removing the issue as a concern under ceqa.moreover,many of the potential impacts discussed in the draft regarding riparian and other wildlife habitats would be eliminated with the removal of the floodplain benching component.however,since the environmental benefits of floodplain benching were debatable,staff did not take a position and left it up to the planning commission to determine whether to require floodplain benching in the project.at the planning commission meeting,staff advised that fish game had concerns that floodplain benching would adversely affect water quality and the habitat of the frog.after taking comments and discussing the matter,the planning commission voted to approve the project without the floodplain benching feature.deletion of that feature was noted when the board of supervisors heard the appeals of the planning commission decision.
c analysis 
an accurate project description is necessary for an intelligent evaluation of the potential environmental effects of a proposed activity silveira las gallinas valley sanitary dist.th,and an unstable description can mislead the public and thwart the eir process.san joaquin raptor rescue center county of merced th.masonite argues that granite inadequate and inconsistent project description prevented informed review and comment on each of the previously described changes.however,both the connection and floodplain benching were described in the draft,and the county received informed commentary on their merits.
masonite argues that the eir improperly gave several conflicting signals about the project changes.san joaquin raptor rescue center county of merced,supra,th at description that gave conflicting signals about nature and scope of the activity was fundamentally inadequate and misleading.masonite makes this claim because,until the actual approval hearing,it appeared that the floodplain benching was still an integral part of the project.this claim is based on the eir response to masonite criticism of floodplain benching,but the response addressed masonite concerns and made clear that r evised alternative would eliminate the channel widening component of the project.the eir was not misleading because it discussed both the potential benefits of floodplain benching and its elimination from a project alternative.inclusion of floodplain benching was an open issue when the eir was prepared.
masonite contends that information about floodplain benching was improperly scattered here and there in the eir.vineyard,supra,cal th at information scatted here and there in an eir may not adequately inform the public and decision makers.however,there is no indication in the record that masonite or any other interested party was misled about the nature of floodplain benching or whether it would necessarily be included in the project.the absence of floodplain benching from the revised reclamation plan was characterized as conspicuous by the doc.the eir performed its role as an informational document with respect to the prospect for floodplain benching.pub.resources code.the comments for and against floodplain benching enabled the planning commission to intelligently weigh whether to require it.there is no merit to masonite arguments that the project description was inadequate.
nor are we persuaded that the project changes had any substantial adverse environmental effect that required recirculation of the eir.laurel heights ii,supra,cal th at,italics omitted.citing the draft,masonite asserts that use of the connection instead of the weir and fuse plug curtailed mitigation originally requiring a fish rescue plan.however,the record reflects that the eir retained the salmonid rescue and relocation programs specified in connection with the weir and fuse plug design.masonite also notes that adoption of the connection led to removal of a mitigation measure that mandated annual inspections and,if necessary,repair of the weir and setback areas.but as pointed out in the county staff report to the planning commission,the connection was considered an environmentally superior alternative,in part,because it eliminated the need for maintenance of the weir.
masonite also challenges a statement in the eir that removal of floodplain benching would not create any flooding impacts relative to the baseline condition.but the statement was correct because the elimination of floodplain benching would simply leave ackerman creek and the russian river in their present state.masonite arguments suggest that floodplain benching was proposed to mitigate the environmental effects of the project,but it was not.floodplain benching was,as granite said,a voluntary component of the project that was offered,as noted in the draft,as an effort to improve the current degraded state of the ackerman creek.the enhancement was eliminated when it appeared that it might do more environmental harm than good.masonite is in no position to now argue for the necessity of floodplain benching because its expert told the county in comments on the draft that floodplain benching was a rtificial,unwarranted,and unneeded under current conditions.
protected species of animals potentially present in the project area were listed on a table of special status species in the draft.the table classified the potential for occurrence at the site as high,medium,low,or unlikely.low potential for a particular species was defined as follows the project site immediate area only provide limited habitat for a particular species.in addition,the known range for a particular species may be outside of the immediate project area.the draft discussed the project potentially significant impacts on species with a medium or high potential for occurrence,and provided mitigation measures designed to reduce those impacts to insignificance.
the table of special status species included the frog.the table stated that the frog b reeds in shaded stream habitats with rock,cobble substrate,usually below feet in elevation.absent or infrequent when introduced predators are present.the table estimated the potential for frog occurrence in the project area to be low,because ackerman creek may provide limited habitat flow portions.predator species present in both ackerman creek and russian river.thus,the draft specified no mitigation measures for the frog.
in its comments to the draft,fish game said that recent surveys had documented the presence of frogs at a bridge crossing the russian river bridge approximately three miles southeast of the project site.accordingly,fish game believed that frogs were likely to exist along riparian areas of ackerman creek and the russian river,and recommended that the special status species table be amended to list the potential for frog occurrence at the site as high,not low.
the table was amended in the eir.a discussion of potentially significant impacts to the frog was added,and mitigation measures were proposed that reduced the impacts to insignificance.the impacts would arise from floodplain benching,and construction and mining operations that would impact potentially suitable upland habitat adjacent to the russian river and ackerman creek.mitigation measures included retention of current riparian vegetation to the extent possible,biological monitoring of the effects of construction on the frog,and halting of construction if impacts to the frog became evident.
masonite argues that the eir should have been recirculated for public comment because it contained significant new information regarding the frog.masonite submits the eir disclosed a new significant environmental impact on the frog guidelines,subd.a,and that the situation here is the same as that in sierra club gilroy city council d sierra club,where the presence on the project site of the potentially endangered california tiger salamander was discovered after the close of the public comment period for the draft eir the new information,the presence of the tiger salamander,demonstrated that the draft eir had not addressed a potentially substantial adverse environmental effect.therefore,revision and recirculation were required laurel heights ii,supra,cal th at.masonite questions whether the mitigation measure adopted in the eir for the frog would reduce impacts to insignificance and submits that in any event the adequacy of those mitigations should have been a topic of public comment.
respondents maintain that guidelines section,subdivision a,not a,applies because under subdivision a,recirculation is necessary when a disclosure shows that a substantial increase in the severity of an environmental impact would result unless mitigation measures are adopted that reduce the impact to a level of insignificance.respondents argue that recirculation is not required here because,under this guideline,mitigation measures in the eir will reduce the newly disclosed impact on the frog to insignificance.respondents also distinguish the sierra club case on the ground that the draft here at least discussed the frog,whereas the draft in sierra club apparently did not mention the tiger salamander.sierra club,supra,d at.
but masonite has the better arguments.this case is indistinguishable from sierra club as described in laurel heights ii,where recirculation was required because new information showed that an endangered species was present at the project site.we acknowledge,as respondents argue,that guidelines section,subdivision a could possibly apply here.the draft stated that the frog potential occurrence was low rather than unlikely,and could thus be construed to disclose a possible minor impact on the frog,and when the likelihood of the frog presence was changed from low to high,the eir disclosed a substantial increase in the severity of that impact guidelines,subd.a.but regardless of guidelines section,subdivision a,recirculation was required under guidelines section,subdivision a.we disagree with respondents suggestion that recirculation can be avoided simply because the draft disclosed some possible impact on the frog.the draft did not suggest that the project would have any potentially significant impact on that species.such an impact was disclosed for the first time in the eir,and was both new and significant within the meaning of guidelines section,subdivision a.
a contrary conclusion would contravene vineyard,supra,cal th at page and laurel heights ii,supra,cal th at page,by depriving the public of an opportunity to comment on mitigation measures for a potentially significant effect that were first identified in the eir.see also silverado modjeska recreation park dist.county of orange th,new information that materially implicates the public right to participate justifies prolonging the environmental review process save our peninsula committee monterey county bd.of supervisors th,recirculation gives the public an opportunity to evaluate the new information and the validity of conclusions drawn from it.the mitigation measures to be employed to minimize the impacts on other special status species were changed after public comment on the draft.the same is possible for the measures to be employed to minimize impacts on the frog.the sections of the eir discussing the frog must be recirculated.vineyard,supra,at discussing the scope of a recirculation.
mitigation for loss of prime farmland 
acres of the project site are prime farmland,meaning they are designated by the department of conservation fmmp farmland mapping and monitoring program as prime farmland,farmland of statewide importance,or unique farmland.one of the significant unavoidable effects of the project identified in the draft is the loss of these acres of prime agricultural land.masonite contends that the county erred when it determined that no mitigation was feasible for the loss of this prime farmland.masonite argues that this impact could have been mitigated by acquisition of agricultural conservation easements on offsite properties,or payment of fees to fund such acquisitions.
the draft explained why this impact could not feasibly be mitigated mitigation for agricultural resources may take the form of avoidance,minimization,restoration,preservation,or compensation providing substitute resources.these forms of mitigation correspond to ceqa guidelines section.for the proposed project,avoidance is not possible,as the location of the mineral resources corresponds to the prime farmland as identified in the fmmp.minimization is incorporated into the project to an extent,as the project is phased,and agricultural activity will continue on a phase until it is mined,thus extending agricultural activity during the life of the project however,this will not reduce the impact to less than significant.restoration is infeasible,as the mining will result in a finished grade below the groundwater level.preservation in this instance,is similar to avoidance,and is infeasible for the same reason.compensation generally takes the form of acquisition of farmland,typically an agricultural conservation easement ace.acquisition of an ace is considered infeasible for the proposed project for the reasons discussed below.
an ace does not replace the resources,but rather,it addresses the indirect and cumulative effects of farmland conversion.indirect effects include the pressure created to encourage additional conversions,as development pressure raises the speculative value of the land and increases the economic costs of farming due to land use incompatibilities limitations on pesticide use,nuisance complaints due to dust and odor,vandalism,predation by domestic pets,increased traffic.because the project site is surrounded by existing and vacant industrial uses,with the exception of the west side,it is unlikely that this project would affect neighboring agricultural uses.there are agricultural uses to the east,but they are separated by the natural barrier of the russian river.in addition,the end use of the property is open space including habitat,rather than urban developments.open space is compatible with agriculture,and would not create indirect development pressure on agricultural lands.
therefore,feasible mitigation measures are not available,and this impact would be significant and unavoidable.italics and bold type deleted.
the doc expressed concerns about the loss of agricultural lands as an unavoidable impact of the project in its comments on the draft.according to the doc,the loss should have been minimized through the acquisition of aces on comparable land of at least equal size.the doc considered this means of mitigation to be a common and appropriate means of mitigating the loss of prime farmland.according to the doc mitigation via agricultural conservation easements can be implemented by at least two alternative approaches the outright purchase of easements or the donation of mitigation fees to a local,regional or statewide organization or agency whose purpose includes the acquisition and stewardship of agricultural conservation easements.the conversion of agricultural land should be deemed an impact of at least regional significance.hence,the search for replacement lands should be conducted regionally or statewide,and not limited strictly to land within the project surrounding area.
the county did not respond to these comments except to note that no williamson act contracts would be affected by the project,and cite to the discussion of mitigation for lost farmland in the draft.the draft discussion of the infeasibility of such mitigation was incorporated into the eir without change.
when masonite appealed the planning commission decisions to the board of supervisors,it said there was no logical basis for the conclusion that impacts to agricultural land could not be mitigated.at the hearing on the appeal,a county representative responded that t he basic purpose of an agricultural conservation easement is to avoid the secondary impacts that are associated with conversion of agricultural land.you know,sometimes considered the so called domino effect.as you extinguish operations,now you putting development pressure on the next farmer and you causing nuisance issues that are going to make life difficult for him and make it more likely that that operation is going to want to sell so that really what you doing because you not replacing the resources.we can put an easement somewhere else but it s not going to recreate those few acres of prime farmland that are present on that site now.so that how we approach that analysis and you have to look at the circumstances of the project the nearest active agricultural operation is across the russian river,which acts as a natural barrier in terms of what i would call these nuisance or domino effects s o given that,the conclusion of county staff was that an agricultural easement was not the appropriate response in this case.
a agricultural conservation easements 
ceqa provides that public agencies should not approve projects as proposed if there are feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen the significant environmental effects of such projects.pub.resources code,see also id.at,subd.b agencies must mitigate significant effects of projects they approve whenever it is feasible to do so.ceqa defines feasible to mean capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time,taking into account economic,environmental,legal,social,and technological factors.guidelines.agency findings regarding whether mitigation measures are feasible are generally reviewed for substantial evidence.see,cherry valley pass acres neighbors city of beaumont th,beaumont.but not in this case.
here,the determination that no mitigation was feasible for the loss of farmland rested on a conclusion that offsite agricultural conservation easements aces can not mitigate for the land lost at the project site because they would not replace the resources.the county presumed that aces were useful only to address the indirect and cumulative effects of farmland conversion,and were not needed here because the project would have no such effects.thus,the finding of infeasibility in the eir rested on the legal conclusion that while aces can be used to mitigate a project indirect and cumulative effects on agricultural resources,they do not mitigate its direct effect on those resources.as respondents put it in the trial court given the lack of indirect or cumulative agricultural impacts,the draft eir properly conclude d that agricultural conservation easements are legally infeasible.the legal feasibility of a mitigation measure is not a question of fact reviewed for substantial evidence but rather is an issue of law that we review de novo.
we disagree with respondents.we conclude that aces may appropriately mitigate for the direct loss of farmland when a project converts agricultural land to a nonagricultural use,even though an ace does not replace the onsite resources.our conclusion is reinforced by the ceqa guidelines,case law on offsite mitigation for loss of biological resources,case law on aces,prevailing practice,and the public policy of this state.
aces preserve land for agricultural use in perpetuity.see,describing agricultural and other conservation easements pub.resources code,defining agricultural conservation easements.as the california farm bureau federation cfbf observes in an amicus curiae brief advocating for the conclusion we reach the permanent protection of existing resources is effective mitigation for a project direct,cumulative,or impacts because it prevents the consumption of a resource to the point that it no longer exists if agricultural land is permanently protected at,for example,a replacement ratio,then at least half of the agricultural land in a region would remain after the region has developed its available open space.by thus preserving substitute resources,ace compensate for the loss of farmland within the guidelines definition of mitigation.guidelines,subd.e mitigation includes c ompensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments.
there is no good reason to distinguish the use of offsite aces to mitigate the loss of agricultural lands from the offsite preservation of habitats for endangered species,an accepted means of mitigating impacts on biological resources.preserve wild santee city of santee th,santee loss of habitat mitigated by conservation of other habitat at a ratio california native plant society city of rancho cordova th,mitigation by offsite preservation of two acres of existing habitat or creation of one acre of new habitat for each acre of habitat impacted by the project endangered habitats league,county of orange th,mitigation by preservation of similar habitat environmental council of sacramento city of sacramento th,purchase of a for habitat reserves for every acre of development see also kostka et,practice under the california environmental quality act ed,kostka acquisition and enhancement of species habitat provide a substitute resource under guidelines,subd.e.indeed,the doc comments on the draft recognized that the rationale for aces in this case parallels that of established mitigation for loss of wildlife habitat.
our conclusion is also supported by the relatively sparse case law involving aces.the case most closely on point is citizens for open government city of lodi th lodi,which involved a project that,similar to the one here,converted acres of prime farmland to other uses.the eir determined that the impact on agricultural resources was unavoidably significant,and the developer was nonetheless required to mitigate the impact by obtaining an ace over other acres of prime farmland.id.at.although the eir observed that such mitigation would not avoid the significant impact resulting from the permanent loss of prime agricultural lands at the project site id.at,the court noted that acquisition of the offsite ace would minimize and substantially lessen that impact id.at.the lodi court reasoning refutes respondents theory that mitigation through use of an offsite ace is not legally feasible.
in beaumont,supra,th,the eir for a housing development on land long used for agricultural purposes noted that there was no feasible mitigation for the impact on agricultural resources other than placing large blocks of farmland into conservation easements,williamson act preserve status,or other temporary protection or preservation plans.id.at italics omitted.but the eir rejected those mitigation measures as economically infeasible because the pace of urban development made farming no longer financially viable,a conclusion that was upheld as supported by substantial evidence.id.at,citing defend the bay city of irvine th,offsite preservation of agricultural land was infeasible because of the negative economics of agriculture in orange county.there would have been no need for the eir or the court in beaumont to address the economic feasibility of aces if,as respondents argue,aces are not legally feasible.nor does beaumont support respondents claim that we should review the infeasibility determination in this case for substantial evidence.because the county decided that aces were not a legally feasible means to mitigate the loss of farmland at the project site,it never investigated whether aces were economically feasible,and there is no evidence to review.
building industry of central california county of stanislaus th stanislaus,involved a challenge to a county general plan that required developers of projects converting agricultural land to residential use to obtain aces on farmland of equal quality in the county at a ratio,or pay an mitigation fee.id.at.the court concluded that these mitigation requirements were reasonably related to the adverse public impact of such projects and thus an authorized use of the county police power.the court observed that a residential project would not be approved until the developer provides permanent protection of one acre of farmland for every acre of farmland converted to residential use.agricultural conservation easements granted in perpetuity are the primary means of accomplishing this permanent protection requirement although the developed farmland is not replaced,an equivalent area of comparable farmland is permanently protected from a similar fate.id.at.stanislaus teaches that aces are a reasonable means to mitigate the impact of a project that replaces agricultural land.
moreover,it appears that aces are commonly used for that purpose.the doc described aces in its comments as accept ed and use d by lead agencies as an appropriate mitigation measure under ceqa,and the administrative record includes evidence that aces are so employed by a number of cities and counties.the eir at issue in lodi stated that acquisition of aces over acreage equal to the agricultural acreage lost due to a project is standard for california communities.lodi,supra,th at.in addition to the city of lodi,the following agencies in the surrounding area apply the mitigation ratio cities of stockton and elk grove,counties of san joaquin and stanislaus,tri valley conservancy county.ibid.this authority suggests that the county is an outlier in believing that aces can not feasibly be used to mitigate the conversion of prime farmland to other uses.
we note finally that our legislature has repeatedly stated the preservation of agricultural land is an important public policy,subd.a the preservation of a maximum amount of the limited supply of agricultural land is necessary to the conservation of the state economic resources,and is necessary not only to the maintenance of the agricultural economy of the state,but also for the assurance of adequate,healthful and nutritious food for future residents of this state and nation pub.resources code,subd.c agricultural lands near urban areas that are maintained in productive agricultural use are a significant part of california agricultural heritage conserving these lands is necessary due to increasing development pressures and the effects of urbanization on farmland close to cities,the preservation of land in its natural,scenic,agricultural,historical,forested,or condition is among the most important environmental assets of california.the legislature has also declared that ceqa is intended to effectuate this public policy.stats,ch,a agriculture is the state leading industry c the conversion of agricultural lands to nonagricultural uses threatens the health of the state agricultural industry.d the california environmental quality act plays an important role in the preservation of agricultural lands.to categorically exclude aces as a means to mitigate the conversion of farmland would be contrary to one of ceqa important purposes.we agree with the cfbf that aces should not be removed from agencies toolboxes as available mitigation for this environmental impact.
for these reasons,the eir determination that aces are legally infeasible can not be sustained.the economic feasibility of aces to mitigate the project impact on the loss of acres of prime farmland must be explored.
b in lieu fees 
as an alternative to the outright purchase of aces,the doc comment letter recommended the donation of mitigation fees to a local,regional or statewide organization or agency whose purpose includes the acquisition and stewardship of aces.masonite argues that the eir was deficient because it did not address this suggestion.the county responds,saying it was legally precluded from accepting fees because it does not have a comprehensive farmland mitigation program.
we agree with masonite that the eir should have addressed the doc comment and given reasons for rejecting the doc proposal.guidelines,subds.a c responses with reasoned analysis are required.again,we are not persuaded by respondents argument for legal infeasibility.the doc was not advocating payment of fees to a county program,but rather to third parties involved in acquiring and overseeing aces.whether the county lacks a comprehensive farmland mitigation program is immaterial,and does not explain why fees are not feasible mitigation.this issue requires further analysis in the eir.
cumulative impacts on farmland 
the discussion of the project cumulative impacts on agricultural resources,set forth in section of the draft and incorporated without change in the eir,reads in full some of the land in the vicinity of the proposed project is considered highly productive farmland,although a majority of it is located on the eastern side of the russian river.a large portion of the project site is classified as prime farmland by the department of conservation farmland mapping and monitoring program draft.once mining ceases,the project site would be reclaimed to open space.cumulative conversion of important farmland was determined to be less than significant in the general plan eir.the project site is zoned for industrial use,and no adjacent lands currently in agriculture are planned for a conversion to urban use.the project would therefore not contribute to a significant cumulative effect.
masonite contends that this discussion improperly relied on the prior general plan eir without tiering from it or incorporating it by reference in the eir for the project,and that the discussion was factually inadequate because the information in the general plan eir was insufficient to support the determination that the project cumulative effect on farmland would be insignificant.for reasons we shall discuss,we agree with masonite on both points.
respondents assert that c umulative impacts in the agricultural context are more properly defined as the project potential to result in indirect impacts to surrounding agricultural resources and,as such,cause subsequent conversions in the future.based on this premise,respondents reason that because the draft shows that the project will not cause the conversion of other prime farmland,it also shows that the project will not result in a cumulative impact.but indirect and cumulative impacts are not the same and they entail separate analysis.compare guidelines,subd.d,subd.a defining indirect effects with guidelines,subd.a describing cumulative effects see also santee,supra,th at distinguishing a indirect impact from a cumulative impact.the draft analysis of cumulative,as opposed to indirect,impacts consists of a single sentence that states cumulative conversion of important farmland was determined to be less than significant in the general plan eir.
a pertinent discussion of cumulative impacts contained in one or more previously certified eirs may be incorporated by reference pursuant to the provisions for tiering and program eirs.guidelines,subd.d.however,an eir that uses incorporation by reference or tiering must do so expressly.vineyard,supra,cal th at.it must indicate where the earlier document is available for inspection,briefly summarize or describe the pertinent parts of earlier document,and describe how they relate to the current project.guidelines,subds.b c,subd.g kostka,supra.this information is required to give the reader a road map to the information the eir intends to convey.vineyard,supra,cal th at.the eir here was deficient because it provides no such road map.
respondents brief indicates that the eir was relying on the following discussion of cumulative impacts of the draft eir for the update of the county general plan update draft although implementation of the general plan would change land use designations,the result would be a minor loss of designated agricultural lands that would not be considered a substantial loss of agricultural land in the county.additionally,policies in the proposed general plan update support the preservation of agricultural lands and farming operations in the county.therefore,the proposed general plan update would not result in a cumulative loss of agricultural lands.
respondents argue that neither tiering nor incorporation by reference was required here because the county was merely relying on the general plan eir as evidence to support the determination in the eir that the project would not substantially contribute to the loss of farmland.surely,respondents can not be saying that because the general plan eir determined that changing land use designations would not cause a substantial loss of agricultural land within the county,no particular project consistent with the general plan could cause such a loss.there is a vast difference between land use designations that permit several alternative uses of property in a geographic area,and the approval of a specific project that changes the character of a particular property.nor do we understand the general plan eir to mean that no substantial loss to the county agricultural resources would occur if all the agricultural land in the county designated for other possible uses were to be so converted,or that no such other conversion would be approved.the general plan eir acknowledges the importance of preserving prime agricultural land,and while there may be no projects in the pipeline that will similarly convert agricultural land,the eir does not attempt to quantify the future of the county agricultural resources in any meaningful way.
we recognize that standards of practicality and reasonableness govern cumulative impacts analysis,and that such impacts need not be discussed in as much detail as the direct impacts of a project.guidelines,subd.b.but we are not persuaded the discussion of cumulative impacts in the eir is sufficient.under the guidelines,an adequate discussion of significant cumulative impacts requires either a list of past,present,and probable future projects producing related or cumulative impacts,or a summary of projections in,among other things,a certified eir for an adopted local plan that describes or evaluates conditions contributing to the cumulative effect.guidelines,subds.b a b b.the discussion in the update draft includes neither of these necessary elements.rialto citizens for responsible growth city of rialto th.
because the general plan amendments were concerned only with zoning changes,the amendments did not consider projects like the one under review that convert farmland to another use without any such change since the update draft does not address such conversions,the update can not be relied upon as a comprehensive summary of projections of cumulative impacts on agricultural lands.despite the county policies that favor preservation of agricultural land,the update draft acknowledges that the proposed general plan update would not explicitly preclude the conversion of farmlands of con
