wyoming sawmills incorporated brings this appeal from the district court order dismissing plaintiff claim of violation of the constitution establishment clause and holding against plaintiff on the merits of its claims of violation of the national forest management act plaintiff commenced this action in the district court after the united states forest service had rejected plaintiff challenges to the historic preservation plan issued by the forest service for the management of the medicine wheel national historic landmark and vicinity.named as defendants in the complaint were the forest service,the secretary of agriculture who is the cabinet officer with authority over the forest service,and three individual officers of the service,all of whom will be referred to herein as the forest service or just the service.the medicine wheel coalition on sacred sites of north america was permitted to intervene in the district court and is aligned with the service as an appellee in this court.
the medicine wheel national historic landmark was created in to preserve the medicine wheel,a prehistoric stone circle about feet in diameter that was constructed by the aboriginal peoples of north america.the wheel includes a large cairn in the center and radiating spokes of rocks.although the age of the structure is unknown,archeological evidence indicates that human presence in the area goes back for years or more.many tepee rings,trails,and other artifacts and traces of human habitation are found in the vicinity.a number of native american tribes consider the wheel to be sacred.
the medicine wheel is located on medicine mountain in the bighorn national forest in north central wyoming.in,approximately acres in the bighorn national forest were set aside for the preservation of the wheel,and designation as a national historic landmark followed twelve years later.in the,the forest service began to reconsider the level of protection afforded the area.an increase in the number of visitors to the monument had raised concerns of visitor safety and concern that the features and artifacts were at risk.on the other hand,apparently some officials were of the view that the flow of visitors should be facilitated.
in,the process resulted in the publication of a draft environmental impact statement deis which set out management alternatives.the preferred alternative set out in the deis called for road construction and improvements to allow unrestricted vehicular access except during times of ceremonial use of the wheel,construction of an enlarged parking lot adjacent to the wheel,and so forth.the forest service received more than comments on the deis,many of which were critical and called for an approach more sensitive to the concerns of native americans.
in response,the service withdrew the proposal and began a more intensive consultation process with the wyoming state historic preservation officer and the federal advisory council on historic preservation the big horn county commissioners,the medicine wheel coalition on sacred sites of north america,the medicine wheel alliance,and the federal aviation administration also became consulting parties in the development of plans for management of the site.the consulting parties entered into a memorandum of agreement moa which established that the management priorities for management for the medicine wheel are its protection and continued traditional cultural use consistent with section f of the national historic preservation act.i.
the consulting parties comprised a committee for planning management of the site.plaintiff notes that no representative of commercial interests was involved in this process.the forest service agreed in the moa to close a portion of forest development road fdr,which provides access to the medicine wheel an exemption to the closing was made for the special needs of traditional religious practitioners to reach the site.as will be seen,the alleged impact on logging of the decision to close fdr is important to plaintiff action.the term of the moa appears to have been quite brief it apparently was executed in and provided that it was to expire on january.
on august,the forest service published a programmatic agreement with the consulting parties,the stated purpose of which was to develop a plan for the long term management of the medicine wheel and medicine mountain.as part of this agreement,the service prohibited,temporarily,any new undertakings in an area within miles of the medicine wheel,including any new mining or timber harvesting,until the anticipated historic preservation plan could be completed and adopted.
in september,the service adopted the plan now at issue,titled the historic preservation plan for the medicine wheel national historic landmark and medicine mountain the hpp.the service implemented the hpp on october,by issuing amendment to the bighorn national forest plan amendment included a decision notice and finding of no significant impact,and environmental assessment.iii.et.
the hpp provides that the forest service will consult with the other parties to the hpp for any project within an area of consultation around the monument.the area of consultation is considerably larger than the national historic landmark,covering an estimated to acres.the purpose of the consultation envisioned by the hpp is to facilitate the consideration of means to minimize impacts to historic resources and traditional cultural use.
the hpp recognizes explicitly that the cultural and historic importance of the medicine wheel is,for many native americans,an element of their religious tradition.indeed,plaintiff points to the fact that the first page of each of the nine major sections of the hpp includes this statement the purpose of this hpp is to ensure that the medicine wheel and medicine mountain are managed in a manner that protects the integrity of the site as a sacred site and a nationally important traditional cultural property,ii.
the forest service points out that preservation of the medicine wheel is consistent with the service responsibilities under a number of statutes.the environmental assessment produced to evaluate the environmental effects of the hpp recites 
the forest service is required by law to protect and preserve national historic landmarks and historic properties.these laws include the antiquities act of,the historic sites act of,the national historic preservation act of,the archaeological and historic resources preservation act of,the american indian religious freedom act of,the archaeological resources act of all as amended.in addition,executive order signed by president clinton,may,orders federal agencies to accommodate access to and ceremonial use of indian sacred sites by indian religious practitioners and avoid adversely affecting the physical integrity of such sacred sites.
plaintiff wyoming sawmills is a commercial timber company located in sheridan county,wyoming.it has been the primary purchaser of timber from the bighorn national forest for over years.in addition to challenging the hpp,plaintiff complaint also addressed the forest service decision not to hold one particular timber sale that it had proposed.the service had,in september,advertised for bidding on a timber sale in an area referred to as horse creek.the service canceled the sale after receiving bids but before opening the bids,citing a procedural error in having failed to consult formally with the parties to the hpp.internal documents indicated that the service planned to the sale and to proceed with it.however,after consulting with the other parties to the hpp and after further deliberations,the service identified several potential problems with the proposed sale,including process violations,conflicting data,and incomplete national environmental policy act analysis.as a result,the service never conducted a sale of timber from the horse creek area on the other hand,the service did not decide to permanently cancel the project.
the forest service and intervenor defendant coalition moved to dismiss the complaint,and alternatively moved for judgment as a matter of law.as relevant to this appeal,the district court addressed issues of standing for plaintiff first amendment claim and addressed on its merits plaintiff claim of violation of the national forest management act.
the district court concluded that plaintiff did not have standing to bring its first amendment claims.we discuss below the concept of standing generally and the elements of standing that the judge found were satisfied.the judge held that plaintiff lacked standing as to the first amendment claims because the court could not remedy the constitutional wrongs plaintiff had alleged.the judge first determined that the legal harm suffered was,essentially,the loss of the opportunity to bid on timber sales,an injury which flowed from the decision to close fdr,to withdraw the horse creek timber sale,and other restrictions put in place by the hpp.the judge concluded that this injury could not be redressed because,even if the hpp were declared constitutionally invalid,the forest service would still be under no obligation to sell any timber from the area of consultation.the judge cited mount evans madigan,cir wyoming lujan,cir ash creek mining lujan,cir and baca king,cir.
the district judge then considered plaintiff claim that the forest service had violated its own regulations and the national forest management act nfma in adopting the hpp by means of amendment to the forest management plan.after concluding that the plaintiff had established standing to advance that claim,the judge ruled against the plaintiff on the merits.the gist of the district court ruling on this claim is that the procedural protections which plaintiff had invoked were not,in fact,required because amendment was not a significant alteration of the forest management plan 
we review de novo the district court determination that plaintiff lacked standing to pursue its first amendment claims.see hackford babbitt,cir.
t he irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements.first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of third,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
lujan defenders of wildlife,d internal citations omitted.the burden is on the plaintiff,as the party asserting jurisdiction,to establish these elements.id.at.further,each element must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof,with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.id.
the district court held that plaintiff had met its burden at the pleading stage of showing an injury in fact because plaintiff had pleaded that it had lost the right to bid on timber contracts as a result of the adoption of the hpp.the complaint also alleges that this deprivation of opportunity was a constitutional injury because it was based on the service decision to manage medicine mountain as a sacred site in violation of the first amendment establishment clause.plaintiff asserts on appeal that the district court was correct in this determination but that the court erred in rejecting plaintiff argument that it also was injured because it was directly affected by the management of medicine mountain as a sacred site we address this latter point first.
plaintiff contends that it has standing to complain of the alleged violation of the establishment of the alleged loss of opportunity to bid on timber sales,which is discussed it is directly affected by the service adoption of the hpp,representing the decision to manage medicine mountain as a sacred site.plaintiff relies on abington school dist.schempp,d,and its progeny,including two cases from this court,robinson city of edmond,cir,and foremaster city of george,cir.
the forest service,in its brief,expresses doubt as to whether a corporation can sustain a injury under the establishment clause.whatever the answer to that question may be,we conclude that this plaintiff has not alleged such an injury.in its attempt to explain how it has been directly affected,plaintiff repeatedly refers to the alleged restrictions on timber cutting which it says will follow from the hpp.plaintiff asserts that it is directly affected by the loss of the right to have federal land classified consistently with the establishment clause and the loss of the opportunity to bid for timber contracts.opening brief at.similarly,plaintiff says that it directed its complaint against the decision of the forest service to close acres to timber harvesting as a result of the adoption of the hpp.id.at.elsewhere,plaintiff very similarly asserts that the lost opportunity to bid demonstrates that wyoming sawmills is directly affected by the hpp and therefore has standing.reply brief at.
we discern no allegation of cognizable injury separate from the alleged loss of opportunity for profitable logging.plaintiff invocation of such religious symbolism cases as foremaster is unpersuasive.as an artificial person,plaintiff has not shown how it experienced the kind of constitutional injury that has been found in such cases.instead,its arguments repeatedly refer to and rely on the alleged economic injury.we therefore conclude that plaintiff claim for standing must turn on the alleged economic injury of the loss of opportunity for logging,to which we now turn.
we consider here the question whether plaintiff has suffered an economic injury.the district judge held that the loss of the opportunity to bid on future timber sales was an injury in fact sufficient to satisfy the first prong of the standing analysis and that the injury was caused by the defendant conduct.on appeal,the forest service argues,as an alternative ground for affirming the judgment below,that plaintiff has not pleaded an injury in fact.we have previously observed that each of the three standing elements blends into the others,ash creek mining lujan,cir,and we think that the district judge can not be faulted for his holding that the plaintiff attempt to establish standing faltered at the third requirement rather than the first.in previous cases we have applied the standing analysis in this manner,and the district judge faithfully applied our precedents.
in ash creek the plaintiff was a coal mining company which desired to bid for leases in an area under federal control.the secretary of the interior had decided to remove the tract from competitive coal leasing so that the tract could be used in a property exchange.the plaintiff attempt to prevent the exchange had previously been rejected on the basis that there was no final agency action.the exchange was effected and the plaintiff again brought a legal challenge.we held that the loss of the possibility of obtaining a federal lease for coal mining was an injury not redressable by a favorable decision and so did not give the plaintiff standing to object to the exchange of lands.at.indeed,we considered the issue so clear cut that we noted detailed discussion was not necessary.id.see also wyoming lujan,cir.
in mount evans madigan,cir,we similarly held that plaintiffs who merely hoped to obtain a contractual benefit,but who had no entitlement to the benefit,lacked standing because their injuries are not redressable by a favorable decision.plaintiffs in that case had previously held the right to operate the crest house on top of mount evans,a facility that provided food and souvenir sales,among other services.the crest house had been destroyed by fire,and the forest service had decided not to rebuild on the summit.plaintiffs filed suit to challenge that decision.they argued that a decision in their favor would require the service to rebuild,which would give them the opportunity to compete for the concession contract.citing ash creek,we rejected this argument,noting that even if a new facility were to be built as plaintiffs desired,there was no guarantee that plaintiffs would be the successful bidder for the concession contract and that no court could order the service to awar
