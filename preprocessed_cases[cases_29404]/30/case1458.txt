in the,scientists discovered that certain chemicals can destroy the layer of ozone gas in the stratosphere approximately ten to miles above the earth surface.stratospheric ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation as the ozone layer thins,less radiation is absorbed.increased human exposure to ultraviolet radiation is linked to a range of ailments,including skin cancer and cataracts.
amidst growing international concern about ozone depletion,the united states and other nations entered into the montreal protocol.the protocol requires signatory now number reduce and eliminate their production and use of chemicals in accordance with timetables.montreal protocol arts.the senate ratified the treaty in,and congress incorporated its terms into domestic law through the clean air act amendments of,tit.vi,stat.since then,the united states has reduced its use of methyl bromide to less than of its baseline.
in,the parties adjusted the protocol to require parties to cease production and consumption of methyl bromide by.see montreal protocol art.in response,congress amended the clean air act to require epa to promulgate rules for reductions in,and terminate the production,importation,and consumption of,methyl bromide under a schedule that is in accordance with,but not more stringent than,the phaseout schedule of the montreal protocol treaty as in effect on october.h.
methyl bromide is a naturally occurring gas produced by oceans,grass and forest fires,and volcanoes.dep t of,agric.research,soil physics pesticide research methyl bromide.usda.gov research docs.htm docid.it is also and used as a pesticide.see final rule.at.methyl bromide is typically injected into soil as a fumigant before several types of crops are planted.the united states regulates methyl bromide as a class i substance.see h.methyl bromide has an ozone depletion potential odp of.this puts it in the middle range of substances scheduled for elimination under the protocol.it is not nearly as destructive as chlorofluorocarbons and most other class i substances,almost all of which were phased out in.b.on the other hand,it is significantly more destructive than class ii substances,which are to be phased out in.see b.
in light of methyl bromide wide use and the lack of comparable substitute pesticides,see final rule.at,the protocol allows exemptions from the general ban to the extent that the parties decide to permit the level of production or consumption that is necessary to satisfy uses agreed by them to be critical uses.montreal protocol art.see also d to the extent consistent with the montreal protocol,the epa administrator may exempt the production,importation,and consumption of methyl bromide for critical uses.the parties to the protocol meet annually to decide to permit the level of production or consumption that is necessary to satisfy uses agreed by them to be critical uses.montreal protocol art.at one of these meetings the parties set general guidelines for implementing the exemptions,see ninth report,supra note,at decision,and at another the parties approved exemptions for.the united states formally began the process of establishing its exemptions in may,when epa published a notice in the federal register seeking applications for and critical uses of methyl bromide and the amounts of new production and consumption needed to satisfy those uses.see protection of stratospheric ozone process for exempting critical uses from the phaseout of methyl bromide.may.epa teams composed of biologists and economists reviewed each application and decided which to include in the aggregate nomination to the parties.the final nomination,submitted to the montreal protocol administrative body the ozone secretariat in february,requested a total exemption of about metric tons of methyl bromide for sixteen different uses.
the process then moved to the international stage.two working groups operating under the auspices of the ozone methyl bromide technical options committee and the technology and economic assessment panel evaluated each country nomination and made a recommendation to the parties at their november meeting.at that meeting,the parties deadlocked over the proposed exemptions and called an extraordinary meeting to make the final decisions.see env t programme,report of the fifteenth meeting of the parties to the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer,doc.pro,at.
the parties reached agreement at their first extraordinary meeting in march.they granted the united states critical uses in sixteen categories,amounting to metric tons of methyl bromide.to satisfy these critical uses,the parties authorized metric tons of new production and consumption,with the remainder metric tons to be made up from existing stocks of methyl bromide.see env t programme,report of the first extraordinary meeting of the parties to the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer,doc,at,decision.decision noted that each party which has an agreed critical use should ensure that the criteria in paragraph of decision are applied when authorizing the use of methyl bromide and that such procedures take into account available stocks.id.
with decision in hand,epa proposed rules to implement the exemption.see protection of stratospheric ozone process for exempting critical uses from the phaseout of methyl bromide.many parties,including nrdc,submitted comments.the final rule,issued in december,authorized new production and consumption up to the limit established in decision.final rule.at tbl.it also authorized the use of stocks as permitted by the decision,id.at,tbl,and permitted noncritical users to draw upon existing stocks,id.at 
nrdc believes the final rule violated decision and decision because epa failed to disclose the full amount of existing stocks,failed to offset new production and consumption by the full amount of these stocks,and failed to reserve the stocks for critical uses,and because the total amount of methyl bromide critical use the final rule authorized is not the technically and economically feasible minimum these claims depend upon the legal status of decisions and.
after oral argument,we ordered supplemental briefing to address the question whether consensus decisions of the parties are cognizable in federal court actions brought to enforce the protocol and the relevant terms of the clean air act.epa and nrdc agree that the decisions are not adjustments to the protocol.but they disagree on the legal consequences of the decisions.
in order for this court to have article iii jurisdiction,nrdc had to establish that at least one of its members has standing to sue in his own right,the interests the association seeks to protect are germane to its purpose,and individual members need not participate in the lawsuit themselves.sierra club epa,citing hunt.state apple adver.comm n,d.we have no reason to doubt that nrdc meets the second and third requirements.as to the first,nrdc had to demonstrate that at least one member satisfied the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing,causation,and redressability.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.
nrdc claimed that its members faced increased health risks from epa rule.although this claim does not fit comfortably within the supreme court description of what constitutes an injury in fact sufficient to confer injuries must be actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical,whitmore arkansas,d quoting city of los angeles lyons,d we have recognized that increases in risk can at times be injuries in fact sufficient to confer standing.see mountain states legal found.glickman.environmental and health injuries often are purely probabilistic.see nrdc i,at,devine,cir.we have cautioned that this category of injury may be too expansive.w ere all purely speculative increased risks deemed injurious,the entire requirement of actual or imminent injury would be rendered moot,because all hypothesized,nonimminent injuries could be dressed up as increased risk of future injury.ctr.for law educ.dep t of.we therefore generally require that petitioners demonstrate a substantial probability that they will be injured.see sierra club,at,am.petroleum inst.epa.envtl.action network epa.mountain states legal foundation glickman,which found that an increased risk of forest fire created by a forest service logging rule was enough to support standing,held that the relevant variations in risk must be,at,and sufficient to take a suit out of the category of the hypothetical,id.at quoting vill.of elk grove vill.evans,cir.
nrdc expert quantified the increased risk posed by epa rule in an affidavit stating that it is reasonable to expect more than deaths,more than nonfatal skin cancer cases,and more than cataract cases to result from the million pounds of new production and consumption allowed by the exemption rule.aff.of sasha madronich.intervenor methyl bromide industry panel argued that the probability of injury to nrdc members is too small.in nrdc i,we found the annualized risk posed to nrdc members to be trivial.at.the parties vigorously dispute whether we were correct to hold as a quantitative matter that nrdc alleged injury was trivial or whether,in nrdc words,any scientifically demonstrable increase in the threat of death or serious illness,pet.for reh g or reh g en banc,is sufficient for standing.this question has given rise to a conflict among the circuits.compare baur veneman,cir cent.delta water agency united states,cir friends of the earth,gaston copper recycling,cir en banc,with shain veneman,cir baur,at pooler,dissenting.on reconsideration,we have determined that the question is one we do not have to answer in this case.epa expert,who built the quantitative model on which both sides rely,now informs us that e xpressing the risk in annualized terms is not practical and it is more appropriate to express the risk as a population cumulative or lifetime risk.decl.of reva rubenstein.the lifetime risk that an individual will develop nonfatal skin cancer as a result of epa rule is about in by the intervenor lights,see aff.of louis anthony cox,or in by epa,decl.of reva rubenstein.even if a quantitative approach is issue on which we express no risk is sufficient to support standing.one may infer from the statistical analysis that two to four of nrdc nearly half a million members will develop cancer as a result of the rule.
as to causation,nrdc asserted injuries are linked to epa action through a fairly straightforward chain epa has permitted too much new production and consumption of methyl bromide,which will result in more emissions,which will increase ozone depletion,which will adversely affect the health of nrdc members.this injury can be redressed if epa does not permit such excessive production and consumption of methyl bromide.
on the merits,nrdc argues that epa rule violates the express terms of the montreal protocol parties unanimous decisions,final opening br.for pet r,and therefore is not in accordance with law.d a see allied local reg l mfrs.caucus epa.
decision,in which the parties reached agreement on methyl bromide exemptions for,stated that the united states had a critical need for metric tons of methyl bromide.id.annex.to meet this need,the parties agreed to allow new production and consumption in the amount of metric tons,id.annex,with the remaining critical uses to be met by drawing down existing stocks.id.the decision also stated that each party which has an agreed critical use should ensure that the criteria in paragraph of decision are applied when implementing the exemption,and that such procedures take into account available stocks.id.emphasis added.paragraph of decision directs the parties to authorize new production and consumption of methyl bromide only if it is not available in sufficient quantity and quality from existing stocks,decision b ii,and only after a ll technically and economically feasible steps have been taken to minimize the critical use,id.b i.
nrdc believes epa rule departs from these agreements in three respects.first,the rule authorizes metric tons of new production and maximum agreed upon in decision offsetting this amount by existing stocks.see final rule.at.epa declined to disclose the size of the total nationwide methyl bromide stockpile,see id.at action nrdc claims is itself a violation of the clean air act,d b i.still,the record suggests that the stockpile is at least as large as the united states total allocation for.second,epa rule allows noncritical users to draw down existing stocks.see final rule.at.nrdc claims that the decisions implicitly reserve the stocks for critical users only.third,epa approved metric tons of critical the maximum agreed upon in decision considering anew whether this was the minimum amount feasible.id.at.epa counters that it adhered to the and new production and consumption levels,and that the remainder of the decisions are hortatory.id.at.
nrdc fashions the entirety of its argument around the proposition that the decisions under the protocol are law.this premise is flawed.the decisions of the side agreements reached by consensus among not law within the meaning of the clean air act and are not enforceable in federal court.
the clean air act authorizes epa to exempt the production,importation,and consumption of methyl bromide for critical uses only t o the extent consistent with the montreal protocol.d see also id.b the protocol bans the production or consumption of methyl bromide after december,except to the extent that the parties decide to permit the level of production or consumption that is necessary to satisfy uses agreed by them to be critical uses.montreal protocol art.nrdc argues that because the clean air act requires epa to abide by the protocol,and because the protocol authorizes future agreements concerning the scope of the exemption,those future agreements must define the scope of epa clean air act authority.supp.br.for pet r.
nrdc interpretation raises significant constitutional problems.if the decisions are law enforceable in federal court like statutes or legislative congress either has delegated lawmaking authority to an international body or authorized amendments to a treaty without presidential signature or senate ratification,in violation of article ii of the constitution.the supreme court has not determined whether decisions of an international body created by treaty are judicially enforceable.but there is a close analogy in this court.the united states is a party to a treaty establishing the international court of justice icj.in committee of united states citizens living in nicaragua reagan,we held that rulings of the icj do not provide substantive legal standards for reviewing agency actions,id.at,because the rulings,though authorized by the ratified treaty,were not themselves treaties.id.at see,medellin dretke,d,dissenting.
although committee of united states citizens is highly suggestive of the outcome in this case,several features of the montreal protocol decisions may distinguish them from icj adjudications.for one thing,congress implemented the montreal protocol with a direction to epa to abide by its terms.see d,b.for another,montreal protocol decisions are not adjudications between parties instead,they purport to set rules for implementing ongoing treaty commitments.
the legal status of decisions of this sort appears to be a question of first impression.there is significant debate over the constitutionality of assigning lawmaking functions to international bodies.see,julian ku,the delegation of federal power to international organizations new problems with old solutions.edward swaine,the constitutionality of international delegations,colum.a holding that the parties side agreements were law would raise serious constitutional questions in light of the nondelegation doctrine,numerous constitutional procedural requirements for making law,and the separation of powers.
we need not confront the serious likelihood that the statute will be held unconstitutional.united states,d see also id.at.scalia,dissenting.it is far more plausible to interpret the clean air act and montreal protocol as creating an ongoing international political commitment rather than a delegation of lawmaking authority to annual meetings of the parties.mistretta united states,d.
nowhere does the protocol suggest that the parties consensus agreements about how to implement the exemption are binding in domestic courts.the only pertinent language in article states that the parties will decide to permit production and consumption necessary to satisfy those uses that they agree to be critical uses.the protocol is silent on any specific conditions accompanying the exemption.agreements setting these conditions are not the protocol.
to illustrate,suppose the president signed and the senate ratified a treaty with germany and france to conserve fossil fuel.how this is to be accomplished the treaty does not specify.in a later meeting of representatives of the signatory countries at the united nations,a consensus is reached to lower the speed limits on all major highways of the signatory nations to a maximum of miles per hour.no one would say that united states law has thus been made.
epa characterizes the decisions as subsequent consensus agreements of the parties that address the interpretation and application of the critical use provision final rule.at.this may be so.like any interpretive tool,however,the decisions are useful only to the extent they shed light on ambiguous terms in the protocol.but the details of the exemption are not ambiguous.they are nonexistent.the decisions do not interpret treaty language.they fill in treaty gaps.
article thus constitutes an agreement to agree.the parties agree in the protocol to reach an agreement concerning the types of uses for which new production and consumption will be permitted,and the amounts that will be permitted.agreements to agree are usually not enforceable in contract.see richard lord,williston on contracts,at ed el al israel airlines,tsui yuan tseng,d zicherman korean air lines,d foster neilson,pet.a treaty is in its nature a contract between nations.and the fruits of those agreements are enforceable only to the extent that they themselves are contracts.there is no doubt that the decisions are not treaties.
the parties actions suggest their common understanding that the decisions are international political commitments rather than judicially enforceable domestic law.see olympic airways husain,d tseng,at.restatement third of foreign relations law of the united states any subsequent practice between the parties in the application of the agreement is to be taken into account in its interpretation.the parties met to decide the exemptions well after epa rule went into effect.see second extraordinary report,supra note.yet they did not invoke the protocol internal noncompliance procedure against the united states,see montreal protocol,nor did they admonish the united states to change its interpretation of the previous decisions this course of dealing suggests that the parties intended the side agreements to be enforceable as a political matter at the negotiating table.
our holding in this case in no way diminishes the power of the executive to enter into international agreements that constrain its own behavior within the confines of statutory and treaty law.the executive has the power to implement ongoing collective endeavors with other countries.see louis henkin,foreign affairs and the united states constitution ed.without congressional action,however,side agreements reached after a treaty has been ratified are not the law of the land they are enforceable not through the federal courts,but through international negotiations.
nrdc claims that epa violated the clean air act when it failed to disclose the amount of existing domestic stockpiled methyl bromide.see d b i.in doing so,epa merely followed its own regulation that precluded disclosure of the information pending the resolution of reverse foia litigation.see f.nrdc own foia request for the aggregate stockpile information was denied on this basis.see nrdc leavitt,wl.epa actions were in accordance with law and neither arbitrary nor capricious.
because we now conclude that nrdc has standing to pursue its claim,we grant the petition for rehearing and withdraw our prior opinion.because the agreements of the parties are not law,epa if inconsistent with those not in violation of any domestic law within the meaning of the clean air act,d a,the petition for review is denied.
so ordered.
i agree that increases in risk can be injuries in fact sufficient to confer article iii standing,and i concur in the judgment that the risk demonstrated by petitioners in this case is sufficient to support standing.
i also agree that,on the merits,petitioners claim fails.as the majority opinion notes,nrdc principal argument is that epa rule violates the express terms of the montreal protocol parties unanimous decisions,final opening br.for pet r at,and therefore is not in accordance with law,d a.in rejecting this claim,our holding is precise and limited 
the decisions of the side agreements reached by consensus among not law within the meaning of the clean air act and are not enforceable in federal court.
on the record before us,this holding is eminently correct for two reasons.first,n owhere does the protocol suggest that the parties consensus agreements about how to implement the exemption are binding in domestic courts.op.at.second,and,in my view,most important,the disputed decisions do not shed light on any ambiguous terms in the protocol 
t he details of the exemption are not ambiguous.they are nonexistent.the decisions do not interpret treaty language.they fill in treaty gaps.
article thus constitutes an agreement to agree.and the fruits of those agreements are enforceable only to the extent that they themselves are contracts.there is no doubt that the decisions are not treaties.
op.at.as i see it,these two points control our disposition of petitioners claim on the merits.
absent procedural defaults,the supreme court has indicated that we should give respectful consideration to the interpretation of an international treaty rendered by an international court with jurisdiction to interpret such.breard greene,d per curiam.as the majority opinion makes clear,however,the disputed decisions in this case do not involve interpretations of a treaty by an international court with jurisdiction to interpret such.
the supreme court has yet to explain whether,once the united states undertakes a substantive obligation as it did in the vienna convention,and at the same time undertakes to abide by the result of a specified dispute resolution process as it did by submitting to the international court of justice jurisdiction,it is bound by the rules generated by that process no less than it is by the treaty that is the source of the substantive obligation.medellin dretke,d,dissenting.in other words,it is unclear whether a judgment by a body such as the icj,decided on the back of a treaty,must be given effect in our domestic legal system just as the treaty itself must be.id.the bewildering array of views found in the per curiam,concurring,and dissenting opinions filed in medellin make it clear that the court has not yet come to grips with this issue.nor do we.
the majority opinion should not be taken to suggest that this court decision in committee of united states citizens living in nicaragua reagan,offers an answe
