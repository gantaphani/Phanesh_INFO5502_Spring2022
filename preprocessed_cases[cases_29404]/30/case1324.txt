this case is about a provision of the clean water act that obligates the states to develop pollution limits for waters that are not meeting applicable quality standards.these limits known as tmdls are submitted to the environmental protection agency epa,and the epa must approve or disapprove them.in their complaints,plaintiffs alleged that oklahoma has never submitted tmdls for the epa to review,that this complete failure constitutes a constructive submission of no tmdls,and that the epa has a mandatory duty to approve or disapprove the constructive submission.
the epa produced uncontradicted evidence that oklahoma has in fact submitted and the epa has approved a small number of tmdls and has a schedule to develop many more tmdls over the next twelve years.although plaintiffs dispute the adequacy of the approved tmdls,we hold that in these circumstances a theory does not apply.
because plaintiffs complaints did not attack the epa approval of the allegedly inadequate tmdls,they may not now proceed on that theory.in addition,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiffs motion to amend their complaint well into this litigation to add this new theory.finally,we hold that plaintiffs waived their right to challenge the district court exclusion of their expert affidavit because they failed to raise this objection to the magistrate judge report.we therefore affirm the district court rulings.
background 
among other provisions,the clean water act,requires the states to implement programs that protect the quality of intrastate waters.id.each state first establishes,subject to epa approval and ongoing review,water quality standards designated uses for a body of water and water quality criteria based on such uses.id.a c.oklahoma water quality standards are not at issue in this case.
the state must then identify the waters within its boundaries for which the other regulatory requirements are not stringent enough to implement an applicable water quality standard.d a.the state must rank its impaired waterbodies by priority,taking into account the severity of the pollution and the uses to be made of such waters.id.
for each impaired waterbody,in accordance with its priority ranking,the state must establish a total maximum daily load tmdl for certain pollutants identified by the epa.id.d c.a tmdl establishes the maximum daily discharge of pollutants into a waterway.scott city of hammond,cir the lists of impaired waterbodies and tmdls are subject to epa approval 
each state shall submit to the administrator from time to time,with the first such submission not later than one hundred and eighty days after the administrator first identifies those pollutants suitable for tmdl measurement,for his approval the waters identified impaired waterbodies and the loads tmdls established the administrator shall either approve or disapprove such identification and load not later than thirty days after the date of submission.if the administrator approves such identification and load,such state shall incorporate them into its current continuing planning process.if the administrator disapproves such identification and load,he shall not later than thirty days after the date of such disapproval identify such waters in such state and establish such loads for such waters as he determines necessary to implement the water quality standards applicable to such waters and upon such identification and establishment the state shall incorporate them into its current plan 
d.the first submission was due in june,and between and,submissions were due biennially,on april of years,d 
plaintiffs are individuals who use oklahoma waters and groups that advocate protecting water quality in the state.in their separate but virtually identical complaints,they alleged that oklahoma had identified over impaired waterbodies,but that in the eighteen years between when the first submission to the epa was due and when the complaints were filed the state had failed to develop tmdls for the impaired waterbodies.this failure,they alleged,was so deficient as to constitute a constructive submittal of no tmdls,which in turn triggers the epa mandatory duty to develop the tmdls itself within thirty days.
the complaints focused primarily on the clean water act provision,which confers jurisdiction on the district courts over civil actions brought by any citizen on his own behalf against the administrator where there is alleged a failure of the administrator to perform any act or duty under the clean water act which is not discretionary with the administrator.a.the complaints also alleged that the epa failure to develop tmdls in the face of oklahoma constructive submission of no tmdls constitutes an arbitrary and capricious action and an abuse of discretion under the administrative procedures act apa.
on the epa motion to dismiss,the district court accepted plaintiffs theory that a complete failure to submit tmdls could constitute a constructive submission of no tmdls,triggering a mandatory duty of the epa.the court therefore found that plaintiffs had stated a claim under the clean water act provision and under the apa to compel agency action unlawfully withheld.it found,however,that plaintiffs had not stated a claim under apa to compel agency action unreasonably delayed or a to set aside agency action as arbitrary,capricious,or abuse of discretion,as plaintiffs had neither identified any final agency action nor had plaintiffs petitioned the epa to act.
the parties agree that oklahoma submitted no tmdls before it is undisputed,however,that before this lawsuit was filed in december the epa had approved at least a small number somewhere between three and of tmdls for impaired waterbodies,although plaintiffs argue that none of these met all the statutory and regulatory requirements for a tmdl.the epa presented uncontroverted evidence to the district court that in oklahoma established a schedule to complete more than tmdls by.although oklahoma did not fully meet its first interim deadline in,it has adjusted the schedule and still expects to finish by.
given this undisputed evidence,a magistrate judge recommended granting the epa motions for summary judgment and to strike an expert affidavit plaintiffs had submitted.plaintiffs objected to the recommendation and sought leave to amend their complaint to add apa claims against the epa approval of the allegedly inadequate tmdls.the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and denied the motion to amend the complaint.plaintiffs now appeal from all of the orders.

clean water act claim 
the district court accepted plaintiffs constructive submission theory,which was first established in scott city of hammond,cir per curiam.under scott,if a state fails over a long period of time to submit proposed tmdl,this prolonged failure may amount to the constructive submission by that state of no tmdl.at.neither party challenges this ruling by the district court,and we agree with scott to this extent a state may at least theoretically act in such a way that it conveys to the epa the message that it has affirmatively determined not to submit tmdls for its impaired waterbodies.such conduct could be treated by a court as a submission a constructive submission of no tmdls.as a submission,it would then trigger the epa nondiscretionary duty under d to approve or disapprove the submission of no tmdls within thirty days.if the epa fails to respond within this period,it is subject to suit under the provision of the clean water act to compel it to perform this nondiscretionary duty.
in scott,the states had submitted no tmdls,and this was
