opinion of the court 
this appeal challenges the grant of summary judgment to one defendant,tennessee gas pipeline tenneco,in an action seeking contribution toward environmental cleanup costs.these costs have been or will be incurred by morton international,morton in regard to the superfund site in wood ridge,new jersey the site or plant.morton and three other plaintiffs,who are not parties to this appeal,sought contribution under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of cercla,et,the new jersey spill compensation and control act spill act,et,and common law.
morton argues that tenneco should be responsible,under the arranged for provision of cercla section a,for some of the cleanup costs because it arranged for the processing of mercury at the facility for many years,resulting in the release of hazardous waste into the environment.because we agree with morton that material factual issues remain with respect to whether tenneco owned or possessed prime virgin mercury,had knowledge of the environmental hazards of mercury processing at the plant,had control over the hazardous waste disposal practices at the plant,and shipped its own dirty mercury to the plant,we will remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the parties dispute many of the facts central to this appeal,but the following facts are undisputed.from to,a mercury processing plant was operated at the site.the plant was the largest domestic producer of intermediate inorganic mercury compounds,including red and yellow oxides of mercury rom and yom.the compounds were formulated,at least in part,using prime virgin mercury pvm.in addition,the plant cleaned mercury that had been contaminated dirty mercury and then converted it into intermediate compounds for some of its customers.the plant released harmful waste into the environment for decades.
the plant was owned by berk company from to.it was transferred to wood ridge chemical corporation its parent company is velsicol chemical corporation in,and then again to ventron corporation in.the plant was closed in.sometime thereafter,ventron merged into thiokol,which then merged into,which eventually became morton.
the parties agree that tenneco purchased rom and yom from the plant from until the early.the parties disagree,however,as to the nature of the transactions between tenneco and the plant,tenneco knowledge of waste disposal by the plant,and whether tenneco shipped dirty mercury to the plant for processing.
prior litigation 
in the,the new jersey department of environmental protection commenced an action against ventron,velsicol,and other parties for cleanup and removal of mercury at the site.eventually,velsicol and morton were held strictly liable,jointly and severally,for the cleanup of the site,and that judgment was upheld following numerous appeals and successive litigation.see morton international,general acc.ins.of america,concluding that morton predecessors had intentionally discharged pollutants over a long period of time state department of environmental protection ventron,finding defendants violated statute prohibiting the discharge of detrimental material into waters by intentionally permitting effluent to escape onto lands surrounding creek.after the enactment of cercla in,and the listing of the site on the national priorities list,morton,as the current owner of the site,velsicol,and various other entities were required to perform a remedial study for the site.since then,morton has been funding the environmental efforts under various judicial orders.
c.the present litigation 
morton filed this action in seeking contribution from tenneco and numerous other defendants under cercla,et,the resource conservation and recovery act rcra,stat,as amended et,the spill act,et,and common law morton argues that the conversion or toll agreements,whereby the plant processed the customers pvm into rom and yom,and the dirty mercury processing agreements render the subject to cercla liability as arrangers under section a,a.morton is trying to recover from other allegedly responsible parties some of the costs it has incurred and will continue to incur to clean up the site.
tenneco and the other defendants refuse to share responsibility for the cleanup costs.the defendants argue that morton characterization of the pvm transactions is inaccurate these transactions were nothing more than straight purchases of finished products rom and yom,which do not expose them to cercla liability.on april,tenneco and the other defendants moved for summary judgment in an omnibus motion.the district court denied their motion with respect to the cercla,spill act,and common law claims because of the varying,complex fact patterns and material factual disputes with respect to each defendant.the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss morton rcra claim 
several months later,tenneco filed a renewed motion for summary judgment this time on its own behalf.morton responded by incorporating by reference the briefings and evidence it had submitted in response to the omnibus summary judgment motion.after hearing oral argument on tenneco individual motion,the district court ruled from the bench and granted summary judgment to tenneco on all claims.
ii.jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction over morton federal claims pursuant to and.the district court exercised pendent jurisdiction over morton state law claim pursuant to.we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal from the final order of the district court pursuant to 
iii.analysis 
the district court has asked us to definitively address the standard for arranger liability under cercla section a in this circuit in order to properly resolve morton contribution claims against tenneco and the other defendants in this case 
cercla arranger liability standard 
congress enacted cercla in in response to the serious environmental and health risks posed by industrial pollution.united states bestfoods,d citation omitted.
as its name implies,cercla is a comprehensive statute that grants the president broad power to command government agencies and private parties to clean up hazardous waste sites.sections and provide the framework for federal abatement and enforcement actions that the president,the epa as his delegated agent,or the attorney general initiates.these actions typically require private parties to incur substantial costs in removing hazardous wastes and responding to hazardous conditions.section sets forth the scope of the liabilities that may be imposed on private parties and the defenses that they may assert.
key tronic united states,d.in,congress amended cercla with the superfund amendments and reauthorization act sara and included a provision section that expressly created a cause of action for contribution.see f.a principal goal of section was to clarif y and confirm the right of a person held jointly and severally liable under cercla to seek contribution from other potentially liable parties,when the person believes that it has assumed a share of the cleanup or cost that may be greater than its equitable share under the circumstances.new castle county halliburton nus,cir quoting.i,at,reprinted in,conf,at,reprinted in.
accordingly,cercla and sara together create two legal actions by which parties that have incurred costs associated with cleanups can recover some or all of those costs section cost recovery actions and section contribution actions.section,the cause of action morton is pursuing against tenneco,provides that a ny person may seek contribution from any other person who is liable or potentially liable under section,during or following any civil action under section f.
section defines those who are potentially responsible persons prp as the current owner or operator of a facility any person who owned or operated the facility at the time of the disposal of any hazardous substances any person who by contract,agreement,or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such person,by any other party at any facility and any person who accepts or accepted hazardous substances for transport to sites selected by such person,from which there is a release,or a threatened release which causes the incurrence of response costs a.
congress did not define the term arranged for in the statute.thus,our interpretation of the term begins with the plain meaning.to repeat,section a holds responsible those who by contract,agreement,or otherwise arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances.the verb arrange is defined as relevant to its usage in this section as to make preparations for.see webster third new international dictionary.the dictionary definition of arrange does not shed much light on the proper scope of liability under this section.however,by including or otherwise after by contract or agreement,congress expanded the means by which a party could possibly arrange for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances in defining this category of prp.we think that this expansive list of means indicates that congress intended this category of prp to be broadly construed.
our view that arranged for is to be broadly construed is consistent with congress overall purpose in enacting cercla.two of the main purposes of cercla are prompt cleanup of hazardous waste sites and imposition of all cleanup costs on the responsible party.general electric litton.auto,cir,cert.denied,d,abrogated on other grounds,key tronic,at.in enacting cercla,congress intended that those actually responsible for any damage,environmental harm,or injury from chemical poisons may be tagged with the cost of their actions.bestfoods,at.quotations and citations omitted.the remedy that congress felt it needed in cercla is sweeping everyone who is potentially responsible for contamination may be forced to contribute to the costs of cleanup.pennsylvania union gas,d plurality op.of brennan,emphasis in original,overruled on other grounds,seminole tribe of florida florida,d see also joint water auth.tonolli,cir.accordingly,we interpret the term arranger liability broadly in keeping with the plain meaning of section a and the remedial statutory scheme of cercla.
almost all of our sister circuit courts have adopted a standard for arranger liability,but the standards adopted vary.see geraghty and miller,conoco,cir,cert.denied,d freeman glaxo wellcome,cir pneumo abex high point,thomasville and denton,cir united states products,cir south florida water management district montalvo,cir amcast industrial corporation detrex,cir beazer materials,cir united states aceto agricultural chems,cir.
our review of these decisions leads us to conclude that the courts are virtually unanimous with respect to two points.first,the determination of arranger liability is a inquiry that requires a analysis.second,courts must look beyond the defendant characterization of the transaction at issue in order to determine whether the transaction,in fact,involves an arrangement for the disposal or treatment of a hazardous substance.we absolutely agree with both of these points.
however,there is not as much agreement among our sister circuits as to which factors must be considered or what priority they should receive in conducting the arranger liability analysis.in fact,some courts require a showing of intent to dispose of or treat hazardous substances,see,at in the absence of a contract or agreement,a court must look to the totality of the circumstances,including any affirmative acts to dispose,to determine whether the defendants intended to enter into an arrangement for disposal a party can be responsible for arranging for disposal,even when it has no control over the process leading to the release of substances.amcast,at arranged for impl ies intentional action.while others require only a demonstration of control ownership over the hazardous substances that are being disposed of or treated.see,aceto,at rejecting reading of section a that requires proof that defendant intended to dispose of a waste,and focusing on defendant ownership of raw materials and control over formulation process.
there has been some disagreement,too,as to whether ownership or control over the material being processed is the more critical factor in the arranger liability analysis.united states hercules,cir implying that ownership without control would suffice and stating that c ontrol is not a necessary factor and,at liability based on ownership without control with united states shell oil,cir proof of ownership not required because actual control is the crucial element.
after carefully examining the language of the statute and considering the standards adopted by other courts,we conclude that the most important factors in determining arranger liability are ownership or possession and knowledge or control.ownership or possession of the hazardous substance must be demonstrated,but this factor alone will not suffice to establish liability.a plaintiff must also demonstrate either control over the process that results in a release of hazardous waste or knowledge that such a release will occur during the process we note,too,that in conducting this analysis a court should not lose sight of the ultimate purpose of section,which is to determine whether a defendant was sufficiently responsible for contamination so that it can fairly be forced to contribute to the costs of cleanup.
we believe that ownership or possession,knowledge,and control are the most critical factors in this analysis for the following reasons.first,proof of ownership,or at least possession,of the hazardous substance is required by the plain language of the statute.see a any person who arranged for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such person emphasis added.this required factor is the starting point in determining arranger liability because,of course,with ownership comes responsibility.see aceto,at imposing arranger liability upon defendant that owned hazardous substance throughout formulation process because finding otherwise would allow defendants to simply close their eyes to the method of disposal of their hazardous substances.
as we said above,though,we do not think that proof of ownership or possession alone is a sufficient basis upon which to ground arranger liability.a rule stating that this factor alone would suffice could broaden the sweep of section a beyond the bounds of fairness.if,for example,a defendant arranges for a plant to treat a hazardous substance that it owns or possesses,but has absolutely no control over the processing and no knowledge or even reason to know that the processing will result in the release of hazardous waste,it would be unfair to require that defendant to contribute to the cost of cleanup.imposing liability on the defendant under those circumstances would go beyond congress intent to require those actually responsible for any damage,environmental harm,or injury from chemical poisons to share in the cost of cleanup.bestfoods,at.citations omitted.
second,proof of a defendant knowledge that hazardous waste can or will be released in the course of the process it has arranged for,provides a good reason to hold a defendant responsible because such proof demonstrates that the defendant knowingly if not personally contributed to the contamination.thus,general knowledge that waste disposal is an inherent or inevitable part of the process arranged for by the defendant may suffice to establish liability.see aceto,at.this factor can be satisfied by proof of either actual knowledge,a provision in an agreement estimating the amount of environmentally harmful spillage inherent in the processing of the defendant materials,or presumed knowledge,the defendant is familiar with industry custom,which is that the processing of the particular material normally results in the release of harmful wastes.see products,at concluding that intent need not be proven by direct evidence,but can be inferred from the totality of the circumstances when evaluating arranger liability montalvo,at indicating that inference that defendants had knowledge that arranged for activity would entail spilling of pesticides and draining of contaminated rinse water would expose defendants to arranger liability 
and third,proof that the defendant had control over the process could establish that the defendant was responsible for the resulting release of hazardous wastes.shell oil,at,suggesting that actual control rather than simply authority to control must be shown general aamco,cir implying that obligation to exercise control alone satisfies arranger liability standard.in many instances,proof of control could also create an inference that the defendant had knowledge that the process resulted in the release of hazardous wastes.accordingly,we see these two factors as somewhat interrelated.
in sum,we conclude that the analysis of arranger liability under section a should focus on these principal factors ownership or possession of a material by the defendant and the defendant knowledge that the processing of that material can or will result in the release of hazardous waste or the defendant control over the production process.a plaintiff is required to demonstrate ownership or possession,but liability can not be imposed on that basis alone.a plaintiff is also required to demonstrate either knowledge or control.we identify these principal factors to establish the for analysis of arranger liability in this circuit.it is certainly possible that other factors could be relevant to this analysis in a given case,and we encourage consideration of those as well.
disputed material facts with respect to morton cercla claims 
tenneco concedes that mercury is a hazardous substance and that there was a release from the plant which has caused morton to incur response costs.morton asserts that tenneco is liable because of two different types of transactions those involving pvm and those involving dirty mercury both of which comprise an arrangement for the disposal of a hazardous substance under section a.the district court found,however,that there was insufficient evidence supporting morton claims to survive tenneco summary judgment motion.we will review each of morton claims under the arranger liability standard articulated above to determine if the district court correctly granted judgment to tenneco.
our standard of review applicable to an order granting summary judgment is plenary.see curley klem,cir.we apply the same test employed by the district court under federal rule of civil procedure c.see kelley tyk refractories,cir.accordingly,the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of tenneco was proper only if it appears that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that tenneco is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in evaluating the evidence,we take the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,morton,and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.doe county of centre,pa,cir citation omitted.
pvm transactions 
morton alleges that tenneco engaged in two types of toll or conversion transactions with the plant involving pvm,both of which comprise arrangements for the disposal of hazardous substances owned by tenneco under section a.basically,morton contends that tenneco purchased the pvm either from the plant or some other supplier and then paid a fee to the plant for the conversion of the pvm into rom or yom.in either case,morton argues,tenneco owned the pvm throughout the conversion process,and was aware that the conversion process inevitably resulted in the release of hazardous waste.
ownership or possession 
the district court addressed the issue of ownership or possession,and found that the record evidence shows that tenneco did not own or possess the pvm that was processed at the plant.app.at.the court based its finding on two conclusions.first,the court reasoned that whether tenneco purchased the pvm through a broker or from the plant directly,the ownership alleged by morton was a bookkeeping function done solely for the purpose of minimizing the plant financial risk in the volatile mercury market.and second,the court determined that there was not a showing that tenneco was the necessary source of the pvm,or that tenneco was a manufacturer of pvm.id.at.
we will look first at the district court conclusion that the toll or conversion transactions used by the plant were solely for the purpose of minimizing the plant financial risk in the volatile mercury market.one problem with this conclusion is that it is an inference drawn in favor of tenneco rather than morton,the party opposing the motion.another problem is that the conclusion inappropriately resolves a material factual dispute.
citing the plant brochure and the deposition testimony of several former plant managers,morton explains that the plant customers,including tenneco,had the option of supplying their own pvm and storing it in the plant vault or purchasing it directly from the plant.if the customer chose the first option,the plant would charge for the processing of the pvm into rom or yom and for insuring the mercury while it was stored at the plant,but the customer owned the mercury at the beginning,middle,and end of the process.morton brief at citing app.at.in fact,one plant manager testified that when customers supplied pvm for processing,the customers continued to hold title to it while it was at the plant.id.citing app.at.morton asserts that tenneco was a major conversion customer from at least to,and that it supplied significant amounts of pvm to the plant for processing.morton brief at citing,inter alia,numerous weekly physical inventories and weekly customer ownership reports documenting the number of pounds of mercury stored at the plant and converted into rom and yom.
to be sure,tenneco disputes morton contention that it owned the pvm throughout the process.tenneco contends that the plant used certain billing methods which look like conversion or toll agreements to protect itself from the price volatility of the mercury market and the associated financial risk tenneco brief at.tenneco also asserts that the pvm it allegedly owned was never segregated or labeled as belonging to it at any point in the process.id.at citing app.at.in fact,tenneco maintains that the pvm was not the actual mercury used to manufacture that customer rom and yom because mercury is homogeneous instead the mercury was added to the plant inventory,like money in a bank.id.at citing app.at.thus,tenneco ownership of the pvm that was converted at the plant on tenneco behalf is very much in dispute.morton has submitted evidence,including plant records and the testimony of former plant managers,from which it is fair to infer that tenneco owned the pvm regardless of whether it purchased it from the plant or a third party throughout the conversion process.proof of ownership,of course,is one of the principal factors in the arranger liability analysis.therefore,this evidence is sufficient to withstand tenneco motion for summary judgment 
although the district court did not directly address the knowledge factor,it discussed evidence that is relevant.the court referred to a memorandum from the united states environmental protection agency epa cited by morton and concluded that the reference therein to tenneco disposal of mercury was just not enough evidence to survive a motion for summary judgment.app.at.
before we discuss the other evidence related to knowledge that was submitted by morton,we will address tenneco argument that the epa memorandum should not be considered because it is not part of the record.morton counsel read a portion of the epa memorandum during the summary judgment oral argument,but neglected to move its admission into the record.id.at.prior to filing its appellate brief,morton moved the district court to supplement the record with,among other things,the epa memorandum.the motion was denied,and morton has not appealed that decision.because the memorandum is not included in the certified record,even after morton motion to supplement the record,tenneco argues that we should not consider it at all.tenneco argues,too,that morton counsel did not provide a copy of the document to either the district court or opposing counsel.morton asserts,however,that tenneco produced this document during discovery.and,because counsel read the relevant portions of the memorandum into the record during oral argument without objection from tenneco and because the district court referred to the memorandum in her ruling,the memorandum is part of the record.
according to federal rule of appellate procedure a,the record on appeal is comprised of the original papers and exhibits filed in the district court the transcript of the proceedings and a certified copy of the docket entries.this definition not only includes items admitted into evidence,but also includes items presented to the district court and not admitted into evidence.waldorf shuta,cir citation omitted.
here,it is undisputed that the epa memorandum was never included in the record in its entirety.given that the memorandum does not appear to have been presented to the district court,we will not review it in its entirety which is not possible as a practical matter in any event because the document was not included in the appendices.see waldorf,at the basic purpose behind the rule is to prevent parties from supplementing the record on appeal with items never presented to the district court.the next question is whether we can appropriately consider the portion of the memorandum that was read by morton counsel during oral argument and which is found in the transcript.because we conclude that morton presented evidence other than the portion of the epa memorandum to establish tenneco knowledge,and because we think that evidence created disputed facts,we do not need to decide whether it is appropriate for us to consider the memorandum on appeal.we leave it to the district court to evaluate the admissibility of the document on remand.
as we just mentioned,morton presented evidence other than the epa memorandum to establish tenneco knowledge that the release of hazardous waste was an inherent and inevitable aspect of mercury processing.specifically,morton maintains that tenneco was knowledgeable about mercury processing because it used rom and yom to manufacture products at its own facilities,and because it had produced mercury oxide at its elizabeth facility in the past.morton brief at,citing app.at.morton contends that tenneco must have been aware of the environmental risks inherent in mercury processing because the hazards of handling and processing mercury were well known within the industry generally,and because substantial mercury loss,as well as known losses in dust and vapor,were an inherent part of manufacturing mercury intermediates,and that those losses were closely monitored by the plant and its customers who provided the mercury.id.at,citing app.at.
tenneco does not dispute that it used rom and yom to manufacture its own products at its elizabeth facility or that it produced mercury oxide at the same facility in the past.tenneco brief at.instead,tenneco accuses morton of improperly relying on general facts about the plant relationship with its customers rather than facts specific to the plant relationship with tenneco in attempting to prove tenneco knowledge that waste was released during mercury processing.
we think it is fair to infer from tenneco involvement with mercury oxides at its own facility that tenneco had some knowledge about the environmental hazards of mercury processing.we also think it is fair to rely on evidence provided by morton about the plant customers generally.while morton did not present evidence showing that tenneco,specifically,was monitoring the mercury losses during processing at the plant,it was not required to do so in order to survive tenneco motion for summary judgment.after all,tenneco was undisputably one of the plant customers,and it is thus reasonable to infer absent proof to the contrary that it had the same kind of relationship with the plant as did the other customers.whether a jury would ultimately be persuaded by this evidence is uncertain,but that is not the standard we apply in evaluating a summary judgment motion.accordingly,we believe that there are disputed facts with respect to tenneco knowledge of hazardous waste releases during the processing of pvm at the plant.because knowledge is one of the principal factors in the arranger liability analysis,this evidence is sufficient to withstand tenneco motion for summary judgment.
the district court did not directly discuss this factor.but,related to control,the court observed that it would not have mattered if tenneco had shipped pvm directly to the plant on a regular basis because it is what happened at the plant and tenneco involvement with respect to what happened at the plant that important.app.at.we disagree with the court suggestion that proof that tenneco shipped pvm directly to the plan would have been irrelevant.such proof could demonstrate tenneco ownership,or at least possession,of the pvm.more importantly,though,the parties dispute tenneco level of control over what happened at the plant.
morton states that customers such as tenneco played a key role in shaping the plant production processes and its resulting emissions by approving a new process for mercury oxide manufacturing in the late.morton brief at citing app.at.morton argues that the customer approval of the production process amounted to some control over the production process.tenneco,however,disputes morton assertion that it had any control over the plant operations or disposal practices.tenneco brief at citing app.at.
again,morton evidence about the customers generally is relevant tenneco was undisputably a customer of the plant.whether this evidence alone is sufficient to establish control is another matter.because we are remanding this case to be analyzed under the standard articulated above,we suggest that the district court consider this evidence in the subsequent proceedings.
useful product defense 
the district court characterized the pvm transactions as sales transactions and referred to the useful product defense discussed in pneumo abex high point,thomasville and denton,cir.app.at.tenneco argued below,and continues to argue on appeal,that this defense applies because the transactions at issue were nothing more than a sale of a useful product pvm and a purchase of finished products rom and yom.we believe that there are disputed facts with respect to the critical elements of this defense.
in pneumo abex,the court concluded that treatment of hazardous substances as used in cercla refers to a party arranging for the processing of discarded hazardous substances or processing resulting in the discard of hazardous substances.at.accordingly,the sale of valuable materials to a processor alone does not satisfy the requirements for arranger liability.see glaxo wellcome,at solvent chemical,d at.
we agree with tenneco that the sale of pvm alone or the purchase of rom and yom alone without evidence of ownership or possession,knowledge,and control would not be sufficient grounds on which to impose arranger liability.those transactions would either not meet the standard we have articulated or would fall within the useful product defense.it would be inappropriate at this stage in the proceedings,however,to conclude that the transactions between tenneco and the plant were nothing more than a sale of pvm or the purchase of rom and yom because of the factual disputes we have described with respect to the key elements of ownership or possession,knowledge,and control.
dirty mercury transactions 
morton asserts that tenneco shipped its own dirty mercury to the plant for processing into usable mercury,a transaction which clearly qualifies tenneco for arranger liability.morton brief at.morton contends that it submitted evidence sufficient to survive summary judgment on this claim.tenneco argues that morton did not present this claim to the district court at all.
it is true that morton did not include the dirty mercury allegation in its statement of contested facts for the pretrial order.at.as a general matter,the pretrial order will control the subsequent course of the action unless modified by a subsequent order.e.moreover,the finality of the pretrial order contributes substantially to the orderly and efficient trial of a case.petree victor fluid power,cir.
