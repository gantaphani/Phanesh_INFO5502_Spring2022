introduction 
in november,california voters approved proposition,an initiative that enacted the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of,now set forth in health and safety code section et.proposition a key provision of proposition is its mandate that the governor publish a list of chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity,subd.a.this list is to be revised and republished in light of additional knowledge at least once per year ibid.and is commonly referred to as the proposition list.
this case concerns the methods by which the list can be updated,and specifically whether the office of environmental health hazard assessment oehha can add chemicals to the list by use of a methodology set forth in subdivision a of section.the california chamber of commerce calchamber contends this listing method is no longer operable and applied only to the creation of the initial proposition list.it asserts further changes to the list must be made using one of the three methods set forth in subdivision b of section.the trial court concluded the language of section is unambiguous and the listing method set forth in subdivision a remains operable.while we do not agree the statutory language is,in all respects,unambiguous,we agree the proposition list not only can,but must be,updated by the method used here by the oehha and set forth in subdivision a of section.we therefore affirm the judgment.
ii.background 
proposition 
proposition imposes two significant requirements on businesses.first,it prohibits businesses from discharging into drinking water sources any chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity the discharge prohibition.second,it requires businesses to provide a public warning if they knowingly and intentionally expose any individual to a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity the warning requirement.the warning requirement applies to any exposure,and thus includes exposures in the workplace,service and retail,and recreational environments.health,tit.a business that violates the discharge prohibition or warning requirement can be sued in a public or private enforcement action and is subject to injunctive relief and civil penalties,subds.a,b.
the discharge prohibition and warning requirement are triggered by the inclusion of a chemical on the proposition list of chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.thus,the methods by which a chemical is placed on the list are among the pivotal features of proposition.
section addresses the content of the proposition list,and does so principally in two subdivisions.subdivision a provides on or before march,the governor shall cause to be published a list of those chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity within the meaning of this chapter,and he shall cause such list to be revised and republished in light of additional knowledge at least once per year thereafter.such list shall include at a minimum those substances identified by reference in labor code section b and those substances identified additionally by reference in labor code section d the labor code reference method,subd.a.
subdivision b provides a chemical is known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity within the meaning of this chapter if in the opinion of the state qualified experts it has been clearly shown through scientifically valid testing according to generally accepted principles to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity the expert review method,or if a body considered to be authoritative by such experts has formally identified it as causing cancer or reproductive toxicity the authoritative body method,or if an agency of the state or federal government has formally required it to be labeled or identified as causing cancer or reproductive toxicity the formally required to be labeled method,subd.b.
this lawsuit primarily concerns whether the labor code reference method set forth in subdivision a continues to be a method by which chemicals are listed,or whether this method provided the content of only the initial proposition list.calchamber advocates the latter and asserts the three methods provided by subdivision b the expert review,authoritative body,and formally required to be labeled methods are the means by which chemicals can now be added to the list.
labor code section,subdivisions b and d 
the labor code reference method set forth in subdivision a of section,provides in pertinent part such list shall include at a minimum those substances identified by reference in labor code section b and those substances identified additionally by reference in labor code section d,subd.a.
labor code section is part of the hazardous substances information and training act hsita,et and sets forth criteria for the preparation and amendment of a list of hazardous substances in the workplace,known as the hsita list.the legislative findings supporting the enactment of hsita included that exposure to hazardous substances in the workplace posed serious health hazards to employees and the right and need to know about these hazards were necessary to reduce the incidence and cost of occupational disease,subd.a.accordingly,one of hsita primary purposes is to ensure the transmission of necessary information to employees regarding the properties and potential hazards of hazardous substances in the workplace,subd.b.
subdivision a of labor code section states any substance identified in any source listed in subdivision b is presumed to be potentially hazardous,subd.a.labor code section,subdivision b expressly referenced in proposition labor code reference method,subd.a identifies s ubstances listed as human or animal carcinogens by the international agency for research on cancer iarc,subd.b.
subdivision d of labor code section also expressly referenced in proposition labor code reference method,subd.a states in addition to those substances on the director list of hazardous substances,any substance within the scope of the federal hazard communication standard is a hazardous substance subject to this chapter,subd.d.
thus,proposition labor code reference method embraces s ubstances listed as human or animal carcinogens by the iarc,subd.b and any substance within the scope of the federal hazard communication standard,subd.d.
c.the federal hazard communication standard 
the federal hazard communication standard hcs referenced in labor code section,subdivision d,was created in,pursuant to title united states code section.that federal statute authorized the department of labor,through the occupational safety and health administration osha,to promulgate a final occupational safety and health standard entitled hazard communication.
the purpose of the hcs is to ensure that the hazards of all chemicals produced or imported are evaluated,and that information concerning their hazards is transmitted to employers and employees.a.this information is transmitted by means of comprehensive hazard communication programs which include,among other things,container labeling and other forms of warning.ibid.
health hazards under the federal hcs include more than chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity included in the proposition list,but do include carcinogens and reproductive toxins.c.instead of attempting to identify every hazardous chemical by creation of a single list of hazardous substances,the hcs requires manufacturers,importers and employers to evaluate chemicals they produce,import or utilize to determine if the chemicals are hazardous and the particular hazards they pose.d see also,the agency determined that the most comprehensive approach would be to require evaluation of all chemicals,not some list of substances.
two provisions of the hcs,however,require a manufacturer,importer or employer to treat a chemical as hazardous if it is identified as such by certain sources.title code of federal regulations part d provides in pertinent part c hemical manufacturer s,importer s or employer s evaluating chemicals shall treat the following sources as establishing that the chemicals listed in them are hazardous i cfr part,subpart z,toxic and hazardous substances,occupational safety and health administration osha subpart z or,ii threshold limit values for chemical substances and physical agents in the work environment,american conference of governmental industrial hygienists acgih latest edition the acgih list d,italics omitted.subpart d provides those evaluating chemicals shall treat the following sources as establishing the chemical is a carcinogen or potential carcinogen for hazard communication purposes i national toxicology program ntp,annual report on carcinogens latest edition ii iarc monographs latest editions or iii osha subpart z.d.
the sources identified in title code of federal regulations part d and,were adopted as part of the hcs to establish a floor,so that certain chemicals,at a minimum,would be treated as hazardous by all evaluators.
d.the initial proposition list and the deukmejian decision 
on february,oehha published the initial proposition list oehha utilized the labor code reference method set forth in section,subdivision a,but listed only chemicals that had been identified as carcinogens or reproductive toxins based on human epidemiological studies.afl cio deukmejian d.deukmejian.it did not include chemicals identified as carcinogens or reproductive toxins based on animal studies.oehha placed these chemicals on a candidate list,which it referred to the newly appointed state qualified experts panel to evaluate.id.at.
a citizens group sued to require the governor to list chemicals known to be carcinogens or reproductive toxins to animals,as well as to humans.deukmejian,supra,d at.governor deukmejian conceded section imposes a ministerial duty to publish the initial proposition list but asserted he had discretion to choose which chemicals identified by reference to labor code section,subdivisions b and d,should be listed without further scientific review and which should be referred to the panel of qualified experts.deukmejian,at.
the court of appeal disagreed.t he provisions of section,subdivision a,admit of no such discretion.the section uses words classically defined as imposing a mandatory duty such list shall include at a minimum those substances identified by reference in labor code section b and those substances identified additionally by reference in labor code section d.deukmejian,supra,d at.therefore,d efendant had no discretion to exclude from the initial list known carcinogenic and reproductive toxins referred to in labor code section.ibid.
the court recognized,however,the federal hcs referred to in labor code section,subdivision d includes thousands of substances that are not carcinogens or reproductive toxins.deukmejian,supra,d at.therefore,the initial proposition list,and subsequent lists published thereafter,need not include all substances listed under hcs but only known carcinogens and reproductive toxins.ibid.
in rejecting the governor assertion that he had discretion with regard to the listing of chemicals identified pursuant to the labor code reference method,the court also rejected his argument that subdivision b of section sets forth the only methods by which a chemical can be identified as known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.deukmejian,supra,d at.the court stated s ection,subdivision a sets forth the minimum definition of those chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity which is to include the known human and animal carcinogens referred to in the labor code.with regard to the minimum content of the initial list,this mandate is etched in stone.proposition was not intended to produce a list of known carcinogenic chemicals,but rather requires revision of the initial list annually or even more frequently,subd.a.section,subdivision a,insures the minimum content of the initial list,and section,subdivision b,directs both defendant and the panel to engage in a diligent,thorough and continuing search for additional chemicals which evolving scientific knowledge demonstrates are subject to proposition.viewed in this light,the provisions of section,subdivisions a and b are not inconsistent,but complementary.id.at.the methods of identifying chemicals known to the state to cause cancer described in subdivision b are supplemental to subdivision a.id.at.
revisions to the proposition list under subdivision b listing methods 
in accordance with the deukmejian decision,oehha added to the proposition list the content required under subdivision a of section,those chemicals identified by the labor code reference method without regard to whether the chemicals had been identified as human or animal carcinogens or reproductive toxins.
oehha then devoted its resources to revising the proposition list in accordance with the methods set forth in subdivision b of section,the expert review,authoritative body,and formally required to be labeled methods,subd.b.oehha issued publications explaining and describing these as three mechanisms by which carcinogens and reproductive toxins are listed.
the expert review method is the only listing method requiring extensive scientific review and analysis by the state qualified experts.regulations define the term state qualified experts to mean the carcinogen identification committee and the developmental and reproductive toxicant identification committee,both of which are committees of the oehha science advisory board.of,tit,subds.c,t.these two committees advise and assist the governor and director of oehha in the implementation of section by issuing opinions as to whether a chemical has been clearly shown to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity,tit,subds.c,t,subds.a,b.
under the authoritative body method,the expert committees identify bodies they consider to have expertise in the identification of chemicals causing cancer or reproductive toxicity,tit,subd.b.it is then oehha responsibility to determine whether any of the designated authoritative bodies have identified a chemical as causing cancer or reproductive toxicity by including it on a list,in a published report,or other final document,tit,subd.c.oehha must further determine whether the authoritative body relied upon sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity or reproductive toxicity as defined in the regulations or did not consider scientifically valid data,but it does not substitute its scientific judgment for that of the authoritative body.exxon mobil office of environmental health hazard assessment th,d exxon mobil,tit,subds.e g.oehha refers a chemical to the expert committees for evaluation only if it finds no substantial evidence that the authoritative body identification of a chemical as a carcinogen or reproductive toxin meets the regulatory criteria,tit,subd.i.
the formally required to be labeled method involves no independent evaluation by oehha or the expert committees.rather,oehha shall list chemicals if it determines that an agency of the state or federal government has formally required the chemical to be labeled or identified as causing cancer or reproductive toxicity,tit,subd.a.
revisions to the proposition list under the subdivision a listing method 
fifteen years after proposition was enacted,oehha for the first time revised the proposition list pursuant to the labor code reference method set forth in subdivision a of section.in april,oehha notified all interested parties it had sodium saccharin.oehha explained that in,s accharin was identified by iarc and ntp as causing cancer and it therefore had added saccharin to the proposition list as a result of the issuance of a judicial decision deukmejian interpreting and enforcing the labor code reference method.however,further scientific research resulted in a changed assessment.in,iarc published a monograph finding saccharin and its salts not classifiable as to their carcinogenicity to humans and concluding the evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of saccharin acid form is inadequate.in,ntp released its ninth report on carcinogens and removed saccharin from its list of substances reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.oehha therefore removed saccharin sodium from the proposition list and received no objections to its doing so.
two years later,in,oehha gave notice it intended to broaden its original listing of certain nickel compounds to include all nickel compounds based upon a ntp report and a iarc monograph identifying nickel compounds as carcinogens.this time oehha received objections that references to chemicals designated under labor code section b and d defined only the minimum content of the initial proposition list.italics omitted.oehha responded that section,subdivision a,requires the list to always include,at a minimum,those chemicals identified by reference to labor code section,subdivisions b and d.as the substances identified by reference to labor code section,subdivisions b and d change the proposition list must change,in accordance with the requirement of health and safety code section a that the governor revise and republish at least once per year the list of chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.
again in july,and three times in,oehha used the labor code reference method to add several more identified carcinogens in recent iarc monographs or ntp reports.
in february,oehha used the labor code reference method to add areca nut and betel quid without tobacco as known carcinogens based upon a iarc monograph.oehha again received objections that the labor code reference method applied only to the initial proposition list.in december,oehha used the labor code reference method to several chemicals.it received no objections to these actions.
the following year,in june,oehha invoked the labor code reference method in a proposal to list several chemicals as known reproductive toxins.oehha explained health and safety code section a further requires that substances identified in labor code section d as causing reproductive toxicity be included on the proposition list.labor code section d captures any chemicals within the scope of the federal hcs that are identified as reproductive toxicants.chemicals fall within the scope of the hcs if they are listed as hazardous in the latest edition of the acgih threshold limit values tlvs.the tlvs for hexafluoroacetone male endpoint,nitrous oxide developmental endpoint and vinyl cyclohexene dioxide male and female endpoints were assigned on the basis of acgih findings of reproductive effects.effective august,oehha added these three chemicals to the proposition list.
g.the current litigation 
on november,calchamber filed a petition for a writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory relief in the san diego county superior court calchamber alleged oehha had exceeded its authority under section by using the labor code reference method to add chemicals to the proposition list that were not included in the initial proposition list following final judgment in afl cio deukmejian,supra,d calchamber sought a declaration that the mandatory duty to include labor code chemicals set forth in section a applied only to the initial proposition list finalized and required to be published by march,and any future action to automatically add labor code chemicals to the proposition list as carcinogens or reproductive toxicants exceeds oehha authority.calchamber sought a writ of mandate directing oehha to remove any chemicals it had added to any revised proposition list using the labor code reference method,and an order enjoining oehha from adding any more chemicals to the list except pursuant to one of the listing methods set forth in subdivision b of section.
on january,the san diego court granted oehha motion to transfer calchamber action to alameda county and consolidate it with a case that had been filed by the sierra club and other environmental and labor organizations sierra club schwarzenegger,no.for the purpose of trying common issues concerning the interpretation of section 
calchamber and oehha filed for judgment on the pleadings,accompanied by requests for judicial notice.the trial court granted the requests,denied calchamber motion,and ruled in favor of oehha on the issues raised by the.it did not enter judgment,however,but allowed calchamber to file an amended complaint and writ petition challenging the inclusion of chemicals on the acgih list as part of the labor code reference method set forth in subdivision a of section.calchamber and oehha filed further for judgment on the pleadings.the trial court denied calchamber motion,granted oehha motion,and entered judgment against calchamber on all causes of action alleged in its first amended complaint and writ petition.this appeal by calchamber followed 
iii.discussion 
calchamber raises two issues on appeal can oehha use the labor code reference method set forth in health and safety code section,subdivision a,in annually revising and republishing the proposition list and if oehha can do so,do chemicals identified by reference to labor code section,subdivision d,include chemicals identified on the acgih list 
we review these questions of statutory construction de novo bruns e commerce exchange,cal th,d california correctional peace officers state of california th,d.
the principles that guide us in interpreting proposition,and specifically section,are well established.in interpreting a voter initiative,we apply the same principles that govern statutory construction.see horwich superior court cal th,d,horwich.thus,we turn first to the language of the statute,giving the words their ordinary meaning.people birkett cal th,d,birkett.the statutory language must also be construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme in light of the electorate intent.horwich,supra,cal th at.when the language is ambiguous,we refer to other indicia of the voters intent,particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.birkett,supra,cal th at.people rizo cal th,d,robert superior court cal th,d,robert accord,sutter place superior court th,d.in other words,our task is simply to interpret and apply the initiative language so as to effectuate the electorate intent.hi voltage wire works,city of san jose cal th,d,hi voltage conc.dis.opn.of george.robert,supra,cal th at.
a.the labor code reference method continues to provide the minimum content of the proposition list 
the statute is ambiguous 
section,subdivision a,states on or before march,the governor shall cause to be published a list of those chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity within the meaning of this chapter,and he shall cause such list to be revised and republished in light of additional knowledge at least once per year thereafter.such list shall include at a minimum those substances identified by reference in labor code section b and those substances identified additionally by reference in labor code section d,subd.a,italics added.
calchamber contends the term such list refers to the initial proposition list of those chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.it thus reads the second sentence as mandating that the initial list shall include at a minimum those substances identified by reference in labor code section b and those substances identified additionally by reference in labor code section d,subd.a.
calchamber points out the term such list as used in the first sentence of subdivision a clearly refers to the initial list the governor was required to publish on or before march.it also points out the statute,by employing two subdivisions,structurally distinguishes between the labor code reference method set forth by itself in subdivision a,and the expert review,authoritative body,and formally required to be labeled listing methods set forth in subdivision b.calchamber also observes subdivision b begins by stating a chemical is known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity if it is identified as such by any of the three,enumerated listing methods,subd.b,italics added.calchamber therefore contends the three methods enumerated in subdivision b supply the additional knowledge pursuant to which the proposition list is to be revised and republished at least once per year,subd.a.calchamber further observes there can be,and in fact,is,redundancy between the labor code reference method in subdivision a,and the authoritative body method set forth in subdivision b thus,calchamber asserts reading such list to refer to the initial proposition list pays heed to the structure of the statute,fulfills the commitment to a scientifically based list,and avoids redundancies.
this construction is also consistent,calchamber observes,with the statement in deukmejian that section,subdivision a,insures the minimum content of the initial list,and section,subdivision b,directs both defendant and the panel to engage in a diligent,thorough and continuing search for additional chemicals which evolving scientific knowledge demonstrates are subject to proposition.viewed in this light,the provisions of section,subdivisions a and b are not inconsistent,but complementary.deukmejian,supra,d at.the issue in deukmejian,however,concerned the minimum content of the initial list,not the validity of methods by which that list is to be annually updated 
oehha contends there is but a single proposition list,which had to be initially published and must be revised and republished in light of additional knowledge at least once per year thereafter,subd.a.thus,such list,as oehha reads the statutory language,means the proposition list,and the labor code reference method set forth in subdivision a fixes the minimum content of the list in any iteration.the three listing methods set forth in subdivision b,in turn,compliment and augment the labor code reference method.
oehha reading of the statute is consistent with statements in baxter healthcare denton th d.in that case,the court described the proposition listing process as follows at a minimum,the list,which is published by the governor on an annual basis,must include substances identified in labor code section,subd.a.id.at.in addition,a chemical must be listed as known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity if it is so identified pursuant to one of the listing mechanisms set forth in section,subdivision b.ibid.the issue in baxter,however,concerned the procedure for obtaining an exemption once a chemical is listed.the case did not address either the content of the initial list or the listing methods applicable to subsequent revisions.
calchamber and oehha both proffer semantically permissible constructions of the statutory language.accordingly,we conclude the language is ambiguous and turn to other construction aides to resolve the issues before us.see county of san joaquin workers comp.appeals bd.th,d,to say that language is ambiguous is to say there is more than one semantically permissible candidate for application.
the legislative history 
where,as here,a statute enacted through the initiative process is ambiguous,b allot summaries and arguments may be considered when determining the voters intent and understanding of a ballot measure.professional engineers in california government kempton cal th,d,accord,robert,supra,cal th at.
the ballot argument in support of proposition stated in pertinent part our present toxic laws are tough enough.despite them polluters contaminate our drinking water and expose us to extremely toxic chemicals without our knowing it proposition singles out chemicals that are scientifically known to cause cancer or reproductive disorders and tells businesses do put these chemicals into our drinking water supplies proposition also tells businesses do expose us to any of these same chemicals without first giving us a clear warning.we each have a right to know and make our own choices about being exposed to those chemicals proposition new civil offenses focus only on chemicals that are known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive disorders.chemicals that are only suspect are not included.the governor must list these chemicals,after full consideration with the state qualified experts.at a minimum,the governor must include chemicals already listed as known carcinogens by two organizations of the most highly regarded national and international scientists the ntp and the iarc.ballot,argument in favor of.
the arguments against proposition stated in part proposition wo produce useful warnings.it requires warnings on millions of ordinary and safe items.we wo know what products are really dangerous anymore.the warnings we really need will get lost in lots of warnings we do need.ballot,supra,argument against,emphasis omitted.the opposition arguments further stated we have many thoughtful laws relating to toxic pollution on the books.over new laws have been passed in the last two years to control chemicals and toxics.we need to build on the system we have,not abandon it in favor of extreme solutions.the simple scientific fact of the matter is that manmade carcinogens represent only a tiny fraction of the total carcinogens we are exposed to,most of which are natural substances significant amounts of manmade carcinogens are highly regulated in california under the most stringent laws in the united states.this initiative will result in chasing after trivial amounts of manmade carcinogens at enormous cost with minimal benefit to our health.ibid.
responding arguments stated in part proposition simply says that businesses should put chemicals that are scientifically known to cause cancer,or birth defects into your drinking water.and they must warn you before they expose you to such a chemical.proposition is based strictly on scientific testing,more than any existing toxics law.proposition does not apply to insignificant safe amounts of chemicals.ballot,supra,rebuttal to argument against.
calchamber and oehha emphasize varying parts of this history.calchamber points to the arguments asserting proposition focuses only on chemicals that are known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive disorders.chemicals that are only suspect are not included,and assurances that listing is based strictly on scientific testing,more than any existing toxics law.ballot,supra,argument in favor of,rebuttal to argument against.given this emphasis on scientific evaluation and certainty of knowledge,calchamber contends the voters could not have intended that the labor code reference method which excludes the state experts from any role in the process and relies on the conclusions of other entities without review of the evidence even by oehha,let alone the state experts would be anything other than a stopgap method to create the initial list.the listing methods set forth in subdivision b,in contrast,emphasize scientific analysis and utilization of recognized experts.
oehha,in turn,points to the arguments that at a minimum the list must include chemicals listed by the ntp and the iarc.these lists are embraced by the labor code reference method set forth in subdivision a,and it is only that listing method that guarantees the chemicals listed by the ntp and iarc are included on the proposition list.as for the proposition emphasis on scientific evaluation,the ballot arguments characterize the ntp and iarc as two organizations of the most highly regarded national and international scientists.ballot,supra,argument in favor of.
we appreciate that ballot arguments in support of and in opposition to initiative measures are carefully crafted sound bites intended to appeal to voter emotion as well as intellect.we also appreciate there is not always absolute congruence between ballot arguments and the letter of the attendant legislation.nevertheless,in this case,we find the legislative history helpful and conclude the ballot materials more strongly support the construction urged by oehha than by calchamber.
no distinction was made in the ballot materials between an initial proposition list and subsequent,revised lists.rather,the materials simply stated the governor must list these chemicals,the word these referring to chemicals that are known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive disorders.the materials also unequivocally stated a t a minimum,the governor must include on his list chemicals already listed as known carcinogens by the ntp and the iarc.ballot,supra,argument in favor of.these lists by the ntp and iarc,in turn,find their way onto the proposition list by virtue of the labor code reference method set forth in section,subdivision a,subd.a,subds.b,d.the ballot materials also described the ntp and iarc as two organizations of the most highly regarded national and international scientists.ballot,supra,argument in favor of.thus,whether or not the lists prepared by the ntp and iarc are based on the same supposed state of scientific certainty as the proposition list,the ballot materials championed the scientific credentials of these organizations,thereby fulfilling the promised scientific basis for listing.
implementation history 
the implementation history of the proposition list,as we have discussed,is problematic and does not weigh strongly in favor of either calchamber or oehha.for the first years following the enactment of the proposition,oehha indicated changes to the proposition list were to be made by the three methods expert review,authoritative body,and formally required to be labeled methods set forth in subdivision b of section.oehha published documents,for example,described three mechanisms by which carcinogens and reproductive toxins are listed and explained how each worked.the documentation made no mention of the labor code reference method set forth in subdivision a.
for the past decade,however,oehha has used the labor code reference method to make changes to the proposition list.it first used this method in to saccharin,without objection.since then,it has periodically used this method to both list and chemicals.listing has triggered some objections that the labor code reference method applied only to the initial proposition list.has drawn no objections.
other than a vague reference to a pragmatic decision to turn its resources to other listing mechanisms after compiling the initial labor code based minimum list in,oehha has never provided any explanation for not using the labor code reference method to revise the proposition list until.nonetheless,regardless of the reasons for oehha shift in focus,its prior practice did not preclude it from changing course and using the labor code reference method in subdivision a as one of the methods by which it revises and updates the list.see henning industrial welfare com.cal d,an administrative agency may change its interpretation of a statute,rejecting an old construction and adopting a new one.citations.put simply,an administrative agency is not disqualified from changing its mind unless the old construction it chooses to reject has been definitively adopted by a court as its own.
oehha has not enacted regulations pertaining to its current use of the labor code reference method to list and chemicals.accordingly,its use of the method does not carry the interpretive weight that adheres to formal regulations adopted by an agency charged with implementing a statutory scheme culligan water conditioning,state board of equalization cal d,mackey bristol west ins.service of,th,d agency interpretation in informational booklet entitled to less weight than formal regulation.
it is also true that an agency vacillating practice,adopting a new interpretation that contradicts a prior interpretation is entitled to little or no weight.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d.however,oehha never expressly stated the labor code reference method was no longer applicable it simply was silent.see estate of giolitti d.mere failure to act,however,does not constitute a prior inconsistent administrative construction.furthermore,since,oehha has consistently and publicly interpreted the labor code reference method as applying to revisions of the proposition list.it has explained its reasons for doing so in formal responses to public comments on listing notifications,letters to members of the regulated community and in a public proposal for comments on a formal regulation explaining its interpretation of the process of identifying chemicals for listing under this method.
accordingly,oehha practice of using the labor code reference method to revise the proposition list is worthy of some,albeit slight,note.see american meat institute leeman th,fn.d some weight given to agency practice followed for years as stated in policy memorandum and letters written by usda officials despite evidence interpretation had changed over the years yosemite park curry department of motor vehicles d.weight given to agency practice of not collecting certain taxes that was contrary to agency litigation position.
canons of construction 
calchamber contends a reading of section that gives continued life to the labor code reference method set forth in subdivision a violates numerous canons of statutory construction.it points to the canon of construction that identical terms should have the same meaning when used multiple times in a statute.marie riverside county regional park open space dist.cal th,d,california teachers governing bd.of rialto unified school dist.cal th,d.as we have discussed,the term such list in the first sentence of subdivision a of section clearly refers to the list the governor was required to publish on or before march,subd.a.calchamber therefore asserts the second sentence which starts with the directive such list shall include at a minimum those chemicals identified pursuant to the labor code reference method must also refer only to that initial list.ibid.
however,as oehha observes,the term such list even in the first sentence of subdivision a can also be read to mean the proposition list,which the governor was required to publish by march,and which must be revised and republished at least once per year thereafter,subd.a.the term as used in the second sentence can also be read to mean the proposition list.accordingly,the construction supported by the legislative history and the recent implementation history need not result in the term such list having different meanings in the first and second sentences of subdivision a.
calchamber also invokes the rule that a statute must not be construed in a manner that renders some of its provisions superfluous.see deukmejian,supra,d at.as we have discussed,there can be,and there in fact is,some overlap between the labor code reference method set forth in subdivision a of section and the authoritative body method set forth in subdivision b.the labor code reference method,for example,embraces lists prepared by the ntp and iarc,while the authoritative body method includes these two scientific bodies pursuant to designation by the state expert panel.this overlap,however,is not inherent in the statute.while the state expert panel has chosen to include the ntp and iarc within the authoritative body method,there is no requirement that it do so.moreover,the authoritative body method allows for the designation of additional authorities,such as the fda and epa,which are not sources encompassed by the labor code reference method.thus,there is no inherent redundancy within the statute.
calchamber contends ongoing use of the labor code reference method set forth in subdivision a also effectively reads out of the statute the discretion afforded to the governor under subdivision d.subdivision d provides the governor shall identify and consult with the state qualified experts as necessary to carry out his duties under this section,subd.d.this is a limited mandate subdivision d provides the governor shall consult with the state experts only as necessary.since the labor code reference method set forth in subdivision a requires no action by the governor,it does not impinge on the governor conditional obligations under subdivision d.
calchamber additionally invokes the rule of construction discussed in palermo stockton theatres,cal d palermo.this rule provides where a statute adopts by specific reference the provisions of another statute,regulation,or ordinance,such provisions are incorporated in the form in which they exist at the time of the reference and not as subsequently modified id.at.calchamber contends that under this rule,the proposition list was limited to those substances already identified by the sources referenced in subdivisions b and d of labor code section when voters adopted proposition.in other words,calchamber asserts that under palermo,the labor code reference method was frozen in time and only those chemicals included on lists embraced by subdivisions b and d of labor code section at the time proposition was enacted can be listed.
we do not agree palermo requires this result.in palermo,the incorporating statute gave rights to foreign corporations to hold property under any treaty now existing between the united states and japan.palermo,supra,cal d at,italics added.the supreme court held the state statute incorporated rights under the federal treaty as it existed at the time the statute was enacted,and foreign corporations retained those rights under the state law even after the treaty was abrogated.id.at see,people domagalski d.when the canon of specific reference applies,the effect is the same as if the adopted statute had been set out verbatim in the adopting statute,so that repeal or modification of the referenced statute does not affect the incorporating statute.the court also recognized a cognate rule.palermo,at.w here the reference is general instead of specific,such as to a system or body of laws or to the general law relating to the subject in hand,the referring statute takes the law or laws referred to not only in their contemporary form,but also as they may be changed from time to time see also in re jovan cal th,d.
here,the incorporated law analogous to the federal treaty in palermo is labor code section,and specifically subdivisions b and d.accordingly,if the first rule recognized in palermo applies,as calchamber contends,what must be deemed to have been written into proposition is the language of those subdivisions as they existed at the time the proposition was enacted.there is no issue in this regard,however,because the language of labor code section,subdivisions b and d,is the same today as it was when proposition was enacted.stats,ch,stats,ch.in fact,there also has been no change in the relevant language of the federal hcs to which subdivision d of section refers compare ch.xvii c,d.
thus,what calchamber actually urges is that palermo extends beyond the expressly incorporated statutes indeed,beyond even the regulations expressly incorporated by the expressly incorporated statutes to reach the specific substances identified on the lists referenced by labor code section,subdivisions b and d,at the time proposition was enacted.in other words,according to calchamber,what must be deemed to have been written into proposition is not only the language of labor code section,subdivisions b and d,and the language of the the federal hcs,but also all lists of identified substances referenced by these statutory and regulatory provisions.nothing in palermo requires such a burdensome or labyrinthine result.furthermore,unlike in palermo,the incorporating statute here,section,subdivision a,anticipates change,by mandating annual revision and republication of the proposition list,subd.a.
the canons of construction,in any case,are among the aides the courts can employ in reaching a reasoned interpretation of a statute.people traylor cal th,d.they are not to be rotely applied in disregard of other indicia of the intent and purpose of the body which enacted the statutory provision in question.rather,our overarching task is to determine the intent of such body and interpret the statute consistently therewith.a lthough the rules of grammar and the canons of construction are useful tools in divining a statute purpose,the normal principles of statutory interpretation may not,in particular circumstances,disclose a clear legislative intent in such a situation courts must remember that t hose who write statutes seek to solve human problems.fidelity to their aims requires us to approach an interpretive problem not as if it were a purely logical game,like a rubik cube,but as an effort to divine the human intent that underlies the statute.citations.citation.ibid.
purpose of the statutory scheme 
the purposes of proposition are stated in the preamble to the statute,section people ex rel.lungren superior court cal th,d,lungren.the preamble states the people of california find that hazardous chemicals pose a serious potential threat to their health and,that state government agencies have failed to provide them with adequate protection,and that these failures have been serious enough to lead to investigations by federal agencies of the administration of california toxic protection programs.the people therefore declare their rights a to protect themselves and the water they drink against chemicals that cause cancer,birth defects,or other reproductive harm.b to be informed about exposures to chemicals that cause cancer,birth defects,or other reproductive harm.c to secure strict enforcement of the laws controlling hazardous chemicals and deter actions that threaten public health and safety.d to shift the cost of hazardous waste cleanups more onto offenders and less onto taxpayers.the people hereby enact the provisions of this initiative in furtherance of these rights.ballot,supra,preamble.
in light of these findings,proposition is a remedial statute and therefore should be broadly construed to accomplish its protective purposes.lungren,supra,cal th at.
we heed this interpretative admonition in concluding the labor code reference method set forth in subdivision a of section is to be used in revising the proposition list,and the three listing methods set forth in subdivision b are additional means by which changes can be made to the list.this construction ensures the proposition list of chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity always includes at a minimum those substances identified by reference to labor code section,subdivisions b and d,those chemicals that already must be treated as carcinogens or reproductive toxins for the purpose of hsita,et and the federal hcs.the stated concern that state government agencies have failed to provide adequate protection with respect to known carcinogens and reproductive toxins ballot,supra,preamble,is thereby assuaged,and the declared right to be informed about exposures to chemicals that cause cancer,birth defects,or other reproductive harm ibid,broadly secured.
that said,we appreciate calchamber fundamental concern that given the significant costs attendant to listing,several key assurances were made with respect to proposition,including that listing would be based on solid science and the list would include only chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity and not only suspect.in this regard,the saccharine episode is,indeed,cause for pause.listed as a chemical known to the state to cause cancer for years pursuant to the labor code reference method,science ultimately concluded otherwise,and saccharine was.thus,despite the statutory descriptor of the list as including chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity the list,in fact,also includes chemicals only suspected to cause such harms and which,upon further research,may prove to have no such pernicious affect.
however,through the millennium,science has never been static,and what is known is necessarily defined by the state of the art at the time.and while calchamber singles out the labor code reference method set forth in subdivision a as scientifically deficient devoid as it is of any independent analysis by oehha,let alone,the state experts two of the listing methods set forth in subdivision b also include little or no independent review.under the authoritative body method,oehha reviews listings to determine if they are supported by sufficient evidence as defined in the regulations,but does not substitute its scientific judgment for that of the authoritative body.exxon mobil,supra,th at,tit,subds.c,e g.it refers a listed substance to the state experts only if it concludes no substantial evidence supports the authoritative body listing determination,tit,subd.i.the formally required to be labeled method entails no review by oehha or the state experts.oehha must limit a chemical if it determines that an agency of the state or federal government has formally required the chemical to be labeled or identified as causing cancer or reproductive toxicity,subd.a.raccordingly,the absence of independent evaluation by oehha or the state experts does not render the labor code reference method set forth in subdivision a an anomaly within the statutory scheme.
in sum,given the remedial purposes of proposition and the mandate that it be broadly construed,we conclude the labor code reference method set forth in subdivision a of section continues to specify the minimum content of the proposition list as it is revised and republished.
b.the labor code reference method includes reproductive toxins on the acgih list 
calchamber additionally contends that even if the labor code reference method set forth in subdivision a of section specifies the minimum content of all iterations of the proposition list,it should not be construed to reach chemicals identified as reproductive toxins on the current acgih list calchamber observes neither subdivision a of section of the health and safety code,nor subdivisions b and d of labor code section referenced therein,identifies or refers to the acgih list as a source of chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity,subd.a.it therefore claims subdivision a of section is ambiguous as to utilization of the acgih list and asserts this ambiguity should be resolved against its use since the ballot arguments mentioned only lists prepared by the ntp and iarc.such a construction also avoids,according to calchamber,potential dilution of the scientific standards undergirding proposition.
there is no question one must drill down through several layers of statutes and regulations to identify the sources embraced by the labor code reference method.as we have discussed,this listing method embraces substances identified by reference in labor code section b and those substances identified additionally by reference in labor code section d,subd.a.labor code section,subdivision b,expressly refers to s ubstances listed as human or animal carcinogens by the iarc,subd.b.labor code section,subdivision d,does not identify any particular listing source.instead,it refers to any substance within the scope of the federal hcs,subd.d.
however,the fact labor code section,subdivision d,does not expressly refer to any specific listing source s does not give rise to any ambiguity as to use of the acgih list.rather,subdivision d explicit reference to substance s within the scope of the federal hcs provides a clear roadmap as to the listing sources it embraces.
subpart b of title code of federal regulations part generally describes the scope of the hcs requiring the evaluation of hazards and,if hazards are identified,communication of information about them.b.subpart d of title of the code of federal regulations part describes the standards for hazard determination,including providing aides for identifying hazardous substances.d.to that end,as we have discussed,subpart d has two subsections,and.
subpart d deals exclusively with carcinogens and provides that if a chemical is identified as such in any one of three sources,it shall be treated as a carcinogen and information must be transmitted regarding that hazard.the three sources are the ntp annual report on carcinogens latest edition iarc monographs latest edition and osha subpart d.calchamber has no quarrel with oehha reference to these sources to identify carcinogens for inclusion in the proposition list since subpart d deals exclusively with identified carcinogens.
however,subpart d is more general and applies to all hazards,including carcinogens and reproductive toxins.c,d.subpart d requires chemical manufacturers,importers and employers to treat as hazardous chemicals identified by two sources osha subpart z d i and the acgih list d ii.as calchamber points out,proposition does not require the listing of all hazardous substances,but only those known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity,subd.a deukmejian,supra,d at.
it can be readily determined,however,which substances have been identified as reproductive toxins in the acgih list d ii.the list includes a basis column which identifies the particular adverse effect s upon which a listing is based basis for carbaryl is male repro damage,embryo damage.the acgih also provides written summaries,known as documentation,which describe the scientific information and data on which the acgih relied in identifying the basis for listing.accordingly,oehha can as readily identify reproductive toxins on the acgih list referenced by subpart d of the hcs as it can carcinogens on the lists prepared by the three sources identified by subpart d.
calchamber asserts there is nevertheless a latent ambiguity because the federal hcs applies to chemicals used in the workplace b and exempts chemicals in foods,drugs,cosmetics,and consumer products b vi ix.thus,as calchamber sees it,the reference in labor code section,subdivision d,to substance s within the scope of the federal hcs if read literally would mean only workplace chemicals could be included on the proposition list pursuant to labor code section,subdivision d.it contends this would result in an absurdity and therefore the reference to the federal hcs can not be deemed unambiguous and must be interpreted in light of other indicia bearing on the electorate intent.however,the venue limitations of the hcs are immaterial.the proposition list must include substances identified by reference to labor code section,subdivisions b and d,and the statutory and regulatory trail leads plainly to the acgih list.
accordingly,we do not perceive any ambiguity in section,subdivision a,with respect to the inclusion in the proposition list of reproductive toxins identified by the current acgih list.we therefore need not consider other indicia of legislative intent.see lungren deukmejian cal d,if statutory language is unambiguous,it is not necessary to resort to indicia of intent.however,even if we were to do so,we are not persuaded it evinces intent not to incorporate the acgih list.
as we have recited,the ballot materials stated in part at a minimum the governor must include the chemicals already listed as known carcinogens by two organizations of the most highly regarded national and international scientists the ntp and the iarc.calchamber contends failure to mention the acgih reflects an intent that it not be used as a listing source.however,when the ballot materials are considered in light of the express language of the initiative,which was also included in the voter materials,it is more reasonable to read the references to the ntp and iarc as illustrative of the kinds of organizations providing minimum listing content.see santa clara county local transportation authority guardino cal th,d,no inference should be drawn from failure of ballot argument to list all changes initiative would enact because ballot arguments are not legal briefs delaney superior court cal d,the most reasonable inference is that the proponents chose to emphasize in the limited space available for ballot arguments what they perceived as the greatest need.
had the intent been to limit listing sources to the ntp and iarc,the statutory language could easily have been drafted to do so.but it was not.instead,the statute expressly refers to substances identified by reference in labor code b and those substances identified additionally by reference in labor code d,subd.a.as we have explained,subdivision d of labor code section refers expressly to substance s within the scope of the federal hcs,which,in turn,leads directly to title code of federal regulations part d of the hcs,which,in turn,refers to the acgih list.indeed,the ballot materials also make no mention of osha subpart z,which is referenced in both subpart d and of the hcs.d ii.yet,calchamber makes no argument the labor code reference method does not embrace substances identified under that osha provision.
furthermore,when proposition was enacted it was already established that a substance was deemed hazardous under the hcs if it was on the latest edition of the acgih list.d ii.when osha published its statement of reasons for the final version of code federal regulations part date,it explained s ome minimal criteria should be established so that certain chemicals will be regarded uniformly as hazards by all evaluators.to this end,it chose to require manufactures,importers and employers to treat a substance as hazardous if so identified in several sources to which manufacturers already routinely referred to obtain hazard information iarc,ntp and osha subpart z for identification of carcinogens and the acgih list and osha subpart z for all other hazards,which include reproductive toxins.
this established a floor a minimum number of chemicals required to be covered.in any situation,the manufacturer or importer is required to treat chemicals regulated by osha or listed by the acgih on their tlv list as hazardous under the hcs.in addition,any chemical which is listed by the ntp or iarc as a suspected or confirmed carcinogen is also to be treated as a potential carcinogen under this standard,see national of mfrs.occupational safety health,supra,at a chemical must be treated as hazardous if included in the latest edition of the threshold limit values for chemical substances and physical agents in the work environment published by the acgih,and this has been a requirement since title code of federal regulations part was first promulgated in associated builders contractors,brock,adoption of acgih list as a floor,while imposing on chemical manufacturers the requirement that they research and assess hazards independently is consistent with statutory directive to set toxic substance standards based on the best available evidence with due consideration to the latest available scientific data.
in light of this established regulatory history,the reference in section,subdivision a,to labor code section,subdivision d,which,in turn,refers to any substance within the scope of the federal hcs,subd.d,reflects an intent to encompass the floor lists used to establish the minimum uniform criteria for identifying hazards under the hcs,including that prepared by the acgih.
we have already discussed and rejected calchamber contention that the labor code reference method is at odds with the asserted scientific underpinnings of the proposition list.calchamber makes the same argument with respect to interpreting the reference to labor code,subdivision d,as reaching the acgih list.it points out a hazard exists under the federal hcs if there is statistically significant evidence based on at least one study conducted in accordance with established scientific principles that the hazard may occur in exposed employees.c,d.proposition,in contrast,requires listing of chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity,subd.a.nevertheless,section,subdivision a,expressly refers to labor code section,subdivision d,which,in turn,expressly refers to the hcs.thus,by its own terms,section,subdivision a,accepts the hcs standard,and the listing standards it embraces,as sufficient.
in sum,again heeding the remedial purposes of proposition and the mandate that it be broadly construed,we conclude the labor code reference method set forth in section,subdivision a,and specifically its express reference to labor code section,subdivision d,embraces reproductive toxins identified on the current acgih list.
