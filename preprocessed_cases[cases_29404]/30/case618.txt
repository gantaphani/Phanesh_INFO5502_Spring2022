jurisdiction was proper in the district court based upon.jurisdiction is proper in this court based upon.the notice of appeal was timely filed pursuant to fed.a.
background 
the following is a summary of the factual and procedural background,as set forth in the district court order of september.see op.at.
in,tce was detected in water coming from underground wells located near property owned by dico and maintained by the des moines water works.the epa designated the area the des moines tce site and placed it on the national priority list.the des moines tce site was divided into several operable units.operable and operable together are within dico property.each was found to be contaminated with tce,and was also found to be contaminated with herbicides and pesticides.
dico corporate predecessor,had operated a chemical formulation business on the dico property until the.in,pursuant to two unilateral administrative orders issued by the epa,dico conducted two removal actions at.a group of former customers of bp amoco oil plc,bp amoco plc,chevron chemical,bayer,monsanto,and shell oil conducted a third removal action pursuant to an administrative order on consent.the epa also incurred costs associated with the removal actions at.
in,the epa signed a record of decision rod,which confirmed the completion of the three removal actions at.the former customers requested settlement negotiations with the government regarding the costs associated with the cleanup efforts.pursuant to cercla,e,the epa undertook a nonbinding preliminary allocation of responsibility nbar and allocated of the responsibility to dico and to the former customers collectively.in april,the epa formally notified the former customers and dico that they were potentially responsible parties prps and provided them each with copies of the nbar and a proposed consent decree.the prps were also notified that settlement with the government would provide protection from liability in the contribution action brought by dico,arising out of the same remediation.dico did not respond to the letter and did not participate in the settlement negotiations,despite repeated invitations by the government to do so.on november,when an agreement was imminent between the government and the former customers,the government sent dico a reminder that a final consent decree would include contribution liability protection for the settling defendants.
on november,the government filed the present action in the district court and simultaneously lodged the proposed consent decree,as signed by the government and the former customers hereinafter referred to as the settling defendants.as required by cercla,d,the consent decree was published in the federal register,in response to which dico submitted objections and comments.dico also moved in the district court to intervene in the present action and to consolidate it with the contribution action,which it had filed against the settling defendants in.the district court granted dico motion to intervene,but deferred ruling on dico motion to consolidate the two actions.
on march,the government formally moved to enter the consent decree.dico requested an evidentiary hearing on the government motion to enter the consent decree,arguing that a hearing was necessary because the government had failed to provide a fair and complete record and it had a vested property interest in the contribution action,which,under the fifth amendment,could not be taken without due process,an evidentiary hearing and just compensation.
upon review of the parties submissions,the district court entered the order from which dico now appeals.the district court denied dico request for an evidentiary hearing,reasoning that a hearing was not necessary to supplement the record because dico had been provided sufficient opportunities to supplement the record before and after the consent decree had been lodged in the district court.see op.at.the district court also rejected dico assertion of a constitutional right to an evidentiary hearing,reasoning that dico never had a right to contribution because its statutory contribution claim was at all times limited by f a person who has resolved its liability to the united states or a state in an administrative or judicially approved settlement shall not be liable for claims for contribution regarding matters addressed in the settlement.see id.at.next,the district court granted the government motion to enter the consent decree.upon careful consideration of the parties arguments and the record before it,the district court concluded that the consent decree had resulted from a fair process,that it was substantively fair,and that it was reasonable and consistent with cercla.see id.at.the district court then denied as moot dico motion to consolidate the contribution action with the action at bar.see id.at.
judgment was entered accordingly,and dico appealed.both the government and the settling defendants oppose dico appeal.
discussion 
denial of dico motion for an evidentiary hearing 
dico first argues that the district court improperly denied its motion for an evidentiary hearing.dico contends that the administrative record was incomplete,biased,and inaccurate,and that an evidentiary hearing was the only meaningful way for dico to rebut the government evidence.dico asserts,among other things,that the district court erroneously relied on the settlement process as a basis for concluding that dico had been given an opportunity to supplement the record.on the contrary,dico argues,the settlement process offered nothing more than an opportunity for dico to bargain away its contribution rights.dico also points out that it was notified of the potential settlement between the government and the settling defendants only after dico had already invested approximately million in response costs and in litigation costs.therefore,dico argues,its refusal to participate in the settlement negotiations was justified.dico further maintains that a hearing was necessary to examine the evidentiary basis for a sworn statement by daniel shiel,an epa attorney,whose statement was submitted by the government in support of its motion for entry of the consent decree.shiel statement hereinafter the shiel declaration purported to explain,among other things,the government methodology in assigning and of the responsibility to dico and the settling defendants,respectively,using eight specific factors according to dico,the shiel declaration was the government primary evidence in support of the epa liability allocation,the shiel declaration did not include or identify supporting documentation,and dico was entitled to examine shiel under oath regarding the bases for his assertions.likewise,dico contends,the government allegations of costs were not adequately supported by the evidence in the record and therefore should have been subjected to e
