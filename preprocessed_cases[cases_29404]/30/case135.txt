ernest brod,robert demarco,beverly peterson,and residents concerned about omya collectively,the plaintiffs or rco,appeal from a judgment entered september,in the united states district court for the district of vermont niedermeier,vacating so much of a summary judgment as held omya,and omya industries,collectively,omya liable for creating an imminent and substantial endangerment within the meaning of the resource conservation and recovery act of,stat.october,codified at rcra.liability was predicated upon a finding that aminoethylethanolamine aeea was present in omya waste.following a remedy hearing held after the entry of summary judgment,the district court determined that,based on,inter alia,subsequent testing and expert testimony presented at the remedy hearing,the potential harm posed by aeea did not in fact constitute a serious endangerment,and thus no remedy was warranted and granted omya motion to dismiss all claims related to aeea because plaintiffs had failed to satisfy the citizen suit notice requirements of rcra.in an opinion and order,dated july,the district court dismissed rco open dumping claim,the court having found that arsenic was not present at a level high enough to subject omya to liability under rcra.in its complaint,which raised two claims,rco alleged that omya waste disposal practices violated rcra.rco first claimed that omya was creating an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health and the environment by permitting its waste to seep into the groundwater,thereby contaminating water sources with aeea.rco also claimed that omya was operating an unlawful open dump because omya solid waste allegedly contained an amount of arsenic above the permitted level established by the environmental protection agency epa.on appeal,rco claims that the district court erred by concluding that omya disposal of aeea did not create an imminent and substantial endangerment erred by granting omya motion to dismiss all claims related to aeea,the district court having held that rco failed to satisfy rcra citizen suit notice requirements erred in finding that omya disposal of solid waste did not violate rcra prohibition on open dumping and abused its discretion by denying rco request to present expert testimony on arsenic contamination and area toxicity.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
background 
omya operates a calcium carbonate mineral processing facility the plant in florence,vermont.it imports raw marble ore,primarily from three quarries in vermont,and then processes the ore by crushing,purifying,and refining it into finished products,including fine ground calcium carbonate.to begin the purification process,omya adds the crushed ore and a flotation reagent to tanks filled with water the flotation reagent then binds to impurities in the ore.much of the flotation mixture floats to the top of the tank and is removed by skimming it off,apparently leaving the pure ore at the bottom of the tank.the mixture is then piped to settling cells.there,the residual solids settle to the bottom of the cells,and the water from the top of the cells is piped back to the plant for.the solids that remain are known as tailings and are comprised of water,mineral impurities,and flotation reagent.omya disposes of the tailings into unlined,exhausted quarries,or tailings management areas tmas,located near the plant.the tmas are in direct contact with fractured bedrock,which permits contaminants from the tailings to seep into the groundwater that flows through the adjacent bedrock.
the plaintiffs are concerned about the environmental and human health effects of omya disposal of its tailings.in particular,plaintiffs point to the negative impact that the tailings may have on the public water supply wells in florence,vermont,and on the streams,ponds,and wetlands adjacent to the tmas.in,the individual plaintiffs formed rco to advocate for regulation and remediation of omya waste disposal practices.rco took action on november,by serving a notice of violation of rcra and intent to file a citizen enforcement suit noi on the epa administrator,the vermont department of environmental conservation,the vermont agency of natural resources vanr,and omya,as required by the citizen suit notice provisions of rcra.see b.rco claimed that omya violated rcra prohibition on unlawful open dumping of solid waste,in violation of,and that omya disposal practices presented an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health and the environment,in violation of.the noi listed chemicals allegedly contained in the waste from omya plant and claimed that there have been reports that the waste piles may contain other hazardous substances dumped there in the past.it also alleged that the wastes are contaminated with numerous chemicals,including hazardous chemicals listed under subchapter iii of rcra,as well as pesticides registered under the federal insecticide,fungicide and rodenticide act.
when neither the epa nor the vanr commenced a civil or criminal action against omya within days,rco filed an action in the united states district court for the district of vermont the complaint contained the same allegations that rco had set forth in its noi namely,that omya was in violation of rcra prohibition on open dumping and that omya disposal practices posed an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.
several months after the action had been filed,omya sought a solid waste disposal certification from the state of vermont for its practice of disposing of tailings in its tmas.while the certification process was ongoing,the state legislature enacted a law requiring that the certification be conditioned in part on omya first financing and completing a study of the effects of its disposal practices on human health and the environment.omya responded by hiring consultants to conduct the study and to produce a report the report,a process that ultimately took several years to complete.
in the interim,the parties began to engage in extensive motions practice,including filing motions for summary judgment.pursuant to a stipulation,discovery was delayed until all motions with the court had been resolved.the district court issued its first substantial ruling in june,when,inter alia,it denied omya motion for summary judgment as to both the open dumping and endangerment claims and denied rco motion for partial summary judgment on its open dumping claim.following the issuance of the court order,rco retained an expert,james smith,who opined that arsenic would be found in solution in the groundwater under the site.subsequently,rco hired a consultant to obtain samples of groundwater from properties in the vicinity of the plant and from directly underneath the plant.the results of this sampling confirmed that arsenic was present in omya waste and that it had been released into the groundwater underneath the plant at levels ranging from parts per billion ppb.
after obtaining the sampling results,rco filed a second motion for partial summary judgment.rco argued that the sampling results showed that omya had violated,which prohibits waste disposal practices that contaminate underground drinking water sources with specific substances in excess of specific thresholds.because was promulgated under,which is rcra prohibition of open dumping,a violation of is a violation of.see road assocs.int l bus.machines,cir explaining that the open dumping regulations operate as independent prohibitions of rcra.appendix to the open dumping regulations sets a maximum contaminant level mcl of ppb for arsenic in groundwater.see,app.rco also noted that the safe drinking water act sdwa sets forth an mcl for arsenic at a level of ppb for community water systems.recognizing that the permitted level of ppb for arsenic in groundwater exceeded the ppb of arsenic actually measured,rco contended that the mcl of ppb stated in appendix i was outdated.it argued that appendix i makes reference to,and its values are intended to mirror,the mcls set forth in the sdwa.since the sdwa mcl for arsenic in community water systems had been recently updated by the epa to a maximum permitted level of ppb,rco argued that omya was in violation of the open dumping prohibition by releasing arsenic at measured levels of ppb.
on september,omya responded by filing a for summary judgment on the open dumping claim.in opposition to rco proposition that the epa had intended to update the mcl for arsenic,omya argued that the open dumping regulations expressly reference appendix i and the standards set forth therein.it further contended that i t is pure speculation to suggest that,if and when epa updates appendix i,epa will incorporate the new ppb arsenic standard.
in october,while the second motions for summary judgment were pending,a preliminary report commissioned by omya was released,followed several months later by the publication of the final report,on february.the report concluded that the groundwater at the plant contained elevated levels of iron,manganese,arsenic,and aeea.the report noted that two separate tests had detected small amounts of aeea between and ppb in spring water,which was traced to the omya plant.it further explained that aeea is a potent cause of a specific and rare birth defect in laboratory rats and,at sufficiently high exposures,might cause such a defect in human fetuses as well.however,tests of drinking water wells did not find any contaminants traced to the plant,and the report concluded that there was no immediate danger to drinking water from omya operations.the report did,however,recommend expanded monitoring and testing of the groundwater and springs in the area.after examining the report,rco became aware that aeea was among the chemicals being released by omya tailings and concluded that the levels of aeea that had been detected both could pose a risk to human health.based on this information,rco filed a supplemental memorandum in support of its august motion for summary judgment,arguing,inter alia,that the presence of aeea in the tailings was alone sufficient to pose an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health.as such,rco contended that it was entitled to equitable relief as necessary to eliminate the risk posed by omya disposal of toxic wastes,citing dague city of burlington,cir,rev on other grounds by,d significantly,congress used the word may to preface the standard of liability this is expansive language,which is intended to confer upon the courts the authority to grant affirmative equitable relief to eliminate any risk posed by toxic wastes.internal quotation marks omitted emphasis in original.
on july,the district court issued an opinion and order granting summary judgment to omya on the open dumping claim and to rco on the endangerment claim.the court found rco arguments as to its open dumping claim unavailing principally for two reasons the open dumping regulation unambiguously references the mcl table in appendix i,and neither the epa regulation nor appendix i mentions the sdwa drinking water standard and even if the epa had intended to update the values in appendix i to mirror the levels set forth in the sdwa for drinking water,the agency would have needed to follow strict rulemaking procedures in order to change the regulation language,including the mcls in appendix because no test had detected arsenic at levels above ppb in the groundwater below omya disposal pits,the court found that rco did not demonstrate that omya had violated rcra open dumping regulation.
on the endangerment claim,the court noted the report conclusion that the groundwater near omya plant was not currently contaminated by aeea to an unsafe level but found that the evidence showed that there was at least some risk of harm to the environment and to human health.specifically,the court found that continued operations could cause the aeea level to rise to an unsafe level,and aeea could spread from the groundwater to drinking water sources.applying our holding in dague that courts are authorized to grant affirmative equitable relief to the extent necessary to eliminate any risk posed by toxic wastes,at emphasis in original,the district court concluded that the evidence regarding aeea met dague expansive any risk standard,noting,in addition,that its finding of any risk was reinforced by the possibility that omya had introduced arsenic into the groundwater,even if the levels were below those required for open dumping liability.the district court concluded w hile liability is clear,the remedy is far from clear.the court is tasked with delivering equitable relief,and it would be inappropriate to decide the appropriate relief without a further remedy hearing.
after the court issued its liability determination but before it scheduled a remedy hearing,omya made several defensive motions.in july,it filed a motion to dismiss all claims pertaining to aeea,arguing that rco had failed to comply with the rcra notice requirement because it had not specified aeea as a waste contaminant in its noi.omya contended that neither party had known aeea to pose a risk of harm until a preliminary draft of the report was published in october,over three years after rco served its noi.while the motion to dismiss was pending,omya also filed a motion to vacate the district court determination as to endangerment liability.omya argued that five rounds of testing completed after the court liability ruling disproved the report conclusion that aeea was migrating and thereby posing a risk of imminent and substantial endangerment.it further contended that this evidence disproved the court rationale and required the court to vacate its opinion.
the district court declined to decide omya motions and instead scheduled a remedy hearing to take place in march.at the hearing,rco presented the testimony of three experts regarding its proposal for an appropriate remedy.rco argued that the court should require omya to conduct additional monitoring,including drilling new wells at different levels,to monitor more accurately the concentration and migration of aeea.rco also sought to present expert testimony,which would have opined that a proper remedy must include arsenic monitoring.however,the court sustained an objection by omya,ultimately ruling,in response to an offer of proof later filed by rco for the excluded testimony,that the evidence at issue was not material because the court had previously ruled that rco failed to demonstrate that arsenic was present in sufficient quantities to violate federal environmental laws.moreover,the court had previously ruled that the hearing would address only the remedy for the presence of aeea,not further issues of liability.
omya experts then testified about changes to the waste management disposal system and groundwater monitoring program,arguing,as it did in its motions to dismiss and to vacate,that its current monitoring and remediation efforts were adequate to protect the plaintiffs.in addition,despite the court prior statements that the sole purpose of the hearing was to determine the appropriate remedy for the endangerment violation,the court nonetheless permitted omya experts to testify on the issue of liability.the experts opined that there was no evidence that aeea posed an imminent and substantial endangerment to rco,and questioned the report methods,arguing that its conclusions on toxicity were not scientifically valid.the court ultimately indicated that it would consider the testimony regarding the toxicity and danger of aeea as it was relevant to omya pending motion to vacate,stating based on the hearing,the court has the option of finding that,in fact,the plaintiffs have met the burden or have met the burden of proving liability under rcra.the court noted that it could,based on the evidentiary hearing determine the validity of the c ourt prior conclusion.
in response,rco filed a motion for leave to present the testimony of william bress,the vermont state toxicologist,to supplement its opposition to omya motion to vacate,arguing that it had no notice that the court would take evidence regarding the toxicity of aeea as relevant to the court prior liability determination rco submitted to the court its belief that bress would have testified,contrary to omya experts,that a human drinking water guideline for aeea was a necessary remedy to protect human health from the imminent and substantial endangerment posed by aeea.the district court denied rco request and stated that it would consider the testimony of omya experts only on the issue of remedy,as the c ourt indicated was the sole purpose of the hearing.
on september,the district court granted omya motion to vacate the july order holding omya liable for creating an imminent and substantial endangerment.the court explained that in making its prior liability determination,it had relied on the report conclusion that aeea may cause birth defects in human fetuses,a conclusion that was grounded in part on an appendix that had not been submitted to the court until after it had issued its order.based on a renewed review of the report and appendix,the court noted that the report authors had stated that their estimates of acceptably small doses of aeea is uncertain,the rat studies had not been published in scientific journals,and there was no direct data to support or refute their judgment of toxicity,and that they had assumed that the risk for humans was the same as for rats,without the benefit of further studies.given the limitations of the report conclusion,the court found omya witnesses to be very persuasive on the issue of the potential toxicity of aeea to humans and the environment.moreover,the court noted that after issuing its order,we clarified the dague standard,stating the combination of the word may with the word endanger,both of which are probabilistic,leads us to conclude that a reasonable prospect of future harm is adequate to engage the gears of a b so long as the threat is and involves potentially serious harm.cordiano metacon gun club,cir emphasis supplied.applying metacon,the district court concluded that p laintiff evidence is merely speculative of future harm and is not sufficient for the trier of fact to find that the alleged potential harm claimed constitutes a serious endangerment,and therefore granted omya motion to vacate.in addition,the court granted omya motion to dismiss,which had argued that rco failed to satisfy the notice requirements for a rcra citizen suit with respect to aeea.this timely appeal followed.
on appeal,rco argues that the district court erred by granting omya motion to dismiss because it properly complied with the notice requirements of rcra citizen suit enforcement provision misapplied the legal standard for determining an imminent and substantial endangerment under rcra by i failing to consider evidence of arsenic contamination and ii failing to address the threat to the environment posed by the contamination of groundwater erred in finding that omya disposal of solid waste did not violate rcra prohibition on open dumping,because i the most recent mcl for arsenic under the sdwa represents the correct benchmark,not appendix i and ii omya disposal practices violated the statutory prohibition on the open dumping of solid waste and abused its discretion by denying rco request to present expert testimony on arsenic contamination and area toxicity.

ii.the statutory framework 
rcra is a comprehensive environmental statute that governs the treatment,storage,and disposal of solid and hazardous waste.metacon,at.it was enacted to promote the national policy of reducing or eliminating hazardous waste and,where waste is nevertheless generated,to provide for the treatment,storage,or disposal of such waste to minimize the present and future threat to human health and the environment.b.in addition to enforcement by the epa and designated state agencies,rcra provides private individuals a means,in some circumstances,by which to commence an action in a district court to enforce rcra waste disposal mandates see.the citizen suit provision of section b a sets forth the mandatory requirements for bringing a claim of an imminent and substantial endangerment under subsection a b.such claim requires that a plaintiff provide notice of a violation,at least days prior to bringing suit,to the epa administrator,to the state in which the alleged violation occurred,and to any alleged violator of such permit,standard,regulation,condition,requirement,prohibition,or order.b a.suits brought under subsection a a,such as an open dumping claim,are subject to the same notice requirements however,the applicable delay period is days instead of days.b a.
the supreme court has emphasized that u nder a literal reading of the statute,compliance with the day notice provision is a mandatory,not optional,condition precedent for suit.hallstrom tillamook,d.the court explained that,as a matter of policy,the delay periods represent a congressional compromise between encouraging citizen enforcement of environmental regulations and avoiding burdening the federal courts with excessive numbers of citizen suits.id.at.we have echoed this balance in our own precedent,noting that strict compliance with the notice and delay provisions fulfills congressional intent 
first,governmental agencies can take the lead in enforcing environmental regulations,with the hope that an agency may be able to compel compliance through administrative action,thus eliminating the need for any access to the courts.second,the alleged violator is given a nonadversarial period in which he has the opportunity to comply with the law,thus obviating the need for the citizen suit.

rcra does not describe the required content of a notice of intent to sue noi nor has the supreme court shed light on this requirement see id.at.however,the epa has promulgated a regulation,which provides 
notice regarding an alleged violation of a permit,standard,regulation,condition,requirement,or order which has become effective under rcra shall include sufficient information to permit the recipient to identify the specific permit,standard,regulation,condition,requirement,or order which has allegedly been violated,the activity alleged to constitute a violation,the person or persons responsible for the alleged violation,the date or dates of the violation,and the full name,address,and telephone number of the person giving notice.
a emphasis supplied.without detailing what constitutes sufficient information,we have held that the content of an noi must serve the purpose of giving the appropriate governmental agencies an opportunity to act and the alleged violator an opportunity to comply.dague,at.
