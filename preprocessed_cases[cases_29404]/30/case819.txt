in this appeal,we consider whether application of sections and of the endangered species act to the california delta smelt violates the commerce clause in the united states constitution.we conclude that it does not,and we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the delta smelt is a small fish,millimeters in length,that is undisputedly endemic to california.though once inhabiting california san francisco joaquin delta estuary,its range has diminished.the delta smelt presently has no commercial value,but it was commercially harvested as bait in the past.
the united states fish and wildlife service service listed the delta smelt as a threatened species in under the endangered species act esa.the service designated critical habitat for the delta smelt in.and,in,it announced that the delta smelt should be as endangered but that the service would forgo for the time being on account of listings.
section of the esa requires federal agencies to consult with the service before undertaking any action authorized,funded,or carried out by the agency that might jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or might result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat used by any endangered or threatened species.a.after the consultation,the service provides the agency with a written statement describing how the proposed action will affect the endangered or threatened species.id.at b a.this statement is commonly known as a biological opinion.if the service concludes that the proposed action will likely jeopardize the species,then it may suggest reasonable and prudent alternatives for agency action that,the service believes,will not result in violations of the esa.id.
in,the service,acting under esa,a,issued a biological opinion to the bureau of reclamation bureau.the biological opinion concerned the bureau and the california department of water resource operation of the central valley project and the state water project,two of the world largest water diversion projects.the biological opinion concluded that the coordinated operations of the water projects,as proposed,are likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the delta smelt and adversely modify delta smelt habitat.
the biological opinion included a reasonable and prudent alternative,as well as an incidental take statement.the reasonable and prudent alternative consisted of various components designed to reduce entrainment and other taking of smelt during critical times of the year by controlling water flows to and in the delta.if the bureau complied with the reasonable and prudent alternative,then the incidental take statement would insulate the bureau from liability under the provision in esa,a c,which prevents taking of endangered or threatened species.
stewart jasper orchards arroyo farms,llc and king pistachio grove collectively the growers sued the service,claiming that their almond,pistachio,and walnut orchards experienced substantially reduced water deliveries as a result of the service decision to act on behalf of the delta smelt.
among other claims,the growers alleged applied to the delta service application of esa and power to enforce the provision in esa were unconstitutional under the commerce clause.the growers claimed that,since the delta smelt is a purely intrastate species,and because it has no commercial value,sections a and of the esa as applied to the operation of the central valley project and the state water project,are invalid exercises of constitutional authority under the commerce clause.
the growers moved for summary judgment.the service,along with intervenors,natural resources defense council and the bay council collectively the environmental parties,for summary judgment.the service and the environmental parties argued that the growers do not have article iii standing,their claim is not ripe,and application of esa and to the operations of the water projects is a valid exercise of congress power under the commerce clause.in re delta smelt consolidated cases,d.
the district court denied the growers motion and granted the service and environmental parties.with respect to the issue of standing,the district court first noted that while the growers complaint challenges sections a and of the esa,the motion for summary judgment focuses exclusively on the theory that the application of section take prohibition to the smelt exceeds congress authority under the commerce clause.id.at emphasis original.nevertheless,the court concluded,t here is no dispute that plaintiffs have standing to bring a section claim.id.at.but the court determined the growers do not have standing to bring a claim.id.at.it reasoned,given that there is no threat of imminent section enforcement in this case,there is no causal connection between plaintiffs injury and the conduct complained of,namely section application to the coordinated operation of the project.id.at.
the district court similarly decided that the esa claim is not ripe plaintiffs point to no concrete plans on the part of project operators to violate the esa,no communication of a specific warning or threat to initiate enforcement proceedings,nor any history of past prosecution or enforcement against the project operators.id.
even though the district court concluded that the growers were not advancing their motion under esa and that they did not have standing under esa,the court went on to address the merits of the commerce clause challenge.id.at.because the service and the environmental parties had for summary judgment on application of sections a and together,the district court addressed the commerce clause challenge to esa.id.it rejected the challenge,though.delta smelt,d at.it held that the service protection of the delta smelt was valid under the commerce clause,even though the delta smelt is,by all accounts,a purely intrastate species.
the growers timely filed their appeal.we have jurisdiction over the growers appeal under and.
the growers have article iii standing to challenge the provision in esa because the service coercive power to enforce esa caused the bureau to reduce water flows,which injured the growers.see bennett spear.
article iii of the united states constitution confines federal courts to hearing only cases and controversies.barnum timber epa,wl,at cir.standing is a core component of the article iii case or controversy requirement.id.citing lujan defenders of wildlife.to establish article iii standing a plaintiff must have suffered an injury in invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,and not the result of independent action of some third party not before the court and it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan,at see also barnum timber,wl,at.here,the growers meet each of these relatively modest requirements.see bennett,at.
the growers have sufficiently alleged an injury in fact because they claim the issuance of the biological opinion has resulted in reduced water deliveries to users delta smelt,d at.the adverse consequences flowing from the reduction in water delivery are concrete and particularized and actual or imminent.see lujan,at see also laub dep t of interior,cir l oss of affordable irrigation water for individual farmers agricultural lands is an injury in fact.the growers,therefore,satisfy the first of lujan three requirements.
the direct cause of the growers injury is the bureau reduction of water flow.but the service power to enforce the provision in esa is an indirect cause since that power has coerced the bureau to comply with the biological opinion by reducing water flow.
article iii standing can not be supported by the independent action of some third party not before the court,but that does not exclude injury produced by determinative or coercive effect upon the action of someone else.bennett,at.in bennett,the supreme court held that ranchers in oregon had standing to challenge a biological opinion issued by the service because the opinion caused the bureau to reduce water flows,which injured the ranchers.id.at.the supreme court reached this conclusion because the biological opinion had a powerful coercive or determinative effect on the bureau regulation of water flow.id.at.
the biological opinion in bennett had a determinative or coercive effect on the bureau precisely because the bureau would be subject to the service enforcement of the provision in esa if it failed to comply with the opinion id.at.the supreme court remarked that the bureau was free to disregard the biological opinion,but it would do so at its own peril,since any person who knowingly takes an endangered violation of esa subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties.id.at see also.cattle growers ass fish wildlife,cir t he action agency rarely,if ever,chooses to disregard the terms and conditions of an incidental take statement in a biological opinion.
in other words,the determinative or coercive effect of a biological opinion stems directly from the service power to enforce the provision in esa.as the biological opinion here stated,the measures in the incidental take statement are nondiscretionary and must be implemented by the bureau in order to be exempt from the provision in esa.the growers injury,directly caused by bureau compliance with the biological fairly traceable to the service ability to enforce esa.lujan,at.
the district court concluded the growers did not have standing because there is no threat of imminent section enforcement in this case and,as a result,there is no causal connection between plaintiffs injury and the conduct complained of,namely section application to the coordinated operation of the project.delta smelt,d at emphasis added.but,in bennett,the supreme court held of whether the threat of section enforcement was service ability to enforce esa had a powerful coercive and determinative effect.id.at.
bennett illustrates the peril of applying the concept of imminency which belongs in the injury analysis to the causation analysis.in bennett,as here,the fact that enforcement was not imminent arguably exemplifies the determinative or coercive effect of the service enforcement power.the service might never enforce esa precisely because the bureau is keenly aware of the consequences of violating the provision.in short,the growers do not have to show a threat of imminent section enforcement and there is no authority to support such a requirement.
the service raises two arguments germane to the causation analysis.first,it argues the bureau was motivated to comply with the biological opinion on account of the provision in esa and not the provision in esa.thus,they claim the growers do not have standing to sue under esa because the determinative or coercive effect is attributable to esa and not esa.the service argument,though,is unavailing.
the provision in esa requires an agency to ensure that any action it takes is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species.a.sections and of the esa arguably create separate duties but they do not function entirely independent of one another.indeed,as we have observed,the core purpose of esa is to impose an affirmative duty to prevent violations of section upon federal agencies.cattle grower ass n,at or.natural resources council allen,cir.
and even if the provision in esa partly motivates an agency to comply with a biological opinion,the provision in esa still has a sufficient determinative or coercive effect under bennett if it is a substantial factor motivating the agency to comply with the biological opinion.tozzi dep t of health human.bennett leaves us with little doubt that the service power to enforce esa is at least a substantial factor motivating agencies to comply with a biological opinion.that power,as a result,sufficiently establishes lujan causation requirement.
second,the service,relying on summers earth island institute,argues that the growers do not have standing to bring an challenge to esa because the service has not concrete ly appli ed it here.summers,though,has little or no applicability here.
in summers,environmental organizations filed suit to enjoin the forest service from enforcing its regulations that exempt small and projects from the notice,comment,and appeal process used by the forest service for more significant land management decisions.at.in particular,the environmental organizations sought to prevent the forest service from applying the regulations to the burnt ridge sale.id.at.the district court granted the preliminary injunction.id.immediately afterwards,the parties settled their dispute over the burnt ridge sale.id.the supreme court held that,as a result of the settlement,the environmental organizations no longer had standing to challenge the regulations because the dispute was no longer live and the regulations could not be concrete ly appli ed to the burnt ridge sale.id.at.
summers is easily distinguishable from both this case and bennett.summers applies to circumstances where a regulation can no longer be applied because there is no longer a live dispute in which to apply the regulation.here,as in bennett,there is a concrete harm,the reduction in water flow,and the service has the concrete power to apply the provision in esa.as discussed above,the fact that the service has not yet exercised that power does not diminish its determinative or coercive effect.see bennett,at.
in summary,the service ability to enforce the provision in esa has a determinative or coercive effect that compelled the bureau to reduce water flows and,consequently,caused the growers to suffer an injury.
finally,under lujan,the growers must show that invalidating the provision in esa would redress their injury.below,the service apparently conceded this point plaintiffs assert,and federal defendants do not refute,that invalidating the application of section to the facts of this case would preclude enforcement of the biological opinion.in this way,invalidating section would arguably redress plaintiffs injury delta smelt,d at.if the provision in esa is invalidated,the growers injury will likely be redressed because the bureau could restore water flows without worrying about whether the flows would result in a taking.see bennett,at.the service conceded this point below at the summary judgment hearing i f the court were to invalidate section,it would affect the reasonable and prudent alternative and obviously the reasonable and prudent alternative is what causing the injury to the plaintiffs.
because the growers have met the three requirements under lujan,they have article iii standing to challenge esa as applied to the delta smelt.
the growers challenge to esa is ripe for our review.the district court concluded otherwise,because it characterized the growers challenge to the provision in esa as a challenge.delta smelt,d at.as the district court observed,a challenge is only ripe if a plaintiff is presented with the immediate dilemma to choose between complying with newly imposed,disadvantageous restrictions and risking serious penalties for violation.id.citing reno catholic soc.in evaluating a challenge,courts examine 
whether the plaintiffs have articulated a concrete plan to violate the law in question 
whether the prosecuting authorities have communicated a specific warning or threat to initiate proceedings and 
the history of past prosecution or enforcement under the challenged statute.
id.citing thomas anchorage equal rights comm n,f d,cir en banc.
applying these factors,the district court concluded the growers challenge was not ripe because they could point to no concrete plans on the part of project operators to violate the esa,no communication of a specific warning or threat to initiate enforcement proceedings,nor any history of past prosecution or enforcement against the project operators.id.we conclude that the claims are ripe for review.
first,unlike plaintiffs in most cases,the growers are not the target of enforcement.consequently,the consideration of whether the plaintiffs have articulated a co
