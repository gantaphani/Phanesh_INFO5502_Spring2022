plaintiffs petitioned the trial court for an order compelling the california department of public health and its director collectively the department to prepare and submit to the legislature a safe drinking water plan plan as required in health and safety code section.the trial court denied the petition.we presume that,in doing so,the trial court concluded that the statutory requirement to prepare and submit the plan had been suspended.we disagree and reverse the judgment.the matter is remanded to enable the trial court to decide,in the first instance,whether the requirements of code of civil procedure section have been met.
factual and procedural histories 
plaintiffs are cynthia newton enloe and an organization called the coalition plaintiffs filed a verified petition for alternative writ of mandate and writ of mandate on november.they allege that health and safety code section section requires that the department submit to the legislature a plan every five years and that no such plan has been completed since.the plaintiffs contend they are intended beneficiaries of the statutory mandate to prepare the plan because they reside or work in communities that are served by public water systems consisting of fewer than service connections,and these communities have drinking water that contains contaminants referred to in section.their petition seeks a writ of mandate commanding the department to prepare and submit to the legislature a plan and also to submit to the court a detailed proposal for the completion of the plan,including parameters and a timeline.
the department filed an answer to the petition asserting several affirmative defenses.among these was a claim that any mandate to prepare and submit a plan was suspended by the legislature decision to discontinue funding its preparation.the department also filed an opposition to the petition,arguing that any statutory mandate was suspended because specific funding to prepare a plan had been eliminated in by assembly bill reg.sess.section ab.in reaching this conclusion,the department relied on government code section,which provides that any legislatively mandated publication like the plan is suspended when funding is discontinued in the budget act 
the department offered declarations from david spath,assistant division chief of the drinking water and environmental management division division from to and chief of the division from january to november rufus howell,acting chief of the division from november to november and chief of the division from november to february and gary yamamoto,then current chief of the division.
each declaration contained identically worded statements regarding the plan and the declarant belief about the effect of ab on the requirement to prepare a plan.a plan was prepared and submitted to the legislature in or about january.funding for preparation of the report had been provided by the legislature but was discontinued by the legislature in by ab no.and in the budget acts subsequently enacted by the legislature.the declarants also identically stated,it is my understanding that under government code section,because the legislature discontinued the funding for the preparation of the report,any mandate to prepare the report was suspended.in addition,the department took the position that the preparation and submission of the plan was not mandatory and,further,that plaintiffs did not have a beneficial interest in having one prepared.
plaintiffs argued that the department failed to demonstrate that government code section applied.they pointed out that the department did not show that specific funding for the preparation of the plan was provided in any budget act prior to or that funding was discontinued after.plaintiffs also contended that the department had a clear ministerial duty to prepare the plan a lack of resources was not a defense to failing to perform a ministerial duty and plaintiffs had a beneficial interest in the issuance of a writ.
on february,the trial court heard oral argument.in denying the petition,the court stated,plaintiffs failed to carry their burden of proof to relief under code of civil procedure,especially in light of the declarations filed by defendants.the petition for writ of mandate is therefore denied.
discussion 
to obtain a writ,plaintiffs were required to show three elements 
code of civil procedure section,providing for writs of mandate,is available to compel public agencies to perform acts required by law.citation.to obtain relief,a petitioner must demonstrate no plain,speedy,and adequate alternative remedy exists code civ,a clear,present,ministerial duty on the part of the respondent and a correlative clear,present,and beneficial right in the petitioner to the performance of that duty.citations.a ministerial duty is an obligation to perform a specific act in a manner prescribed by law whenever a given state of facts exists,without regard to any personal judgment as to the propriety of the act.citation.people picklesimer cal th.
the department argued before the trial court that the statutory mandate to prepare and submit a plan was suspended by the legislature termination of funding.the court denied the petition,finding that plaintiffs failed to carry their burden of proof to relief under code of civil procedure,especially in light of the declarations filed by defendants.italics added.as we have already mentioned,the declarations filed by the department were from three current and former division chiefs who stated that funding for the plan was discontinued by the legislature and that their understanding was any mandate to prepare the plan was suspended.the declarations did not address any other issues.for example,the division chiefs did not say anything about the possibility of speedy alternative remedies or whether plaintiffs had a beneficial interest in having a plan prepared and submitted.the declarations related only to the department claim that the statutory mandate was suspended.we assume the court agreed with that claim and denied the petition for that reason.
to determine whether the legislature has suspended the requirement to prepare and submit a plan,we review de novo the trial court implicit statutory interpretations.kavanaugh west sonoma county union high school dist.cal th.we conclude that the statutory mandate was not suspended.

history of the plan requirement 
the crux of the department argument is that,notwithstanding the language of section,their duty to prepare and submit a plan was suspended because the legislature terminated funding in.in examining this question,we begin with a brief history of section and its predecessor,health and safety code section.
original statutory requirement with fee provision 
the first statutory requirement to prepare and submit a plan was enacted in.former health and safety code section,subdivision a,created a obligation on or before july,the department shall submit to the legislature a comprehensive safe drinking water plan for california.former,subd.a,added by stats,ch.like current section,former section required the plan to include,among other things,t ypes and levels of contaminants found in public drinking water systems which have less than service connections and r ecommendations for actions which could be taken by the legislature,the department,and these systems to improve water quality.former,subd.b.former section,subdivision c,provided authorization for a fee to cover the costs of preparing this plan 
the department may levy a fee on public water systems which serve more than service connections for the exclusive purpose of covering its costs in preparing the safe drinking water plan.
the fee shall be paid by water systems to the department at a rate of nine and fifteen cents per service connection,up to a maximum amount of ten thousand dollars.
ab deletes obsolete fee provision 
in,by ab,the legislature amended health and safety code section,deleting subdivision c.from an assembly committee report,it appears that the fee provision was deleted as obsolete because the fee had already been collected and recovered.see assem.com.on ways means,on assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.the committee report also commented that a draft plan has been prepared,but has not been approved or submitted to the legislature for unexplained reasons.ibid.despite the passing of the deadline,amended health and safety code section continued to require the department to submit a safe drinking water plan on or before july.former,as amended by stats,ch.in fact,a plan was submitted to the legislature in.
current statutory requirement 
in,the legislature renumbered health and safety code section as section.former,added by stats,ch.that statute continued to require the department to submit a plan to the legislature on or before july,subd.a.then,in,the legislature amended section,deleting the requirement that a plan be submitted by july,and adopting the current language once every five years the department shall submit to the legislature a comprehensive safe drinking water plan for california,subd.a,added by stats,ch.
b.the statutory mandate has not been suspended 
the department contends that,in,ab permanently terminated funding for preparation of any safe drinking water plan.therefore,the department argues,government code section suspends the mandate to prepare and submit a plan even though the legislature enacted the current mandate after.
government code section 
government code section provides notwithstanding any other provision of law,when funding for any legislatively mandated publication is discontinued in the budget act,the statutory mandate for that publication shall be automatically suspended.the parties do not cite,and our research has not uncovered,any cases applying section.to interpret the statute,we look to the overall scheme in which the statute is included.city of brentwood central valley regional water quality control bd.th,observing that court may consider organization of the division,chapters,and articles is an aid to understanding its purpose.here,government code section is part of an article titled distribution of state publications.in government code section,subdivision a,the legislature explains that the intent of the article is to reduce the excessive flow of unsolicited state agency reports,which are produced and distributed at significant public expense and then often shelved or destroyed by the recipients again at significant public expense.publication is not defined in government code section,but section refers to state publications and defines them with reference to government code section.government code section defines a state publication to include,among other things,any report issued by any department,commission,or other agency of the state.
since the plan is a report prepared by a state agency,we assume it is a legislatively mandated publication for purposes of government code section.for section to apply,there must be a showing that funding for the plan has been discontinued in the budget act.the department did not offer evidence of any budget acts in which funding for the preparation of the safe drinking water plan expressly was discontinued.plaintiffs argue that deletion of the fee provision does not invoke government code section because ab in which the fee was deleted was not part of a budget act.the department concedes that there is no express discontinuation of funding in any budget act but argues that this is of no consequence because if the legislature terminates funding through statutory amendment,then it follows that the legislature will not make an appropriation in the budget act.
assuming,but not deciding,that government code section does apply to discontinuation of funding found outside budget acts,the next question is whether ab means that the current statutory mandate stands suspended today.again,the department claim is that,in,through ab,the legislature discontinued funding for the statutory mandate at issue submission of a plan to the legislature once every five years,even though this mandate was not created until.we do not see how,by deleting in a fee that had already served to cover the costs of a plan that had already been drafted,the legislature intended to discontinue funding prospectively for the preparation and submission of safe drinking water plans that it was going to require four years later.nor does it seem likely that the legislature would enact a statutory mandate,yet intend it to be suspended from the start,relying on the deletion four years earlier of a fee provision in a predecessor statute.in the end,we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.torres parkhouse tire service,cal th.
we recognize that the department provided declarations from three current and former division chiefs of the department offering their opinion that the statutory mandate to prepare a plan was suspended by ab.on appeal,plaintiffs assert that these declarations lack foundation and independent evidentiary support.the department counters that plaintiffs have forfeited any objections to the admission of the declarations because they failed to raise them in the trial court.we agree with the department that the declarations properly are part of the record on appeal.even so,they are of little value because they merely state legal conclusions.
for example,the division chiefs stated,funding for preparation of the report had been provided by the legislature but was discontinued by the legislature in by ab no.and in the budget acts subsequently enacted by the legislature.the department,however,concedes that there is nothing in any budget act that expressly demonstrates that funding has been discontinued for the current statutory mandate.the division chiefs statements that funding was discontinued in the budget acts is nothing more than a legal conclusion about the effect of the deletion of the fee provision.similarly,the division chiefs each stated,it is my understanding that under government code section,because the legislature discontinued the funding for the preparation of the report,any mandate to prepare the report was suspended.this,again,is a legal conclusion about whether section applies to suspend the current statutory mandate.
our supreme court has considered in detail how much weight courts should give to agency interpretation of statutes 
whether judicial deference to an agency interpretation is appropriate and,if so,its extent the weight it should be given is fundamentally situational.t wo broad categories of factors are relevant to a court assessment of the weight due an agency interpretation those indicating that the agency has a comparative interpretive advantage over the courts,and those indicating that the interpretation in question is probably correct.citations.
in the first category are factors that assume the agency has expertise and technical knowledge,especially where the legal text to be interpreted is technical,obscure,complex,or entwined with issues of fact,policy,and discretion.a court is more likely to defer to an agency interpretation of its own regulation than to its interpretation of a statute,since the agency is likely to be intimately familiar with regulations it authored and sensitive to the practical implications of one interpretation over another.citation.the
