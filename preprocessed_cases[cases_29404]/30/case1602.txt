state of california appeals the judgment of the united states court of federal claims holding that the flood control act of,codified at,immunizes the united states from claims for damages arising from or related to flood control projects.because we conclude that,to the extent sovereign immunity might otherwise apply,it has been waived by the tucker act,and the later enactment did not repeal the earlier by implication,we reverse,ordering judgment for the state of california,and remand for an assessment of damages.
background 
in the,the state of california california and the united states,through the department of the interior,independently evaluated the possibility of expanding their respective water projects in the central valley of california.both ultimately determined that only one,and the same,location for their respective projects was feasible.as a result,the parties began discussing a joint project.in,congress authorized the secretary of the interior secretary to negotiate and enter into an agreement with california,subject to congressional approval,for the construction of a facility.see,stat.the san luis act.the principal purpose of the san luis act was to furnish water for irrigation of approximately acres of land in central california along the san luis unit,with contemplated incidental use for,among other things,recreational and fish and wildlife benefits.id.
the secretary exercised his congressionally granted authority on behalf of the united states,reaching an agreement with california in december the contract the parties also entered into a supplemental agreement in.the contract provided that the united states would construct the facility and thereafter turn it over to california for operation and maintenance.notably,it further provided that 
the united states and the state shall each pay annually an equitable share of the operation,maintenance,and replacement costs of the facilities,including claims paid by either party.the method of computation of the share to be paid by each agency shall be mutually agreed to by the state and the united states before the transfer of care,operation,and maintenance of facilities.
before california began operating the facility,the parties agreed that the costs would be equitably apportioned as follows california would cover of the costs identified in the blocked excerpt above,and the united states would cover the remaining.
under san luis act,the contract became effective after the contract had been before congress for ninety days,and was not disapproved by either the house or the senate interior and insular affairs committees.see cong.rec.july,statement of miller.in,the united states bureau of reclamation completed construction of the san luis unit,a mile canal that transports water from northern california through the central valley to southern california.importantly,the canal crosses the path of several transitory streams such that,in times of heavy rainfall,water from those streams is diverted onto neighboring landowners property.as a result,between and,the united states and california made payments totaling over million,all related to damage from flood waters from such diversions.each time,the parties paid their share of the march.
in march,a large storm caused a massive overflow of the transitory stream beds,causing property damage in excess of million.over the next four years,california paid many claims seeking compensation for this damage.when it sought partial reimbursement,however,the united states the very first it was not required to contribute its share because it was immune under the flood control act of.
california sued the united states for breach of contract in the court of federal claims.the parties stipulated to the facts recounted above and for summary judgment,agreeing that resolution of the suit turned on whether the cause of action was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.eschewing oral argument,the court of federal claims granted the united states motion,denied california motion,and entered judgment for the united states.california united states.in reaching its decision,the court concluded that no liability could attach because the flood control act covers all damage from floods and flood waters,and the san luis unit was designed from its inception as a flood control project.id.at.and it was persuaded that,in light of the broad,sweeping language of the flood control act,the contract and its supplement were entered into ultra vires,such that the section of those contracts requiring the united states to partially reimburse california for claims paid for flood damage arising from floods or flood waters was of no force or effect.id.at regardless of whether the contract and the supplement contemplated the sharing of cost of flood claims,this court can not enforce terms,whether freely negotiated or not,which are in violation of a statute t he conduct of the parties is irrelevant because an agency can not ratify an arrangement which violates federal law.
final judgment was entered in favor of the united states on september,after which california timely filed its notice of appeal.we heard oral argument on october.the appeal is now ripe for disposition.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,employing an identical standard to that applied by the trial court.wolff shoe united states.the mere fact that the parties have for summary judgment does not impel a grant of at least one motion each must be independently assessed on its own merit.ecolab,envirochem.accordingly,summary judgment is appropriate here if,drawing all inferences in a light most favorable to the,there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
the flood control act of enacted a comprehensive program for the mississippi valley,embodying a general bank protection scheme,channel stabilization and river regulation,all involving vast expenditures of public funds.united states james,d quoting united states sponenbarger.now applicable nationwide,the act contains an immunity provision covering floods and flood waters,which is indeed broad in scope no liability of any kind shall attach to or rest upon the united states for any damage from or by floods or flood waters at any place.the present case is one of first impression insofar as no court appears to have addressed whether this immunity provision is waived when the united states enters into contracts that may be somehow related to flood control projects and those contracts create tucker act jurisdiction.
historically,the issue of waiver has arisen most often in the context of suits sounding in as whether the united states can be held liable for negligent failure to warn recreational boaters before the army corps of engineers releases flood waters from a federal flood control project,united states james,d,whether the united states can be held liable for injuries caused while the coast guard tows a stranded recreational vehicle on a flood control lake,boudreau united states,cir,or whether the united states can be held liable for damages from waters that spilled when a retaining wall for an irrigation channel burst,washington east columbia basin irr,cir.in each instance,the united states has enjoyed immunity as a result of the undeniable breadth of the scope of immunity under.boudreau,at see also james,at.it is difficult to imagine broader language congress clearly sought to ensure beyond doubt that sovereign immunity would protect the government from any liability associated with flood control.
the court of federal claims found such cases,and james in particular,to be instructive in determining if the grant of immunity under extends to actions for breach of contract.citing in james the discussion of the legislative history of the flood control act,the court concluded that breach of contract claims are within the ambit of because the legislative history show s that the sweeping language of was no drafting inadvertence.state of california.at quoting james,at.on appeal,california asserts that this conclusion is logical only if the flood control act effected a partial repeal of
