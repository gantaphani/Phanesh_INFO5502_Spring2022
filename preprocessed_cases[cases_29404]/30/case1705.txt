in,real party in interest milan rei iv llc milan purchased over acres of land property in the orange park acres area in the city of orange city.milan envisioned a residential development project or ridgeline project on the property,which was formerly the home of the ridgeline golf course and country club.but the project was controversial because the private development would replace public open space.despite the controversy,the city advanced the ridgeline project by approving milan request to amend its general plan and permit development on the property.in response,the orange parks association and a political action committee called orange citizens for parks and recreation together,orange citizens challenged the city amendment by referendum.the city then changed course,arguing that there was no need to amend its general plan to approve the ridgeline project because a resolution from permitted residential development on the property.the city thus concluded that the referendum,whatever its outcome,would have no effect.in november,percent of voters rejected the city general plan amendment.
the main question before us is whether the resolution is part of the city current general plan.the city frames its approval of milan development application and reliance on the resolution as an exercise of its legislative discretion to which we owe deference.but deference has limits.in light of the contents of the city general plan,no reasonable person could interpret that plan to include the resolution.because we conclude that the city abused its discretion in interpreting the general plan to permit residential development on the property,we reverse the court of appeal judgment upholding the city approval of the project.
orange park acres covers over acres of land in the foothills of the santa ana mountains.in,orange city council city council established an orange park acres development committee to resolve ongoing disputes among local landowners,developers,and residents.after weeks of outreach and evaluation,the development committee adopted the orange park acres specific plan opa plan.the opa plan designates the property for use as a golf course or,should that prove economically infeasible,for recreation and open space.
the city planning commission considered the opa plan and,after a hearing,adopted resolution no.on november.this resolution recommended that the city council adopt the opa plan subject to amendments providing,among other things,that the property be designated as other open space and low density acre instead of open space and that the opa plan be adopted as representing a portion of the land use element of the general plan.
the city council adopted the opa plan on december.the pertinent legislative act,resolution,upholds the recommendation of the planning commission and identifies the opa plan as the herein described general plan for the orange park acres area as set forth in that certain plan prepared by webb planning consultants webb,dated september and as amended by the planning commission on november.neither the city council resolution nor the opa plan prepared by webb referred to the planning commission resolution no.by name or described the planning commission proposed amendments to the opa plan.in,the city council passed resolution,which amended the general plan land use element to permit residential development in orange park acres and removed the word specific from the title of the opa plan.it also authorized the department of planning and development services to make the necessary changes to the official maps and text of the orange park acres area plan and land use element of the general plan so that both documents correctly reflect these changes.
for reasons that are unclear,the city never made these changes.neither the text of the opa plan nor its attached land use policy map was revised to designate the ridgeline project site as other open space and low density acre instead of open space.if any members of the public had requested a copy of the opa plan,they would have received the unamended opa plan with resolution attached.neither of these documents included the planning commission proposed amendments in resolution no.this oversight bred confusion from the late onward.city planning documents and internal analyses have referred to the opa plan in varying and inconsistent terms,sometimes describing it as part of the general plan,sometimes as a specific plan,and sometimes as a different type of plan altogether,such as an area,neighborhood,or community plan.
the city has revised its general plan since the opa plan adoption.in,the city adopted a general plan intended to establish definitive land use and development policy to guide the city into the next century.on the land use policy map,identified by the general plan as the single most important feature of the land use element,the property is designated as or open.the general plan incorporated the opa plan under the heading area plans.the publicly available opa plan also designated the property as open space.
in light of this history,both milan and the city believed a general plan amendment would be required to develop the property.when milan submitted a development application in,it requested a general plan amendment to change the property land use designation from open space to estate residential,as well as a change in zoning from open space to.in a september draft environmental impact report on the project,the city agreed that milan proposed changes were required.the report indicated that the existing general plan designation for the property is open space,while finding that the project was otherwise consistent with the general plan and the opa plan.
in late,as the city was processing milan development application,milan counsel discovered resolution no.and conveyed it to the city attorney,prompting the city to conduct a comprehensive review of planning documents related to the property.in a december,letter to the orange park acres homeowners association,the city attorney reached the following conclusions the opa plan is part of the general plan,and the opa plan designates the golf course portion of the property as other open space and low density acre.the city attorney observed that the opa plan and the ridgeline project were inconsistent with the city general plan but asserted that f rom a processing standpoint,the city attorney findings have little impact on the ridgeline project because the plan designation for the golf course is other open space and low density acre.
at that time,the city was also revising its general plan,a final version of which was adopted in march.the general plan includes an introduction and enumerated elements.it refers to but does not incorporate s everal supporting documents that were produced during the development of the general plan,including an environmental impact report eir,a land use survey,a circulation model,inventories of historical and cultural resources,and market studies.it states,the organization of the general plan allows users to identify the section that interests them and quickly obtain a perspective of the city policies on that subject policies are presented as written statements,tables,diagrams,and maps.all of these components must be considered together when making decisions.
the general plan also discusses ordinances,plans,and programs that should be consulted in association with the general plan when making development and planning decisions.the general plan directs readers to consult specific plans and neighborhood plans in orange that are intended to provide more finite specification of the types of uses to be permitted the opa plan is listed as an adopted specific plan and neighborhood plan.while citing the opa plan as an example of e arlier planning efforts that have influenced the growth and change within orange,the general plan states that specific and neighborhood plans,including the opa plan,must be consistent with the policies expressed in the land use element.
part of the land use element is the land use policy map,which indicates the location,density,and intensity of development for all land uses citywide.it designates the project site as open space and defines open space as s teep hillsides,creeks,or environmentally sensitive areas that should not be developed.although designated as permanent open space,most areas will not be developed as public parks with the exception of river and creekside areas that promote connectivity of the city trails system.
in july,the planning commission advised the city council that a general plan amendment was needed to i clarify and amend the original and unchanged terms of the existing opa plan which permitted both golf course and residential uses by amending the opa plan land use designation to low density one acre minimum,and iv make the general plan land use designations for the subject property consistent throughout the general plan.the planning commission recommended approval of such an amendment,general plan amendment,and found that u pon approval of the proposed amendments to the general plan,the project is consistent with the goals and policies of the general plan.
on june,the city council certified the final environmental impact report feir for the project.the feir concluded that the opa plan was part of the general plan based on the city attorney review of the city council actions in.the report found that at the time the opa plan was adopted,the very specific intent of the city council was that residential lots be permitted on the property.it explained that most likely through clerical oversight and contrary to the express terms of resolution,the textual changes recommended by the planning commission and approved by the city council were never entered into any official copy of the opa plan.in approving general plan amendment,it is the intent of the city council to exercise its legislative discretion to honor the intent of the original adoption of the opa,remove any uncertainty pertaining to the permitted uses of the property,and allow uses on the property which the city council believes to be appropriate.the feir concluded that contingent on passage of the proposed general plan amendment the proposed project would be both consistent and in many cases furthers the city policies.
also on june,the city council adopted a general plan amendment,stating that u pon approval of the proposed amendments to the general plan,the project is consistent with the goals and policies of the city general plan that was approved by the city council on march,including the opa plan which is part of the general plan land use element pursuant to city council adoption of resolution in that included the opa plan as part of the required land use element to be included in a general plan for the city of orange.
on june,orange citizens circulated a referendum petition challenging the city general plan amendment.orange citizens filed the referendum with the city clerk on july,precluding the general plan amendment from taking effect.see code.but that same day,the city council moved forward with the ridgeline project,implementing milan requested zoning change and approving the development agreement with milan.the city council made several consistency findings,including a finding that the zoning change was consistent with and further ed the objectives and policies of the orange park acres plan,which is part of the land use element of the general plan,as amended by general plan amendment,and that the development agreement was consistent with the objectives,policies,general land uses,and programs specified in the general plan as amended by general plan amendment,which general plan includes the orange park acres plan as part of its land use element.
on august,counsel for milan wrote to the city attorney with an elegant solution.counsel posited that city staff had inadvertently failed to update the opa plan to conform to the planning commission recommendations in resolution no.as adopted by the city council in resolution.this clerical error,milan suggested,could not change the fact that the true designation for the property was other open space and residential acre.thus,the general plan amendment was not required to permit the project to go forward.instead,the legal inadequac y in the land use policy map could be remedied through administrative correction.
the city attorney adopted this solution and,in an august,report,suggested that the general plan amendment defeat by referendum would not necessarily negate the other actions the city council took to advance the ridgeline project.while acknowledging that a general plan amendment would make the opa plan more internally consistent than it is without and more consistent with the approval of the project,the city attorney reasoned that the project would remain consistent with the general plan irrespective of repeal of the general plan amendment.
meanwhile,on july,milan filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief to stop the referendum.orange citizens,seeking to nullify the zone change and the project approval as inconsistent with the property land use designation under the general plan.milan filed its own,seeking to establish that the project could proceed regardless of the outcome of the referendum because the property land use designation was controlled by the opa plan.alternatively,milan argued that the general plan amendment defeat would be devoid of any legal effect because it would result in an internally inconsistent general plan.
in july,the trial court entered judgment in favor of milan.the court ordered the city to remove the referendum from the ballot and allow milan to proceed with the project in accordance with the actual and original general plan designation of the property as other open space and low density acre.orange citizens filed a petition for writ relief,requesting that the court of appeal vacate the trial court orders,reinstate the referendum to the november,ballot,and enter judgment in their favor.on july,the court of appeal issued an order to show cause and granted orange citizens request for a stay of the trial court order,allowing the public to vote on the referendum.
the referendum appeared on the november ballot.the city attorney analysis in the ballot pamphlet stated that the amendment clarifies that the orange park acres plan is part of the land use element of the city of orange general plan and that the land use designation of other open space and low density acre is the existing general plan land use designation on the acres of property.it explained that the general plan amendment was enacted in connection with the ridgeline project and concluded that the land use map,which shows solely an open space land use designation on the site,would also be revised to reflect the other open space and low density acre general plan land use designation.in november,percent of voters rejected the general plan amendment.
despite the referendum,the court of appeal affirmed the project approval on july.framing the central issue as whether the project is consistent with the city plan amendment general plan,the court of appeal deferred to the city consistency finding and found that substantial evidence supported the city decision.the court of appeal further found that the land use designation in the land use policy map did not bar milan requested zoning change because the policy map is not the end of the analysis.the court of appeal identified contradictions and ambiguities that call into question the possibility of definitively determining the land use designation of the property in the general plan,including ambiguity in the land use classification of the property and ambiguity in the city planning documents.but the court found that this uncertainty counseled in favor of deferring to the city council judgment.
with respect to the practical effect of the referendum,the court of appeal held that despite the persistence of erroneous information in the general plan,the vote does not alter the reasonableness of the city council conclusion that the open space designation is an error and not a substantive inconsistency.the court reasoned that because the city has the power to fix errors in the orange park acres plan and the policy map by reference to previously adopted resolutions of the city council,the amendment did not matter with regard to the major points of contention.
we granted review.

in support of the city approval of the project,milan emphasizes that t he opa plan was comprehensively reviewed and considered by the public when it was adopted in.there is no evidence in the record to indicate that any of the subsequent general plan amendments intended to change the designation of the ridgeline property in the opa plan.however,the relevant land use designation for the property is not the general plan designation from,but rather the designation in effect in after the voters rejected the city general plan amendment.the import of that vote depends,in turn,on the property status before the city sought to amend the general plan in.milan contends that an amended opa plan has been continuously in effect since,so the voters rejection of the general plan amendment in merely preserved the status quo of the property as zoned for open space and residential development.orange citizens argues that the property designation is solely open space,as determined by the text and maps in the publicly available version of the general plan,so the voters rejection of the amendment means that the property remains open space.we conclude that orange citizens has the better view.
as an initial matter,milan and the city correctly contend that our review in this case is confined to whether the city abused its discretion in finding the project consistent with the general plan.a city determination that a development approval is consistent with its general plan has been described by some courts as adjudicatory san franciscans upholding the downtown plan city county of san francisco th,and by others as endangered habitats league,county of orange th.where a consistency determination involves the application of a general plan established land use designation to a particular development,it is fundamentally adjudicatory.in such circumstances,a consistency determination is entitled to deference as an extension of a planning agency unique competence to interpret its policies when applying them in its adjudicatory capacity.san franciscans upholding the downtown plan,at.reviewing courts must defer to a procedurally proper consistency finding unless no reasonable person could have reached the same conclusion.id.at see joshua tree downtown business alliance county of san bernardino th,san francisco tomorrow city and county of san francisco th.
