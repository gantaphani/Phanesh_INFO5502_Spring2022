a public agency issued a permit for expansion of a landfill after considering and certifying as complete an environmental impact report eir prepared pursuant to the california environmental quality act pub.resources code,et,hereafter ceqa community organizations filed a petition for a writ of mandate.the organizations claimed a right to appeal the eir certification to the county board of supervisors,and also claimed that the eir was inadequate and should be adjudged so by the superior court.the superior court resolved the first issue alone and issued a judgment directing the county board of supervisors to hear an administrative appeal of the eir certification.
we reverse the judgment.approval of the landfill permit,and certification of the eir for that approval,is a power vested in a local enforcement agency not the county itself.the local enforcement agency is a distinct legal entity from the county.the county board of supervisors has no authority to approve or disapprove the project at issue and thus is not a decisionmaking body empowered to hear plaintiffs administrative appeal,subd.c guidelines,subd.b.plaintiffs challenge to the adequacy of the eir lies in the superior court,to which we remand this case,subd.c.
redwood landfill,rli operates the redwood landfill on a acre site north of novato on the petaluma river in marin county.the landfill began receiving waste in,and handles the majority of marin county solid waste.rli has a solid waste facilities swf permit issued pursuant to the integrated waste management act waste act.et t he responsibility for solid waste management is a shared responsibility between the state and local governments,subd.a.the california department of resources recycling and recovery calrecycle generally enforces the act but may also certify a local government agency as the enforcement agency in a given community,et in,calrecycle certified marin county environmental health services marin ehs as the local enforcement agency for marin county.in,marin ehs issued an swf permit to rli,with the concurrence of calrecycle.in,rli filed an application with marin ehs to revise the landfill swf permit,which is the subject of this litigation.rli application seeks operational changes and expansion of the landfill capacity.rli also has a conditional use permit for operation of the landfill that was issued by marin county in.the use permit is broadly written and contains no expiration date.rli has not applied for any change to its use permit,only its swf permit.
issuance of an swf permit is a discretionary decision by a public agency implicating ceqa,which requires environmental review of both public projects and public agency approval of private projects,subd.g,subd.a.marin ehs,as the public agency with principal responsibility for issuing the requested swf permit,assumed the role of lead agency under ceqa.guidelines.an initial study concluded that substantial changes were proposed that had not been addressed in a prior eir from,and this required a subsequent eir.guidelines,subd.a.a draft eir was completed in,and the final eir in.the final eir presented a project redesign as a mitigated alternative,which rli accepted.the final eir was twice amended and the process finally completed in may.pursuant to marin county guidelines,the marin county planning commission,as the body with the greatest expertise for ceqa environmental review,reviewed the eir and recommended to the decision making body here,marin ehs certification of the eir.in june,marin ehs certified the final eir second amendment.
plaintiff no wetlands landfill expansion nwle,an association of local residents,claimed a right to appeal the marin ehs certification to the marin county board of supervisors board of supervisors,and filed a petition to do so in june.plaintiff environmental groups sustainability,parks,recycling and wildlife legal defense fund sprwldf and northern california recycling association ncra joined in the petition for appeal.marin county counsel advised plaintiffs that marin ehs was acting as the designated representative of calrecycle under the waste act,not the county of marin,and thus no appeal to the board of supervisors was available.county counsel also stated that appeal of a ceqa determination is not timely until after action on the underlying project is taken and t he underlying project here would be action on the anticipated proposed revision of the solid waste facility permit,which action has not yet occurred.
meanwhile,action on the proposed swf permit proceeded.marin ehs deemed the application complete in october and found that the permit was consistent with state standards for solid waste facilities.marin ehs provided calrecycle with a copy of the proposed permit containing the terms and conditions marin ehs proposed to establish.in november,plaintiffs sprwldf and ncra petitioned marin ehs for an administrative review hearing under the waste act to challenge marin ehs recommended issuance of the swf permit.marin ehs scheduled a hearing.meanwhile,after public hearing and deliberations,calrecycle concurred in issuance of the swf permit.marin ehs was now authorized to issue the swf permit,and did so in december,subd.a.plaintiffs sprwldf and ncra withdrew their petition for an administrative hearing.
in january,plaintiffs nwle,sprwldf,and ncra filed in the superior court a petition for a writ of mandate alleging violations of ceqa and local land use law.code civ.plaintiffs sued marin county,the board of supervisors,and marin county agencies including marin ehs and one of its officers.in june,plaintiffs filed their opening brief.plaintiffs argued that defendants violated ceqa in refusing their june petition for appeal to the board of supervisors that challenged marin ehs certification of the eir.plaintiffs relied upon a ceqa provision stating that,i f a nonelected decisionmaking body of a local lead agency certifies an environmental impact report that certification may be appealed to the agency elected decisionmaking body,if any,subd.c.effectively,plaintiffs asserted that the board of supervisors was marin ehs elected decisionmaking body and thus should review marin ehs eir certification.plaintiffs also claimed that the certified eir failed to adequately analyze numerous environmental impacts from an expanded landfill.
defendants responded that there was no appeal to the board of supervisors because marin ehs was acting as the designated representative of calrecycle under the waste act,not the county of marin.marin ehs is an entity distinct from the county of marin,defendants argued,and does not have an elected decisionmaking body to hear an appeal following marin ehs certification of an eir.the remedy for individuals dissatisfied with an eir certified by marin ehs is an immediate writ of mandate.et defendants noted that plaintiffs also had,as an additional remedy,an administrative challenge to the swf permit under waste act provisions,which they abandoned.defendants also defended the eir on its merits,contending that it fully assessed the environmental impacts of the project.
in october,the trial court issued an order granting plaintiff petition for a writ of mandate on the cause of action alleging a ceqa violation for refusing appeal of the eir certification to the board of supervisors,subd.c.the court did not address plaintiff claims that the eir is inadequate,finding that those claims could be rendered moot by subsequent actions by the board of supervisors,which could include eir revisions.the court denied defendants motion for a new trial.judgment was issued in march.the court ordered defendants to vacate certification of the eir and issuance of the swf permit and to allow an administrative appeal of marin ehs certification of the eir to the board of supervisors.defendants appealed the judgment to this court.
ii.discussion 
the question presented on appeal is a narrow one is marin ehs certification of an eir for issuance of an swf permit appealable to the board of supervisors the answer is no.the source of the answer lies in the regulatory structure created by the waste act and the waste act intersection with ceqa.that regulatory structure reveals that approval of an swf permit,and certification of the eir for that approval,is a power vested in marin ehs as a distinct local enforcement agency and is not a power vested in the county itself.
a.the waste act 
the waste act requires calrecycle to prepare and adopt certification regulations for local enforcement agencies,subd.a.a county board of supervisors may designate a local enforcement agency under the waste act to inspect,issue permits,and enforce regulations at solid waste landfills,subd.a.the designated local enforcement agency must meet standards for technical expertise and a dequacy of staff resources before it may be certified by calrecycle to assume duties under the waste act,subds.a,a a,b.technical expertise is essential.regulations promulgated under the waste act state that the local enforcement agency shall have one or more full time staff members dedicated solely for solid waste issues and staff shall be composed of at least one registered environmental health specialist,tit,subd.a.calrecycle strictly enforces these requirements.no enforcement agency may exercise the powers and duties of an enforcement agency until the designation is approved by calrecycle.if no designation is approved,calrecycle shall be the enforcement agency and shall assume all the powers and duties of an enforcement agency under the waste act,subd.a.if a local enforcement agency is certified,waste act regulations specify that p erformance of permitting,inspection,and enforcement duties and responsibilities of comprehensive solid waste enforcement issues shall reside solely within the local enforcement agency.cal code regs.tit,subd.a.
landfill applications are submitted to the local enforcement agency.the application must show compliance with ceqa,tit,subd.f.the local enforcement agency evaluates the application to determine if the proposed solid waste facilities permit is consistent with and is supported by existing ceqa analysis,subd.g and meets state regulations adopted by calrecycle,subd.b.calrecycle has adopted comprehensive regulations governing solid waste facilities,tit.the local enforcement agency may impose terms and conditions on the swf permit,as necessary to protect public health and the environment.the local enforcement agency is not,however,authorized to issue an swf permit under its own power.the local enforcement agency must submit the proposed swf to calrecycle for the state agency consideration,subd.a.calrecycle reviews the proposed swf permit for consistency with state standards,subd.a.calrecycle then either objects or concurs,subd.a.the local enforcement agency may issue an swf permit only with calrecycle concurrence,subd.a.
the issuance of an swf permit is subject to administrative review.a member of the public may request the local enforcement agency hold a hearing to consider claims that the agency failed to act as required by law or regulation.sustainability of parks,recycling wildlife legal defense fund county of solano of resource management th.the hearing is heard by a hearing panel or officer appointed by the local governing body the board of supervisors here.the decision from this hearing may be appealed to calrecycle,subd.a and an individual dissatisfied with calrecycle decision may file with the superior court a petition for a writ of mandate for review thereof,subd.a.
the waste act review process is arguably permissive,rather than a mandatory administrative appeal that is a precondition to judicial review.see sierra club san joaquin local agency formation com.cal th,the right to petition for judicial review of a final decision of an administrative agency is not necessarily affected by the party failure to file a request for reconsideration or rehearing before that agency.defendants have conceded as much.no defense based on an asserted failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the waste act was raised in the trial court or on appeal.
for our purposes,the important thing to notice in the waste act structure is the limited role played by the local governing body,which is the board of supervisors here.the board of supervisors does not evaluate the swf application,impose terms,or recommend issuance or denial of the swf permit.the board of supervisors may appoint a hearing panel or officer in the event of an administrative appeal,and may even appoint three of its own members as the panel but,significantly,the board of supervisors as a whole does not itself act as the hearing panel.nor is the local hearing panel,however constituted,the last available venue for administrative review.the local hearing panel decision may be appealed to calrecycle as the final administrative arbiter on an swf permit,subd.a.
we now consider the waste act intersection with ceqa.as noted earlier,issuance of an swf permit is a discretionary decision by a public agency implicating ceqa,which requires environmental review of both public projects and public agency approval of private projects,subd.g,subd.a.marin ehs,as the public agency with responsibility for issuing the requested swf permit,assumed the role of lead agency under ceqa.the term lead agency is defined as the public agency which has the principal responsibility for carrying out or approving a project.guidelines.where two or more public agencies will be involved with a project,the determination of which agency will be the lead agency is governed by specified criteria.guidelines.for private projects,the lead agency shall be the public agency with the greatest responsibility for supervising or approving the project as a whole.guidelines,subd.b.most land use projects require issuance of a conditional use permit by a city or county and thus t he lead agency will normally be the agency with general governmental powers,such as a city or county,rather than an agency with a single or limited purpose.guidelines,subd.b.but marin county is not the lead agency here.rli has an existing conditional use permit for operation of the landfill that was issued by marin county in,and that use permit remains effective.therefore,marin ehs,as the public agency with principal responsibility for issuing the requested swf permit,assumed the role of lead agency under ceqa,and its lead agency standing is unquestioned on appeal 
as the lead agency,marin ehs was responsible for preparing an eir,and certifying that the final eir was compliant with ceqa,subd.a guidelines,subd.a,subd.a,subd.a.guidelines,section et sequitur,permit staff members of the lead agency to perform certain tasks,including conducting initial studies and responding to public comments,but other tasks are deemed nondelegable and reserved exclusively for the agency decisionmaking body,including r eviewing and considering a final eir and making certain findings.california oak foundation regents of california th,quoting guidelines,subd.b.under ceqa,the decisionmaking body is any person or group of people within a public agency permitted by law to approve or disapprove the project at issue.california oak foundation,supra,at quoting guidelines.it is well settled that the decisionmaking body may be one or more individuals in the public agency it need not be composed of the agency as a whole.california oaks foundation,supra,at.here,the decisionmaking body was an individual philip smith,marin ehs deputy director in his capacity as the director of the marin county local enforcement agency designated by calrecycle,as stated in the resolution certifying the eir.
ceqa furthers provides if a nonelected decisionmaking body of a local lead agency certifies an environmental impact report that certification may be appealed to the agency elected decisionmaking body,if any,subd.c.ceqa guidelines expound on this rule when an eir is certified by a body within a local lead agency,that certification may be appealed to the local lead agency elected body,if one exists.for example,certification of an eir for a tentative subdivision map by a city planning commission may be appealed to the city council.each local lead agency shall provide for such appeals.guidelines,subd.b.
marin ehs certification of an eir for issuance of an swf permit is not appealable to t
