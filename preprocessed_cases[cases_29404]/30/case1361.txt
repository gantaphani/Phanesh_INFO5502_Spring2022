quebell parker and her children,sandra skypek and charles parker plaintiff,appeal the district court denial of her motion to show cause as to why scrap metal processors,smp and wayne maddox together defendant,have failed to comply with this court order in parker scrap metal processors,cir,to obtain a solid waste handling permit and to implement a legally sufficient storm water pollution prevention plan swppp.additionally,this court ordered a retrial as to damages only,on plaintiff state tort claims.rather than conduct the retrial,the district court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to c,which the plaintiff also appeals.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse as to the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction and the denial of the motion to show cause with regard to obtaining a solid waste handling permit.however,we affirm,without prejudice,the district court denial of the motion to show cause as to the implementation of the swppp.
background 
plaintiff family has owned the property at washington street,covington,georgia parker property for approximately fifty years.the adjacent property,at washington street defendant property,has had a metal yard operating on it since the or.wayne maddox took over the junkyard and scrap metal yard operation in or about,and acquired ownership of the property in.
plaintiff filed this action on april,against defendant and its predecessors in interest,alleging negligence,negligence per se,nuisance,trespass,violations of the clean water act cwa,the resource conservation and recovery act rcra,and various state environmental statutes.
on august,after a jury trial,the northern district of georgia entered judgment in favor of plaintiff on all counts.defendant was ordered to pay a total of million in damages to the plaintiff,and pay civil fines for its cwa and rcra violations to the government.defendant was further ordered to implement a storm water pollution prevention plan,and to obtain a solid waste handling permit from the georgia environmental protection division epd.
the defendant appealed the district court findings of liability under the cwa and the rcra,as well as the award of damages.parker scrap metal processors,cir.on september,this court upheld the findings of liability based upon the cwa and the rcra,but reversed the damages award because the district court did not instruct the jury that damages were only recoverable by a party that owned or occupied the parker property during the relevant time period.id.at.although parker children were included in the damage award,they did not own or occupy the parker property during the relevant time period.accordingly,this court ordered the district court hold a new trial on damages.id.at on remand the plaintiffs sought damages as to parker only.
on september,the district court ordered the parties to submit briefs addressing whether the court should exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state law damage claim.on september,plaintiffs submitted their motion to require defendants to show cause as to why the district court should not hold defendants in contempt for failing to comply with its august,order.plaintiffs alleged the defendants had failed to implement a legally sufficient swppp and had not obtained a solid waste handling permit,as per the orders of the district court and this court.
on december,the district court entered an order denying the plaintiff motion to show cause.the district court reasoned under rcra,defendants are deemed to have a and do not need any other solid waste handling permits and under the cwa,plaintiffs failed to provide clear and convincing evidence that defendants were in violation of the district court order to develop and implement a legally sufficient swppp.
the district court also declined to exercise jurisdiction over the new trial on damages,dismissing the action without prejudice,so it could be refiled in georgia state court.this appeal followed.
ii.standard of review 
there are three issues presented on appeal 
whether the district court erred in denying plaintiff motion to show cause as to why defendant had not obtained a solid waste handling permit.
ii.whether the district court erred in denying plaintiff motion to show cause as to why defendant had not implemented a legally sufficient storm water pollution prevention plan.

iii.analysis 
plaintiff argues the district court erred when it denied plaintiff motion to show cause as to why defendant should not be held in contempt for violating the district court order to obtain a solid waste handling permit,and to implement a legally sufficient swppp.plaintiff further argues the district court erred when it dismissed plaintiff case.we consider each of these issues in turn.
solid waste handling permit 
on august,the district court found defendant in violation of the rcra,and ordered that defendant take all reasonable steps to obtain a solid waste handling permit from the director of the epd.on appeal,this court upheld the district court finding of liability under the rcra and affirmed the district court order requiring the obtaining of a solid waste handling permit.parker scrap metal processors,cir.because we concluded in that case the defendant must apply for and obtain a solid waste handling permit,we now briefly review the analysis for that decision.
the rcra allows approved states to implement and enforce its provisions.b.georgia received approval to do so in,and enacted the comprehensive solid waste management act swma,ann.through,to regulate solid and hazardous waste.under the swma,a person generally must obtain a permit to handle solid waste.parker,at,citing.ann.
because the scrap metal and other materials on defendant property were found to be within georgia broad definition of solid waste,defendant was required to have a solid waste handling permit unless an exception to the permit requirement applied.parker,at.defendant contended the materials on the property were actually recovered materials,making the smp facility a recovered materials processing facility,eliminating the need for a solid waste handling permit because the swma excludes recovered materials from the definition of solid waste.ann.comp.regs.a.
however,even recovered materials,require a solid waste handling permit if they are accumulated speculatively.parker,at,citing.comp.regs.b.to prove materials are not accumulated speculatively,defendant would have to show during the preceding days the amount of material that is recycled,sold,used,or reused equals at least percent by weight or volume of the material received during that period and percent by weight or volume of all material proviously sic received and not recycled,sold,used,or reused and carried forward into that period.comp.regs.c.the district court found,and this court upheld,defendant waste was accumulated speculatively and must comply with all applicable regulations,which include applying for and obtaining a solid waste handling permit.parker,at.
on a contempt motion,the movant bears the initial burden of proving,by clear and convincing evidence,the defendant noncompliance with a court order.united states roberts,cir.in the instant case,plaintiff showed that there is no record the defendant has either applied or has attempted to apply for a solid waste handling permit with the epd.
once the movant makes a prima facie showing of a violation,the burden shifts to the alleged contemnor to produce detailed evidence specifically explaining why he can not comply.roberts,at,citing united states rylander,d.the burden of production is not satisfied by a mere assertion of inability.united states hayes,cir.defendant argues they are covered by a,pursuant to.comp.regs.defendant further argues that the epd acknowledged this fact,and thus,no solid waste handling permit is required.we disagree.
a is not sufficient if materials are accumulated speculatively.comp.regs.b.in its argument,defendant relies on two letters from the program manager of the epd solid waste management program,harold gillespie,and on an affidavit from epd employee,michael rodock.we consider each of these items in turn.
the first letter from gillespie,dated july,indicates that i f defendant is only engaged in the collection or handling of recyclable materials,like metals i am not aware of any other permits that would be required not only does this letter ignore the issue of whether materials are accumulated speculatively on defendant property,it also predates the district court order.it does not negate that the district court and this court found that materials are accumulated speculatively,nor does it overrule this court order to obtain a solid waste handling permit.
gillespie second letter is dated november.it states that it is a to his letter of july.it provides,in pertinent part,my july response was solely based upon the information provided in your july,letter and did not address the possibility that recovered materials may be accumulated speculatively or disposed of at your facility.in such cases,recovered materials are considered solid waste and a solid waste handling permit is required emphasis added.this letter clearly states that if recovered materials are accumulated speculatively,a solid waste handling permit is required.thus,because the district court and this court both found that materials are accumulated speculatively,defendant must obtain a solid waste handling permit.
the next piece of evidence defendant points to is an affidavit by michael rodock,the epd employee responsible for inspecting facilities to determine what type of permit,if any,the facility requires.rodock affidavit provides defendant f acility has been deemed to have a solid waste handling defendant permitting status is reflected in correspondence from epd dated november,july,and no other solid waste handling permit is necessary.it further provides rodock visited the f acility on october,and i t does not appear that there are recovered materials accumulated speculatively or disposed at the f acility.in consideration of this affidavit,the district court found that defendant was covered by a,and application for a solid waste handling permit was not necessary.
appellate courts have the power to issue mandates which are commands that can not be ignored.absent a supreme court decision to the contrary,district courts are compelled to follow mandates of appellate courts.litman massachusetts mutual life insurance company,cir citing in re sanford fork tool.sibbald united states,pet.a district court when acting under an appellate court mandate,can not vary it,or examine it for any other purpose than execution or give any other or further relief or review it,even for apparent error,upon a matter decided on appeal or intermeddle with it,further than to settle so much as has been remanded.id.at,citing in re sanford fork tool.sibbald united states,pet.internal quotes omitted.
in the instant case,this court affirmed the finding that recovered materials were being accumulated speculatively,and issued a mandate ordering defendant to obtain a solid waste handling permit.it is not within the district court power to second guess its or this court conclusion or revise this court order.the fact that rodock disagrees with this conclusion is irrelevant,even though he is an epd employee this court order to obtain a solid waste handling permit still stands,and neither the district court nor the defendant is permitted to ignore or modify that order.thus,we conclude the district court abused its discretion in denying plaintiff motion to show cause and finding that defendant was not required to seek a solid waste handling permit 
storm water pollution prevention plan 
on august,after finding defendant liable under the cwa,the district court ordered the defendant to develop and implement a legally sufficient storm water pollution prevention plan.this court affirmed that order in parker,at.
as stated previously,on a motion to show cause the movant bears the initial burden of proving,by clear and convincing evidence,that the alleged contemnors are in violation of a court order.reynolds alabama of,d,citing united states roberts,cir laitram cambridge wire cloth,united states hayes,cir citing northside realty associates united states,cir.in its december,order,the district court found that plaintiffs did not produce clear and convincing evidence that defendant had violated of the district court order to develop and implement a legally sufficient swppp.
the district court relied upon a november,affidavit of jason maddox,president of smp and son of defendant wayne maddox,in reaching its decision.the maddox affidavit explains that defendant has not been able to construct a storm water detention pond as per the swppp,due to financial constraints.such constraints include legal fees to cover litigation as well as the inability of smp and wayne maddox to procure loans due to this litigation.
jason maddox affidavit also describes defendant efforts to implement the swppp.smp has constructed a curb around the perimeter of its property and pumps collected storm water as necessary until it can afford to construct the required storm water detention pond,which it estimated to occur within days of the affidavit.plaintiff offers no evidence to the contrary.the facts that defendant has constructed a curb and is pumping storm water as necessary show there has been an effort to comply with the court order.we do not believe defendant failure to construct a storm water detention pond as of the show cause hearing is enough to provide clear and convincing evidence that the defendant violated a court order 
based upon the record,we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion when it found no violation of its order requiring the defendant to implement a legally sufficient swppp.however,given that nearly a year has passed since the district court ruling,this is without prejudice to the matter being revisited upon proper motion.
jurisdiction 
the district court has original jurisdiction over plaintiff claims under the rcra and cwa pursuant to jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims comes under the doctrine of supplemental or pendent jurisdiction outlined in united mine workers of america gibbs,d,and codified in the statute reflects a dichotomy between a district court power to exercise supplemental jurisdiction,a,and its discretion not to exercise such jurisdiction,c.lucero trosch,cir palmer hosp.auth.of randolph county,cir.section a authorizes a court to hear supplemental claims to the full extent allowed by the case or controversy standard of article iii of the constitution.palmer,at.the constitutional case or controversy standard confers supplemental jurisdiction over all state claims which arise out of a common nucleus of operative fact with a substantial federal claim.united mine workers of america gibbs,d palmer,at a federal court has the power under section a to exercise pendent jurisdiction over state claims which arise from the same occurrence and involve the same or similar evidence draper and son,cir a federal court may exercise pendent jurisdiction over state law claims deriving from a common nucleus of operative fact with a substantial federal claim.
in this case,the rcra and cwa claims are the substantial federal claims,and they arise out of a common nucleus of operative fact as the state claims,namely,smp operation of a junkyard adjacent to the parker property.the
