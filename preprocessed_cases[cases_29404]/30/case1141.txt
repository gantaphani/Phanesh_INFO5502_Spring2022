this case arises from claims that two dairies discharged pollutants into navigable waters of the united states without a permit and in violation of water quality standards.we are called upon to decide two central issues first,we must determine whether under the citizen suit provision of the clean water act cwa,the plaintiffs notice letter adequately notified the defendants of alleged violations.second,we must determine whether the district court erred by concluding that ongoing violations existed.the district court resolved both questions in favor of the plaintiffs and imposed penalties for proved violations.we affirm.
background 
the complaint filed by plaintiff community association for restoration of the environment care alleges that defendants henry bosma dairy,liberty dairy,henry bosma and bosma enterprises bosma operated and discharged pollutants without a national pollution discharge elimination system npdes permit.the complaint further alleged that the discharges were of a type which would not be allowed even with a npdes permit.the complaint also claimed that bosma discharged pollutants in violation of the washington general dairy npdes permit.
it is unlawful to discharge any pollutant into the united state waters except those discharges made in compliance with the cwa.see a.in order to lawfully discharge a pollutant,a npdes permit must be obtained.a,a.a npdes permit allows the holder to discharge pollutants at levels below thresholds incorporated in the permit.a et.
bosma owns and operates two dairies,the bosma and liberty dairies,in the yakima valley,in the central part of washington.the dairies are adjacent to one another and consist of four large parcels of property the dairies stable or confine approximately and dairy cattle.the dairies are supposed to be set up so that waste produced by the dairies is contained and stored in a lagoon.bosma permit states that the dairies may utilize dry storage and lagoon or waste pond storage for manure and farm waste.the dairies total waste capacity is months at volume.fifty acres are used for wastewater field application.with more than cattle,the dairies operate a concentrated animal feeding operation cafo.cafos are animal feeding operations where animals are stabled or confined for a total of days or more in any month period in an area where neither crops,vegetation or crop residue is sustained.c.as a cafo,bosma is subject to effluent guidelines,a,and is considered to be engaged in industrial activities.b i v.therefore,bosma must obtain an individual permit for storm water discharges.p b.admin.code.
bosma has a long history of compliance problems.soon after bosma began operating the hank bosma dairy in,washington dep t of ecology wadoe cited bosma for discharging manure waste to joint drain.starts above and runs along the east side of bosma property then southwest under kirk road and then south through bosma property down to the sunnyside valley irrigation canal canal and then to the yakima river.care bosma dairy,et,d.discharges into the canal during irrigation season,and into the granger drain which empties into the yakima river during season.a diversion box in uses wooden boards to direct flow to either the canal or the granger drain.in,wadoe directed bosma to obtain a npdes permit.bosma ignored this request.wadoe repeated this request in,and.each time bosma refused.over this period of time,wadoe received several complaints of discharge into the drain and also cited bosma for verified discharges into.
on january,bosma was issued a general dairy permit for the bosma dairy.pursuant to federal law,the state of washington has adopted a washington general dairy permit which it issues to cafos consisting of dairy operations.see.admin.code.at bosma request the permit was modified to include both the bosma and liberty dairies on january,the same day care filed its complaint.pursuant to the cwa,a state is authorized to create and administer its own permit program,provided that program meets the requirements established by the cwa and is approved by the epa.b.in washington,dairies are regulated by a general dairy permit and a dairy waste management plan dwmp.wadoe administers and enforces permits for operators of concentrated dairy animal feeding operations,where required by federal regulations or state law or upon request of a dairy producer.e west.wadoe has the lead enforcement responsibility 
pursuant to federal regulations,wadoe adopted a dairy farm national pollutant discharge elimination system and state waste discharge general permit washington general dairy permit which it issues to cafos.wash admin.code.a dairy can seek an individual or general npdes permit.dairy operations that require site specific conditions to protect water quality are issued an individual permit.pursuant to washington revised code,the local conservation district provides assistance to the department and dairy producers in implementing a dairy nutrient management program the local conservation district in this case is the south yakima conservation district sycd.wadoe referred bosma to the sycd for technical assistance in developing a dwmp,which is required for the npdes permit.the washington general dairy permit issued to bosma states with regard to surface water effluent limitations 
there shall be no discharge of process waters to surface waters of the state,except for overflow from facilities designed,constructed and maintained to contain process waste unless such a discharge is due to or a direct result of a,rain fall event for that location.this permit does not authorize any discharge of process waste that would result in the violation of state surface water quality standards.
if a citizen believes that an entity has violated either the act,the limitation of its permit,or both,federal law allows the citizen to bring suit against the alleged violator.
on october,care sent bosma a day notice of its intent to sue bosma under the citizen suit provision of the federal cwa.the notice advised bosma of care intent to sue for alleged illegal discharges.on january,care filed its complaint seeking civil penalties for the violations as well as for alleged violations set forth in an appendix to the complaint appendix b.care complaint alleged three counts operation and discharge without a npdes permit discharges in violations of the washington general dairy npdes permit and discharges causing violations of water quality standards.
the district court resolved the following issues on summary judgment which relate to this appeal 
care provided adequate notice of its claims under b and.the court held that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the alleged violations contained in appendix b of the complaint because those violations were sufficiently similar to those contained in the notice.
the court had no jurisdiction over allegations of violations relating to and haford highway because the notice contained no information which would enable bosma to identify those areas as locations of discharge violations.the court limited this ruling to precluding care from seeking penalties for alleged discharges at these locations.however,the court expressed no opinion and reserved ruling on whether evidence of manure wastes produced and applied at these locations was admissible at trial.
bosma dairies are cafos.thus,they are point sources subject to the npdes permit requirement and can not discharge animal waste without such a permit or in violation of an npdes permit.the cafos include the ground where the animals are confined,the lagoons and any equipment used to distribute or apply the animal waste product at the confinement area.
care can enforce the effluent limitations contained in washington dairy farm national pollution discharge elimination system and state waste discharge general permit.

after the liability portion of the trial,the court found that care proved violations.the district court found that as of the date of the filing of the complaint,january,there was a continuing violation and a reasonable likelihood of recurrent violations of the following discharges of wastewater from a truck wash to,misapplication or overapplication of animal wastewaters to a acre field which would flow down the slope east into,and a long history of repeated violations resulting from discharges to and the canal due to operation and maintenance of the dairies.the court did find,however,that care failed to prove continuing violations or reasonable likelihood of recurrent violations relating to bosma operating without an npdes permit and to seepage and capacity of the storage ponds.
in the penalty phase of the trial,the court ordered bosma to pay in civil penalties.the court awarded care attorney fees in the amount of.bosma appeals the district court order.in addition,care appeals the court award of attorney fees and penalties imposed.
care alleged subject matter jurisdiction in the federal district court based on a a and.bosma contested the district court subject matter jurisdiction.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.

statutory requirements 
we first turn to the statutory requirements particular to the citizen suit provision of the cwa.under the cwa private citizens may sue any person alleged to be in violation of the conditions of an effluent standard or limitation under the act or of an order issued with respect to such a standard or limitation by the administrator of the environmental protection agency epa or any state.see a.citizens may not bring suit until they have given days notice of their intent to sue to the alleged violator,as well as to the administrator and the state in which the alleged violation occurs.b a.the cwa does not describe the content of the required notice,but directs that n otice shall be given in such a manner as the administrator shall prescribe by regulation.b.the epa has adopted such regulation,which mandate as follows 
notice regarding an alleged violation of an effluent standard or limitation or of an order with respect thereto,shall include sufficient information to permit the recipient to identify the specific standard,limitation,or order alleged to constitute a violation,the person or persons responsible for the alleged violation,the date or dates of such violation,and the full name,address,and telephone number of the person giving notice.
a.the supreme court has interpreted this notice requirement as serving two purposes to give the alleged violator an opportunity to bring itself into compliance with the act and thus likewise render unnecessary a citizen suit.gwaltney of smithfield,chesapeake bay foundation,d.
in a series of cases beginning with hallstrom tillamook county,d,courts have attempted to clarify the citizen suit notice requirement and have strictly construed the requirements listed in the epa guidelines.in hallstrom,the court held that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs action because the plaintiffs had failed to give any notice to the epa or the appropriate state agency.id.at.although hallstrom did not speak directly to the issue of what constitutes sufficient notice under the applicable regulation,a number of courts have found guidance in the hallstrom court rationale for strict interpretation of environmental statute notice requirements.in washington trout mccain foods,cir,we interpreted hallstrom to require strict compliance with all aspects of the notice requirement set out by the epa and held that the plaintiffs failure to include their identities,addresses,and phone numbers in the notice letter required dismissal of the suit.atwell kw plastics recycling,d,interpreting the notice requirement strictly cal.sportfishing prot.alliance city of sacramento,concluding that monitoring and effluent violations are distinct and that the plaintiff must give notice of each because imprecise notice does not fulfill purpose of notice requirement.
however,in recent years some courts have taken a more liberal interpretation of the notice requirements.the third circuit,the only circuit to have considered the adequacy of a notice which failed to include additional violations listed in the complaint as that at issue here,held that a citizen plaintiff initial notice of discharge violations was broad enough to encompass additional discharge,monitoring,reporting,and record keeping violations occurring during and after the date of the notice letter.pub.interest research group hercules,cir.these claims,however,have to be of the same type.id.at see also,comfort lake ass n,dresel contracting,cir agreeing with hercules that a citizen suit is limited to violations that are closely related to and of the same type as the violations specified in the notice of intent to sue.although the notice must be sufficiently adequate so that the recipients can identify the basis for the complaint,the citizen is not required to list every specific aspect or detail of every alleged violation.nor is the citizen required to describe every ramification of a violation.hercules,at.hercules overall sufficiency approach focused on the purpose of the notice requirement to provide the recipient with effective,as well as timely notice.atl.states legal found.stroh die casting,cir stating that the notice must be sufficiently detailed to allow the alleged violator to know what it is doing wrong so that it will know what corrective actions will prevent a lawsuit.like in hercules,the plaintiffs complaint listed violations that were not specifically listed in the notice.
as in hercules,care notice satisfies the goals of the cwa citizen suit provision.the notice must include 
sufficient information to permit the recipient to identify the specific standard,limitation,or order alleged to constitute a violation,the person or persons responsible for the alleged violation,the date or dates of such violation,and the full name,address,and telephone number of the person giving notice.
a.following the rule of strict compliance we are unable to discern any failure on care part to satisfy the statutory requirements.care notice included all of the information required by the epa regulations.neither the cwa nor the epa regulations require plaintiffs to provide an exhaustive list of all violations.see,atlantic states,at holding that plaintiff notice of specific violations at defendant outfall was sufficient to encompass later violations at outfall when the defendant to outfall that the notice provided the defendant with sufficient information to correct the violation.the key language in the notice regulation is the phrase sufficient information to permit the recipient to identify the alleged violations and bring itself into compliance.
care notice letter listed the following violations 
illegal discharges occurred on at least the following dates 
the appendix b violations added in the complaint read as follows 
violations at bosma and liberty dairies discovered by plaintiffs after sending the october,notice of intent to sue 
the appendix b discharge violations are sufficiently similar to those contained in the notice and allowing plaintiffs to sue on these violations does not undermine the purpose of the citizen suit provision or the requirements established by the epa.first,care,in its notice letter,provided bosma with a range of dates during which the violations later listed in appendix b occurred.see,cal.sportfishing.at stating that the date or dates of the violation must be stated with some specificity and while it would be best if the plaintiff provided the specific date,the plaintiff should at least give a range as to the date that is reasonably limited.the appendix b violations occurred within the same time frame,at times the same month,as allegations listed in care notice.brandywine indus.paper,chemical leaman tank lines,wl,at holding that the notice given by the plaintiffs was not sufficiently specific because it failed to provide an average general range of the dates of the cwa and cercla violations.
second,the violations alleged by care,both in the complaint and the notice,are that the two dairies,which milk cows in a confined space,produce manure which runs into a single drain.the violations originated from the same source,the cafo dairies,which deposited the same waste material,manure,into clearly identifiable navigable waters of the.thus,in essence all of the alleged violations are a single violation that repeated over a span of time.see atlantic states,at in practical terms,the notice must be sufficiently specific to inform the alleged violator about what it is doing wrong,so that it will know what corrective actions will avert a lawsuit the key to notice is to give the accused company the opportunity to correct the problem.furthermore,the waters into which bosma allegedly discharged manure is a small,identifiable strip of the drain.the notice sent by care,as well as the additional discharges listed in the complaint,stated that manure was discharged to.the district court noted that joint drain can be walked from its southern point on bosma property to the northern point on bosma property in to minutes.care henry bosma dairy,et,d.in addition,bosma had an extensive complaint and verified discharges history with wadoe that made both parties acutely aware of the location and course of.id.therefore,care notice provided sufficient detail to bosma and the relevant agencies.
as the third circuit stated in hercules,does not compel a finding that a citizen must give notice to recipients of each individual violation of a specific discharge limitation.at.the court reasoned that 
if a permit holder has discharged pollutant x in excess of the permitted effluent limit five times in a month but the citizen has learned of only four violations,the citizen will give notice of the four violations of which the citizen then has knowledge but should be able to include the fifth violation in the suit when it is discovered.whether the agency or the permit holder is informed of four or five excess discharges of pollutant x will probably make no difference in a decision to bring about compliance.
id.in creating the citizen suit provision,congress sought to strike a balance between encouraging citizen enforcement of environmental regulations and avoiding burdening the federal courts with excessive numbers of citizen suits.hallstrom,at.the purpose of the day notice is to provide the agencies and the defendant with information on the cause and type of environmental laws or orders the defendant is allegedly violating so that the agencies can step in,investigate,and bring the defendant into compliance.the point is to trigger agency enforcement and avoid a lawsuit.congress did not intend to unduly burden citizens by requiring them to basically carry out the job of the agency.based on the fact that the violations originated from the same source,were of the same nature,and were easily identifiable,we find that care notice was adequate.the notice allowed bosma to identify the violations contained therein and in appendix 
ii.ongoing violations 
when reviewing a district court conclusion that there was an ongoing violation of the cwa,the ninth circuit reviews findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo.southwest marine,at.
to prevail at trial,a must prove an ongoing violation.gwaltney of smithfield,chesapeake bay found,d.a citizen plaintiff may prove ongoing violations either by proving violations that continue on or after the date the complaint is filed or by adducing evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could find a continuing likelihood of a recurrence in intermittent or sporadic violations.sierra club union oil,cir internal quotations omitted.this circuit has confirmed that i ntermittent or sporadic violations do not cease to be ongoing until the date when there is no real likelihood of repetition.id.internal quotations omitted.
the district court found that as of the date of the filing of the complaint,january,there was a continuing violation and a reasonable likelihood of recurrent violations of the following discharges of wastewater from the truck wash to,misapplication or overapplication of animal wastewaters to the acre field which would flow down the slope east into,and a long history of repeated violations resulting from discharges to and the canal due to operation and maintenance of the dairies.bosma,d at.we find that the record supports the district court conclusions.
truck wash 
bosma argues that there was no evidence that any water from the truck wash discharged into navigable waters of the.this argument lacks merit.the district court held that on january,when care filed its complaint there was evidence of a continuing violation of the cwa due to discharges of wastewater from the truck wash to.the court noted that in the dwmp stated that wastewater from the vehicle wash area was piped to the sunnyside valley irrigation drain svid.although bosma argued that the drain was capped in march of,the court found that bosma had not presented sufficient evidence to prove that this condition was not a continuing violation.the court pointed to specific evidence that belied bosma claim that the drain was capped.the court noted that if the drain had been capped bosma would have notified the person he hired to review the dwmp and the dairy facilities that such condition had now been corrected.the court findings are supported by evidence,and,accordingly are not clearly erroneous.
of wastewaters 
bosma argues that the district court erred in finding an ongoing violation with regards to the acre field.we disagree.the court relied on testimony presented at the trial of residents who live in the area who stated that they had seen manure wastewater applied to the field and spilling into the canal.thus,the district court found that bosma was overapplying or misapplying manure wastewater to the field and that the topography of the field indicated that the wastewater would flow down the slope east into.notwithstanding bosma argument,we may not disturb this finding since it is supported by evidence.
discharges 
the district court held that bosma history of a variety of repeated violations of the cwa resulting from discharges to and the canal makes it likely that there will be intermittent discharges to and the canal.the court based its findings on the poor operation and maintenance of the dairies.wadoe had cited bosma for several verified discharges over the years.bosma did not dispute these verified discharges and often failed to pay the penalties until pressured by wadoe.testimony,photos,and video showed that bosma had placed deposits of manure in proximity to the water after care filed suit.in addition,witnesses testified that they saw manure water spilling into the canal.the district court did not err in finding that care proved the existence of ongoing violations by showing that such violations had a likelihood of recurring.
iii.other issues raised on appeal 
waters of the united states 
we find that the district court did not err in finding that fits under the definition of navigable waters.
the cwa defines navigable waters as waters of the united states.in headwaters,talent irrigation district,cir,our circuit held that irrigation canals are waters of the united states because they are tributaries to other waters of the united states.a stream which contributes its flow to a larger stream or other body of water is a tributary.id.at.our circuit reasoned that e ven tributaries that flow intermittently are waters of the united states.id.at.as the district court noted,at three points in the svid,water in the canal is returned to the yakima river.the yakima river falls within the definition of waters of the united states and no parties dispute this.the svid takes water out of the yakima river at parker dam in the spring of each year.the water runs through the canal bringing water to the land serviced by the canal.water runs back to the canal through a series of returns composed of water not used by irrigators and irrigation runoff.the drainage supervisor,shuck,and the district manager for svid,trull,testified that eventually drains into the yakima river by way of either the granger drain or the canal.during the winter months,water from the drain empties into the granger drain,which empties into
