cholla ready mix,cholla appeals the district court dismissal of its complaint alleging that arizona state officials policy against using materials mined from woodruff butte in state construction projects violates its rights under the establishment clause,and,and the arizona constitution.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
background 
dale mckinnon,who is cholla sole shareholder,and his family own a portion of woodruff butte in,the mckinnon family leased part of woodruff butte and began mining it for aggregate materials used primarily for road construction.shortly after mining operations began,the hopi tribe,zuni pueblo,and navajo nation collectively,the tribes passed resolutions against the mining because of woodruff butte religious,cultural,and historical significance to these groups.in june,the arizona department of transportation adot granted a commercial source number allowing materials mined from the butte to be used in state highway construction projects.in september,the mckinnons bought the mined portion of woodruff butte.
the mining of woodruff butte led to a variety of disputes and litigation involving the tribes,cholla,construction contractors,and various arizona and federal officials and agencies.in response,adot adopted strategies to discourage the use of materials from woodruff butte in state construction projects.in,adot promulgated new commercial source regulations,which require each applicant for a commercial source number to submit an environmental assessment ea that considers,inter alia,adverse effects on places eligible for listing on the national register of historic places nrhp.woodruff butte was declared eligible for listing on the nrhp in or around.on june,adot denied cholla application for a new commercial source number because of the projected adverse effects on historic property on woodruff butte.without a commercial source number,cholla can not provide aggregate materials for state highway construction projects,but cholla remains free to sell its materials in the private market.
on june,cholla filed suit in district court against various government officials alleging that the policy against using materials from the butte in state construction projects violates cholla rights under the establishment clause,federal civil rights laws,and the arizona constitution.the district court granted cholla motion for leave to file an amended complaint,but then granted the state defendants motion to dismiss.after the district court denied cholla motion for reconsideration and granted its request for certification of final judgment against the state defendants,cholla timely filed a notice of appeal to this court.

iii.discussion 
eleventh amendment immunity 
cholla appeals the district court holdings that the eleventh amendment bars its state law claims and its claim for damages under title vi,
damages under title vi 
congress abrogated state immunity from damages under title vi.see a alexander sandoval,d miranda kitzhaber,cir.although we affirm on other grounds,we conclude that the district court erred by holding that the eleventh amendment bars cholla claims for damages under.
state law claims 
as the district court held,all of cholla state law claims are barred by the eleventh amendment,which precludes the adjudication of pendent state law claims against nonconsenting state defendants in federal courts.see pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d raygor regents of of,d ashker cal.dep t of,cir 
cholla reliance on piatt macdougall,cir to revive its state law claims as a substantive part of its claim is misplaced.piatt held that where a state statute provides prisoners a right to compensation for their work,they can bring a claim alleging that the state revoked their right to pay without due process.id.at.piatt recognizes that,because a due process claim necessarily fails if the plaintiff has no property interest in the relevant property,a federal due process claim may succeed or fail depending on whether the plaintiff has a cognizable property interest under state law.id.at.however,piatt does not permit plaintiffs to sue in federal court under solely for violations of state law.thus,piatt is of no help to cholla.
statutes of limitations 
the statutes providing cholla federal causes of action,and,do not contain their own statutes of limitations,so courts borrow the most appropriate state statute of limitations.see wilson garcia,d.for these claims,we borrow arizona statute of limitations for personal injury claims.see wilson,at.holding that the statute of limitations for personal injury claims applies in suits addisu fred meyer,cir claims citing goodman lukens steel,d taylor regents of of,cir claims the applicable statute of limitations for personal injury claims in arizona is two years.see.tworivers lewis,cir.thus,the district court correctly concluded that cholla only timely claim is its challenge to the rejection of its application for a commercial source number.this claim brings into play cholla allegations of an establishment clause violation and discrimination on account of race.
cholla argues that under the continuing violations doctrine,it may challenge defendants ongoing policy against the use of materials from woodruff butte.discrete acts are not actionable if time barred,even if related to acts alleged in timely filed charges.see national passenger morgan,d carpinteria valley farms,county of santa barbara,cir rk ventures,city of seattle,cir.nonetheless,the time bar makes little difference to cholla requests for declaratory and injunctive relief.by challenging the denial of cholla application for a commercial source number,without which cholla aggregate materials can not be used in state construction projects,cholla is challenging arizona policy against using materials from woodruff butte.moreover,acts occurring more than two years before cholla filed suit may be relevant background material in support of its timely claim.morgan,at.
establishment clause claim 
cholla alleges that the defendants policy against using materials from woodruff butte in state construction projects violates the establishment clause of the first amendment.on appeal,cholla emphasizes the liberal notice pleading requirements and argues that the district court improperly evaluated the strength of cholla claim.accepting as true the facts alleged and construing them in the light most favorable to cholla,we conclude that the district court properly dismissed this claim.no evidence could bolster cholla establishment clause claim because it is premised on flawed analysis of the governing law.
government conduct does not violate the establishment clause if it has a secular purpose,its principal or primary effect is not to advance or inhibit religion,and it does not foster excessive government entanglement with religion.see,lemon kurtzman,d.particular attention is paid to whether the challenged action has the purpose or effect of endorsing religion.county of allegheny aclu,d.
secular purpose 
it is clear from cholla complaint that defendants actions have the secular purpose of carrying out state construction projects in a manner that does not harm a site of religious,historical,and cultural importance to several native american groups and the nation as a whole.
putting aside for now the historical and cultural importance of woodruff butte,the s
