discussion 
the leading ohio case on is belvedere condominium unit owners ass roark,ohio.in belvedere,the ohio supreme court announced a test to determine if a shareholder is liable for the wrongdoing of the corporation of which he is an owner.the three prongs are 
control over the corporation by those to be held liable was so complete that the corporation had no separate mind,will,or existence of its own 
control over the corporation by those to be held liable was exercised in such a manner as to commit fraud or an illegal act against the person seeking to disregard the corporate entity and 
injury or unjust loss resulted to the plaintiff from such control and wrong.
belvedere,ohio at,at.
in this case,there is no real argument about the second and third prongs.there is no dispute that was harmed by dixie violation of cercla,or that denune used his control over the corporation to cause it to violate the law.denune focuses his attack on the first prong.he claims the district court erred by regarding control of the illegal transaction as sufficient,rather than analyzing the question of control using the factors set out in leroux billyle supper club ma,ohio app d.he also claims the result the district court reached is contrary to the rule of bestfoods,supra,because it imposes liability on denune in the same circumstances in which the court in bestfoods held liability under cercla could not be imposed.we review these questions of law de novo.see women medical professional voinovich,cir.
sufficiency of control to prove the first belevedere element

the decision in belvedere came down two years after the decision in leroux billyle.even after belvedere,ohio courts have continued to use a approach when deciding whether to pierce the corporate veil.see,tandem staffing abc automation packing,wl,ohio app.lexis,at,willoway nurseries curdes,wl,ohio app.lexis,at,barents navigation,western overseas,serv d cbc.but because of the equitable nature of the doctrine,no list of factors can be exclusive or exhaustive.in global information solutions union tank car,d,a cercla case involving a analysis under ohio law,the court held 
as noted in leroux,the ohio supreme court endorses the notion that the corporate veil could be pierced if an injustice would result.several ohio appellate courts have been even more expansive and chose to disregarded sic the corporate entity all together sic where evidence of harm,injustice,or fundamental unfairness has been found.
id.at citations omitted.the court also noted that congress enacted cercla with the intent of ensuring that those responsible for any damage,environmental harm,or injury from chemical poisons bear the costs of their actions.courts applying state veil piercing law in conjunction with a cercla action must keep this statute broad legislative purpose in mind.id.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
