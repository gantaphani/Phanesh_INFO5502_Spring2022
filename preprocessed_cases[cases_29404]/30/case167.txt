the appellants in this action are eleven public health,environmental,religious and farmworker organizations,including the natural resources defense council collectively,the nrdc appellants.they appeal from judge lynch dismissal of their complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
the complaint challenged the environmental protection agency epa decision to leave in effect certain pesticide tolerances,the maximum permissible amount of pesticide residues on food for five pesticides after a systematic tolerance reassessment program required by the food quality protection act of,stat.judge lynch dismissed the complaint after concluding that h required such challenges to be reviewed only in the courts of appeals after exhausting administrative review processes.on appeal,the nrdc appellants argue that section h governs judicial review only of epa decisions to establish,modify,or revoke tolerances and that decisions to leave tolerances in effect are reviewable in the district courts pursuant to the administrative procedure act apa,et.
background 
a statutory and regulatory scheme 
the epa regulates agricultural pesticides under two interrelated statutes the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act ffdca,and the federal insecticide,fungicide,and rodenticide act fifra.
fifra imposes a federal licensing scheme on the sale,distribution,and use of pesticides.a no person in any state may distribute or sell to any person any pesticide that is not registered under fifra.a pesticide may not be registered unless the epa determines that it will not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.id.c d.these environmental effects are analyzed,in part,by referencing the ffdca and the human dietary risk that might arise from pesticide residues in or on food.id.bb.
to ensure the safety of consumers of food,the ffdca empowers the epa to establish tolerances,which set the maximum permissible level of pesticide residue on a particular food,or to grant exemptions from the tolerance requirement.a c.before any agricultural commodity containing pesticide residue can be sold or distributed,a tolerance or exemption meeting certain safety standards must be promulgated by the epa.a,a b,a.if no tolerance or exemption is established,any food containing pesticide residue is deemed unsafe and adulterated and may not be moved in interstate commerce.id.
the epa may establish or leave in effect a tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a food only if the administrator determines that the tolerance is safe.id.b a i.the term safe is defined to mean that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue,including all anticipated dietary exposures and all other exposures for which there is reliable information.id.b a ii.any tolerance that is not safe must be modified or revoked.id.b a i.if a pesticide is used on more than one food crop,a separate tolerance or exemption must be established for each combination.
in,both fifra and the ffdca were amended by the food quality protection act fqpa,stat.the fqpa required that the epa reassess the safety of all added to the ffdca a range of detailed,scientific factors to be considered in the assessment of pesticide risks.b c d.included in these factors were new requirements pertaining to the safety of infants,children,and other major identifiable subgroups.id.b c an additional tenfold margin of safety shall be applied for infants and children unless the epa on the basis of reliable data establishes a different margin of safety that will be safe for infants and children see also id.b d iv,vi,vii.section q established a timetable for the reassessment of the preexisting tolerances were to be completed by august,were to be completed by august,and were to be completed by august.id.q.
under section j,a tolerance fqpa enactment shall remain in effect unless modified or revoked under subsection d or e of this section,and shall be subject to review under section q.id.j.in conducting its review of a particular tolerance under section q,the epa must determine whether it meets the requirements of subsections b or c,and if it does not,issue a regulation under subsection d or e of this section to modify or revoke the tolerance or exemption.id.q.
a reassessment review under section q,therefore,leads to one of two outcomes if the epa determines that the tolerance meets the new safety standards of section b,the epa leaves the tolerance in effect,and it is considered reassessed under section q if the epa finds the tolerance to be unsafe under section b,then it must modify or revoke the tolerance pursuant to sections d or e.id.q.
the establishment,revocation,or modification of a tolerance occurs under the procedures set forth in sections d g.id.d g.section d describes the procedures by which the epa may establish,modify or revoke a tolerance in response to a petition from the general public.id.d any person may file with the administrator a petition proposing the issuance of a regulation establishing,modifying,or revoking a tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a food.upon receiving a petition,the epa must first determine whether the petition meets the requirements governing petition contents.id.d.if the requirements are met,the epa must publish a notice of the petition filing within thirty days.id.d.after publishing the notice,the epa must issue a final regulation establishing,modifying,or revoking the tolerance issue a proposed regulation under the provisions of section e and follow the procedures therein or issue an order denying the petition.id.d a.
section e describes the procedures by which the epa may,on its own initiative,issue a regulation establishing,modifying,suspending or revoking a tolerance.under section e,the epa must issue a notice of proposed rulemaking and generally provide at least sixty days for public comment before issuing a final regulation.
once a regulation or order is issued pursuant to sections d or e,any person may file objections to the regulation or order within sixty days of its issuance,specifying with particularity the provisions of the regulation or order deemed objectionable and stating reasonable grounds therefor.id.g a.a public evidentiary hearing on the objections may be held,id.g b,but a s soon as practicable after receiving the arguments of the parties,the administrator shall issue an order stating the action taken upon each such objection and setting forth any revision to the regulation or prior order that the administrator has found to be warranted.id.g c.
the only provision relating to judicial review in section is subsection h.id.h.under section h,
i n a case of actual controversy as to the validity of any regulation issued under subsection e c of,or any order issued under subsection f c or g c of any person who will be adversely affected by such order or regulation may obtain judicial review by filing in the united states courts of appeals a petition praying that the order or regulation be set aside in whole or in part.
id.h.in sweeping language,section h provides that a ny issue as to which review is or was obtainable under this subsection shall not be the subject of judicial review under any other provision of law.id.h.
b epa implementation of the fqpa amendments 
much of the tolerance reassessment program has been conducted concurrently with a similar program under fifra to pesticide registrations.see.the epa has frequently used reregistration eligibility decisions reds and interim reregistration eligibility decisions ireds to announce its decisions on tolerance reassessment and pesticide.see.june.
reds for two pesticides at issue in this case,alachlor and captan,were issued in and,respectively.epa,reregistration eligibility decision red alachlor available at http hereinafter alachlor red epa,reregistration eligibility decision red captan available,as amended,at hereinafter captan red.concluding that the established tolerances for alachlor,with amendments and changes as specified in this document,meet the safety standards under the fqpa amendments,the epa determined that of tolerances,five should be revoked and six should be modified to contain an increased tolerance value.alachlor red at.making similar findings with respect to captan,the epa found that of the tolerances needed some sort of adjustment.captan red at.
the three other pesticides at issue in this case,diazinon,disulfoton,and,are members of a large group of pesticides known as organophosphates,which share a common mechanism of toxicity and whose exposure can cause cumulative effects on humans.see.because the epa determined that the cumulative risks of several organophosphates,including diazinon,disulfoton,and,made at most minimal or negligible contributions to the overall risk associated with organophosphates,the tolerances for these organophosphates were maintained regardless of the outcome of the organophosphate cumulative assessment and any potential regulatory action taken as a result of that assessment,see also,july,may.
c district court proceedings 
on september,the nrdc appellants filed the present action on december,an amended complaint was filed challenging the epa reassessment and retention of tolerances for pairs involving five pesticides alachlor,captan,diazinon,disulfoton,and.specifically,the nrdc appellants argued that the epa decision to leave these tolerances in effect after reassessment was improper because i the epa ignored its statutory duty under the ffdca to include an additional tenfold margin on safety in order to protect infants and children ii the epa failed to designate the children of farmworkers as a major identifiable subgroup especially vulnerable to the reassessed pesticides iii for eleven organophosphates,the epa left in effect tolerances whose level exceeded the safe level for children iv for tolerances,the epa erroneously reduced the acute dietary risk posed by the pesticide by relying on data based on the estimated percentage of the crop treated with the pesticide and v in violation of fifra,the epa unlawfully relied on a confidential,proprietary computer model developed by the pesticide industry to conduct organophosphate tolerance reassessments.
on march,the district court granted a motion to intervene on behalf of an association of pesticide manufacturers and distributors and several of its member companies the croplife appellees.all appellees moved to dismiss the amended complaint on the ground that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the language of section h specifically precluded district court review of the nrdc appellants challenges.
after holding that the disputed tolerance reassessments were final agency actions,the district court granted the motions to dismiss.it held that section h established an exclusive procedure for obtaining judicial review and confined such review to the courts of appeals.new york united states epa,d.judicial review in the district courts under the apa was therefore unavailable.
more specifically,the court found that the language of section h 
clearly demonstrates congress intent to preclude other avenues of review for determinations issued under the subsections to which it applies.moreover,the provision broad language,specifying that it covers any issue as to which review is or was obtainable,indicates an intention to sweep in any challenge to an agency action that could have been appealed through the procedures it references,regardless of whether such internal review was actually pursued.that is,subsection h explicitly applies not merely to cases in which administrative review was pursued,such that appellate review is obtainable under subsection h,but also to cases in which such review was obtainable had the appropriate steps been taken.a litigant challenging an administrative decision governed by these provisions thus can not,by skipping the internal review procedures of subsection g,avoid the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals and proceed instead to the district courts under the apa,by arguing that,in the absence of an order under subsection g c,subsection h is inapplicable.
id.at.the district court concluded that the nrdc appellants could have challenged the epa reassessment decisions using the procedures of section d,by filing a petition to establish,modify,or revoke a in motion a chain of events leading to judicial review under section h.because a determination to leave an existing tolerance in effect would be reviewable in exactly the same manner as any existing tolerance,determinations made pursuant to subsection q to leave tolerances in place should not be treated any differently than decisions to modify or revoke them.id.at.
the district court also dismissed the nrdc appellants claims of jurisdiction under fifra.id.at.the district court held that because section h limited review under any other provision of law,fifra grant of jurisdiction is irrelevant.id.at.because the nrdc appellants challenge the registration of pesticides under fifra only through their challenge to the tolerances set under the fdca,fifra did not represent an independent source of jurisdiction in this case.id.at.
discussion 
a standard of review 
when reviewing a district court rule b determination of its subject matter jurisdiction,we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo.wake united states,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.moreover the court must take all facts alleged in the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiff.sweet sheahan,cir.
b judicial review under the apa 
the apa provides that a person suffering legal wrong because of agency action,or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute,is entitled to judicial review thereof.this provision permits review of final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.id.however,review under the apa may be excepted where i statutes preclude judicial review or ii agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.id.a.these exceptions are construed narrowly and apply only if there is clear and convincing evidence of legislative intention to preclude review.japan whaling ass am.cetacean soc y,d see also abbott labs.gardner,d,abrogated on other grounds by califano sanders,d.
whether and to what extent a particular statute precludes judicial review is determined not only from its express language,but also from the structure of the statutory scheme,its objectives,its legislative history,and the nature of the administrative action involved.block cmty.nutrition,d see also bowen michigan acad.of family physicians,d the presumption favoring judicial review may be overcome by specific language or inferences of intent drawn from the statutory scheme as a whole.indeed,the clear and convincing evidence standard is met,and the presumption favoring judicial review overcome,whenever the congressional intent to preclude judicial review is fairly discernable in the statutory scheme.block,at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.however,the clear and convincing evidence standard is a useful reminder to the courts that,where substantial doubt about the congressional intent exists,the general presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action is controlling.id.at.
before addressing the nrdc appellants arguments that the apa provides for judicial review in the district court,we must determine whether the challenged decisions represent final agency action.if the decision to leave certain tolerances in place is not final action,apa review would be inappropriate.see in re sec ex rel.glotzer,cir judicial review under apa is expressly conditioned,under apa,on the existence of a final agency action.citing darby cisneros,d.we agree with the district court that the tolerance reassessments challenged were final agency actions and adopt its reasoning.
c judicial review under the ffdca 
because the epa tolerance reassessments represent final agency action,the apa permits review in the district court unless it is fairly discernable that section precludes judicial review.block,at.in analyzing whether section precludes judicial review under the apa,we first note that the fdca is unique in that it only commits certai
