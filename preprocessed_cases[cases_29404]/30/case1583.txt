appellants bass enterprises production,perry bass,lee bass,sid bass,thru line,keystone,enron oil gas,sid bass,edward bass,robert bass,lee bass,and reagan legg collectively bass appeal from the united states court of federal claims decision dismissing bass claim that the bureau of land management blm delay in approving bass applications for permits to drill apd oil and gas wells constituted a temporary taking requiring compensation from the government.bass enters.prod.united states,fed.cl.because the blm delay permitted the government to critically evaluate whether the proposed wells would cause the release of radioactive material from an underground nuclear waste storage facility,this court finds that the blm delay was not an extraordinary delay and,moreover,the penn central factors were not satisfied.we therefore affirm the court of federal claims dismissal of bass takings claim.
background 
bass owns interests in federal oil and gas lease,which was initially conveyed by the government to bass in.the current dispute concerns bass lease of mineral rights on acres of the south half of section,township south,range east,in eddy county,new mexico,near carlsbad the lease.the lease conveys to bass the exclusive right and privilege to drill for,mine,extract,remove,and dispose of all oil and gas deposits except helium in the lands covered by the lease,subject to all reasonable regulations of the secretary of the interior now or hereafter in force when not inconsistent with any express and specific provision.
in,the government withdrew approximately acres in eddy county from appropriation under public land laws and began to study the feasibility of a waste isolation pilot plant wipp to provide for underground storage of nuclear waste.bass lease is located in the corner of the area set aside for the waste facility.id.at.
shortly after the land withdrawal,bass filed an apd for a natural gas well,which was approved.before drilling could commence,however,the government condemned the first vertical feet of the lease in order to preserve the integrity of the proposed waste site.in the condemnation order,the government stated that bass predecessor could continue the exploration,development,production or removal of oil and gas by way of entries other than through the aforesaid surface and initial feet of subsurface.ultimately,in,the owners of the lease at that time drilled a directional natural gas well outside the condemned property that reached under the wipp site at a depth below feet.bass acquired its interests in the lease after the directional well had been drilled.
in,congress passed the waste isolation pilot plant land withdrawal act the wipp act,which established a process for opening the storage facility to receive hazardous waste,stat.
the wipp act required considerable interagency coordination to permit the site to open.first,the wipp act required the environmental protection agency the epa to promulgate disposal and operational regulations for the facility as well as criteria for judging compliance with such regulations.wipp act b c.next,the department of energy doe was to submit an application to the epa outlining how it would comply with the epa regulations.id.d.finally,the epa was to review the doe application and determine whether the facility could be certified and opened for storage of nuclear waste.id.b.
as part of the certification decision,the epa was also required to consult with the doe and the secretary of the interior to consider whether bass lease should be acquired to ensure the safety of the waste storage site.id.b,b.the wipp act prohibited all manner of mining or oil and gas production,including slant drilling,that could affect the wipp site with the exception of bass rights under its lease.with respect to the lease,the wipp act established a consultative process to evaluate whether to condemn bass property 
a in as provided in subparagraph b,no surface or subsurface mining or oil or gas production,including slant drilling from outside the boundaries of the withdrawal,shall be permitted at any time including after decommissioning on lands on or under the withdrawal.
b rights under federal oil and gas leases no.nmnm and no.nmnm the lease shall not be affected unless the administrator determines,after consultation with the secretary and secretary of the interior,that the acquisition of such leases by the secretary is required to comply with the final disposal regulations or with the solid waste disposal act et.
id.b emphasis added.the wipp act did not otherwise change the administrative process associated with receiving a drilling permit.the blm remained responsible for issuing adps until the epa made a determination as to whether condemnation would be required.to effectuate the purposes of the wipp act,however,blm entered into a series of memoranda of understanding mous with the doe relating to the blm permitting procedures on or near the nuclear waste disposal site.
in march,inspired by the passage of the wipp act and the possible threat that the secretary would acquire its lease pursuant to the wipp act,bass filed eight adps to drill directional oil wells that would reach below surface feet and extract oil from underneath the area covered by the wipp act.upon receiving the adps,the blm contacted the doe pursuant to the first mou between the agencies.the mou required the blm to withhold approval of adps until it received comments from the doe and not approve any adp that may affect the integrity of the wipp site.after being put on notice of bass adps,the doe notified the epa of the proposed wells,noting that the grant of the adps may have ramifications,if not addressed thoroughly.
in may,the doe notified the blm that,while both the epa and the doe had not found any indication that the wells would impact the waste facility,the epa had not yet determined whether to acquire the lease pursuant to the wipp act.the doe therefore requested that the blm delay its adp decision until the epa was able to make an informed decision regarding the need for condemnation.
in july,the blm circulated an internal document recommending that the adps be approved.by the end of the month,however,the blm reconsidered its position and recommended denial of the adps because of new concerns over reinjection wells and water flooding for secondary recovery.in addition,blm had signed a new mou with the doe that emphasized the importance of preserving the wipp site.
on august,the blm wrote to bass and denied the adps at this time,because the epa had not yet made a decision on the acquisition of bass leasehold.bass filed an action for damages in the court of federal claims in january.after bass filed its action,on august,the blm sent a supplemental decision letter to bass indicating that,although the prior denial had been final for purposes of appeal,it was willing to reconsider the adps once the epa certified that drilling would not conflict with the wipp regulations.
bass adps were ultimately approved in may,months after the adps were initially denied by the blm.blm approval issued shortly after the epa published its final decision certifying the doe application for the wipp and finding that the lease did not need to be acquired to comply with safety regulations.
takings litigation 
in,the court of federal claims entered judgment in favor of bass,finding a final denial of the adps and a permanent taking of bass leasing rights.bass enters.prod.united states,fed.cl.at that time,however,the epa had not yet determined whether to condemn the lease under section b b of the wipp act.on appeal,we reversed the court of federal claims finding of a permanent taking.we held that congress established a mechanism for condemning the lease under the wipp act and that,until the epa rendered its final decision as to condemnation,the final denial of the adps would not constitute a permanent taking.we then remanded the case for consideration of whether a temporary taking had occurred.bass enters.prod.united states.
after the blm approved bass permits in,the only issue remaining on remand was whether the blm delay in issuing the adps effected a compensable temporary taking.bass claimed compensation for only the month delay between the blm denial of the permits and their subsequent approval.
in evaluating bass temporary takings theory,the court of federal claims initially found in favor of bass and awarded damages in the amount of.bass enters.prod.united states,fed.cl.bass enters.prod.united states,fed.cl.bass enters.prod.united states,order setting damages.in this determination,the court of federal claims held that bass had been denied all beneficial use of the property during the delay period and thus that the taking was a per se,categorical taking requiring compensation under the supreme court decision in lucas south carolina coastal council,d.bass,fed.cl.at.the damage calculation was derived from the interest earned on the oil and gas profits that would have been received during the delay period.
the government filed a motion for reconsideration after the supreme court decision in preservation council,tahoe regional planning agency,d.bass,fed.cl.at.in,the supreme court stated anything less than a complete elimination of value,or a total loss,would require the kind of analysis applied in penn central,at.analogizing the moratorium on building development in to the blm delay in approving the adp,the court of federal claims held that it should apply a penn central analysis instead of categorically finding a taking based on the blm permitting delay.bass,fed.cl.at.
the court of federal claims therefore looked to the character of the government action,the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant,and the extent to which the regulation interfered with reasonable expectations.see penn cent.transp.new york city,d.while acknowledging that bass had reasonable expectations,the court found that the economic impact on bass was de minimis and that the government delay was reasonable given the importance of protecting the public from the possible release of radioactivity.bass,fed.cl.at.weighing the factors and the circumstances surrounding the delay as a whole,the court of federal claims concluded that blm delay did not create a temporary taking and dismissed bass complaint.id.bass filed a timely appeal to this court,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
when reviewing a final decision by the court of federal claims,we examine the court legal determinations de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.glendale fed.bank,fsb united states,whitney benefits united states.whether a taking that is compensable under the fifth amendment has occurred is a question of law that is based on factual determinations.wyatt united states,alves united states.
use of lucas test 
under the fifth amendment to the united states constitution,private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.const.amend.supreme court precedent has long recognized that a taking can be accomplished by a physical invasion of the property or by the imposition of a governmental regulation.lucas,at.coal mahon.in the case of physical possession by the government where there is economic damage to the owner,compensation is always due to the owner regardless of whether the taking was of only part of the property or of the property as a whole.loretto teleprompter manhattan catv,d united states pewee coal.when the alleged taking is a result of regulation,however,a court must typically conduct a complex factual assessment to determine whether compensation is owed to the property holder.yee city of escondido,d keystone bituminous coal ass debenedictis,d.a per se categorical rule is applied to regulatory takings only in the extraordinary circumstance when no productive or economically beneficial use of land is permitted.lucas,at.in,the supreme court clarified that the rule applied in lucas would only be applicable to permanent,rather than temporary,regulatory takings,stating that lucas carved out a narrow exception to the rules governing regulatory takings for the extraordinary circumstance of a permanent deprivation of all beneficial use.at.emphasis added.
because bass alleges a temporary regulatory taking,the court of federal claims properly eschewed the use of a per se categorical rule such as that imposed in lucas.the appellants submitted two separate theories as to why there has been a temporary taking.first,they argue that,even if action on the permit applications was merely delayed and not denied,they should be compensated because there was extraordinary delay,and the penn central factors have been satisfied.second,they argue that the applications were denied and then granted that under our decision in boise cascade united states,a showing of extraordinary delay is not required where a permit has been denied and that application of the penn central factors shows that a temporary taking occurred.neither theory establishes a compensable taking on the facts of this case.
extraordinary delay 
in the present case,appellants allege that the blm month delay in making its permitting decision constituted a temporary regulatory taking compensable under the fifth amendment.we reject bass argument.
in reviewing the court of federal claims decision,we first must emphasize that the evaluation of regulatory takings is an essentially ad hoc process.penn central,at.the supreme court jurisprudence counsels the courts to weigh all of the relevant circumstances in context to determine whether a taking has occurred.palazzolo rhode island,d,concurring.
when looking at a regulatory action by the government,the supreme court has noted that government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law.mahon,at.the requirement that a property owner obtain a permit to undertake a particular use of his land therefore does not in and of itself constitute a compensable taking.united states riverside bayview homes,d.moreover,as the supreme court emphasized in,normal delays in obtaining building permits,changes in zoning ordinances,variances,and the like have long been considered permissible exercises of the police power and are therefore noncompensable under the fifth amendment.at.emphasis added.
a taking may result,however,when an extraordinary delay in governmental decisionmaking occurs.tabb lakes,united states.the supreme court,as well as our own court and other sister circuits,have recognized that extraordinary delays typically last for a substantial length of time.see,williamson county reg l planning comm hamilton bank of johnson city,d finding no temporary taking despite eight year delay wyatt united states,same for seven year delay council,tahoe reg l planning agency,cir same for forty month delay.
the question of whether a delay is extraordinary is not a simple matter of the number of months or years taken by the government to make its decision however.in,the supreme court rejected proposals that would have made a governmental delay longer than a fixed number of years,such as more than six,compensable under the takings clause.at.instead of such an easy guidepost,courts must evaluate a number of factors to determine whether the delay is extraordinary.first,the supreme court has stated that it will be rare for a court to find an extraordinary delay in the absence of bad faith by the government.tabb lakes,at.in addition,our court in wyatt also recognized that,since delay is inherent in complex regulatory permitting schemes,we should examine the nature of the permitting process as well as the reasons for any delay to determine if the delay is disproportionate to the regulatory permitting scheme from which it arises.at.as we explained in wyatt 
complex regulatory schemes often require detailed information before the issuance of a permit.the nature of the regulatory scheme is especially critical when the permitting process requires detailed technical information necessary to determine environmental impacts.governmental agencies that implement complex permitting schemes should be afforded significant deference in determining what additional information is required to satisfy statutorily imposed obligations.
