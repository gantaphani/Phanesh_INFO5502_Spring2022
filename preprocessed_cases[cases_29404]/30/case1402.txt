in these consolidated petitions,several states,counties,and industrial entities challenge the environmental protection agency promulgation of area designations for the annual national ambient air quality standard applicable to fine particulate matter,a category of air pollutants consisting of miniscule airborne particles known to present adverse health risks.insisting that epa methodology for designating areas as nonattainment for the fine particulate matter standard violates section d of the clean air act,which governs such designations,and that this methodology and the individual designations it produced are otherwise arbitrary and capricious,petitioners ask us to vacate the nonattainment designations and to send epa back to the drawing board.with one minor exception,we deny the petitions for review.faced with the complex task of identifying those geographic areas that contribute to fine particulate matter pollution,epa both complied with the statute and,for all but one of the counties or partial counties it designated as nonattainment,quite often basic obligation of reasoned decisionmaking.
title i of the clean air act charges epa with formulating national ambient air quality standards naaqs for air pollutants that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare.naaqs set maximum ambient air concentrations for those pollutants.id.while each state has primary responsibility for assuring air quality within its borders and,in particular,for developing a state implementation plan sip for achieving and maintaining the naaqs for each air pollutant,a,the act triggers more or less stringent requirements depending on the quality of an area ambient air.thus,before a state can design an appropriate sip,it must know which areas within its boundaries comply with the naaqs and which do not.
this is where caa section d comes in.it requires epa to designate areas as attainment,nonattainment,or unclassifiable depending on their compliance with the relevant naaqs.attainment areas are those that meet the relevant standard nonattainment areas are those that exceed the standard or that contribute to ambient air quality in a nearby area that exceeds the standard unclassifiable areas are those that permit no determination given existing data.d a i iii.in nonattainment areas,the act requires stricter pollution controls.for instance,states must implement controls that will achieve attainment as expeditiously as practicable in nonattainment areas,id.a,c,whereas states need only implement measures that will prevent significant deterioration of air quality for attainment and unclassifiable areas,id.
in addition to setting the criteria for attainment and nonattainment,section d prescribes the designation process.upon promulgation of new or revised naaqs,states must submit to epa their own initial designations of all areas within their borders.d a.epa must then promulgate the submitted designations or modify them as it deems necessary.d b.specifically,caa section d b ii provides that 
in making the promulgations required,the administrator may make such modifications as the administrator deems necessary to the designations of the areas or portions thereof submitted by the states under subparagraph a including to the boundaries of such areas or portions thereof.whenever the administrator intends to make a modification,the administrator shall notify the state and provide such state with an opportunity to demonstrate why any proposed modification is inappropriate.the administrator shall give such notification no later than days before the date the administrator promulgates the designation,including any modification thereto.
this case involves the naaqs for fine particulate matter.known as,fine particulate matter consists of airborne particles that are micrometers in diameter or,less than the thickness of a human hair.air quality designations and classifications for the fine particles national ambient air quality standards designations rule,codified at pt.a significant association links elevated levels of with adverse human health consequences such as premature death,lung and cardiovascular disease,and asthma.id.and significantly for the primary issue before method for identifying the geographic origins of elevated ambient can travel hundreds or thousands of miles.
in,epa abandoned its practice of regulating all particulate matter,both coarse and fine,under a unified standard.instead,it established specific naaqs for the first time.national ambient air quality standards for particulate matter.july.epa promulgated annual and naaqs,setting the annual one at issue micrograms per cubic meter.id.at see also.although section d required epa to promulgate area designations for the new standard as expeditiously as possible,d b i,litigation here and in the supreme court waylaid the designation process until we finally upheld the standard five years later.see am.trucking ass ns epa,on remand from whitman am.trucking ass ns,d,aff g in part and rev g in part am.trucking ass ns epa.in the meantime,congress had passed legislation requiring the deployment of a nationwide monitoring network and extending the deadline for the designations until three years of monitoring data had been collected.see transportation equity act for the century,stat.then,following our decision upholding the naaqs and epa initiation of the designation process,congress amended the clean air act to add section d,which set a firm deadline for the area designations.see,a,stat,codified at d.thus,amended section d a now provides 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,not later than february,the governor of each state shall submit designations referred in paragraph for the july national ambient air quality standards for each area within the state,based on air quality monitoring data collected in accordance with any applicable federal reference methods for the relevant area.
d a.and section d b provides 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,not later than december,the administrator shall,consistent with paragraph,promulgate the designations referred to in subparagraph a for each area of each state for the july national ambient air quality standards.
in april,epa issued a guidance document initiating the designation process.known as the holmstead memo,the document explains the timeline for state submissions and,more importantly,the criteria epa would employ in reviewing those submissions.memorandum from jeffrey holmstead,assistant administrator,to regional administrators,regions,holmstead memo.noting recent evidence that violations of the air quality standards generally include a significant contribution,the holmstead memo explains epa inten t to apply a presumption that the boundaries for urban nonattainment areas should be based on metropolitan area boundaries.id.at.in other words,the memo announces epa view that if any area within a metropolitan area exceeds the annual naaqs,then all areas within the metropolitan area presumptively contribute to that violation within the meaning of section d a and therefore warrant nonattainment designations.the holmstead memo further explains that epa would define metropolitan boundaries by reference to office of management and budget definitions of metropolitan statistical areas msas and consolidated metropolitan statistical areas cmsas interchangeably.id.thus,under this approach,a violation of the naaqs in the district of columbia,for instance,would trigger the presumption that seventeen counties in northern virginia and five counties in inside the applicable msa,though only some are contiguous with the to elevated levels in the city and warrant nonattainment designations.
an attachment to the holmstead memo elaborates on epa basis for adopting the presumption,as well as the circumstances that would warrant a departure.as to the rationale for the presumption,the holmstead memo explains that after examin ing the geographic distribution of total concentrations in and near many metropolitan areas,the agency had found an association of higher concentrations with greater levels of urban activity such as motor vehicle use and home heating,as well as industrial activities.holmstead memo,attach,guidance on nonattainment area designations for,at holmstead memo guidance.thus,the presumption reflects epa view that,in the absence of evidence to the contrary,violations of the naaqs in urban areas may be presumed attributable at least in part to contributions from sources distributed throughout the metropolitan area.id.at.that said,the holmstead memo also recognizes that appropriate boundaries of urban nonattainment areas may well be smaller or larger than the applicable.epa would therefore consider requests for urban nonattainment area definitions that deviate from omb metropolitan area definitions on a basis.id.at.the holmstead memo lists nine factors to guide that analysis emissions in the potentially contributing areas air quality in those areas population density and degree of urbanization in those areas traffic and commuting patterns expected growth meteorology geography and topography jurisdictional boundaries and level of control of emissions sources.id.at.the memo encourages states submitting designations that depart from the metropolitan presumption to justify such designations by reference to all nine factors.id.
with that,the designation process was underway.the states submitted their initial designations epa responded with its proposed modifications,as well as explanations of its analysis under the test the states then submitted any responses and epa promulgated the final area designations in december.see designations rule.at.in a technical support document accompanying the rule,epa explained the basis for the designations and the analytical tools that it had developed and applied to assess the nine factors.see epa,office of air quality planning and standards,technical support document for state and tribal air quality fine particle designations technical support document.recognizing that monitoring data would soon become available,epa also invited states to submit any new data that might support an amended designation.designations rule.at.based on the new data,epa then revised designations for eight areas from nonattainment to attainment and four areas from unclassifiable to attainment.see air quality designations for the fine particles national ambient air quality amendments,codified at pt.
in the end,epa applied the presumption so that nonattainment boundaries were coextensive with metropolitan boundaries and unchanged by the analysis in only seven of metropolitan areas.see epa br.citing relevant portions of the technical support document.in every other metropolitan area,applying the analysis and finding that the presumption misjudged the nature of the problem,epa designated the urban nonattainment area as either an area larger than the metropolitan area for instance,in chattanooga,tennessee or smaller for instance,in washington,dc.
several states,local governments,and industrial entities petitioned epa for reconsideration of the designations others filed petitions for review directly in this court.we stayed proceedings in this court while epa considered the petitions for reconsideration.once epa resolved the petitions for reconsideration,we consolidated all petitions for review.
petitioners challenges fall into four broad categories.first,they raise procedural challenges to the holmstead memo and to the designations rule,arguing that epa illegally bypassed notice and comment for each.second,they raise various objections to epa statutory authority to adopt and implement the presumption and the test.third,they argue that even if section d permits epa to adopt the presumption and the test,epa analysis nonetheless suffers from such serious methodological deficiencies and inconsistencies as to render the entire designations rule arbitrary and capricious.finally,as a last resort,petitioners request that we vacate certain area designations that affect them,claiming that epa at least acted arbitrarily and capriciously in making these particular nonattainment and unclassifiable designations.we review petitioners challenges under section d of the clean air act,which requires the court to set aside epa final actions when they are in excess of the agency statutory authority or otherwise arbitrary and capricious.d a.
before addressing petitioners arguments,however,we think it helpful to review some technical background.
fine particulate matter includes both primary particles,carbonaceous particles and crustal particles like dust that pollution sources emit directly into the atmosphere,as well as secondary particles,sulfate and nitrate particles that form in the atmosphere as a result of chemical reactions between precursors that sources emit.designations rule.at.power plants,diesel and gasoline powered engines in mobile sources like cars and trucks,and other industrial sources produce most carbonaceous particles agriculture,mining,and other activities that cause soil or metals to be suspended in the atmosphere account for the crustal component.see technical support document epa,office of air quality and planning standards,the particle pollution report,available at.the chemical precursors to secondary include sulfur dioxide,emitted in substantial part by power plants nitrogen oxides nox,emitted in substantial part by mobile sources,power plants,and other industrial sources and ammonia,emitted from agricultural sources,mobile sources,and power plants.see designations rule.at technical support document.atmospheric chemical reactions between these gases yield secondary in the form of sulfate and nitrate particles.designations rule.at.the naaqs set a annual limit for all fine particulate matter without distinguishing among the various kinds or species of.even so,speciation data that breaks the total concentration into its constituent components is quite useful for the area designation process.because such data reveals the kinds of particles carbon,sulfate,nitrate,crustal particles,that most account for an area problem,it suggests,by extrapolation,the kinds of sources most responsible for the problem as well.
while the holmstead memo announced epa methodology for determining whether an area with passable concentrations nonetheless deserves a nonattainment designation,epa regulations set forth the technical procedures for measuring ambient concentrations in the first place.exhaustive technical specifications regulate the states operation of a network of air monitors that collect air quality data for any given area.see pt,apps.l,n.these monitors measure ambient concentration,what called the design value,on any given day.the annual design determines whether an area complies with the then computed by averaging every quarter worth of daily design value samples typically collected every third or sixth day,averaging those quarterly numbers to obtain an annual average,and then averaging three years of annual numbers to yield the final annual design value.see pt,app.samples from these monitors can be further analyzed to yield the speciation data described above.
the majority of the designations at issue here drew on monitoring data collected from to.based on a judgment that no petitioner challenges,epa decided that the county boundary would determin e the extent of the area reflected by a violating monitor.designations rule.at see also id.at i f a monitor was violating the standard based on the data,at a minimum we designated the county where that monitor is located as nonattainment.we made exceptions in a few very large western counties where a significant geographic feature such as a mountain range divided a county.thus,for instance,if a monitor in an industrial area of downtown detroit registered a violation,all of wayne county would be designated as even its more idyllic corners like the town of grosse pointe.id.at designating wayne county nonattainment.to be clear,this reflects quite a separate judgment from that underlying the presumption.epa selection of the county as the unit of analysis resolved a problem inherent in the monitoring process,namely,that a monitor only measures air quality in its immediate vicinity.because of this,epa had to determine how much compass to give any monitored measurement,which it did by choosing the county as the unit of analysis.the presumption,by contrast,addresses a different problem,namely,how to identify those areas that,although deemed to be meeting the standard themselves,are contributing to nearby violations.
we have already described the nine factors that epa evaluated to determine whether to depart from the presumption,see supra at,and in the hundreds of pages that comprise the technical support document,epa explained its findings for each metropolitan area on each of the nine factors.epa assessed these factors with the help of several analytical tools and models it had developed.see technical support document explaining analytical tools.we describe the most important ones here in general fashion,reserving additional elaboration for those portions of the opinion that require it.
to start,given the hundreds of miles that can travel in the atmosphere,epa thought it important to isolate the portion of urban that originates from a metropolitan area local sources as opposed to regional sources much farther away.thus,under its urban excess analysis,epa paired an urban monitoring site with an upwind rural monitoring,a rural site where prevailing winds move in the direction of the metropolitan subtract ed the rural concentration from the measured urban concentration.id.true to name,this simple arithmetic allowed epa to estimate the portion of urban levels that arises from urban activities by cancelling out the rural background that would exist regardless of those activities.id.epa calculated the urban excess for each species and then summed those numbers to yield a total urban excess measure.id.
epa next used the urban excess calculations to develop weighted emissions scores for each county in a.id.the notion underlying these scores is intuitive if the urban excess numbers for the district of columbia,for instance,reveal that all local pollution is in the form of carbon,it would make little sense to think that a county plays a significant part in the district monitored violation if the county has zero carbon emissions.thus,for purposes of evaluating the first of the nine emissions in areas potentially included versus excluded,holmstead memo guidance at determined that raw emissions data is usually less suggestive of contribution than data adjusted to account for the species that actually comprise the urban excess.
calculating weighted emissions scores required a number of steps.see technical support document.first,epa determined the total metropolitan emissions of carbon,nox,and crustal particles by summing the counties individual emissions of each pollutant.for those pollutants,epa then divided each county emissions by total emissions,calculating each county percentage share of total metropolitan emissions.for example,if county a emits tons of carbon and if total carbon emissions equal tons,then the ratio would be fifty percent.next epa weighted these percentages by multiplying them by the proportion of urban excess attributable to the relevant pollutant.to continue with our hypothetical,then,if carbon accounted for forty percent of urban excess,epa would multiply fifty percent by,and county a weighted carbon score would be twenty.having calculated a county weighted scores for each species,epa then added these scores together to derive a county total weighted emissions score.importantly,because these scores scale a county raw emissions based on attributes specific to an individual,the urban excess number and the total level of metropolitan only provide a measure for comparing counties within the same.
finally,epa developed pollution roses that depict monitoring and meteorological data for each air monitor.see,technical support document to.each pollution rose consists of concentric circles,with the circles center representing the location of the air monitor.epa then plotted dots around the circles,with each dot representing one monitored reading,the dot size representing the magnitude of the reading,the dot spatial location representing the prevailing wind direction on the day of the reading,and the dot distance from the center of the circle representing the average wind speed on that day.
with this technical background in mind,we turn to petitioners four primary arguments.
petitioners first lodge procedural challenges against epa promulgation of the final designations rule and the holmstead memo.petitioners argue that epa violated the administrative procedure act,by failing to publish both the rule and the holmstead memo for notice and comment.they are in error as to both.
final designations rule 
designation of nonattainment areas is governed by section d of the clean air act.d.the parties disagree as to which subsection of section d provides epa authority to promulgate designations.industry petitioners argue that designations are promulgated under section d,which states notwithstanding any other provision of law,not later than december,the administrator shall,consistent with paragraph,promulgate the designations referred to in subparagraph a for each area of each state for the july national ambient air quality standards.d b.by contrast,epa argues that the source of its authority is a provision of section d,entitled promulgation by epa of designations,which states in relevant part 
upon promulgation or revision of a national ambient air quality standard,the administrator shall promulgate the designations of all areas or portions thereof submitted under subparagraph a as expeditiously as practicable,but in no case later than years from the date of promulgation of the new or revised national ambient air quality standard.
d b i.the distinction between these provisions is important because the statute exempts designations under section d,among others,from the apa section requirements it does not,however,exempt designations under section d.see d b promulgation or announcement of a designation under paragraph,or shall not be subject to the provisions of sections through of title of the united states code relating to notice and comment,except nothing herein shall be construed as precluding such public notice and comment whenever possible.
epa is entrusted with administering the clean air act,of which section is a part,and thus we review the agency construction of the statutory provisions under the familiar framework set out in chevron natural resources defense council,d.under chevron step one,we ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.if at that point we determine that the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.we proceed to chevron second step only if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue.id.at.at the second step,we determine whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.
here we need go no further than the first step because the intent of congress is clear.petitioners reliance on section d is misplaced.subparagraph b of section d requires that,not later than december,the administrator shall promulgate the designations referred to in subparagraph a.d b.subparagraph a,in turn,states notwithstanding any other provision of law,not later than february,the governor of each state shall submit designations referred to in paragraph of d for the july national ambient air quality standards d a emphasis added.thus,contrary to petitioners claim,section d b,when read in conjunction with section d a,shows that section d does not itself authorize the promulgation of designations.rather,section d merely governs the timing of designations,which are made under the authority contained in section d a provision that the statute expressly exempts from requirements.see d b.
holmstead memo 
petitioners argument that the holmstead memo had to undergo notice and comment stems,in part,from their erroneous belief that the final designations were subject to notice and comment.our determination above,that the statute exempts the nonattainment designations from procedures,suggests that the holmstead was simply the first step in the promulgation of also exempt.
petitioners further argument,that the holmstead memo is a legislative rule that must undergo notice and comment independent of the final rule to which it relates,is also unavailing.for support,petitioners point to general electric epa,in which we explained that whether an agency action is the type of action that must undergo notice and comment depends on whether the agency action binds private parties or the agency itself with the force of law,id.at is,whether a document expresses a change in substantive law or policy that is not an interpretation which the agency intends to make binding,or administers with binding effect,id.at quoting robert anthony,interpretive rules,policy statements,guidances,manuals,and the federal agencies use them to bind the public,duke.general electric further explained that an agency pronouncement will be considered binding as a practical matter if it either appears on its face to be binding or is applied by the agency in a way that indicates it is binding.id.at internal citation omitted.
in response,epa argues that the holmstead memo is merely a policy statement,not a legislative rule,because it does not create or modify legally binding rights or obligations.as epa correctly notes,the apa expressly exempts policy statements from requirements.see b a specifying that,except when required by statute,the section requirements for notice and comment do not apply to interpretative rules,general statements of policy,or rules of agency organization,procedure,or practice.
epa has the better of this dispute.first,the holmstead memo is not binding on its face.it specifies that it merely provides guidance to state and local air pollution control agencies on the process for designating areas for the purpose of implementing the fine particle national ambient air quality standards.holmstead memo at.it then explicitly states that it is not binding on the states or epa and notes that it provides only epa current views on the designation process,suggesting that those views are open to revision.id.at.unlike the agency documents at issue in general electric and croplife america epa,which petitioners also cite,the holmstead memo does not impose binding duties on states or the agency.it merely clarifies the states existing duties under the clean air act and explains the process epa suggests for states to follow in providing their initial designations.as we explained above,see supra at,the memo establishes a rebuttable presumption and outlines nine factors for epa to consider in its final designations,see holmstead memo guidance at.
petitioners point to language in the holmstead memo that they view as evidence of its binding character the states a demonstration supporting the designation of boundaries that are less than the full metropolitan area must show both that violations are not occurring in the excluded portions of the metropolitan area and that the excluded portions are not source areas that contribute to the observed violations.id.at.but this language does not create a new burden on the states it merely reiterates the statutory requirements.see d a i requiring governors to designate as nonattainment any area that does not meet or that contributes to ambient air quality in a nearby area that does not meet the naaqs.
nor does the holmstead memo bind epa.the memo announces the presumption as a rebuttable presumption,which preserves the agency discretion to deviate from the boundaries of a in the final designations.see panhandle producers royalty owners ass econ.regulatory,an agency pronouncement is not deemed a binding regulation merely because it may have some substantive impact,as long as it leave s the administrator free to exercise his informed discretion.presumptions,so long as rebuttable,leave such freedom.quoting brock cathedral bluffs shale oil,internal quotation marks omitted.
further,epa has not applied the holmstead memo in a binding manner.petitioners again cite general electric for the proposition that an agency document will be considered binding if the affected private parties are reasonably led to believe that failure to conform will bring adverse consequences,at quoting anthony,supra,at.the memo encouraged states to address all nine factors epa identified,but did not require them to do so.holmstead memo guidance at.some states did not address all or even any of the factors.see,letter from robert burnley,dep t of envtl.quality,commonwealth of virginia,to donald welsh,epa region iii,recommending that all of virginia be designated attainment without addressing any of the nine factors letter from stephanie timmermeyer,west virginia dep t of envtl,to donald welsh,epa region iii,recommending nonattainment areas to match the existing ozone nonattainment areas without addressing any of epa other eight factors.epa considered such submissions and did not impose adverse consequences,notwithstanding the states failure to address the factors listed in the holmstead memo.compare state of west virginia recommendations,with designations rule.at showing that epa designated as attainment an area that west virginia had proposed be designated nonattainment,despite the fact that west virginia did not address eight of epa nine factors.
in sum,we deny petitioners procedural claims because epa was not required to submit either the final designations rule or the holmstead memo for notice and comment.
petitioners next claim that epa violated section d of the clean air act by applying the presumption and test to identify areas that contribute to nearby violations.as we explained above,we review epa interpretation of the clean air act under chevron,asking whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,at,and if so,whether it has unambiguously foreclosed the agency statutory interpretation,sierra club epa.but if the statute is either silent or ambiguous on the specific question at issue,we defer to epa statutory interpretation so long as it is reasonable.id.
at the outset we observe that section d is replete with the kinds of words that suggest a congressional intent to leave unanswered questions to an agency discretion and expertise,see cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d statutory ambiguity is delegation to the agency to fill the statutory gap in reasonable fashion.section d requires epa to designate an area as nonattainment if it contributes to ambient air quality in a nearby area that exceeds the relevant standard,d a i,yet the statute defines neither contributes nor nearby words that we have expressly found ambiguous as used in other sections of the act.see envtl.def.fund epa,contributes to ambiguous in another section of the clean air act sierra club epa,same,as to nearby.it authorizes epa to revise designations whenever it deems such modifications necessary,yet it says nothing of what precisely will render a modification necessary.d b ii.and section d requires states to submit designations based on air quality monitoring data collected in accordance with any applicable federal reference methods,d a,yet it fails to define based on and t here is no question that the phrase based on is ambiguous,sierra club epa,accord.nuclear energy,epa.a mbiguities in statutes within an agency jurisdiction to administer are delegations of authority to the agency to fill the statutory gap in reasonable fashion.brand x,at.because it conveys no approach for determining whether an area contributes to a nearby violation,section d text is consistent with such a delegation.
to be sure,a statute may foreclose an agency preferred interpretation despite such textual ambiguities if its structure,legislative history,or purpose makes clear what its text leaves opaque.pub.serv.epa,court must exhaust traditional tools of statutory construction at chevron step one.notwithstanding petitioners torrent of arguments to the contrary,this is not such a,it is even close.
we start with the argument that petitioners judge to be their best.see oral arg.at.pointing to section d,petitioners insist that the statute express mandate that epa apply the presumption in other contexts conclusively proves that congress intended to preclude its use here.enacted as part of the amendments to the clean air act,section d revise s by operation of law the boundaries of certain urban ozone or carbon monoxide nonattainment areas to include the entire metropolitan statistical or consolidated metropolitan statistical area,unless epa determined that some portions do not contribute significantly to the violation of the national ambient air quality standard.d a iv v.in contrast,section d says nothing about the presumption.instead it provides that the area designations must be based on air quality monitoring data and promulgated in accordance with section d general provisions for area designations.d a.citing the familiar canon of statutory interpretation that w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it from another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion,russello united states,d internal quotation marks and brackets omitted,petitioners insist that the statute exclusive inclusion of the presumption for the ozone and carbon monoxide designations demonstrates congress unambiguous intent to preclude epa from adopting the presumption here.
although petitioners are correct that we construe statutes to give meaning to the disparate inclusion of particular language,that principle hardly compels the interpretation they favor.when interpreting statutes that govern agency action,we have consistently recognized that a congressional mandate in one section and silence in another often suggests not a prohibition but simply a decision not to mandate any solution in the second context,to leave the question to agency discretion.cheney icc,see also clinchfield coal fed.mine safety health review comm n,w here an agency is empowered to administer the statute,congress may have meant that in the second context the choice should be up to the agency.silence,in other words,may signal permission rather than proscription.for that reason,that congress spoke in one place but remained silent in another,as it did here,rarely if ever suffices for the direct answer that chevron step one requires.cheney,at internal quotation marks omitted see also am.forest paper ass ferc,statute discrepant inclusion of the modifier competitive to describe markets renders statutory provision lacking the modifier ambiguous.
undaunted,petitioners insist that the silence here is unambiguously prohibitive.they point out that congress not only refused to treat like ozone and carbon monoxide but chose an altogether different scheme in subsection d one based on air quality monitoring data,d a,rather than metropolitan boundaries and a test.as indicated above,however,congress mere choice of different standards in subsections d and d tells us nothing about whether congress wanted to mandate different approaches or to permit them.thus,for this argument to succeed,subsection d must itself preclude epa from adopting a test for like the one that congress mandated for ozone and carbon monoxide in subsection d.but nothing in subsection d even hints at such a prohibition.subsection d a requires states to submit designations based on air quality monitoring data collected in accordance with any applicable federal reference methods subsection d b in turn requires epa to promulgate those designations in accordance with subsection d general provisions.for the sake of argument,we shall assume that subsection d based on language unambiguously applies to epa even though it appears only in the particular provision governing states.we shall also assume that the language substantively constrains epa discretion in determining nonattainment boundaries.but even given these assumptions,binding precedent,the statute purpose,and basic common sense foreclose petitioners argument that section d itself precludes epa from adopting the presumption and test.
first,as noted above,we have repeatedly held that the words based on are unquestionably ambiguous they neither compel the agency to rest its decisions solely on the specified factor nor indicate the extent to which the agency may rely on additional factors.sierra club,at accord.nuclear energy,at.instead,they simply constrain the agency from abandon ing or supplant ing the specified factor altogether.sierra club,at.we need ask only whether epa designations can still reasonably be described as based on air quality monitoring data,and we have no doubt that the contribution designations meet this modest standard.if nothing else,the contribution designations are based on the air quality monitoring data that demonstrate a nearby violation of the naaqs.even were this insufficient,epa use of air quality monitoring data as part of its instance,its use of urban excess and weighted emissions scores based on speciation surely suffice.
second,because subsection d directs epa to designate some areas as nonattainment despite monitoring data that provides no basis,on its own,to do so,see d a i,we think it quite clear that the statute contemplates reliance on factors other than monitoring data to determine contribution.how could epa possibly fulfill its statutory duty to determine,for instance,whether emissions in indiana contribute to monitored violations in chicago without considering wind and emissions data from indiana obviously it could not.that the statute fails to set forth the additional criteria for epa to consider in evaluating contribution hardly forecloses epa from developing such criteria in order to accomplish congress objectives.see,entergy riverkeeper,d.indeed,when a statute is silent with respect to all potentially relevant factors,it is eminently reasonable to conclude that the silence is meant to convey nothing more than a refusal to tie the agency hands.id.emphasis added.
still undaunted,petitioners advert to section d which permits epa to require a revision to an area designation on the basis of air quality data,planning and control considerations,or any other air considerations the administrator deems appropriate,d as evidence that congress knew how to authorize a flexible,approach to attainment decisions when it so intended.counties opening br.but the supreme court rejected just this kind of argument in entergy riverkeeper,which asked whether epa may engage in analysis under section b of the clean water act given that it says nothing of analysis while other sections expressly authorize it.at.pointing out that section b is silent not only with respect to analysis but with respect to all potentially relevant factors,the court rejected the claim that the silence reflected a prohibition,for if it did,then the epa could not consider any factors in implementing section b an obvious logical impossibility.id.here we face just this kind of overwhelming statutory silence.although logic dictates that epa must evaluate some factors in addition to monitoring data to determine contribution,the statute says nothing about which factors it should consider.we thus have no difficulty rejecting the claim that the statute unambiguously forecloses epa from adopting the presumption or considering its nine factors in applying it.
the legislative history petitioners cite fails to rehabilitate their claim that section d unambiguously requires epa to base all nonattainment designations for contribution on air quality monitoring data alone.although petitioners are correct that in the transportation equity act for the century,congress provided for the deployment of a monitoring network to produce adequate monitoring data for these designations,that does nothing to dispel the ambiguity over what criteria epa should rely on to assess contribution.indeed,the particular provision of that petitioners emphasize actually reinforces that ambiguity rather than resolves it.see c only data from the monitoring network shall be considered for such designations.nothing in the previous sentence shall be construed as affecting the administrator authority to promulgate the designation of an area as nonattainment,under section d of the clean air act,based on its contribution to ambient air quality in a nearby nonattainment area.
in sum,we conclude that neither section d requirement that designations be based on air quality monitoring data nor its mandate that epa apply the presumption and a test for pollutants other than unambiguously reveals congress intent to prevent epa from using the presumption and the test to determine contribution here.our rejection of petitioners purportedly strongest argument is a fair harbinger of the fate of their remaining statutory complaints.
to begin with,petitioners waived two of their statutory arguments by failing to raise them in their opening briefs.see new york epa,petitioners waive those arguments that they fail to raise in their opening briefs.specifically,not until their reply briefs did they present a statutory challenge to epa interpretation that a nearby area under section d a may include noncontiguous areas,or to its conclusion that an area future reductions in emissions qualifies as a relevant factor for assessing contribution.this leaves just two general challenges petitioners claim that the presumption and the test run afoul of the statutory term contribute and their claim that the presumption impermissibly encroaches on states statutory prerogative to have on area designations within their borders.
as to the textual claim,petitioners insist that the verb contribute necessarily connotes a significant causal relationship,meaning that epa may not designate a county as contributing to nonattainment if corrective measures in the county will do nothing to address the problem or help achieve compliance in the nonattainment area.counties opening br.we reject both the major and the minor premise.although petitioners cite one dictionary that supports the claim that the adverb significantly is implicit in the verb contribute,epa cites other dictionaries that define contribute without reference to any threshold level of significance.this alone suggests an ambiguity that fatally undermines petitioners chevron step one argument.see cellular telecomms.internet ass fcc,d ueling over dictionary definitions is pointless,for it fails to produce any plain meaning of the disputed word.but even were we to think that contribute unambiguously means significantly contribute,we still disagree that significantly contribute unambiguously means strictly cause.michigan epa,significant is ambiguous.given that the statute uses the word contribute and that a contribution may simply exacerbate a problem rather than cause it,we see no reason why the statute precludes epa from determining that a county addition of into the atmosphere is significant even though a nearby county nonattainment problem would still persist in its absence.in fact,a contrary interpretation of contribute would effectively preclude a nonattainment designation for any attaining county when the cause of the violation is.we may not interpret contribute in a way that does such violence to section d very purpose.
we also reject petitioners argument that epa violated the statute by failing to articulate a quantified amount of contribution that would trigger a nonattainment designation.petitioners apparently prefer a,objective test of contribution,see,counties opening br,but it is the statute,not petitioners preferences,that constrains epa discretion.and nothing in the statute compels epa to quantify a uniform amount of contribution below which counties will automatically escape nonattainment designations or to quantify similar thresholds for the nine factors epa evaluated in making those determinations.section d is ambiguous as to how epa should measure contribution and what degree of contribution is sufficient to deem an area nonattainment,as even petitioners seem to concede,see counties reply br.epa was supposed to be defining and deciding contributes.thus,reasonably exercising the discretion that congress delegated to it,epa interpreted contribute to mean sufficiently contribute,and then applied the presumption and test precisely to identify those areas that meet that definition.petitioners offer no plausible reason to think that the statute forecloses this approach.
nor do we agree with petitioners that epa failure to quantify its analysis somehow rendered its interpretation of contribute arbitrary and capricious and therefore unreasonable under chevron step two.northpoint,fcc,statutory interpretation that is arbitrary and capricious is unreasonable under chevron step two.an agency is free to adopt a test to implement a statute that confers broad discretionary authority,even if that test lacks a definite threshold or clear line of demarcation to define an term.pdk,dea,internal quotation marks omitted.to be reasonable,such an standard must simply define and explain the criteria the agency is applying,id.at,something the holmstead memo and certainly the technical support document did in spades.of course,epa may have applied its test inconsistently,resulting in similar counties being treated question we address in part epa may also have applied it so erroneously in a particular case that it could not have reasonably concluded that a county was contributing to nearby issue we consider in part vi.but epa use of a flexible analysis is not in and of itself unreasonable just because it lacks quantitative standards.see id.at.
we are equally unimpressed by petitioners last general argument that the presumption unlawfully deprived states of the deference to which their designations were entitled under section d.states opening br.to the extent petitioners are claiming that epa owes the states a measure of procedural deference under section d,we agree that epa must wait its turn before it makes any individual county designations.indeed,in contrast to its many ambiguities,section d clearly provides that states submit their initial designations first,d a,and only then does epa promulgate or modify the designations as it deems necessary,d b ii.not only is that precisely what happened here,but nothing in section d prevents epa from developing general principles to govern its exercise of discretion when the time comes,or from announcing those general principles before the states submit their initial designations.to the extent petitioners think that epa owes the states a measure of substantive deference under section d a claim that seems implicit in their objection that the presumption somehow alters states burden in the designation process,see states opening br.disagree.though epa may,of course,go along with states initial designations,it has no obligation to give any quantum of deference to a designation that it deems necessary to change.see.dep t of envtl.prot.epa,recognizing that section d gives deference to states initial designations provided epa deems no modification necessary.in short,epa had authority to apply the presumption at the time it rejected the states submissions.we see no reason why section d would force epa to bite its tongue until then.
having rejected petitioners arguments that section d unambiguously precludes epa from adopting the presumption and test,we can easily conclude that epa reasonably interpreted the statute as permitting it to do so.even if we read section d favorably to petitioners,it requires only that epa designate,based on air quality monitoring data,nonattainment areas that either violate or contribute to violations of the naaqs.acting on evidence that urban violations usually stem from activities,epa adopted a presumption that designates all metropolitan areas as nonattainment when at least one metropolitan area registers a violation,as well as a specifically defined analysis to assess when that presumption fails to reflect the realities of a given metropolitan area.petitioners give us every reason to think they would prefer another system of,one that would allow them to escape certain nonattainment they give us no reason to think the system epa selected is unreasonable.
petitioners next argue that the designations rule is arbitrary and capricious because it is riddled with methodological flaws and inconsistencies.they challenge the rule in four regards epa designation of noncontiguous townships as nonattainment,the agency refusal to account for some potential emissions reductions,the carbon error in some weighted emissions scores,and the way epa applied the test.
w e apply the same standard of review under the clean air act as we do under the administrative procedure act apa,a,allied local reg l mfrs.caucus epa,and will set aside the designations rule only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,d a.we must affirm the rule if the record shows epa considered all relevant factors and articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.burlington truck lines united states,d.of particular note in this challenge,we give an extreme degree of deference to epa when it is evaluating scientific data within its technical expertise,city of waukesha epa,internal quotation marks omitted.such deference is especially appropriate in our review of epa administration of the complicated provisions of the clean air act.see ass of clean air agencies epa.
in basing its designation decisions on a rigorous analysis of each county particular attributes,epa satisfied the requirements of reasoned decisionmaking.given our highly deferential standard of review,these four challenges provide no basis to question epa general analysis or to upset the entire designations rule.
designation of noncontiguous townships 
as we have described above,epa designation analysis starts with two presumptions.see supra at.first,if a monitor is violating the naaqs,at a minimum epa will designate the entire county where that monitor is located as nonattainment because the county boundary is the basic jurisdictional boundary for determining the extent of the area reflected by the monitor.designations rule.at.second,all counties within the contribute to that violation.see id.at holmstead memo guidance at.when these presumptions operate in tandem,a violating monitor within a will result in a single contiguous block of nonattainment counties that includes both the county with the violating monitor and the other counties that are deemed to contribute to that violation.likewise,when epa includes counties in a nonattainment block,those counties typically adjoin violating counties.but epa also invites states to recommend smaller designation areas on a basis if they provide an adequate justification demonstrating that a smaller area would include the full area that is violating the standards and all nearby source areas that contribute to the violation.holmstead memo guidance at.some states took up epa offer and asked that a township rather than a county be designated as nonattainment when a power plant in the township was the overwhelming source of the county contribution to a nearby violation.see designations rule.at technical support document discussion.
to borrow petitioners imagery,this approach created an island of by a sea of attainment throughout the remainder of the county.industry petitioners argue that creating such islands of nonattainment arbitrarily deviates from the presumption that designations should be made at the county level.because emissions from a power plant in a township do not skip over all other parts of the surrounding county and come to rest in a nearby area with a violating monitor,petitioners argue that violating areas designated nonattainment should be contiguous to those areas contributing to the violation.
we find no fault in epa conclusion that it would be unreasonable to designate as nonattainment those areas that do not,in fact,contribute to violations.epa designated as nonattainment a township with an emitting than the entire it would be inappropriate to include other portions of a county,merely because those portions lay between the large stationary source and the remainder of the designated nonattainment area.designations rule.at.although contiguity of nonattainment areas may follow from the operation of the rule twin presumptions,the designations process does not mandate that result when the scientific data show that a source contributing to a violation is not in an area contiguous to the county with the violating monitor.according to the technical support document,epa designated townships rather than entire counties as nonattainment only when a power plant in the township was responsible for the vast majority of the county emissions.for example,the conesville plant in franklin township emitted of the,of the nox,of the carbon,and of the crustal emissions for all of coshocton county.see technical support document factor.by designating only franklin township as nonattainment,epa accounted for the lion share of coshocton county emissions that are contributing to the violation in the columbus metropolitan area,id.discussion.epa presented comparable statistics for the townships designated nonattainment in adams and gallia counties.id.factor providing a similar rationale for designating monroe and sprigg townships in adams county and cheshire township in gallia county.epa reasonably concluded there was no need to designate as nonattainment any other part of these counties.
industry petitioners also argue that epa failed to use monitoring or modeling data in designating townships as nonattainment.but petitioners fail to identify any township designations lacking such support.and although we have no obligation to comb through the voluminous record in this case to determine the merits of an argument for which petitioners offer no support,see fed.app.a a requiring briefs to contain citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies,we note at least one instance in which we easily found that the record contradicts their assertion.epa used air quality modeling to determine that the power plant in franklin township was responsible for the vast majority of coshocton county contribution to violations in the columbus metropolitan area.see memorandum from brian timin richard damberg,epa office of air quality planning standards,air quality modeling to assess power plant impacts,technical support document discussion,factor,factor see also designations rule.at explaining that epa uses speciation data from monitors to determine which sources contribute to violations.
finally,industry petitioners contend that because epa designated only contiguous areas as nonattainment for excessive levels of ozone,it acted arbitrarily in not doing so for.but ozone was the subject of a different designations process and a separate rulemaking,and nothing compels epa to use the same approach for.petitioners emphasize that and ozone are both pollutants that can travel long distances.that similarity alone,however,is not enough to force epa to treat the two pollutants as if they pose the same threat to public health and welfare.when epa set forth the criteria it would use during the designations process,it explained that unlike ozone,can arise on a very localized basis.for example,violations can be caused by the emissions from a single major source or set of sources.holmstead memo guidance at.given this critical difference,epa was well within its discretion to consider state recommendations for smaller designations on a basis,id.
future reductions in emissions 
when it is evident that federally enforceable pollution controls will yield significant reductions in emissions,epa accounts for those forecasted reductions in estimating an area emissions levels for the purpose of evaluating contribution.see letter from stephen johnson,adm r,epa,to david flannery,counsel for midwest ozone group et,attach.at,johnson attach.industry petitioners argue that epa overestimated emissions levels and thus made mistaken designations by failing to account for future reductions from two federal programs the clean air interstate rule cair and the nox state implementation plan also known as the nox sip call.see generally north carolina epa.describing programs,modified.we find no error in epa refusal to consider estimates of lower emissions levels that might result from these two programs.
epa promulgated cair to reduce and nox emissions from upwind sources in states and the district of columbia that contribute to nonattainment levels for ozone and in downwind states.id.at.when epa made its designations,it reasonably decided emissions reductions from cair were,at the time,uncertain and should not be a factor in estimating emissions levels for the designations process.see johnson attach.at explaining that epa would include projected emissions reductions only for federally enforceable agreements that were in place by the time that epa was required to promulgate the designations in december.as discussed above,designations for,counties,and townships turn in part on contributions from identifiable sources.when epa made its designation decisions in december,there was no assurance that a state compliance with cair,which did not become effective until march,would result in reduced emissions for specific sources.indeed,cair did not require states to submit to epa their recommendations as to which power plants would reduce and nox emissions and how they would do so until september two years after the agency had designated areas under the naaqs.see rule to reduce interstate transport of fine particulate matter and ozone clean air interstate rule,may,rule to reduce interstate transport of fine particulate matter and ozone clean air interstate rule reconsideration,each state covered by cair may independently determine which emission sources to control,and which control measures to adopt.even epa provisional compliance to start reductions in emissions levels before states were required to file their not take effect until more than a year after the agency had completed designating areas.see rulemaking on section petition from north carolina to reduce interstate transport of fine particulate matter and ozone,see also north carolina,at describing program.it was therefore reasonable for epa to disregard as too speculative any claimed emissions reductions that might come from cair when it promulgated the designations in december.see johnson attach.at.
it was likewise reasonable for epa to disregard forecasted reductions from the nox sip call.created to reduce ozone pollution,this program requires upwind states and the district of columbia to decrease nox emissions,a significant precursor to,but it has nothing to do with reducing,another significant precursor.see finding of significant contribution and rulemaking for certain states in the ozone transport assessment group region for purposes of reducing regional transport of ozone.the power plants in question are often among the largest sources of in their respective areas.see johnson attach.at.epa concluded that reducing nox but not was a step in the right direction for reducing,but it fell short of what epa required to consider forecasted reductions in its designations.see id.at.lacking evidence of significant reductions in,epa reasonably decided not to alter nonattainment designations based only on forecasted reductions in nox.see,technical support document factor showing epa designated as attainment stokes county,north carolina,because a power plant there installed controls certain to reduce significantly both nox and.
carbon error 
in making nonattainment designations,epa relied upon a mistaken estimate of carbon emissions by power plants that burn bituminous coal.industry petitioners seize on this error as evidence that the designations rule is arbitrary and capricious.we disagree.epa used the best available information,and the mistaken estimate of carbon had no effect on the reasonableness of the challenged designations.
among the analytical tools epa uses to make designation determinations is a county weighted emissions score,which allows the agency to compare,nox,carbon,and crustal emissions across counties within a.see designations rule.at.this score is not based on measurements of actual emissions by a particular source.instead,epa uses emissions estimates from the national emissions inventory nei to calculate total emissions,as well as,nox,carbon,and crustal emissions for each county.see what is the national emissions inventory nei,http www.epa.gov ttn chief net neiwhatis.html last visited june.the nei is a database assembled by epa emission inventory and analysis group that houses estimates of the kinds and amounts of substances emitted by particular sources,including point sources like power plants and mobile sources like automobiles.based on these estimates,epa creates speciation profiles,which describe the chemicals that make up the emissions associated with a particular type of source.see speciation emissions modeling clearinghouse,last visited june.
the speciation profile epa used for large electric generating units egus estimated that carbon makes up of their emissions.as it turns out,that estimate was wrong for plants that burn bituminous coal.carbon accounts for only of their emissions.see at.epa updated the speciation profile for these plants in its revision of the naaqs,but retained the old profile for plants that burn primarily lignite coal.
industry petitioners argue that because the designations were based on a flawed egu profile that vastly overestimated carbon emissions,epa nonattainment designations for counties with large electric power plants that burn bituminous the identified in the petition for likewise flawed.epa responds that its ultimate designations did not turn on any one estimate of a single chemical component of.rather,the agency relied on numerous data points,including emissions levels and county rankings of weighted emissions scores within a,that were largely unaffected by the lower carbon estimate.according to epa,changes in the speciation profile for plants that burn bituminous coal did not substantially lower total emissions estimates.instead,the proportions of pollutants emitted by these sources changed.specifically,the estimate of crustal particles,also a precursor to,increased as the carbon estimate decreased.see johnson attach.at.
we hold that epa was not obligated to upend the designations process when it discovered a mistake in its speciation profile for certain power plants.epa used the best information available in making its designations,and that is all our precedent requires.in american iron steel institute epa,the petitioners argued that epa estimate for the mercury concentration permitted in the great lakes was flawed because the agency used inaccurate data that had since been corrected.relying on icc jersey city,and vermont yankee nuclear power natural resources defense council,d,we held that epa did not act arbitrarily by using the older data in its calculation.the agency was not obliged to stop the entire process because a new piece of evidence emerged.if this were true then the administrative process could never be completed.an agency does,however,have an obligation to deal with newly acquired evidence in some reasonable fashion.am.iron,at.
here,epa dealt with newly acquired evidence in a reasonable fashion by explaining why it would not have changed the challenged designations.epa is correct that revisions to the speciation profile for plants that burn bituminous coal altered only one component of the weighted emissions score,which itself is only one of numerous analytical tools used to assess the first of nine factors epa considers in determining contribution to violations.speciation profiles for power plants are by no means the exclusive or even the primary basis for epa designations,but merely make up one part of a much larger and decisionmaking process.johnson attach.at.
petitioners nonetheless contend that the carbon error is particularly important because carbon typically makes up a large portion of the urban excess and therefore weighs heavily in these counties weighted emissions scores,which themselves weigh heavily in the contribution analysis because of the presence of large power plants.that may be so,but epa granted a march request to recalculate the weighted emissions scores using the revised estimates and concluded 
that even if the agency were to reconsider the designations,the area by area evaluation of counties with emissions scores or activities contributing to violations of the naaqs would not result in a different outcome.of the counties petitioners identified in their petition,epa sees no change in the rank or magnitude of sources relative to other counties in the areas that would negate the appropriateness of inclusion of the counties within their respective designated nonattainment areas.
letter from stephen johnson,adm r,epa,to david flannery,counsel for midwest ozone group et,see also at showing initial and revised scores for the counties identified by petitioners johnson attach.at explaining why particular designations would not have changed with new data.even with a change in the estimated proportion of carbon emitted by plants that burn bituminous coal,the overall level of pollutants emitted by those egus generally stayed the same,as did county rankings of weighted emissions scores.for example,epa explained that using the new speciation data for a power plant in jefferson county,indiana,would not have changed its nonattainment designation despite industry petitioners claim that it is among the most problematic of epa determinations.see at midwest ozone petition for reconsideration.although the weighted emissions score for jefferson county would have been lower,it still would have been higher than surrounding counties scores because of the significant levels of and nox that the county power plant continued to emit.johnson attach.at.epa dealt with the carbon error in a reasonable fashion.
application of the test 
as explained above,epa uses nine things like air quality,population density,and traffic determine the boundaries of areas contributing to nearby violations.see designations rule.at see also supra at.state petitioners argue generally that epa arbitrarily applied its test by treating similarly situated counties differently without adequately explaining the allegedly divergent outcomes.in each of their challenges,petitioners seize upon discrete data points and ignore the very nature of the test,which is designed to analyze a wide variety of data on a basis,holmstead memo guidance at.it is epa holistic assessment of numerous factors that drives the single factor determines a particular designation.and although petitioners seek to paint a picture of systemwide inconsistencies,their challenges really amount to an attack on epa designations of a small group of new york counties.although we address such individual challenges in part vi,we conclude here that with respect to the system as a whole,epa consistently applied its test and adequately explained its decisions based on record evidence.
first factor 
epa characterizations of county emissions 
the first of the nine factors epa uses to designate areas calls for the agency to consider how emissions levels contribute to nearby violations.in describing these levels,epa characterizes a county emissions as low,high,significant,insignificant,and so forth.state petitioners argue that epa characterized county emissions inconsistently,providing further evidence that the designations were arbitrary.for example,petitioners claim it is manifestly arbitrary to designate as attainment counties with emissions levels epa characterized as low based on weighted emissions scores of sevier county,tennessee and jasper county,georgia,while designating as nonattainment counties with lower scores of orange county,new york,westchester county,new york,and rockland county,new york.states opening br.as explained above,a weighted emissions score reflects only a county share of a total emissions.weighted emissions scores can not be used in any meaningful way to compare emissions levels between counties in different.because cumulative emissions scores for all counties within a must total,areas with few counties like the athens,georgia,msa will invariably have relatively larger scores than areas with numerous counties like the,even though emissions levels in the smaller may be lower.
likewise,petitioners argue that two instances in which epa revised a county designation from nonattainment to attainment show that its characterization of emissions data and subsequent designations were arbitrary.epa originally described the emissions levels in woodford county,kentucky,as significant and designated it as nonattainment.technical support document factor.but epa later any change in emissions the county has relatively low emissions,id.justifications for changes to epa recommendations contained in the june,letters to states,and revised its designation to attainment.these changes,petitioners argue,reflect the flawed manner in which epa applied the first factor.but epa adequately explained the change.after the initial designation,kentucky submitted evidence that violations in nearby fayette county were due to local sources,not emissions from woodford county as originally thought.id.petitioners reply that epa used the new data to explain the change in woodford county designation,not the change in epa assessment of emissions levels.to the extent that is even true,though,we can reasonably discern epa path.given that the weighted emissions score is a rough estimate of a county relative and relevant emissions in the first place,epa simply interpreted the numeric score differently when the new data suggested its facial significance was inaccurate.
in the same vein,petitioners contend epa acted arbitrarily in revising its designation for jasper county,georgia.finding significant emissions that potentially contribute to violations in other parts of the region,epa originally designated the county as nonattainment.see id.factor.data later submitted by georgia,however,showed that emissions from a source in jasper county were actually insignificant,prompting epa to redesignate the county as attainment.see id.justification for changes to epa recommendations contained in the june,letters to states letter from ron methier,chief,air prot.branch.dep t of natural,to beverly bannister,air,pesticides toxics mgmt,epa region,at.far from being arbitrary,these revised designations demonstrate the reasonableness of epa approach to applying the first factor.
first factor 
epa region use of a test 
as explained in greater detail in part vi,epa region used a test to determine which counties within a would be designated as attainment.the test worked like this epa region ranked each of its counties from highest to lowest according to their weighted emissions scores.starting from the top of the list,epa region added each county score and stopped when the sum hit.counties above the point were presumed to be nonattainment those below were designated as attainment,provided they did not have a violating monitor and were not among those recommended for nonattainment status by a state.see technical support document factor.state petitioners argue that application of this test led to inconsistent area designations,and they are right in one instance.rockland county,new york,which is not in epa region and was designated as nonattainment,would have been designated as attainment under the test.such an inconsistency is evidence of an arbitrary designation,but as part vi explains,epa mistaken designation of rockland county is an aberration,and petitioners fail to identify any other designation that might have changed had epa applied the test elsewhere.nothing about the way epa region applied the first factor reveals a fundamental problem with epa evaluation of emissions in potentially contributing areas.
second factor use of design values 
under the second of the nine factors,which looks to air quality,epa uses monitoring data to compute a design value to describe the concentration of ambient in a county.see supra at.the agency then compares the design value to the annual naaqs to help determine whether the county is violating standards or contributing to violations nearby.see epa br.state petitioners argue that epa arbitrarily designated some counties as nonattainment despite their relatively low design values and other counties as attainment despite their higher design values.for example,epa designated hardin county,kentucky,as attainment even though its design value of was higher than the design value for westchester county,new york,which was designated as nonattainment.see technical support docu
