defendant american premier underwriters,apu,appeals the judgment for plaintiff franklin county convention facilities authority cfa following a bench trial in this action under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act of cercla,as amended by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of sara,stat.apu makes eight arguments the material released at the site was never conclusively identified as a hazardous substance cfa did not incur response costs in a manner consistent with the national oil and hazardous substances pollution contingency plan ncp,part,as required by cercla the hazardous material was not placed on the property while it was owned by a predecessor of apu cfa is not an innocent land owner under cercla even if the district court properly allowed cfa to include a contribution action,the district court abused its discretion by allocating of the liability to apu under the district court improperly allowed cfa to include a contribution action when it had only pleaded a response cost recovery action cfa attorney fee award,totaling,was not a necessary response cost,as required by cercla and applying cercla retroactively to this case violates the due process and takings clauses.we affirm for reasons slightly different than those given by the district court.
defendant apu is the surviving corporate successor of several railroad companies,including penn central,the cleveland,columbus and cincinnati railroad company ccc,the columbus and xenia railroad company c x,and the union depot company,all of which operated in columbus,ohio,beginning in the century.cfa is a public agency operating pursuant to chapter of the ohio revised code.
sometime prior to,a wooden box filled with creosote and benzene measuring feet by feet by eleven feet,was buried near a railroad depot in columbus.the box straddled two tracts of land that had been purchased by ccc and c x in,and had most likely been used as a tank for soaking wooden railroad ties,bridge timbers,and other materials.records of the box disappeared over time,if they existed at all.
in,the city of columbus city exercised its eminent domain authority over a parcel of property,which included the land upon which the box had been buried.by purchase agreement following an independent appraisal,the city paid penn central and other predecessors of apu the fair market value of for the land.the portion of the land containing the box was acquired to the ohio center authority,one of the parties to the purchase agreement.among other things,the railroad companies agreed to remain responsible for any claims which may affect any portion of the premises.
in october,cfa commissioned a private consultant to conduct three environmental assessments for the property.these assessments attempted in part to identify storage tanks and hazardous substances using soil sampling,groundwater monitoring,examination of records,and other tests.none of the tests revealed the presence of the box.at the conclusion of the testing,cfa subleased the property from the city for the purpose of constructing a new convention facility.
in october,a contractor hired by cfa was digging a storm sewer line with a backhoe when he accidentally split open the box.some of the creosote and benzene mixture seeped into the ground,omitting a strong,objectionable odor.an environmental consultant was immediately called to the scene,and the ohio environmental protection agency ohio epa was notified within several days.chemical analyses performed by cfa environmental consultant determined that the material was creosote mixed with benzene.
within a week of discovering the box,cfa notified the city.accounts of the box and its contents were published in the local newspapers,which continued coverage as significant events occurred.cfa board meetings,which were open to the public and covered by local media,included oral and written status reports concerning the site.an executive director of cfa was designated to speak to community groups,to handle all media inquiries,and to respond to public records requests.in march,the ohio epa prepared a detailed report on the pollution and the risks presented to the human and natural environment.cfa environmental consultant also prepared a report with recommendations as to different methods of disposal.after considering its options,cfa tentatively chose to remove and transport the contamination to an location.cfa prepared detailed job specifications,which were approved by the ohio epa,and consulted the united states epa.the remediation was publicly bid to foster wheeler enviresponse in august.
on september,cfa sent a demand letter to apu expressly referencing cercla.the demand contained no dollar amount,but requested that penn central accept financial responsibility for remediation of the contamination.apu declined,and despite various written and oral invitations,did not request to investigate the box or comment upon the remediation.
the remediation began in october.in the course of removing the creosote,foster wheeler discovered that it had migrated into approximately feet of pea gravel surrounding a sewer line.foster wheeler erected a barrier to prevent further migration,excavated a significant amount of contaminated material around the box,and encapsulated the remaining contamination with compacted soil and concrete.
during the remediation,a contract dispute arose between cfa and foster wheeler,which had spent nearly million on the its authority by approximately.ensuing litigation in the ohio state courts resulted in a verdict for cfa,which ultimately paid foster wheeler only.
on october,cfa commenced this action to recover the response costs it incurred in the remediation.on april,at the close of discovery,apu moved for summary judgment.the district court denied apu motion,but resolved several relevant issues.first,it concluded that cfa,as a statutorily created government entity,was not a state within the meaning of cercla,and therefore had the burden of proving that its response costs were incurred in a manner consistent with the ncp second,it ruled that the ncp standards for a remedial action,and,applied third,it ruled that cfa could proceed concurrently under both cercla a,for response cost recovery,and cercla f,for contribution,despite having only pleaded a cause of action for cost recovery.
on january,the united states intervened to defend the constitutionality of retroactive application of cercla.
after a bench trial,judgment was entered for cfa for,plus prejudgment interest.in a separate published memorandum and order,the court upheld the retroactive application of cercla to apu.see franklin county convention facilities auth.american premier underwriters,d.
we review de novo the district court conclusions of law.see carter jones lumber dixie distrib,cir.we similarly review mixed questions of fact and law de novo.see wooldridge marlene,cir.
the district court factual findings are reviewed for clear error.see id.considerable weight is afforded to findings of fact they will be reversed only if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.see stevens mcginnis,cir.where two logically permissive interpretations of the evidence exist,the trial judge selection can not be adjudged clearly erroneous on appeal.see anderson city of bessemer city,north carolina,d.the clearly erroneous standard applies when findings are based entirely on physical or documentary evidence,as well as on inferences from other facts.see id.
cercla,as amended by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of sara,is a comprehensive environmental statute principally designed to effectuate two goals the cleanup of toxic waste sites and the compensation of those who have attended to the remediation of environmental hazards.see meghrig kfc western,d.to establish a prima facie case for cost recovery under a,a plaintiff must prove four elements the site is a facility a release or threatened release of hazardous substance has occurred the release has caused the plaintiff to incur necessary costs of response consistent with the ncp and the defendant falls within one of the four categories of potentially responsible parties.see centerior serv.acme scrap iron metal,cir.apu challenges the court findings on all but the first element.in addition,apu challenges the court decision to simultaneously allow actions under cercla and,the apportionment of total liability to apu,the award of certain attorney fees to cfa,and the constitutionality of retroactive application of cercla.
apu contends that the substance in the box was never properly identified by cfa as a hazardous substance.rather than creosote and benzene,apu suggests that the box could have contained some form of petroleum.a private plaintiff seeking to recover response costs must demonstrate that the material released was a hazardous substance.see a.under cercla,petroleum and any fraction thereof not specifically listed or designated as a hazardous substance is excluded from the definition of a hazardous substance.see.however,petroleum products mixed with hazardous substances not constituent elements of petroleum are hazardous substances.see united states alcan aluminum,cir holding that the petroleum exclusion was intended to exempt oil spills,not releases of oil that have become infused with hazardous substances through use.
apu argument takes several forms.first,apu asserts that the district court improperly concluded that the burden of proving whether the substance was hazardous belonged to apu.second,apu argues that the court findings are not supported in the record because cfa chose not to perform additional tests which would have conclusively identified the substance.apu does not dispute the presence of benzene,but contends that benzene is a constituent of gasoline and other petroleum products which would have qualified for the petroleum exception.third,apu asserts that the district court erroneously relied on witness testimony that the material smelled like creosote,even though witnesses testified that odor is not an accurate method of identifying a substance.fourth,apu argues that the court conclusion that the material was creosote and benzene is contradicted by evidence in the record.to support this final contention,apu points to a long list of facts which the court allegedly overlooked,including an article from suggesting that wood could not be treated by oils lighter than water,such as benzene,an article from,approximately thirty years after the latest date upon which the box could have been buried,suggesting that wood could be treated with creosote diluted with lighter petroleum products such as benzene,and an expert witness who testified that benzene was not used to thin creosote until.apu adds that the court ignored ample evidence showing that the substance was some derivative of petroleum railroads in the late nineteenth century manufactured gas from petroleum that was piped to waiting passenger cars a roundhouse,associated with oil used for maintenance purposes,was on adjacent property annual reports from area railroads for and which show expenditures for oil,but none for creosote the presence of underground petroleum storage tanks in the area and the existence of oil refining businesses in the area prior to.
the district court concluded that the material in the box was creosote diluted with benzene,possessing sufficient strength upon testing in to constitute a hazardous substance under cercla.in addition to environmental testing performed in,the court based this finding on circumstantial evidence,including nineteenth century literature which suggested that creosote thinned with a volatile oil could be used to treat wood products.the court specifically rejected apu theory that the box and its contents could have been used by oil refining businesses existing in the area because no evidence associated oil businesses with the property in question,and such a conclusion would be too attenuated and speculative.the court also rejected apu contention that additional testing should have been performed,finding that no indication was given in the ohio epa reports and consultations that the agency believed more or different chemical testing was in order.the court concluded that to require additional testing,especially in view of the undisputed presence of benzene in levels which made the substance a hazardous waste,would undercut a primary purpose of cercla by discouraging voluntary,private cleanup efforts.finally,the court noted that even though apu had notice of the spill in september,it never requested independent tests.
we affirm the district court because its findings are supported by the record and we are not left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.four witnesses testified that creosote has a distinctive odor,and all three witness who observed the box on the site identified the substance as creosote based on their familiarity with the chemical odor.the district court was free to assign heavier weight to the testimony of the three witnesses who identified the substance as creosote,than to the notion that smell is not a reliable method of identifying a chemical.in any event,evidence suggests that creosote was commonly used,in combination with other substances like benzene,as a preservative for wood products.perhaps most importantly,laboratory testing indicated that benzene was present in a quantity sufficient to require treatment as a hazardous substance under cercla.
although apu evidence relating to local petroleum businesses raises the specter that the substance might have been some form of petroleum,the inference is weak because nothing in the record connects the petroleum businesses with the property at issue.the mere proximity of petroleum businesses is not sufficient to render the court finding clearly erroneous.moreover,that benzene is a constituent of petroleum,but not creosote,also raises the possibility that the substance in the box might have been petroleum.however,this inference is not well supported in the record,and is insufficient to call the court finding into question.we also note that apu,despite receiving notice prior to the remediation,did not suggest that additional testing was in order.
finally,nothing in the court decision suggests that it decided this issue based on the burden of proof.regardless of whose burden it was,the evidence was sufficient to support the court conclusion that the material in the box was creosote mixed with benzene.
therefore,in light of the evidence supporting the conclusion that the box contained creosote mixed with benzene,and mindful of the deference that we must pay to the court ability to judge witness credibility,we affirm the district court finding that the substance in the box was a hazardous substance under cercla.
apu argues that cfa is not entitled to recover response costs because it did not incur those costs consistently with the ncp cercla authorizes a private plaintiff to recover from liable parties only necessary response costs that are consistent with the ncp.see a b.it is undisputed that the ncp as amended in applies to this case.we review de novo the district court conclusion that the remedial action substantially complied with the ncp and was a cleanup.see bedford affiliates sills,cir.
for the purpose of cost recovery under cercla a b,a cleanup will be consistent with the ncp if,taken as a whole,it is in substantial compliance with c,and results in a cleanup.c i.immaterial or insubstantial deviation from the ncp will not deem the cleanup not consistent.see c.areas of the ncp which potentially apply,under c i ix,to private party response actions,include,among others,provisions providing for worker health and safety,documentation and cost recovery,and identification of arars.likewise,c states that private parties undertaking response actions should provide an opportunity for public comment concerning the selection of the response action based on potentially applicable ncp public notice and comment procedures.
a cleanup is a response action that protects human health and the environment,utilizes permanent solutions and alternative treatment technologies or resource recovery technologies to the maximum extent practicable,is,satisfies applicable and relevant or appropriate requirements arars for the site,and provides opportunity for meaningful public participation.see national oil and hazardous substances pollution contingency plan,march.
the district court concluded that cfa substantially complied with the ncp.apu disagrees,arguing that cfa failed to meet the ncp technical requirements for remedial investigation,feasibility study,remedial design,and record of decision rd,identify and satisfy arars,provide notice and meaningful opportunity for public comment throughout the remediation,notify apu of its potential liability,consider alternative treatment technologies,and perform a remediation.
first,we reject apu contention that cfa did not substantially comply with the ncp rd requirements.the,as defined in and governed principally by,is intended to determine the extent of contamination and possible remedies.see united states akzo coatings,cir.ri emphasizes data collection and site characterization,while the fs uses that data to define the objectives of the response action and to develop remedial action alternatives.see.the rod is a document setting forth the proposed remedy as recommended in the.see akzo coatings of america,at.the rd stage includes the actual design of the selected remedy,as well as its implementation.see.here,cfa initially hired an environmental consultant to investigate the site.the ohio epa also conducted an assessment of the site.cfa considered numerous options for the remediation,as presented by its environmental consultant,and developed a remediation plan that ultimately was approved by the ohio epa.finally,each step in the remediation process was well documented by cfa.under these circumstances,we conclude that cfa substantially complied with the ncp rd requirements.
second,we reject apu argument that cfa did not substantially comply with its obligation to identify and comply with arars.although cercla does not define arars,it requires that remedial actions result in a level of cleanup that at least meets the legally applicable or otherwise relevant and appropriate federal or stricter state requirements.see d a.applicable requirements are defined in the ncp as those cleanup standards,standards of control,and other substantive requirements,criteria,or limitations promulgated under federal environmental or state environmental or facility siting laws that specifically address a hazardous substance,pollutant,contaminant,remedial action,location,or other circumstance found at a cercla site.relevant and appropriate requirements are those cleanup standards,standards of control,and other substantive requirements,criteria,or limitations promulgated under federal environmental or state environmental or facility siting laws that,while not applicable to a hazardous substance,pollutant,contaminant,remedial action,location,or other circumstance at a cercla site,address problems or situations sufficiently similar to those encountered at the cercla site that their use is well suited to the particular site.id.here,we agree with the district court that the significant involvement of the ohio epa,including its preliminary report outlining the dangers presented to the human and natural environment,as well as the involvement of the united states epa,with whom cfa consulted on a limited basis,is strong evidence to suggest that cfa satisfied its obligation to meet arars.moreover,nothing in the record suggests that the cleanup violated any relevant and appropriate federal or state requirement.
third and fourth,we conclude that cfa substantially complied with the public notice and comment requirement,and provided adequate notice to apu.in c,the ncp identifies notice and comment requirements that are potentially applicable to private remedial actions.first,a private party may be required to provide the public with prompt and accurate information regarding the incident,and to establish a method for disseminating information,such as through an news office.see.second,c requires that a party solicit concerns from the public and prepare a formal community relations plan.third,a private party may have to comply with f,which requires,among other things,a publicly available report describing the preferred remedy along with various alternatives,and a reasonable opportunity,not less than calendar days,for comment.similarly,f requires that a copy of the rod be made available for public inspection.lastly,c generally requires parties to continue providing notice and comment opportunities through the rd phase.
here,the city was given notice in,almost immediately after the incident.apu was notified nearly a month prior to the commencement of the remediation.the media covered significant developments at the site,as well as public cfa board meetings,at which the remediation was discussed and opportunity for public comment given.a cfa director was appointed to speak to community groups,to handle all media inquiries,and to respond to public records requests.
notwithstanding these actions,cfa compliance was not perfect.nothing suggests that cfa continued providing notice and comment opportunities throughout the rd stage,nor is it clear from the record how closely cfa adhered to the technical minutia of the notice and comment provisions.nevertheless,we conclude that cfa shortcomings were immaterial and insubstantial deviations from the technical ncp requirements,and should not,on these facts,bar cfa from recovering its response costs.we note that the district court expressly found that no residential neighborhoods were proximate to the cfa cite,and that no citizens group or other organization ever contacted cfa about environmental problems of any kind.the epa,in explaining the substantial compliance standard,explicitly contemplated these types of findings w hat may be a significant deviation from procedures under one set of circumstances may be less serious in another for example some communities may express no interest in a site,resulting in fewer public meetings.national oil and hazardous substances pollution contingency plan.at.thus,although cfa compliance with the ncp notice and comment requirements was not perfect,we conclude that any deviation was immaterial,insubstantial,and did not affect the overall quality of the cleanup.
apu cites pierson sand gravel,pierson township,wl cir.june,unpub.per curiam,where we held that a private party plaintiff failure to substantially comply with the ncp public notice and comment requirement prevented recovery of response costs under cercla.pierson sand gravel is distinguishable on its facts.in that case,this court found that improperly noticed and otherwise incidental opportunities for public comment would not satisfy the ncp.see id.at.there,the notice preceding one public meeting concerning an application for a landfill permit did not mention that alternatives for a remediation would be discussed.see id.a second meeting was held,but with similarly inadequate notice and only after a remediation plan had been adopted.see id.in the instant case,however,the public board meetings,regular media coverage,and appointment of a cfa director to speak to community groups and respond to public records requests provided direct notice and opportunity for comment,not merely incidental notice and opportunity for comment as in pierson sand gravel.moreover,in pierson sand gravel there were no findings concerning the lack of community interest.here,the district court specifically concluded that the affected area was not residential,and that there had been no real desire in the community to participate in the remediation process.therefore,although this is a close issue,we distinguish pierson sand gravel and conclude that under the facts of this case,cfa substantially complied with its obligation to provide meaningful notice and opportunity for comment concerning the remediation.
fifth,apu contends that cfa failed to consider and utilize alternative treatment technologies to the greatest extent possible.this argument is without merit.the record reveals that cfa environmental consultant discussed numerous treatment alternatives in its report to cfa,including bioremediation,fuel blending,recycling,incineration,and removal to a landfill.the report ultimately identified either encapsulation or removal to a landfill as the two most feasible options.although apu contends that cfa imprudently rejected alternatives such as fuel blending and recycling,given the analysis provided by cfa consultant,we can not conclude that cfa acted improperly in choosing to remove the waste to a landfill.
finally,apu contends that the cleanup was not.we disagree.to be consistent with the ncp,all remedial actions must be.see f ii d.is determined by comparing overall effectiveness to cost.see id.overall effectiveness is determined by evaluating three criteria effectiveness and permanence reduction of toxicity,mobility,or volume through treatment and effectiveness.see id.a remedy is if its costs are proportional to its overall effectiveness.see id.
here,cfa chose to remove much of the contamination to a landfill,and to encapsulate the remainder.in doing so,cfa incurred in costs.while cfa could have saved up to by opting for ecapsulation rather than removal,we conclude that this amount is insignificant when compared to the benefits cfa achieved in terms of permanence and reduction of mobility and volume by opting to remove as much of the contamination as possible.therefore,we affirm the district court finding that the remediation was.
in sum,the district court properly determined that cfa substantially complied with the ncp.although cfa compliance was not perfect,the ncp requirements are not intended to be a checklist of required actions for private remediations.a n omission based on lack of experience with the superfund program should not be grounds for defeating an otherwise valid cost recovery action,assuming the omission does not affect the quality of the cleanup.at.in other words,cercla is to be liberally construed to serve its dual purposes of efficientlycleaning the environment,while at the same time holding responsible parties accountable for their actions.see in re,cir martin,concurring.taken as a whole,cfa remediation substantially complied with the ncp and resulted in a cleanup as that term has been described by the epa.to allow apu to avoid liability for its share of the response costs,under these circumstances,would undermine cercla intended purposes.we affirm on this issue.
apu argues that the district court improperly relied on circumstantial evidence to conclude that penn central,its predecessor corporation,was an owner or operator of the property at the time the hazardous substance was deposited.we review the court factual finding for clear error.
cercla imposes liability on,among others,any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which hazardous substances were disposed of.a.
in concluding that the box was owned by apu predecessors,the district court relied on circumstantial evidence,which it set out in great detail in its findings of fact.first,the court concluded that the box was not in use prior to september,when a color lithograph of downtown columbus was prepared.the print shows that the land upon which the box was eventually buried was being used as a pasture,not for industrial activity.next,the court noted that the box straddled two pieces of property identified as tracts six and thirteen on a master property map maintained by apu.these tracts were acquired for railroad use in jointly by c x and ccc,and no record existed of an easement,lease agreement,or other joint use of the property prior to that date.thus,because the box straddled the tracts,the court concluded that it could not have been constructed prior to.moreover,the court observed that the box had been very well constructed,and therefore was not likely to have been built by native americans or early settlers,who had been engaged principally in farming or other activity.taking note of nineteenth century literature which suggested that creosote and related materials were used to preserve wood,the court concluded that the box had been used as a pit or tank for soaking railroad ties,bridge timbers,and other wooden material.
the district court did not clearly err.although apu objects to the absence of direct evidence linking the box to any of apu predecessors,there is nothing objectionable in basing findings solely on circumstantial evidence,especially where the passage of time has made direct evidence difficult or impossible to obtain.we accord great deference to the district court factual findings,which in this case were meticulously drawn from a record that may have supported competing conclusions.because there is no clear error,we affirm.
apu argues that the court erred in concluding that cfa qualifies for cercla innocent landowner defense,set forth at b.as discussed above,cercla a imposes liability on four classes of parties,including the present owner and operator of a vessel or a facility.cercla defines a facility as including any site or area where a hazardous substance has been deposited,stored,disposed of,or placed,or otherwise come to be located.an otherwise liable facility owner or operator can escape liability by demonstrating that the release or threatened release was caused solely by an act or omission of a third party see b united states acres of land,cir.cercla defines a release as any spilling,leaking,pumping,pouring,emitting,emptying,discharging,injecting,escaping,leaching,dumping,or disposing into the environment including the abandonment or discarding of barrels,containers,and other closed receptacles containing any hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant.
apu contends that cfa is not an innocent landowner because cfa contractor split open the box,releasing the hazardous substance.additionally,apu asserts that cfa did not exercise due care once the material was released because cfa failed to erect a barrier to prevent the creosote from spreading.apu supports its position that cfa should have erected a barrier with expert testimony that a barrier was required to meet the standard of care in the industry.apu also cites several cases from other circuits which suggest that a party responsible for moving a hazardous substance throughout a site,such as by spreading it to uncontaminated portions of the land,may incur cercla liability.see redwing carriers,saraland apartments,cir tanglewood homeowners,cir.in response,cfa does not argue that,as sublessee of the property,it is not an owner or operator within the meaning of cercla rather,it contends only that the innocent landowner defense applies.
the district court concluded that cfa was an innocent landowner.we disagree.first,we note that cfa played no role in placing the hazardous substance at the site,nor could have reasonably been aware of the box presence.moreover,even though cfa contractor split open the box,this was accidental and unavoidable,and can not fairly be attributed to cfa,tanglewood homeowners,at party filled several creosote pools with soil and then spread the soil over the entire site.nevertheless,we think that cfa failed to exercise due care after discovering the box.although it immediately ceased work and contacted an environmental consultant,for some unexplained reason cfa allowed a significant amount of creosote to migrate approximately feet,through an open sewer trench.although cfa claims that there was a dam of sorts from dirt and debris that was backing the material up and holding it in place before it reached the concrete sewer line trench,it is clear that this natural barrier was insufficient to prevent further contamination.eventually,cfa erected a barrier to avoid further migration,but this did not occur until late november,more than a year after the box was discovered,and more than eight months after the ohio epa,as part of its preliminary assessment,notified cfa that the creosote may have gotten into a seam of the sewer pipe or may migrate down the channel of the sewer.under these circumstances,we can not conclude that cfa acted with due care with respect to the contamination.we therefore reject the court determination that cfa qualifies for cercla innocent landowner exception.
apu argues that the district court should have allocated some portion of the total liability to cfa.because we have concluded that cfa is not immune from cercla liability as an innocent landowner,cfa cause of action under cercla is properly characterized as an action for contribution under f.we must therefore address apu argument.
congress added f,an express authorization of claims for contribution,as part of sara,which was enacted in.see superfund amendments and reauthorization act of,f,stat,codified as amended at f.section f states that a ny person may seek contribution from any other person who is liable or potentially liable under cercla a for response costs.f.in resolving contribution claims,the court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate.id.the apportionment of cercla liability under f among various responsible parties is an equitable undertaking within the broad discretion of the district court.see united states meyer,cir holding that a court may take into account more varying circumstances than common law contribution,including the state of mind of the parties,their economic status,any contracts between them bearing on the subject,any traditional equitable defenses,and any other factors deemed appropriate to balance the equities in the totality of the circumstances.
we reject apu argument.although the court concluded that cfa was not subject to cercla liability as an innocent landowner under,it also concluded,alternatively,that even if this determination were incorrect,this court would adjudge defendant american premier responsible for a contribution share under.specifically,the court reasoned that equitable factors,such as apu refusal to participate in cleanup efforts despite notice from cfa,militate for this result.additionally,we note that apu predecessor,in its agreement with the city of columbus,agreed to remain responsible for any claims which may affect any portion of the premises.mindful of the broad discretion of the district court,we can not conclude on these facts that the court abused its discretion by allocating total liability to apu.
apu argues that the district court,in its pretrial order,improperly allowed cfa to assert a concurrent contribution action under cercla f because the complaint pleaded only a response cost recovery action under cercla a.we review the district court decision for abuse of discretion.
here,the district court did not abuse its discretion because an order entered after a pretrial conference supersedes the pleadings.see moore federal practice,matthew bender ed.therefore,we affirm the district court on this issue.
apu argues that the award for attorney fees incurred by steven gentry,cfa independent attorney,was not a necessary response cost.as stated above,cercla permits recovery of any necessary costs of response incurred consistent with the national contingency plan.a b.fees are not recoverable,but legal work that is closely tied to the actual that benefits the entire cleanup and serves a statutory purpose other than cost constitute a necessary cost of response.see key tronic united states,d.for example,work performed in identifying potentially responsible parties is recoverable.see id.
apu contends that the portion of the attorney fees awarded to cfa for work performed in preparing waste manifests is not a necessary response cost.moreover,apu asserts that cfa should not have been awarded fees for work performed in identifying potentially responsible parties because gentry did not identify apu as a potentially responsible party.
the district court concluded that gentry fees were not,but were closely tied to the actual cleanup and therefore recoverable by cfa.we agree.gentry work with the waste manifests and identifying potentially responsible parties was a necessary cost of response because it arose during the cleanup process,had nothing to do with any litigation,and benefitted the cleanup as a whole by increasing the probability that the cleanup would be effective.moreover,key tronic expressly approves of attorney fees in connection with identifying potentially responsible parties,and we are unpersuaded by apu assertion that an attorney seeking to identify such parties must actually identify those who will ultimately be responsible for payment.rather,as indicated in key tronic,it is enough that cfa actions increased the probability of an effective cleanup.at.thus,we affirm the district court on this issue.
apu argues that the retroactive application of cercla violates substantive due process and amounts to an unconstitutional taking under the fifth amendment.we review this constitutional issue de novo.see lumber,at.
as an initial matter,cfa argues that apu is estopped from challenging the constitutionality of cercla retroactive application because apu predecessor corporation,penn central,litigated the due process and takings issues in penn central united states.however,preclusion may be defeated by showing that there has been a substantial change in the legal climate that suggests a new understanding of the governing legal rules which may require different application.charles wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,at.although myriad courts have upheld the constitutionality of cercla retroactive application,the supreme court recently decided eastern enterprises apfel,d,in which the court invalidated retroactive application of the coal industry retiree health benefit act of coal act.because eastern enterprises signals a change in the legal climate,we reject cfa preclusion argument.
apu contends that retroactive application of cercla violates substantive due process.in general,due process is satisfied simply by showing that the retroactive application of the legislation is itself justified by a rational legislative purpose.pension benefit guar.gray,d.legislative acts adjusting the burdens and benefits of economic life carry a presumption of constitutionality,and the burden of proving that the legislature acted in an arbitrary and irrational way is on the party complaining of the violation.see usery turner elkhorn mining,d.
the issue here is squarely framed by examining two supreme court cases.first,in usery,the supreme court decided a challenge to title iv of the federal coal mine health and safety act of,as amended by the black lung benefits act of,et,which,inter alia,made coal mine operators responsible for paying benefits to miners who left employment in the industry before the statute effective date.at.a group of operators challenged this retroactive application under the due process clause,arguing that to impose liability upon them for former employees disabilities is impermissibly to charge them with an unexpected liability for past,completed acts that were legally proper and unknown to be dangerous at the time.id.at.the court upheld the statute constitutionality,reasoning that liability for the effects of disabilities bred in the past is justified as a rational measure to spread the costs of the employees disabilities to those who have profited from the fruits of the employees labor.id.at.in response to the operators argument that their liability was disproportionate to the number of miners currently employed,the court noted that i t is enough to say that the act approaches the problem of cost spreading rationally.id.at.the court expressly held that our cases are clear that legislation readjusting rights and burdens is not unlawful solely because it upsets otherwise settled expectations.this is true even though the effect of the legislation is to impose a new duty or liability based on past acts.id.at.citations omitted.
second,in eastern enterprises,a deeply divided court struck down retroactive application of the coal industry retiree health benefit act of cirhba.at.plurality op,kennedy,concurring in judgment.there,under an allocation formula provided in cirhba,retirement benefits for some employees,including guaranteed health care benefits established by a series of collective bargaining agreements in the,were assigned to employers who had left the industry even before the agreements became operative.five justices
