wilderness watch appeals the grant of summary judgment to the national park service on its complaint seeking to enjoin the park service practice of using motor vehicles to transport visitors across the designated wilderness area on cumberland island,georgia.wilderness watch asserts that this practice violates the wilderness act,and also that the park service made the decision to transport tourists without conducting the investigation and analysis of potential environmental impact required by the national environmental policy act nepa.finally,wilderness watch claims that the park service established an advisory committee without the public notice and participation required by the federal advisory committee act,rendering the agreement signed following those meetings invalid and unenforceable 
we review de novo a grant of summary judgment,applying the same legal standards used by the district court.shotz city of plantation,cir.the administrative procedure act,which governs review of agency action,permits courts to set aside agency action when it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.
i.the wilderness act 
mindful of our increasing population,accompanied by expanding settlement and growing mechanization,congress passed the wilderness act in order to preserve and protect certain lands in their natural condition and thus secure for present and future generations the benefits of wilderness.a.the act recognized the value of preserving an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man,where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.id.at c.congress therefore directed that designated wilderness areas shall be administered for the use and enjoyment of the american people in such manner as will leave them unimpaired for future use and enjoyment as wilderness,and so as to provide for the protection of these areas,the preservation of their wilderness character,and for the gathering and dissemination of information regarding their use and enjoyment as wilderness.id.at a.
cumberland island,which features some of the last remaining undeveloped land on the barrier islands along the atlantic coast of the united states,was declared by congress to be a national seashore in.ten years later,congress designated as wilderness or potential some acres,including most of the northern of the island.see,stat.under the aegis of the secretary of the interior,the park service thus became responsible for administering the wilderness area in accordance with the applicable provisions of the wilderness act.id.at c.today,visitors to cumberland island must leave their vehicles on the mainland and travel to the island by boat.
in addition to wilderness area,park service land includes several buildings and facilities on the southern end of the island as well as two historical areas on the northern and western coasts plum orchard,just outside the wilderness boundary,and the settlement,located in potential wilderness area historically,these two locations have been reached via the main road,a dirt road that has also been designated as part of the wilderness and potential wilderness areas.
once federal land has been designated as wilderness,the wilderness act places severe restrictions on commercial activities,roads,motorized vehicles,motorized transport,and structures within the area,subject to very narrow exceptions and existing private rights.specifically,the relevant section provides 
except as specifically provided for in this chapter,and subject to existing private rights,there shall be no commercial enterprise and no permanent road within any wilderness area designated by this chapter and,except as necessary to meet minimum requirements for the administration of the area for the purpose of this chapter including measures required in emergencies involving the health and safety of persons within the area,there shall be no temporary road,no use of motor vehicles,motorized equipment or motorboats,no landing of aircraft,no other form of mechanical transport,and no structure or installation within any such area.
c.thus,aside from exceptions not relevant here the statute permits the use of motor vehicles and transport only as necessary to meet minimum requirements for the administration of the area for the purpose of this chapter.id.
following the wilderness designation,the park service continued to use the existing dirt road to access the historical areas motorized transportation on cumberland island became a controversial issue in the,as the federal government sought to obtain remaining private tracts on the island and various groups called for greater public access to and support of the historical sites.an informal group of environmental organizations,historical societies,and local residents met several times in an attempt to discuss and ultimately to influence park service policy.jack kingston,the representative to congress from the district including cumberland,introduced legislation that would have removed the wilderness designation from the roads leading to the historical sites.this bill died in committee in,but later that year the park service convened the first of two meetings with many of the same interested parties in an attempt to negotiate a solution to the conflict over its policies.in february the park service agreed to provide regular public access to plum orchard and the settlement via park service motor vehicles until boat service could be established.
the park service claimed that it needed motorized access to the historical areas in order to meet its obligations to restore,maintain,preserve and curate the historic resources and permit visitor access and interpretation.at.the service also claimed that permitting tourists to piggyback along on park service personnel trips to these locations would yield no net increase in impact,that is,the number of trips and overall impact on the area would be no greater than if the park service were simply meeting its statutory obligations.id.for the first two months,the park service used vehicles that held four passengers,but the agency soon acquired a van in order to accommodate larger numbers of visitors.the park service offered trips to plum orchard three times per week and to the settlement once per month.although the park service had not previously visited the sites on a regular schedule,the agency decided to establish a regular schedule in order to accommodate the transportation of visitors 
wilderness watch objects to this arrangement,arguing that the wilderness act restricts motorized vehicle use within wilderness areas to the minimum necessary for an agency to meet its administrative needs for the purpose of the wilderness act and not for any other purpose.thus,wilderness watch argues,the statute prohibits the park service from offering these piggybacked tours to visitors.
the park service,on the other hand,reads the statute to allow visitors to ride along with its employees as they travel to plum orchard and the settlement to perform what they claim is administrative and maintenance work on those properties.the service claims that the act allows land designated as wilderness to be devoted to multiple purposes,citing as authority b,which provides that wilderness areas shall be devoted to the public purposes of recreational,scenic,scientific,educational,conservation,and historical use.thus,the park service argues,because it has a separate duty to preserve the historical structures at the settlement,the preservation of historic structures in wilderness or,as here,potential wilderness is in fact administration to further the purposes of the wilderness act.appellees br.at.
this dispute thus requires us to interpret the limitations imposed on motor vehicle use under the wilderness act,in particular the requirement that motor vehicle use be restricted to the level necessary to meet minimum requirements for the administration of the area,c.we must also determine the effect of the act upon the park service obligations to maintain the historical structures on cumberland island and whether the act can accommodate the park service decision to transport tourists for the purpose of visiting those structures.
we analyze the park service interpretation of the statutory phrase except as necessary to meet minimum requirements for the administration of the area under the analysis described in chevron,natural resources defense council,d,and clarified in united states mead,d.under chevron,we first ask whether congressional intent is clear,and if so,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.at.we examine congressional intent through the plain language of the statute,understanding that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.fda brown williamson tobacco,d.if we find the statute silent or ambiguous,we defer to the agency interpretation when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.mead,at.
as an initial matter,we can not agree with the park service that the preservation of historical structures furthers the goals of the wilderness act.the park service responsibilities for the historic preservation of plum orchard and the settlement derive,not from the wilderness act,but rather from the national historic preservation act nhpa,et.the nhpa requires agencies to assume responsibility for the preservation of historic properties they control.id.at a.plum orchard and the historic district containing the settlement have both been listed in the national register of historic places though the congressional reports and early park service reports only mention plum orchard which itself lies outside the designated wilderness area.
the agency obligations under the wilderness act are quite different.the wilderness act defines wilderness as undeveloped federal land retaining its primeval character and influence,without permanent improvements or human habitation.c.a wilderness area should generally appear to have been affected primarily by the forces of nature,with the imprint of man work substantially unnoticeable.id.another section of the act explicitly states that,except as necessary for minimal administrative needs that require occasional vehicle use,there shall be no structure or installation within any such wilderness area.c.as the park service notes,section b mentions historical use along with recreational,scenic,scientific,educational,and conservation uses.however,this list tracks the definition of wilderness areas in c,which describes a primitive and unconfined type of recreation and ecological,geological,or other features of scientific,educational,scenic,or historical value.c.given the consistent evocation of untrammeled and natural areas,the previous pairing of historical with ecological and geological features,and the explicit prohibition on structures,the only reasonable reading of historical use in the wilderness act refers to natural,rather than,features.
of course,congress may separately provide for the preservation of an existing historical structure within a wilderness area,as it has done through the nhpa.congress wrote the wilderness rules and may create exceptions as it sees fit.absent these explicit statutory instructions,however,the need to preserve historical structures may not be inferred from the wilderness act nor grafted onto its general purpose.furthermore,any obligation the agency has under the nhpa to preserve these historical structures must be carried out so as to preserve the wilderness character of the area.see b e ach agency administering any area designated as wilderness shall be responsible for preserving the wilderness character of the area and shall so administer such area for such other purposes for which it may have been established as also to preserve its wilderness character.
this appeal turns not on the preservation of historical structures but on the decision to provide motorized public access to them across designated wilderness areas.the wilderness act bars the use of motor vehicles in these areas except as necessary to meet minimum requirements for the administration of the area for the purpose of this chapter the wilderness act.c.the park service decision to administer the settlement using a van filled with tourists simply can not be construed as necessary to meet the minimum requirements for administering the area for the purpose of the wilderness act.c.the plain language of the statute contradicts the park service position.when interpreting the language of a statute,we generally give the words used their ordinary meaning.griffith united states in re griffith,cir en banc citations and internal quotation marks omitted.if these words are unambiguous,our inquiry is complete,for we must presume that congress said what it meant and meant what it said.cbs,primetime joint venture,cir citation omitted.in no ordinary sense of the word can the transportation of fifteen people through wilderness area be necessary to administer the area for the purpose of the wilderness act.
the park service argues that these trips affect the wilderness no more than would a standard park service vehicle with no additional passengers.thus,the agency argues that the use of motor vehicles remains the same as what would be minimally necessary for administration.there are several problems with this interpretation.most obviously,it still runs counter to the plain meaning of the provision.under an ordinary,reading people use motor vehicles when they ride in the park service van,thereby increasing the use of motor vehicles beyond the minimum necessary for administration of the wilderness act.the park service wishes to define the term based on the number of vehicles used rather than on the number of people using them,but even so,the acquisition and use of a large passenger van for transporting tourists can not reasonably be squeezed into the phrase necessary to meet minimum requirements of administration.the language in this subsection is quite categorical,providing for no motor vehicle use except as necessary and labels this a prohibition.c emphasis added.moreover,the same subsection provides that there shall be no other form of mechanical transport beyond what is necessary for administration of the wilderness act.id.a passenger van certainly provides more transport than would a park service vehicle without extra passengers.
in addition,the overall purpose and structure of the statute argue against the agency interpretation.the prohibition on motor vehicle use in the wilderness act stems from more than just its potential for physical impact on the environment.the act seeks to preserve wilderness areas in their natural condition for their use and enjoyment as wilderness.a emphasis added.the act promotes the benefits of wilderness for the american people,especially the opportunities for a primitive and unconfined type of recreation.id.at c.thus,the statute seeks to provide the opportunity for a primitive wilderness experience as much as to protect the wilderness lands themselves from physical harm.see also national park service,reference manual at in addition to managing these areas for the preservation of the physical wilderness resources,planning for these areas must ensure that the wilderness character is likewise preserved.use of a passenger van changes the wilderness experience,not only for the actual passengers,but also for any other persons they happen to pass more so than would be the case upon meeting a lone park ranger in a jeep.of course,there is nothing wrong with appreciating natural beauty from inside a passenger van,and many other categories of public land administered by the federal government appropriately offer this opportunity.it simply is not the type of use and enjoyment promoted by the wilderness act.
other documents in the record highlight the potential conflict between wilderness values and the transportation of passengers.the agency minimum requirements determination mrd for the plum orchard trips recognized concerns over the van affecting the qual
