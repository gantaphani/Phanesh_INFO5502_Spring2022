this case involves procedural challenges to a united states forest service rule known as the state petitions rule.the plaintiffs,several states and various environmentalist organizations,contend that the state petitions rule was promulgated without proper process and that it is invalid.they urge us to affirm the district court,which set aside the state petitions rule and reinstated the roadless area conservation rule,more commonly known as the roadless rule,pending forest service compliance with the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act.
we agree with the plaintiffs that the promulgation of the state petitions rule effected a repeal of the roadless rule,which we previously found to afford greater protections to the nation roadless areas than those the individual forest plans provide.the forest service use of a categorical exemption to repeal the nationwide protections of the roadless rule and to invite states to pursue varying rules for roadless area management was unreasonable.it was likewise unreasonable for the forest service to assert that the environment,listed species,and their critical habitats would be unaffected by this regulatory change.
we affirm the district court order permanently enjoining the implementation of the state petitions rule because the forest service violated the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act when it promulgated the state petitions rule.we further conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering the forest service to comply with the roadless rule as a remedy for these procedural shortcomings.
before turning to the merits of this dispute,we will provide an overview of the factual background and procedural history of the instant litigation.we will also resolve disputes about the ripeness of the plaintiffs claims and the appropriate standard of review to apply to them.
the state petitions rule is the most recent effort by the forest service to address the management of roadless areas in the national forests.in order to appreciate this rule and the plaintiffs challenges to its validity,one must have a general understanding of the land management measures that preceded it.
the national forest system consists of approximately million acres of national forests,national grasslands,and related areas.the forest service manages these lands under several federal statutes,including the national forest management act.under the national forest management act,the forest service must develop and periodically revise an integrated land and resource management plan,commonly known as a forest plan,for each unit of the national forest system.a,f see also idaho sporting,rittenhouse,cir.each forest plan is prepared by an interdisciplinary team and must provide for multiple use and sustained yield of the products and services obtained from the forest unit and include coordination of uses relating to outdoor recreation,range,timber,watershed,wildlife and fish,and wilderness.e,f.
to achieve these objectives,forest plans typically divide a forest unit into different management areas that are subject to different goals,objectives,and management prescriptions.for example,a management area may be dedicated to recreation or to forest products.the forest service then may consider individual,projects consistent with that plan.see,ohio forestry ass sierra club,d describing the method for proposing and adopting a logging project in a national forest.activities proposed to occur within a management area must be consistent with the prescriptions as well as with the prescriptions applicable to the entire forest unit.see i see also citizens for better forestry usda,cir describing the tiered approach to forest land management and decision making at the national,regional,and levels.
in the,the forest service began to study and evaluate roadless areas in national forests.it developed an inventory of roadless areas,each larger than acres,to be considered by congress for inclusion in the national wilderness preservation system.as a result of the reviews in the,subsequent assessments,and land and resource planning for individual forest units,there are now million acres of the national forest identified as inventoried roadless areas.these inventoried roadless areas are largely undeveloped,but not entirely without roads 
from the late through the late,inventoried roadless areas were governed primarily by the individual forest plans developed under the national forest management act.nothing in that act or any other federal statute obligates the forest service to manage inventoried roadless areas as a distinct unit of administration or resource value.most forest plans provided for extractive uses,including logging,mining,oil and gas development,and construction of vehicle routes,on at least some portion of what are classified as inventoried roadless areas.
in the late,the forest service began to reevaluate its approach to roadless area management.on october,president clinton directed the forest service to initiate a nationwide plan to protect the roadless areas in the national forests.within a week of this directive,the forest service began working on what would ultimately become the roadless area conservation rule,or roadless rule.
the forest service promulgated the roadless rule on january.it was an adaptation of one of several options for roadless area management studied in the final environmental impact statement issued in november.subject to limited exceptions,the roadless rule would prohibit road construction,reconstruction,and timber harvest in roadless areas.roadless area conservation.it did not displace the forest plans used for forest management rather,the roadless rule superseded any restrictions on inventoried roadless areas that were less stringent.see id.at state petitions for inventoried roadless area management,may.
perhaps in response to,or in anticipation of,concerns that local decision making might be preferred,the forest service defended its categorical,programmatic approach to roadless area management 
at the national level,forest service officials have the responsibility to consider the whole picture regarding the management of the national forest system,including inventoried roadless areas.local land management planning efforts may not always recognize the national significance of inventoried roadless areas and the values they represent in an increasingly developed landscape.if management decisions for these areas were made on a basis at a forest or regional level,inventoried roadless areas and their ecological characteristics and social values could be incrementally reduced through road construction and certain forms of timber harvest.added together,the nationwide results of these reductions could be a substantial loss of quality and quantity of roadless area values and characteristics over time.
the roadless rule was to go into effect on march.however,because of a change in presidential administration,the effective date of the roadless rule was delayed for days,or until may.
two days before the roadless rule postponed effective date,the united states district court for the district of idaho preliminarily enjoined the forest service from implementing all aspects of the rule.kootenai tribe of idaho veneman,wl,at may.the forest service chose not to appeal this ruling,but environmentalist groups that had intervened in the suit mounted a successful appeal.
on december,the ninth circuit court of appeals reversed.kootenai tribe of idaho veneman,cir.the majority evaluated in considerable detail the procedural challenges made against the roadless rule and concluded,on the record before it,that it is plain that the forest service gave a hard look at the complex problem presented.id.at.the majority concluded that the plaintiffs had not shown a substantial likelihood of success on their national environmental policy act claims and that the balance of the hardships weighed against enjoining the roadless rule.id.at.the majority reversed the district court issuance of the preliminary injunction.id.at.the court mandate issued in april,and the roadless rule went into effect nationwide.
within months,another court enjoined the roadless rule.wyoming usda,d.on july,the united states district court for the district of wyoming held that the roadless rule was promulgated in violation of the national environmental policy act and the wilderness act and ordered that it be permanently enjoined.id.at.as in the idaho litigation,the forest service did not appeal to the tenth circuit,but the environmentalist intervenors did.
the day after oral argument before the tenth circuit,the forest service announced the adoption of a final rule replacing the roadless rule.wyoming usda,cir.because the new state petitions t he portions of the roadless rule that were substantively challenged,the tenth circuit concluded that to render a decision on the validity of the now nonexistent roadless rule would constitute a textbook example of an advisory opinion.id.at.the tenth circuit dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction and vacated the district court judgment.id.at.
the rule announced by the forest service on may,state petitions the primary focus of this appeal.
the forest service began working on what would become the state petitions rule in july,when the appeal of the idaho preliminary injunction against the roadless rule was pending before the ninth circuit.roadless area conservation.july.in its advance notice of proposed rulemaking in the federal register,the forest service expressed its intention to reexamine the roadless rule and move forward with a responsible and balanced approach to roadless area management that would fairly address concerns raised by those affected by the roadless rule.id.
the forest service issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for the state petitions rule in july.see state petitions for inventoried roadless area management.july.the forest service determined that a state petitioning process that will allow consideration of the needs of roadless areas was an appropriate solution to address the challenges of roadless area management.id.at.
following an extended period of public comment,the forest service issued the final state petitions rule.state petitions for inventoried roadless area management.may.the rule revised part of title of the code of federal regulations to remove the text of the roadless rule and insert in its place provisions establishing an window during which states could petition for roadless area protections id.at.
the final provision of the state petitions rule is a severability clause.according to the forest service,this 
provision responds to public comment expressing concerns and confusion regarding the status of the prior roadless rule that was set aside by the federal district court in wyoming.the department of agriculture believes that adopting this new rule resolves the matter by establishing a new process for addressing inventoried roadless area regardless of these lawsuits surrounding the roadless rule,the department has concluded that the rule inflexible nationwide rulemaking approach is flawed and there are better means to achieve protection of roadless area values.the department wishes to make its intent clear that should all or any part of this regulation be set aside,the department does not intend that the prior rule be reinstated,in whole or in part.
in its decision memorandum,the forest service explained that it had designated this rule for categorical exclusion under the national environmental policy act nepa.at.the forest service specifically cited a provision from the forest service handbook fsh,which provision excludes from documentation in an environmental assessment or impact statement rules,regulations,or policies to establish administrative procedures,program processes,or instructions.id.at citing fsh,b.the forest service explained that the final rule is merely procedural in nature and scope and,as such,has no direct,indirect,or cumulative effect on the environment.id.the forest service also referred to the draft and final environmental impact statements that were prepared as part of the roadless rule development and explained that the environmental impacts associated with not implementing the enjoined roadless rule are essentially those disclosed and discussed for the no action alternative displayed in the final environmental impact statement.id.
much like the roadless rule,the state petitions rule was almost immediately met with litigation.
this appeal arises from two consolidated district court actions that challenged the department of agriculture usda and forest service promulgation of the state petitions rule as violating certain requirements of the national environmental policy act,the endangered species act,and the administrative procedure act.the plaintiffs in the district court cases were the states of california,new mexico,and oregon collectively the state plaintiffs,and the wilderness society and other environmental advocacy organizations collectively the environmental plaintiffs.the state of washington intervened as a plaintiff.silver creek timber company intervened on behalf of the forest service.also intervening on behalf of the forest service as to the remedy phase were the american council of snowmobile associations,the blue ribbon coalition,california association of wheel drive clubs,and united four wheel drive association there were amici curiae for both sides 
collectively,the plaintiffs alleged that the usda and forest service violated the national environmental policy act by relying on a categorical exclusion when promulgating the state petitions rule section of the endangered species act by promulgating the state petitions rule without fulfilling the act consultation requirements and the rationality requirement of the administrative procedure act by failing to articulate a p urpose and n eed for rescission of the roadless rule.
on september,the district court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs and denied summary judgment for the usda the district court held that the usda violated the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act lockyer,d at.as a remedy for these violations,the district court permanently enjoined the state petitions rule and reinstated the roadless rule.id.at.
under the court analysis,the state petitions rule triggered the national environmental policy act environmental analysis requirement because the rule permanently removed the roadless rule substantive protections.id.at the court reasoned that the elimination of a major nationwide land management program would be sufficient to trigger environmental analysis here,the forest service eliminated such a program and replaced it with a far more varied and potentially less protective land management regime.id.at.the court rejected the usda argument that replacing the roadless rule was a paper exercise.id.at.
the court also focused on the language of the categorical exclusion used by the forest service to implement the rule,reasoning that the replacement of the roadless rule with the state petitions rule was not the type of routine administrative action for which the categorical exclusion existed.id.at.the district court highlighted additional problems with the rulemaking process,such as the scant discussion given to resource conditions or other extraordinary circumstances that might make the categorical exclusion unavailable.id.at.ultimately,the district court concluded that t he forest service proposed interpretation of this categorical exclusion in this case is clearly erroneous and its use in promulgating the state petitions rule was arbitrary and capricious.id.at.
the district court national environmental policy act discussion overlapped,in part,with its analysis of the plaintiffs endangered species act claims.id.at.the court explained that it would strain credulity to hold that the repeal of the roadless rule protections in inventoried roadless areas would not have any effect,as that term is interpreted for purposes of the endangered species act,on the numerous species that make their homes in inventoried roadless areas.id.
in crafting the appropriate remedy,the district court noted the substantial nature of the procedural violations,balanced the equities,considered the public interest,and determined that the proper course was to reinstate the roadless rule pending the usda compliance with the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act.id.at.
on appeal,the defendants challenge the district court holding that environmental analysis and consultation was required under either the national environmental policy act or the endangered species act.the defendants contend that the usda appropriately determined that the state petitions rule was procedural and would not have any effect on the environment.the defendants also contend that the district court abused its discretion by reinstating the roadless rule,which the usda specifically indicated it did not want reinstated should any challenge to the state petitions rule be successful.
the district court exercised federal question jurisdiction over the instant suit under.we have appellate jurisdiction under and c.
the parties dispute whether the plaintiffs claims are ripe for adjudication.specifically,california association of wheel drive clubs contends that the state petitions rule merely presents a starting point for future rulemaking,such that any alleged procedural injury can not be identified until a state files a petition.
ripeness is a question of law reviewed de novo.colwell dep t of health human,cir.ripeness serves to prevent the courts,through avoidance of premature adjudication,from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies,and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.abbott labs.gardner,d.in determining whether a case satisfies prudential requirements for ripeness,we consider two factors the fitness of the issues for judicial decision,and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.la ligue contre le racisme et,cir quoting abbott,at.
the district court considered these factors and correctly concluded that the suit was ripe for adjudication.lockyer,d at.judicial consideration of this dispute would not interfere with further administrative action with respect to the state petitions rule,which is a final rule that has been published in the federal register.nor is additional factual development required under the plaintiffs theory of the case,which is that the promulgation of the state petitions rule improperly removed the substantive protections afforded to inventoried roadless areas under the roadless rule.
the supreme court has held that a person with standing who is injured by a failure to comply with nepa procedure may complain of that failure at the time the failure takes place,for the claim can never get riper.ohio forestry ass n,at.with this suit,the plaintiffs are taking advantage of what may be their only opportunity to challenge the state petitions rule on a nationwide,programmatic basis.therefore,we agree with the district court that this dispute is ripe for adjudication.

we generally review the usda compliance with the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act under the arbitrary and capricious standard of the administrative procedure act.id.citing a.an agency interpretation of the meaning of its own categorical exclusion should be given controlling weight unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the terms used in the regulation.alaska ctr.for the env t forest,cir.similarly,an agency no effect determination under the endangered species act must be upheld unless arbitrary and capricious.sw.ctr.for biological diversity forest,cir.
ninth circuit jurisprudence distinguishes between the level of deference afforded to agency decisions that are primarily legal in nature and that afforded to decisions that are factual.alaska wilderness recreation tourism ass morrison,cir we find that it makes sense to distinguish the strong level of deference we accord an agency in deciding factual or technical matters from that to be accorded in disputes involving predominately legal questions.see northcoast envtl.ctr.glickman,cir holding that the less deferential standard of reasonableness applies to threshold agency decisions that certain activities are not subject to nepa procedures.in the ninth circuit,a n agency threshold decision that certain activities are not subject to nepa is reviewed for reasonableness.kern bureau of land,cir citing northcoast,at.the supreme court has noted,however,that the difference between the arbitrary and capricious and reasonableness standards is not of great pragmatic consequence.marsh or.natural res.council,d.
we now turn to the merits of the plaintiffs national environmental policy act and endangered species act claims and to the appropriateness of the remedy crafted by the district court.
the national environmental policy act is our basic national charter for protection of the environment.idaho cmty.action network dep t of,cir quoting ctr.for biological diversity highway traffic safety,cir.it is a procedural statute intended to ensure environmentally informed by federal agencies.tillamook county army corps of eng rs,cir.the national environmental policy act does not mandate particular results,but simply provides the necessary process to ensure that federal agencies take a hard look at the environmental consequences of their actions.high sierra hikers ass n,cir quoting neighbors of cuddy mountain alexander,cir.
the act requires that an environmental impact statement be prepared for all major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.the threshold that triggers the requirement for environmental analysis under the national environmental policy act is relatively low it is enough for the plaintiff to raise substantial questions whether a project may have a significant effect on the environment.blue mountains biodiversity project blackwood,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the purpose of an environmental impact statement is to provide full and fair discussion of significant environmental impacts and to inform decision makers and the public of reasonable alternatives that would minimize adverse environmental impacts.
an environmental impact statement is not always required to ensure that an agency has taken the requisite hard look at the potential environmental effects of its activities rather,under regulations adopted by the council on environmental quality,federal agencies may document compliance with the national environmental policy act for any action by preparing an environmental impact statement preparing a less extensive environmental assessment and making a finding of no significant impact on the environment or documenting that the action falls within an established categorical exclusion.see see also west sec y of dep t of,cir.
the council on environmental quality has defined categorical exclusion to mean a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and which have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a federal agency in implementation of these regulations.see also id.b ii requiring agencies to adopt nepa procedures including categorical exclusions.the definition of categorical exclusion also contains a mandate that an agency make allowances for extraordinary circumstances in which a normally excluded action may have a significant environmental effect.when an action falls within a categorical exclusion and an agency reasonably determines that there are no extraordinary circumstances,further documentation under the national environmental policy act is unnecessary.california norton,cir.
the forest service has adopted various categorical exclusions as part of its forest service handbook.fsh.by direction of the forest service chief,
the following categories of routine administrative,maintenance,and other actions normally do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment and,therefore,may be categorically excluded from documentation in an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment unless scoping indicates extraordinary circumstances exist 
rules,regulations,or policies to establish administrative procedures,program processes,or instructions.
fsh,b.the forest service handbook also includes a list of resource conditions that should be considered in determining whether extraordinary circumstances related to a proposed action warrant further analysis and documentation in an environmental analysis or environmental impact statement.fsh.these conditions include federally listed threatened or endangered species or designated critical habitat,species proposed for federal listing or proposed critical habitat,forest service sensitive species and i nventoried roadless areas.id.the mere presence of one or more of these resource conditions does not preclude use of a categorical exclusion.it is the degree of the potential effect of a proposed action on these resource conditions that determines whether extraordinary circumstances exist.id.
the usda characterized the state petitions rule as administrative only and without direct,indirect,or cumulative effects on the environment.at.because of its procedural nature,the usda invoked the forest service categorical exclusion from environmental analysis for r ules,regulations,or policies to establish administrative procedures,program processes,or instructions.id.
the district court rejected this procedural only argument because the argument failed to account for the fact that the state petitions rule,when it was promulgated,specifically removed the roadless rule from the code of federal regulations.lockyer,d at see also.at subpart b the roadless rule is revised to read as follows.the district court reasoned that the replacement of the roadless rule uniform substantive protections with a less protective and more varied land management regime would qualify as substantive action and would meet the relatively low threshold to trigger some level of environmental analysis under the national environmental policy act.lockyer,d at.the district court also found the usda reliance on the wyoming district court injunction to be misplaced.see,id.at defendants can not have it both ways,that is,take deliberate action that moots a pending appeal,triggering vacatur,yet rely on the vacated decision to avoid compliance with procedures mandated by environmental laws.
we agree with the district court that the usda characterization of the state petitions rule as merely procedural in nature and scope was unreasonable.see.at.
like the district court,we are cognizant that we do not write on a blank slate.in kootenai tribe veneman,cir,we explored the beneficial environmental effects the roadless rule would have on inventoried roadless areas.the majority in kootenai tribe remarked upon the substantive differences between localized forest management under the individual forest plans and the uniform nationwide protections imposed by the roadless rule 
whatever protections of the involved environmental interests remain in the absence of the roadless rule,there can be no doubt that the million acres subject to the roadless rule,if implemented,would have greater protection if the roadless rule stands.
this is an unusual case where an action,cessation of road development and repair in certain areas of our national forests,is being undertaken for the primary purpose of conservation,and the resulting benefit of the environment.there can be no serious argument that restrictions on human intervention in these wilderness areas will not result in immeasurable benefits from a conservationist standpoint.
at.thus,the kootenai tribe majority found that the roadless rule provided greater substantive protections to roadless areas than the individual forest plans it superseded.the majority also found that the reduction in human intervention that would result from the roadless rule actually does alter the environmental status quo by altering how the forest service manages inventoried roadless areas,the roadless rule will have a demonstrable impact on the physical environment.id.at.
we are bound by the findings of kootenai tribe,and we reject the usda arguments that the roadless rule was never meaningfully in force and that it could not have altered the status quo the roadless rule was legally valid for the seven months after the opinion in kootenai tribe.from the time our mandate issued to when the united states district court for the district of wyoming issued its injunction,the roadless rule governed the roadless area management of the national forests.the usda asserts that the period between injunctions was insufficient to make any meaningful difference in forest planning.this is so because development activities require many months or years to plan,evaluate,and implement.this argument misses the mark.that the roadless rule did not interfere with forest planning measures does not mean that the months of limited human intervention it facilitated were without beneficial effect on roadless areas and their complex ecosystems.
the usda argues that its actions were not a repeal of the roadless rule,but rather amounted to a reasonable response to the agency being stopped in its tracks first by the improperly issued idaho preliminary injunction and then by the wyoming permanent injunction.we are not persuaded by this argument the promulgation of the state petitions rule necessarily encompassed the permanent repeal of the roadless rule substantive protections.
the usda plainly intended to free itself of any future constraints imposed by the roadless rule.most obviously,when the final state petitions rule was published in the federal register,it revised subpart b of,which contained the roadless rule,in its entirety.see.at f or the reasons set forth in the preamble,the department of agriculture amends part of title of the code of federal regulations as follows subpart b is revised to read as follows.the state petitions rule included a severability clause that the usda emphasized was to make its intent clear that should all or any part of this regulation be set aside,the department does not intend that the prior rule be reinstated,in whole or in part.id.at see also severability clause.
in its decision memorandum announcing the final rule,the usda discussed its dissatisfaction with the roadless rule and highlighted its rejection of the roadless rule inflexible nationwide rulemaking approach.at.the usda internal correspondence,notice of proposed rule making,decision memorandum,and filings with this court repeatedly recognize that the state petitions rule replaced the roadless rule whether one calls it a replacement or a repeal,the end result is the same the usda took deliberate action to prevent appellate review of the wyoming injunction and to free itself from the restrictions the roadless rule would impose on roadless area management if the injunction were lifted.
given the usda repeated acknowledgment of its intent to replace the roadless rule,that the state petitions rule accomplished little else supports our conclusion that a primary purpose of the state petitions rule was taking substantive environmental protections off the books.as silver creek timber company concedes,a state could petition the secretary of agriculture for a rule regarding roadless area management under e with or without the state petition rule.california association of wheel drive clubs acknowledges that one might persuasively argue the state petitions rule is a specific,but redundant,clarification of the right to petition for rule making addressing roadless areas.the duplicative nature of the state petitions rule and the very limited duration of the state petitioning window eighteen months strongly suggest that the primary purpose of the state petitions rule was to eliminate permanently the roadless rule.
the usda attempts to bolster its argument that the replacement of the roadless rule was simply a paper exercise by relying upon the wyoming district court permanent injunction.the usda conveniently crafted argument is as follows the usda could remove the roadless rule without environmental analysis because of the wyoming injunction,and the tenth circuit could not review the propriety of the wyoming injunction because the roadless rule no longer existed after the promulgation of the state petitions rule.the district court noted that this type of argument leaves too much to the vicissitudes of the timing of litigation.we agree.
the most obvious problem with the usda reliance on the wyoming injunction is that it was in the process of being appealed to the tenth circuit.internal usda documents reveal the agency understanding that the promulgation of the state petitions rule was not legally compelled,but was in fact a choice from many options then available to the agency.in selecting a course of action,the usda unreasonably ignored the possibility that the tenth circuit would reverse the united states district court for the district of wyoming and reinstate the roadless rule,in spite of the admitted uncertainty surrounding the roadless rule.see roadless area protection.july,there continues to be uncertainty about the roadless rule validity as legal proceedings are ongoing and the ultimate outcome is far from certain.adding to the uncertainty is the fact that a panel of this court had rejected a preliminary injunction resting on many of the grounds upon which the wyoming district court based its injunction.
in the context of this case,we can not condone a marked change in roadless area management without environmental analysis because it was the usda preferred response to an untested district court injunction that was subject to possible reversal in a pending appeal this is not to suggest that an agency can not make decisions or promulgate rules while challenges to earlier rules wind their way through the appellate process.we simply find unreasonable,in the midst of this admitted uncertainty,the usda position that the wyoming injunction permanently removed all protections afforded under the roadless rule in all jurisdictions and that the state petitions rule elimination of the roadless rule from the books was merely a paper exercise to the extent that the usda wanted to move forward with a new rule while the appeal of the wyoming injunction was pending,it could have developed a rule that was independent of the roadless rule we agree with the district court that the appealed wyoming injunction did not reduce the removal of the roadless rule from the code of federal regulations to a paper exercise.
the usda contends that its reliance on the categorical exclusion was reasonable because the state petitions rule did not dictat e substantive rules or implicate any extraordinary circumstances that would preclude reliance on the categorical exclusion for r ules,regulations,or policies to establish administrative procedures,program processes,or instructions.fsh.as already explained,we disagree with the characterization of the state petitions rule as procedural only.
as the district court noted,the examples of the categorical exclusion set forth in the forest service handbook involved more routine procedures that are far less likely to significantly affect the environment than the state petitions rule repeal of the roadless rule.lockyer,d at.counsel for the usda could cite no occasion when this categorical exclusion was used to repeal a rule with substantive effects on land management.id.at.the other rules promulgated under this categorical exclusion do not appear to involve the revocation of any major substantive environmental regulations indeed,the usda use of this exclusion has generally involved routine matters the usda past usage of this categorical exclusion for solely routine and rather mundane matters indicates that the agency own interpretation of the scope of this exclusion has been more modest than the one it advocates here.id.
the forest service handbook also lists resource conditions that should be considered in determining whether extraordinary circumstances related to a proposed action warrant further environmental analysis and documentation.fsh.relevant to the use of the categorical exclusion in this case are the conditions of federally listed threatened or endangered species or designated critical habitat,species proposed for federal listing or proposed critical habitat,forest service sensitive species and i nventoried roadless areas.id.
where there is substantial evidence in the record that exceptions to the categorical exclusion may apply,the agency must at the very least explain why the action does not fall within one of the exceptions.california norton,cir emphasis added.within the final environmental impact statement that was developed for the roadless rule,there is considerable discussion of the unique and valuable qualities of roadless areas and the listed species that dwell in these lands.when it promulgated the state petitions rule,the usda summarily concluded that the state petitions rule would have no discernable effects on the various classes of resources listed in the agency nepa policy and procedures that can constitute extraordinary circumstances.at.this cursory statement does not even identify those resource conditions that might be affected by the promulgation of the state petitions rule.even if we were to believe that this rule might fall within the categorical we do is an insufficient explanation of why the rule would not fall into one of the exceptions to the categorical exclusion.
in sum,the usda determination that the state petitions rule,with its concurrent repeal of the roadless rule,could be promulgated as a categorical exclusion was unreasonable.
by permanently removing the roadless rule from the code of federal regulations,the state petitions rule did much more than establish a new procedure for the consideration of land management rules it purported to ensure that future land management decisions would never again be constrained by the roadless rule and its enhanced protections for inventoried roadless areas.it was unreasonable for the usda to characterize the permanent repeal of these substantive protections as merely procedural and within the scope of the cited categorical exclusion.
we conclude that the threshold for environmental analysis under the national environmental policy act has been met the plaintiffs have raised substantial questions whether the state petitions rule,with its concurrent repeal of the roadless rule,may have a significant effect on the environment.see blackwood,at.
the supreme court has called the endangered species act the most comprehensive legislation for the preservation of endangered species ever enacted by any nation.valley auth.hill,d.the statute reflects a conscious decision by congress to give endangered species priority over the primary missions of federal agencies.id.at.to accomplish this goal,the endangered species act sets forth a comprehensive program to limit harm to endangered species within the united states.
for federal agencies,the heart of the endangered species act is section a.this section affirmatively commands each federal agency to insure that any action authorized,funded,or carried out by the agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of the designated critical habitat of such species.a.to carry out this substantive mandate,agencies must engage in a consultation process with the appropriate expert wildlife agency on the effects of any federal action to listed species.see or.natural res.council allen,cir describing the consultation process.
the threshold for triggering the endangered species act is relatively low consultation is required whenever a federal action may affect listed species or critical habitat.a emphasis added see am.bird conservancy fcc,cir see also interagency species act of,as amended,june,any possible effect,whether beneficial,benign,adverse or of an undetermined character,triggers the formal consultation requirement emphasis added.the consultation process may be formal or in
