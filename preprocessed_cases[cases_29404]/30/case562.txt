the corps did not provide a written response to the foia request however,representatives from each party communicated by phone.no documents were released pursuant to the request.subsequently,the coalition filed the instant case in district court.in its answer to the coalition complaint,the corps asserted the requested documents were subject to a foia exemption.
the corps moved for summary judgment and attached to its motion declarations from corps employees thomas minear and david goldman and a vaughn index identifying documents responsive to the coalition foia request.the vaughn index identified each document with general distinguishing information such as the date it was generated,the author,the addressees,and whether the document was a memorandum,letter,agenda,or meeting notes.a short description was provided for each document,discussing potential methodologies to be used in ffs or letter discussing the ffs analysis methods.finally,each and every document was identified as privileged under foia exemption,the deliberative process privilege.the coalition for summary judgment,arguing the corps had failed to prove that the documents were exempt from disclosure.summary judgment was granted in favor of the corps.
the freedom of information act is intended to provide public access to government documents.miller dep t of,cir.the act,which permits access to official information long shielded unnecessarily from public view is therefore broadly conceived.epa mink,d.
the act itself provides nine specific statutory exemptions.b.these are to be narrowly construed to ensure that disclosure,rather than secrecy,remains the primary objective of the act.miller dep t of,at citing dep t of the air force rose,d.the deliberative process privilege,foia exemption,exempts or memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.b.the purpose of the exemption is designed to ensure that open,frank discussions between subordinate and chief will not be made impossible by the agencies having to operate in a fishbowl.schwartz irs,quoting,sess.the goal of the privilege is clear and straightforward to allow full and frank discussion while preserving the goal of an open government.
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment in a foia case de novo.missouri,ex rel.garstang dep t of interior,cir.our review is the same as it was for the district court the record is evaluated in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party to determine whether there is no genuine issue of any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c garstang,at citing miller dep t of,at.in a foia case,summary judgment is available to a defendant agency where the agency proves that it has fully discharged its obligations under foia,after the underlying facts and the inferences to be drawn from them are construed in the light most favorable to the foia requester.miller dep t of state,cir citing weisberg dep t of justice.
the coalition argues that,viewed in the light most favorable to the coalition,the corps vaughn index is insufficient to show whether the corps obligations under foia were discharged.as a result,the coalition posits,some of the documents should have been released.alternatively,the coalition proposes that even if the vaughn index is adequate,some of the whole or in not subject to the exemption.the corps contends that it satisfied its foia obligations with an adequate vaughn index that properly demonstrated the documents were subject to the deliberative process privilege.
vaughn indices 
to help determine whether a governmental agency has discharged its burden under foia,vaughn indices may be used.crancer dep t of justice,cir.the vaughn court recognized the problems associated with foia requests for documentation,including the requesting party inability to advocate its position in light of its lack of knowledge and the court difficulty reviewing massive documentation.vaughn rosen.thus,vaughn indices serve two purposes first,to ensure an effectively helpless party right to information is not submerged beneath governmental obfuscation and mischaracterization and second,to permit the court system effectively and efficiently to evaluate the factual nature of disputed information.id.
this court has held that a proper vaughn index 
provides a specific factual description of each document sought by the foia requester.specifically,such an index includes a general description of each document contents,including information about the document creation,such as date,time,and place.for each document,the exemption claimed by the government is identified,and an explanation as to why the exemption applies to the document in question is provided.
crancer,at internal citations and quotations omitted.such an index allows both the district court and the requesting party to evaluate the decision to withhold records and ensure compliance with foia.barney irs,cir.here,the vaughn index contained all necessary identifying information and stated the applicable exemption.although the index itself failed to explain why the exemption applied to each document,the affidavits provided in conjunction with the index indicated that the documents were,critiques,comments,and recommendations by members of the two groups.
generally,a more substantial vaughn that provides for each document requested a specific explanation as to why an exemption preferable to a bare bones index.even so,in camera review of the documentation in this case was not necessary.barney,at.in barney,we held that in camera inspection should be limited as it is contrary to the traditional judicial role of deciding issues in an adversarial context upon evidence
