petitioner robert oja sued the united states army corps of engineers the usace and robert flowers collectively defendants under the privacy act of,stat.codified as amended at a,for disclosing oja personal information by posting it on the usace public internet website.the district of oregon granted summary judgment for defendants.we affirm,holding that the district court properly applied the privacy act statute of limitations to both of oja amended complaints.in the course of answering oja claims,we hold that the single publication rule applies to privacy act claims relating to internet posting.
facts and proceedings 
background 
oja served as regulatory chief of the alaska district of the usace from until.during his tenure at the usace,oja avers that he was frequently critical of the usace,accusing the agency of thwarting his efforts to enforce wetlands violations and bending to pressure from oil companies.oja made numerous protective disclosures under the whistleblower protection act of,stat.codified in scattered sections of and documented repeated statutory violations by the usace alaska construction projects in investigative reports required under the clean water act of,stat.codified in scattered sections of.in,the usace stripped oja of his duties as regulatory chief.in february,oja filed a claim for illness.that same month,the usace acknowledged in writing that oja medical records demonstrated that he was disabled for work due to a illness.
in,oja and the usace entered into a settlement agreement regarding his claim for illness settlement agreement.the usace agreed to convert the basis for oja termination from excessive absence and failure to follow leave procedures to continued absence due to illness.the usace also agreed to purge the former explanation from its records.oja agreed to file for retirement,which the usace subsequently granted,retroactive to march.
in september,the washington post published a series of articles critical of the usace.the series included a discussion of the alaska district and oja tenure as regulatory chief and mentioned oja earlier complaints that the usace had thwarted his efforts to enforce wetlands violations.
at some point shortly after the post articles appeared,the usace posted a response to the articles on its internet website under corps facts at.one of these points reads

the usace removed the posting from its public internet website on november.the following month,oja asserts,he discovered the very same personal information about me could be accessed by going into the usace public affairs website,clicking on news publications,and then finding a new posting that contained the same personal information about me.
in september,oja filed a petition for enforcement with the merit systems protection board mspb.he alleged that the usace had breached the settlement agreement by posting employment and medical information about him on its internet website and by not providing relocation entitlements.he further alleged that these breaches were intentional and that the usace had continued to abuse him as if the settlement agreement had never existed.he stated in his petition that 
in september,more than a year after the settlement terms had taken effect,i learned that the usace posted the following information about me on their national internet web site.
removal from job.oja stopped coming to work on october,and failed to provide information about the likelihood of returning to work.effective september,oja was removed from his position for excessive absence due to illness.
oja later confirmed that i first saw the usace internet posting about me in september.in october,the usace informed oja that it had placed his personal information on its internet website to defend the usace from media inquiries.
oja filed his original complaint in the district of oregon on november,alleging that the usace had violated the privacy act by posting oja private information on its public internet website original complaint.he then filed an amended complaint on november,first amended complaint.both complaints stated that d uring the month of november,and continuously until at least november,the defendants posted private information about oja on the public portions of the usace internet website.on march,oja filed a second amended complaint.in that complaint,oja did not repeat his allegations that the usace violated the privacy act by posting private information on its public internet website from september to november.rather,he alleged that d uring the month of december defendants posted private information about him on public portions of the usace public affairs internet website.oja noted that this was the same information he had previously located on a different usace website,but which had disappeared from that website in late november.oja alleged that the usace continuously posted this information on the usace public affairs internet website from december until january.defendants filed a motion for summary judgment in response to oja first amended complaint and a motion to dismiss in response to oja second amended complaint.
proceedings 
first amended complaint 
defendants filed for summary judgment against oja first amended complaint on the basis that oja had not filed his claim within the privacy act statute of limitations.see g specifying that an action to enforce any liability created under this section may be brought within two years from the date on which the cause of actions arises.the defendants submitted oja statement before the mspb that he had discovered the internet postings in september,and argued that his original november,not been filed within the privacy act statute of limitations accordingly,defendants argued that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider oja original and first amended complaints.
oja opposed the motion,asserting that the internet posting constituted a perpetual violation of the privacy act and that his action was therefore within the statute of limitations.he also argued that the statute of limitations should actually have commenced to run when the usace informed him in october of its reason for posting the information because it was only as of that point that he had actual knowledge that the posting was willful or intentional.
the magistrate judge recommended granting defendants summary judgment request.the magistrate judge found that oja first amended complaint only referenced the posting he discovered in september the september posting did not fall within the narrow parameters of the continuing violation doctrine and,accordingly,the statute began to run at the time oja discovered the posting and oja cause of action accrued when oja first became aware of the posting rather than when oja first learned that the posting had been intentionally or willfully published on the usace public website.after a de novo review,the district court adopted the magistrate judge findings and recommendation,and entered judgment for defendants.
second amended complaint 
defendants filed a motion to dismiss oja second amended complaint,asserting that it was also filed more than two years after oja discovered the second posting on the usace internet website.defendants argued that because the second amended complaint concerned a posting distinct from that contemplated in oja original and first amended complaints,the second amended complaint did not relate back to the first amended complaint.see.c.oja opposed the motion,arguing that his second amended complaint averred that he found the same information referenced in his original and first amended complaints on a different usace internet website thus,the conduct and basic facts alleged in the first and second amended complaints were identical,his second amended complaint should relate back to the first amended complaint filing date,and the second amended complaint should accordingly be considered filed within the statutory period.oja argued in the alternative that the multiple publication rule should apply to his case because the usace engaged in serial disclosure of identical private information under that theory,each disclosure made to those who accessed the personal information on the usace website commenced a new statute of limitations period.
after considering the foregoing,the magistrate judge recommended granting the defendants motion to dismiss.the magistrate judge viewed the question before the court as whether the second posting discovered in december,to a different website,can reasonably be viewed as involving the same transaction as the first posting discovered in september.the magistrate judge held that the posting of identical a website different from that to which the information was first posted is a discrete act,independent of the first posting.analogizing the instant case to a publication of the same article in two different issues of two different magazines owned by a single parent company,the magistrate judge stated that a plaintiff could not amend his complaint and expect that it would relate back because the two publications are entirely independent factual bases for separate claims.finding that the december usace internet website posting was a transaction wholly independent of the september posting,the magistrate judge held that the relation back doctrine was inapplicable,and,accordingly,the statute of limitations for the privacy act cause of action in oja second amended complaint expired three months before the filing of that complaint.after conducting a de novo review,the district court again adopted the magistrate judge findings and recommendation,and granted defendants second motion for summary judgment.this timely appeal by oja followed.

we review de novo the question of when a cause of action accrues and whether a claim is barred by the statute of limitations.orr bank of america,nt sa,cir.we also review de novo the district court application of the federal rules of civil procedure,including rule c relation back doctrine.in re dominguez,cir.
iii.analysis 
over the last several years,we have labored to apply settled principles of law and procedure to the relatively new medium of the internet that application has often proved difficult and occasionally unsatisfying,given the novel structure and ubiquity of the web and its growing importance to social dialogue and electronic commerce.the present appeal raises a novel question in this circuit when does a cause of action accrue for an unauthorized,publication of information protected by the privacy act 
the privacy act provides 
no agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person,or to another agency,except pursuant to a written request by,or with the prior written consent of,the individual to whom the record pertains 
b.the privacy act also specifies civil remedies to be imposed for violations 
civil any agency 
d fails to comply with any other provision of this section,or any rule promulgated thereunder,in such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual,the individual may bring a civil action against the agency,and the district courts of the united states shall have jurisdiction in the matters under the provisions of this subsection.
the statute plainly as words can no agency shall disclose any record within its system without a written request by or the prior written consent of the individual affected,subject to certain exceptions not applicable here.oja has alleged and for purposes of this appeal we must assume that the usace violated b by disclosing his personal information on its internet website without oja prior written request or consent.the only question before us,then,is whether the privacy act statute of limitations bars oja from bringing his suit more than two years after he first learned of the usace disclosure.a suit seeking civil damages under the privacy act must be filed 
within two years from the date on which the cause of action arises,except that where an agency has materially and willfully misrepresented any information required under this section to be disclosed to an individual and the information so misrepresented is material to establishment of the liability of the agency to the individual under this section,the action may be brought at any time within two years after discovery by the individual of the misrepresentation.
in general then,an individual must bring suit within two years of the unauthorized disclosure except where an agency has willfully misrepresented information required to be disclosed to the individual and which would be material to establishing the agency liability under the privacy act in such exceptional circumstances,g affords the individual two years from the time he discovers the agency actions.
oja original complaint was filed on november,and then amended and refiled as his first amended complaint on november.the first amended complaint states that d uring the month of november,and continuously until at least november,the defendants posted private information about oja on the public portions of the usace internet website in oja petition for enforcement filed with the mspb on september,however,he acknowledged that 
in september,more than a year after the settlement terms had taken effect,i learned that the agency posted the following information about me on their national internet web site removal from job.oja stopped coming to work on october,and failed to provide information about the likelihood of returning to work.effective september,oja was removed from his position for excessive absence due to illness.
oja then filed his second amended complaint in march,in which he alleged that the usace had posted the same information on its public affairs internet website from december until january.obviously,oja original and first amended complaints were filed more than two years after he first learned that the usace had posted private information on its website.similarly,oja filed his second amended complaint more than two years after he discovered that the usace had posted the same information on a different portion of its website.
oja raises three arguments for why his first and second amended complaints were nonetheless filed within the privacy act statute of limitations.first,oja argues that posting information on the internet is a continuing tort,that each disclosure gives rise to a cause of action and new limitations period,and that the single publication rule should not apply to internet publications.accordingly,oja argues that his first amended complaint was timely because it was filed on november,than two years after november,the date on which the usace removed the posted information.second,oja avers that because the usace posted identical information at a second website,his second amended complaint related back to the dates on which he filed his original and first amended complaint.third,oja asserts that his suit was timely because his cause of action did not actually accrue until october,when he learned that the usace intentionally or willfully disclosed private information on its internet website.we consider each of these arguments in turn.
a.the single publication rule and internet publications 
as a threshold matter,we note the enormous impact of the internet on commerce and the marketplace of ideas.indeed,f rom the publishers point of view,the world wide web constitutes a vast platform from which to address and hear from a worldwide audience of millions of readers,viewers,researchers,and buyers.reno aclu,d.such broad access to the public carries with it the potential to influence thought and opinion on a grand scale.by extension,the publication of defamatory and private information on the web has the potential to be vastly more offensive and harmful than it might otherwise be in a more circumscribed publication.accordingly,in search of cogent principles,we compare the internet to other media with great care 
while the language of the privacy act speaks in terms of disclosures,the magistrate judge analogized the usace website posting to the publication of a magazine or office manual.we agree that the analogy to mass media,defamation law,and the notion of publication is appropriate when considering unauthorized disclosures under the privacy act,given that the statutory text prohibits disclosure by any means of communication and such disclosure implies the concept of publication to a third party.in addition,the term disclose is defined as to make known or public.see collegiate dictionary ed.in light of these textual and grammatical indicia,we conclude that it is appropriate to import publication considerations into our analysis of the privacy act.in so doing,we also consider legal doctrines generally associated with the realm of defamation law,namely the single publication rule.we also note that the fact that both the privacy act and defamation law are driven by similar policy integrity and reputational the application all the more apt.
courts that have considered the issue of when information is properly considered published have done so largely in the context of state defamation suits.these courts have generally concluded that the posting of information on the web should be treated in the same manner as the publication of traditional media,books,newspapers,magazines,and radio and television broadcasts,that is,that traditional media single publication rule should apply to postings on the internet under the single publication rule,any one edition of a book or newspaper,or any one radio or television broadcast,exhibition of a motion picture or similar aggregate communication is a single publication.restatement second of torts.under this rule,the aggregate communication can give rise to only one cause of action in the jurisdiction where the dissemination occurred,and result in only one statute of limitations period that runs from the point at which the original dissemination occurred.zuck interstate publ g,cir.
courts that have extended the single publication rule to internet publishing have done so on the premise that published web content is functionally identical to published traditional print media and,accordingly,internet publication should be considered published in the same manner as is a print edition while that premise is not entirely accurate we agree that the analogy between internet and print publication is sufficiently apt to be serviceable.internet publication is a form of aggregate communication in that it is intended for a broad,public audience,similar to print media in both print and internet publishing,information is generally considered published when it is made available to the public once information has been published on a website or print media,there is no further act required by the publisher to make the information available to the public 
in addition to functional similarities between print and internet publication,the same considerations that compel application of the first publication rule to traditional forms of aggregate communication are equally compelling in the context of internet publication.the single publication rule is designed to protect defendants from harassment through multiple suits and to reduce the drain of libel cases on judicial resources.see keeton hustler magazine,d.those same considerations present themselves in relation to internet publishing,and militate in favor of applying the single publication rule to internet publication.given that c ommunications posted on web sites may be viewed by thousands,if not millions,over an expansive geographic area for an indefinite period of time,allowing internet publications to be subject to a multiple publication rule would implicate an even greater potential for endless retriggering of the statute of limitations,multiplicity of suits and harassment of defendants.inevitably,there would be a serious inhibitory effect on the open,pervasive dissemination of information and ideas over the internet,which is,of course,its greatest beneficial promise.firth,at.such concerns have motivated state courts to extend the single publication rule to internet publication and federal courts sitting in diversity have done likewise 
oja takes issue with the analogy to traditional media and the proposition that the single publication rule should apply to internet publication.he urges us to consider the continuous hosting of private information on an internet website as a series of discrete and ongoing acts of publication,each giving rise to a cause of action with its own statute of limitations.specifically,oja compares the hosting of a website to a series of citizen telephone calls to the usace,each caller asking the same question and each receiving the same private information in response and in violation of the privacy act.we find that approach problematic.the actual posting or publishing of information onto a website requires only a single,discrete act,and no additional action by the host is necessary before the information may be accessed by the general public.thus,unlike a series of telephone calls,once a host posts information on the internet,the host may remain passive and does not have to respond anew each time an internet user accesses its website.here,for example,the usace the website host did not modify the substance of the published information following the initial posting of the private information in september of through november of,or cause its renewed publication beyond the continued hosting of its internet site although it is true that a website must be continuously hosted on a server computer for the public to access posted information,that action concerns technical maintenance rather than the particularized and original effort involved in publishing information to an audience such routine maintenance of a website which often amounts to no more than supplying the server computer with power should not in itself be considered an act of republication 
oja urges us to adopt the approach taken in swafford memphis individual practice association,wl,an unpublished decision by the tennessee court of appeals.in swafford,the national practitioner data bank npdb provided allegedly defamatory information to health care entities which requested the information directly from the electronic data bank maintained by the npdb.id.at.each transmission was released in response to an affirmative request by a hospital or other health care entity and the databank could be accessed only by certified health care entities.id.at.accordingly,the court of appeals found that the single publication rule did not apply because each time a certified entity directly requested the information from the electronic held by the npdb,the npdb itself provided the information directly to the requesting entity.id.at.
swafford is distinguishable from our present concern,and is not inconsistent with application of the single publication rule to the vast majority of internet publications.unlike a typical internet publication,the information at issue in swafford was not available for the general public to access,nor could any unregistered and entities access the registered databank.given the exclusive and controlled access to the npdb databank,the release of the offending information could hardly be considered an aggregate communication comparable to typical internet publication,where access is generally available to anyone at any time.indeed,the limited access scenario set forth in swafford resembles oja telephone call analogy where the agency releases the information anew each time there is a request.swafford is much more akin to the release of personal credit reports by those agencies that track and compile credit information in such cases,it has been widely accepted that the transmission or publication of the information does not warrant application of the single publication rule,and each transmission or publication is actionable 
application of the single publication rule to internet publication is not inconsistent with the privacy act strictures.application of the single publication rule to internet publication will focus privacy act claims against a defendant,thereby economizing judicial resources while preserving the plaintiff ability to bring the claims.thus,we hold that the single publication rule should be applied under the privacy act to general internet publications.consequently,oja original and first amended complaints were not filed timely,and the district court correctly determined that oja claims were barred by the statute of limitations.
oja second amended complaint is also barred by the statute of limitations.in march,oja filed a second amended complaint,alleging that the usace published the same private information at a different internet address in december.if,in fact,the usace published the same private information at a different url address then that disclosure constitutes a separate and distinct not foreclosed by the single publication the usace might be liable for a separate violation of the privacy act.however,such an additional claim is still subject to the statute of limitations,which,under the privacy act,is two years from the date the private information is made public.see g.given that the alleged second disclosure occurred in december,the statute would have run in december,some three months before oja filed suit for the disclosure in his second amended complaint,filed in march.accordingly,the district court correctly determined that the second amended complaint was untimely.
b.the relation back doctrine 
oja claims that his second amended complaint is timely because it relates back to the filing of his earlier complaints.oja argues that the privacy act claims in his second amended complaint are timely because they arose out of the same conduct,transaction,or occurrence alleged in his earlier complaints,given that the information in the second posting was identical to the information in the first posting accordingly,oja avers that his second amended complaint should relate back to the filing date of his earlier complaint under rule c.
after considering the issue,we find that oja mistakes the meaning of the language of rule c.rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure provides,in pertinent part,that 
an amendment of a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when 
the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct,transaction,or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading 
the conduct,transaction,or occurrence of which oja complained in his first amended complaint was the usace act of disclosing oja personal information on its website in november,in violation of the privacy act prohibitions.by contrast,oja second amended complaint alleges claims arising from a second disclosure by the usace on a separate website occurring in december.nowhere in oja first amended complaint does he reference a second disclosure on a usace public affairs site in december,and nowhere has oja alleged that the disclosure act in december arose out of the conduct,transmission,or occurrence of the usace november disclosure on the usace national site.the privacy act states that n o agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person,b,and we have determined,supra,that a disclosure occurs when the information is first posted on the internet.the fact that the language in the two disclosures is identical is inapposite because oja claims under the privacy act are based on the acts of disclosure themselves,each of which is distinct in time and place,if not substance accordingly,and given that the claims made in oja second amended complaint are otherwise barred by the statute of limitations,we agree with the district court that oja second amended complaint does not relate back to the filing date of oja earlier complaint.our conclusion is consistent with our application of the single publication rule to internet publication 
intentional or willful disclosures 
in the alternative,oja argues that while he knew of the usace posting in september,his cause of action did not actually accrue until october,when he claims he first learned that the usace posting was intentional or willful.g d provides that whenever an agency d fails to comply with any other provision of this section,or any rule promulgated thereunder,in such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual,the individual may bring a civil action against the agency section g predicates an award of monetary damages for a violation of g d on the court determin ing that the agency acted in a manner which was intentional or willful.emphasis added.oja asserts that this reference to willful ness brings his claim within the exception to the statute of limitations provision,section g.that section states,in relevant part,that 
an action to enforce any liability created under this section may be brought within two years from the date on which the cause of action arises,except that where an agency has materially and willfully misrepresented any information required under this section to be disclosed to an individual and the information so misrepresented is material to establishment of the liability of the agency to the individual under this section,the action may be brought at any time within two years after discovery by the individual of the misrepresentation.
id.emphasis added.thus,oja asserts that the statute of limitations for his original privacy act claims did not begin to run until october,placing them well within the limitations period.
the privacy act statute of limitations commences when the person knows or has reason to know of the alleged violation.because the accrual of the statute of limitations in part turns on what a reasonable person should have known,we review this mixed question of law and fact for clear error.rose united states,cir internal citations omitted see also englerius veterans,cir we join the seventh,tenth and district of columbia circuits in holding that a cause of action under the privacy act does not arise and the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the alleged violation.to the extent that oja avers that he was unaware that the usace intentionally or willfully disclosed his personal information,we find that the record substantiates the magistrate judge finding that oja knew or had reason to know in september that the usace intentionally posted his information on its internet site.indeed,the magistrate judge found that it would have been unreasonable for oja to believe that the posting was anything but intentional.accordingly,the magistrate judge concluded that,w hile the court allows for the possibility of an accidental posting,the chances of such an unintentional posting occurring are so small that the only reasonable assumption for plaintiff to make when he became aware of the posting was that it was done intentionally.we add to that assessment that the context in which oja information was posted compels the inference that the usace posting was intentional as oja himself notes in his first amended complaint his personal information was posted in conjunction with the usace response to a washington post article that was critical of the usace and which referred to oja activities during his tenure with the alaska district.moreover,the information the usace posted on oja was inconsistent with the settlement agreement,as oja had claimed in his september petition for enforcement before the mspb.given the foregoing,there is no error in the magistrate judge findings or conclusions.
oja asserts that g tolled the statute of limitations in his claim until he learned that the usace admitted that its posting was intentional.oja argument incorrectly conflates the context in which the term willfulness operates in g and.section g provides that agency disclosure of personal information must be intentional or willful in order to permit the recovery of monetary damages.as discussed previously,g requires that all claims for actionable agency disclosures be brought within two years of the disclosure unless the agency has materially and willfully misrepresented information that the privacy act requires the agency to disclose to an individual,and that m
