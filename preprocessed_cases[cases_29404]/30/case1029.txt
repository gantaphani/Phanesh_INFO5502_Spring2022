in this action for injunction against the united states,the san carlos apache tribe tribe seeks to maintain certain water levels in the san carlos reservoir reservoir in arizona.the tribe brought suit under various federal laws and federal common law and is primarily concerned with damage to the environment,including to fish and other species,caused by decreased water flow into the reservoir.our focus here is the tribe claim under of the national historic preservation act nhpa et,which requires that federal agencies take into account the effect of the ir undertaking s on any district,site,building,structure,or object that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the national register.the tribe argues that its suit is properly brought as a private right of action directly under nhpa rather than under the administrative procedure act apa,et.
whether provides a private right of action against the united states is a question of first impression in this circuit and one that we consider in light of alexander sandoval,d.the district court dismissed the claim on the ground that nhpa contains no such private right of action we agree and affirm.
background 
in,congress authorized construction of the coolidge dam as a means of providing water to the pima indians.congress provided that any excess water was to be used for the irrigation of such other lands in public or private ownership,as in the opinion of the said secretary,can be served with water impounded by said dam without diminishing the supply necessary for said indian lands.act of june,ch,stat.the reservoir is located in the southern portion of the san carlos apache reservation.although the reservoir is encircled by the tribe land its water is designated almost entirely for use by others 
in the,the water levels in the reservoir began to drop because of drought.the drought did not show signs of abating and threatened to seriously deplete the reservoir.after failed efforts to negotiate for commitments that water be retained in the reservoir,in may,the tribe filed this suit seeking injunctive relief.the tribe alleged statutory violations of the endangered species act,et,the native american graves protection and repatriation act,et,and nhpa,as well as common law nuisance and breach of trust.the district court denied requests for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction and ultimately ruled against the tribe on all of its claims.san carlos i,d at 
the nhpa involves a series of measures designed to encourage preservation of sites and structures of historic,architectural,or cultural significance.penn cent.transp.city of new york,d.for example,the act establishes the national register of historic places and procedures related to listing on the register.section requires that federal agencies take into account the effect of their undertakings on any district,site,building,structure,or object that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the national register.
section does not expressly provide that private individuals may sue to enforce its provisions.nor does the statute specify a remedy for violation of this section.the question is whether the statute creates a private right of action by implication.the government maintains it does not and that the only avenue open to private parties seeking to force government officials to comply with is to invoke the review procedures set out in the apa,including the requirements for a final order and exhaustion.because the tribe has not sought review under the apa,the government argues that the tribe nhpa claim must be dismissed.the tribe urges us to find that contains a private right of action separate and apart from the apa and that dismissal of its claim under nhpa was error.
whether contains a private cause of action is a question not yet addressed by our circuit.in tyler cisneros,cir,we assumed without deciding that nhpa contains a private right of action.id.at reversing the district court holding that nhpa contains an implicit statute of limitations.in other cases where we have reviewed government compliance with nhpa in actions initiated under the apa,the question has not arisen.see,muckleshoot indian tribe forest,cir reviewing under the apa a tribe claim that the forest service violated nhpa in the course of a land exchange.
it is now well understood that private rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by congress.sandoval,at.the court explained that t he judicial task is to interpret the statute congress has passed to determine whether it displays an intent to create not just a private right but also a private remedy.id.as in sandoval,we begin our analysis by turning to the provision at issue.
the language of is strikingly similar to the language the supreme court considered in sandoval.in sandoval,the court inquiry was whether of title vi of the civil rights act of contained a private right of action.sandoval,at.section of the civil right act provides that n o person in the united states shall,on the ground of race,color,or national origin,be excluded from participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.there was no disagreement that envisioned a private right of action.sandoval,at.citing precedents that clearly established that created a private right of action.
section authorizes agencies to effectuate the provisions of by issuing rules,regulations,or orders of general applicability.consideration of prompted the supreme court to clarify that s tatutes that focus on the person regulated rather than the individuals protected create no implication of an intent to confer rights on a particular class of persons.sandoval,at.quoting california sierra club,d.the court observed that unlike,which protected individuals,focused not on individuals to be protected,but on regulatory agencies.id.at.as a result,the court held that did not create a private right of action.id.at.
section of the civil right act and of nhpa are similar in a crucial way they are directives to federal government actors.the thrust of is not directed to individuals or entities that may be harmed through violation of nhpa dictates,but rather,like of the civil rights act,to the persons heads of federal agencies.this focus on regulating agencies provides little reason to infer a private right of action.
sandoval offers a second lesson that weighs against implying a private right of action under.in rejecting the claim that of the civil rights act contains a private right of action,the court took note that provided means by which regulations promulgated under it were to be enforced.at.describing statutory procedures for enforcing regulations.after describing the enforcement mechanism,the court concluded that t he express provision of one method of enforcing a substantive rule suggests that congress intended to preclude others.id.at.
here,there is an alternate means of ensuring that government officials comply with the dictates of a federal statute although not expressly referenced in nhpa,invocation of the apa is a longstanding means to challenge agency action.see,glacier park found.watt,cir concluding that r egardless whether a statute implies a private right of action,administrative actions thereunder may be challenged under the apa unless they fall within the limited exceptions of that act.like the civil rights act considered in sandoval,the apa established a specific mechanism for enforcing statutes like nhpa.the apa provides review for a gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.this avenue is open to a person suffering legal wrong because of agency action,or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action.
indeed,as breyer explained 
it is difficult to understand why a court would ever hold that congress,in enacting a statute that creates federal obligations,has implicitly created a private right of action against the federal government,for there is hardly ever any need for congress to do so.that is because federal action is nearly always reviewable for conformity with statuto
