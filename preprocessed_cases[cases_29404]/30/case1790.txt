hoffman street,llc hoffman,and harper project,llc harper collectively petitioners,seek to redevelop their properties in the city of west hollywood by demolishing existing apartment buildings and constructing new condominium projects.the city determined that the development applications were incomplete and later adopted an interim ordinance restricting development in areas zoned for multifamily residential uses after the city council extended the interim ordinance for one year,petitioners filed a combined petition for writ of mandate and complaint against the city,its city council,and its community development department.petitioners challenge the extension of the interim ordinance under the planning and zoning law,et,the permit streamlining act,et,and the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et.they also seek damages based on the denial of due process,denial of equal protection,and inverse condemnation.after a hearing on the merits of the counts seeking a writ of mandate,the trial court entered a judgment denying the petition and denying any relief on the complaint.petitioners appeal the judgment.
we conclude that the city council failed to make findings required under government code section,subdivision c upon extending the interim ordinance and that the extension therefore was contrary to law and invalid.as a result,the trial court denial of petitioners petition for a writ of mandate was improper thus requiring a reversal of the judgment as to the first count of petitioners combined pleading.we also conclude,however,that petitioners have shown no prejudicial error in the denial of relief on their second count alleging a violation of the permit streamlining act,and that the third count alleging a ceqa violation is moot.finally,by entering judgment on counts four through seven without affording the parties an opportunity to be heard on those counts,the trial court deprived petitioners of their right to a fair hearing,thus requiring a reversal of the judgment as to those counts as well.

interim ordinance and its extension 
the city council adopted an interim ordinance ord.on june,temporarily prohibiting the issuance of permits or other approvals for the development of new multifamily dwellings in the city and zoning districts,with the exception of developments in compliance with specified interim zoning standards.the ordinance stated that its purpose was to increase both the number and the affordability of multifamily housing units in development projects in areas zoned for multifamily housing.the city adopted the ordinance as an urgency measure.
the interim ordinance stated that the city council found that the recent proliferation of applications for structures in the and zoning districts with both fewer and larger units than are desirable to meet the city unmet housing goals and the significant unmet need for smaller affordable housing units are posing a current and immediate threat to the public health,safety and welfare.it stated that the city was preparing to revise the land use and housing elements of its general plan,including new regulations governing the construction of multifamily dwellings.the ordinance stated that it was adopted pursuant to government code section and that it would remain in effect for days,unless it was extended in accordance with section.
the interim zoning standards allowed the construction of p rojects for housing which were deemed complete or approved prior to may,multifamily dwellings in which at least of the units were affordable,as defined in the municipal code multifamily dwellings in which the units did not exceed specified maximum size limits,the buildings did not exceed a specified height,and the net increase in total units was at least public facilities projects consolidating adjacent parcels in particular areas,provided that the projects included a significant commercial enhancement on sunset boulevard or projects adding new residential units to existing multifamily dwellings without the demolition of existing units.
the city council adopted an ordinance ord.on july,extending the interim ordinance for months and days the ordinance stated some of the same findings made in the interim ordinance concerning urgency and the need for affordable housing.it also revised the interim zoning standards by increasing the maximum size limits for some units and allowing the construction of multifamily dwellings on land where there were no existing residential buildings or only single family residential buildings.
trial court proceedings 
petitioners filed their combined petition for a writ of mandate and complaint against the city,its city council,and its community development department in october.petitioners allege that the city council,upon extending the interim ordinance,failed to make the findings set forth in paragraphs through of government code section,subdivision c,as required.they also allege that the extended interim ordinance may have a significant impact on the environment and that the city failed to comply with ceqa.they allege further that the city intentionally delayed the processing of hoffman application to ensure that the project would not qualify under the interim zoning standards as a project for which the application was complete as of may.
petitioners combined pleading alleges counts for failure to comply with government code section,subdivision c by both petitioners,seeking a writ of mandate ordering the city to set aside the extension of the interim ordinance failure to comply with the permit streamlining act by hoffman,seeking a writ of mandate establishing that hoffman application is exempt from the terms of the interim ordinance as a previously completed application violation of ceqa by both petitioners,seeking a writ of mandate ordering the city to set aside the extension of the interim ordinance denial of procedural due process under the united states constitution,pursuant to title united states code section section by hoffman,seeking damages arising from the delay in the processing of hoffman application denial of equal protection under the united states and california constitutions,pursuant to section by hoffman,seeking damages arising from the delay in the processing of hoffman application inverse condemnation by both petitioners,seeking damages and declaratory relief as to all of the foregoing by both petitioners.
the trial court conducted a hearing on the merits of only the first three counts seeking a writ of mandate.in a minute order filed on august,the court concluded that the requirement that the legislative body adopt the findings set forth in paragraphs through of government code section,subdivision c in order to extend an interim ordinance did not apply to projects involving the demolition of affordable housing units,pursuant to subdivision g of section,and that petitioners had failed to show that the existing apartment buildings contained no affordable housing units.it concluded that the city was not required to make those findings upon extending the interim ordinance and that the extension was neither arbitrary nor capricious.the trial court also concluded that the administrative remedy of an appeal to the city council was available for any denial of an application for a permit,and that petitioners had failed to exhaust that administrative remedy.the court stated further that petitioners had failed to exhaust their administrative remedy with respect to their challenge to the extension of the interim ordinance by failing to argue to the city council that additional findings were required under section,subdivision c,and that they had failed to exhaust their administrative remedy with respect to their argument that the city was equitably estopped from asserting that their development applications were incomplete by failing to raise that point before the city council.
the trial court stated with respect to the ceqa count that government code section,subdivision a expressly exempted from ceqa the adoption of an interim ordinance such as the one adopted by the city,and that the extensive procedural requirements of ceqa were fundamentally inconsistent with an urgency measure adopted pursuant to section.it stated further that there was no evidence to support a fair argument that the interim ordinance would cause a significant environmental impact.
the minute order concluded by directing the city to prepare a proposed judgment.the order did not specifically address counts four through seven.the city submitted a proposed judgment in favor of the city on all counts alleged in the petition and complaint.petitioners objected to the proposed judgment on the ground that the court had conducted no hearing on the merits of counts four through seven.the court overruled the objection and entered a judgment in september denying the petition for writ of mandate and denying petitioners any relief on any of the counts alleged in the complaint.petitioners timely appealed the judgment.
zoning amendments 
the city adopted new zoning ordinances while this appeal was pending,amending the regulations governing the development of multifamily dwellings in the city and zoning districts.the amendments include new maximum average unit sizes and a requirement that new developments be built to a minimum of percent of the allowable density 
contentions 
petitioners contend the city was required to make the findings set forth in paragraphs through of government code section,subdivision c upon extending the interim ordinance,but failed to do so the trial court finding that petitioners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies in connection with both their challenge to the extension and their contention that hoffman application should be exempt from the interim ordinance as a previously completed application was error the extension of the interim ordinance was not exempt from ceqa and the dismissal of counts four through seven without a hearing on the merits or any statutory authority for the dismissal was error.
discussion 
government code section 
government code section authorizes a city or county to adopt an ordinance that temporarily imposes land use restrictions that are consistent with a land use plan or zoning proposal that the city or county may consider adopting,subd.a.the legislative body of the city or county may adopt such an interim ordinance as an urgency measure to protect the public safety,health,and welfare,by a vote,without notice or a hearing.ibid.or,a lternatively,an interim ordinance may be adopted by a vote following notice pursuant to section and public hearing,subd.b.
an interim ordinance expires days after its adoption unless the legislative body,by a vote,extends it,subds.a,b.an interim ordinance adopted without notice or a hearing may be extended once for a period months and days and a second time for a period of one year,subd.a.an interim ordinance adopted following notice and a hearing may be extended for a period of months and days,subd.b.
an interim ordinance may not be adopted or extended unless the ordinance contains legislative findings that there is a current and immediate threat to the public health,safety,or welfare,and that the approval of additional subdivisions,use permits,variances,building permits,or any other applicable entitlement for use which is required in order to comply with a zoning ordinance would result in that threat to public health,safety,or welfare,subd.c.additional requirements apply if the legislative body seeks to extend an interim ordinance that has the effect of denying approvals needed for the development of projects with a significant component of multifamily housing.ibid.the legislative body may extend such an interim ordinance only upon written findings adopted by the legislative body,supported by substantial evidence on the record,that all of the following conditions exist 
the continued approval of the development of multifamily housing projects would have a specific,adverse impact upon the public health or safety.as used in this paragraph,a specific,adverse impact means a significant,quantifiable,direct,and unavoidable impact,based on objective,identified written public health or safety standards,policies,or conditions as they existed on the date that the ordinance is adopted by the legislative body.
the interim ordinance is necessary to mitigate or avoid the specific,adverse impact identified pursuant to paragraph.
there is no feasible alternative to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific,adverse impact identified pursuant to paragraph as well or better,with a less burdensome or restrictive effect,than the adoption of the proposed interim ordinance,subd.c,italics added.
government code section,subdivision g states for purposes of this section,development of multifamily housing projects does not include the demolition,conversion,redevelopment,or rehabilitation of multifamily housing that is affordable to lower income households,as defined in section of the health and safety code,or that will result in an increase in the price or reduction of the number of affordable units in a multifamily housing project.the language projects with a significant component of multifamily housing is defined as projects in which multifamily housing consists of at least of the total square footage of the project,subd.h.
thus,a city or county may adopt an interim ordinance to prevent development that would be inconsistent with a contemplated land use plan or zoning proposal if the legislative body,by a vote,finds that such development would pose an immediate threat to the public health,safety,or welfare,subds.a c.such an interim ordinance is valid for a period of days,but can be extended so that the full duration of the measure is up to two years,subds.a,b.the legislative body,however,can not extend an interim ordinance that has the effect of denying approvals needed for the development of projects with a significant component of multifamily housing,subd.c unless the legislative body makes the findings set forth in paragraphs through of government code section,subdivision c,subd.c.
government code section,subdivision g limits the definition of multifamily housing projects for purposes of the statute 
the city contends this appeal is moot as to the validity of the extension of the interim ordinance because the extension has expired by its own terms.petitioners contend the validity of the extension is relevant to counts four through seven and for other reasons.we need not decide whether the appeal is moot in this regard because we have the discretion to consider the appeal in any event.an appellate court has the discretion to decide an appeal that,although technically moot,presents an issue of continuing public interest.torres parkhouse tire service,cal th,d.the exercise of such discretion is particularly appropriate if the issue ordinarily arises in controversies that are so as to evade normal appellate review,as here.chantiles lake forest ii master homeowners th,d.
the purpose of the requirement under government code section,subdivision c that the legislative body make additional findings,supported by substantial evidence in the record,upon the extension of an interim ordinance that has the effect of denying approvals needed for the development of projects with a significant component of multifamily housing ibid.is to avoid undue restrictions on the development of multifamily housing the legislative body adopting such an extension must find that an extension is necessary to mitigate or avoid a specific,adverse impact on public health or safety identified by the legislative body,and that there is no feasible alternative to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid that impact,as stated in paragraphs through of subdivision c.subdivision g excludes from the definition of multifamily housing projects certain types of developments that would decrease the supply or the affordability of multifamily housing,as we will explain.
our fundamental task in construing a statute is to ascertain the legislative intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.hassan mercy american river hospital cal th,d.because the statutory language ordinarily is the most reliable indicator of legislative intent,we begin by examining the words of the statute.ibid.we give the words of the statute their ordinary and usual meaning and construe them in the context of the statute as a whole and the entire scheme of law of which it is a part.state farm mutual automobile ins.garamendi cal th,d.if the language is clear and a literal construction would not result in absurd consequences that the legislature did not intend,we presume that the legislature meant what it said and the plain meaning governs.coalition of concerned communities,city of los angeles cal th,d.if the language is ambiguous,we may consider a variety of extrinsic aids,including the purpose of the statute,legislative history,and public policy.ibid.frontier oil rli ins.th,d.
government code section,subdivision c states in relevant part,any interim ordinance adopted pursuant to this section that has the effect of denying approvals needed for the development of projects with a significant component of multifamily housing may not be extended except upon written findings italics added.the first of the required findings is a finding that t he continued approval of the development of multifamily housing projects would have a specific,adverse impact upon the public health or safety,as defined,subd.c,par,italics added.these two italicized phrases are similar but not identical.section defines projects with a significant component of multifamily housing as projects in which multifamily housing consists of at least of the total square footage of the project,subd.h,and states that development of multifamily housing projects does not include certain types of projects,subd.g.the statute does not explicitly state,however,that development of projects with a significant component of multifamily housing does not include the types of projects described in subdivision g.
we believe that the phrases development of projects with a significant component of multifamily housing,subd.c and development of multifamily housing projects,par.were intended to have the same meaning.the additional findings set forth in paragraphs through of subdivision c are required only if the extension of an interim ordinance has the effect of preventing the development of projects with a significant component of multifamily housing,while the three required findings all relate exclusively to the development of multifamily housing projects,as described in paragraph.in our view,this indicates that the legislature used the phrase development of multifamily housing projects as a shortened reference to development of projects with a significant component of multifamily housing.for purposes of the statute,the two phrases are synonymous.
government code section,subdivision g,which expressly limits the meaning of development of multifamily housing projects,therefore limits the meaning of development of projects with a significant component of multifamily housing as well.thus,the development of projects with a significant component of multifamily housing does not include the development of the types of projects described in subdivision g.if an interim ordinance has the effect of denying approvals needed for the development of only those types of projects described in subdivision g,the additional findings set forth in paragraphs through of subdivision c are not required.the legislature apparently concluded that a development that involves the demolition,conversion,redevelopment,or rehabilitation of multifamily housing that is affordable to lower income households or results in an increase in the price or reduction of the number of affordable units in a multifamily housing project,subd.g would reduce the supply or affordability of affordable housing,and that the findings set forth in paragraphs through of subdivision c should not be required for an interim ordinance affecting only such developments.
the legislative history supports this construction.legislative committee reports and analyses prepared in connection with the bill that added the second sentence of government code section,subdivision c paragraphs through of subdivision c and subdivisions g and h stated that the requirement of additional findings would not apply to interim ordinances relating to the types of projects described in subdivision g.rules,off.of floor analyses,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended,assem.com.on local government,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended june,assem.com.on housing and community development,analysis of bill reg.sess.june,proposed amendment,the legislative history also indicates that the bill imposed findings requirements similar to those under the housing accountability act in order to prevent local governments from circumventing the requirements of that act through the adoption of interim ordinances.rules,off.of floor analyses,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.
our construction is consistent with the purpose of government code section,subdivision c to avoid undue restrictions on the development of multifamily housing and the purpose of section,subdivision d to reduce barriers to the production of affordable housing.those purposes both are served by requiring the legislative body to make the additional findings set forth in paragraphs through of section,subdivision c if the extension of an interim ordinance has the effect of preventing the development of multifamily housing,but those purposes would not be served by requiring such additional findings upon extending an interim ordinance that prohibits only those projects that would decrease the supply or reduce the affordability of affordable housing.
the city was required to make the additional findings set forth in paragraphs through of government code section,subdivision c 
petitioners allege in their first count that upon extending the interim ordinance,the city was required to make the findings set forth in paragraphs through of government code section,subdivision c,but failed to make those findings the trial court concluded that such findings are not required upon extending an interim ordinance that has the effect of denying approvals for the types of developments described in subdivision g.the trial court stated that petitioners
