petitioner,association of irritated residents air,petitions this court for review of the united states environmental protection agency epa promulgation of,a regulation that revised the scope of a previous epa decision.the epa promulgated the regulation under k of the clean air act caa,act,an provision,after the agency determined that it had mistakenly approved certain new source review rules in as part of california state implementation plan.
this case requires the court to address two matters.first,this court must decide whether the epa reasonably determined that it made the error.this court holds that the epa was not arbitrary,nor did it abuse its discretion in correcting its prior approval of the new source review rules after it learned that california law,specifically senate bill,did not authorize the san joaquin air control district to require new source permits or emissions offsets for minor agricultural sources.because those rules conflicted with state law,they should not have been incorporated into the state implementation plan in thus,the epa did not act improperly in correcting its prior approval.
second,as a matter of first impression,this court must decide whether k of the caa grants the epa authority to amend retroactively its approval of the new source review rules.petitioner argues that the other enumerated actions in k strictly limit the epa methods of revising an error.using the standard set forth in chevron,natural resources defense council,we find that k does not clearly speak to the issue at hand.in light of this ambiguity,the epa reasonably interpreted k requirement that the epa revise such erroneous action as appropriate to encompass a retroactive limitation of its previous approval.accordingly,we deny the petition for review.
background 
a.the clean air act 
congress enacted the caa amendments in to protect and enhance the quality of the nation air resources so as to promote the public health and welfare and the productive capacity of its population.b.at that time,congress also created the epa and charged it with setting national ambient air quality standards naaqs for various harmful air pollutants at levels necessary to protect the public health and welfare.the epa must designate areas for each naaqs as attainment it meets the pollutant level,nonattainment it does not meet the pollutant level,or unclassifiable.u.d.the epa is charged with assuring compliance with environmental laws and taking enforcement action against violations.see a,b.
under the caa,the epa works with the states pursuant to a model of cooperative federalism to achieve the statute environmental goals.vigil leavitt,cir.the act delegates to the states primary responsibility for assuring air quality within their respective boundaries and requires each state to develop a state implementation plan sip,which will specify the manner in which the naaqs will be achieved and maintained.a.in california san joaquin valley,the san joaquin valley unified air pollution control district the district promulgates and enforces regulations to meet the standards set by the epa.a state submits its sip to the epa for review and approval whenever the naaqs are updated.a.once an adequate sip one that meets the act requirements is approved by the epa,it has the force and effect of federal law.safe air for everyone epa,cir.the caa requires states to give the epa necessary assurances that state law authorizes the air control districts to carry out any rules contained in the sip.a e.
in,congress enacted the caa new source review nsr program to strengthen the safeguards that protect the nation air quality.new york epa.the nsr program requires new and modified major sources in areas,to acquire construction permits,install best available control technology bact,and purchase offsets from other sources emission reductions.c,a.a minor source is subject to the epa regulations,although it is not required to have nsr permits for all construction activities.a minor source is not subject to offset requirements unless the state chooses to establish them as part of the sip.
california implementation of the clean air act 
california central valley,which includes the san joaquin valley,has,and at all times relevant hereto,had,a major air pollution problem.in,the epa designated the san joaquin valley as a area for the hour ozone standard.see.
ozone aka smog forms when volatile organic compounds vocs react with nitrogen oxides in the presence of heat and sunlight during the summer.ozone pollution causes serious health problems,including damaging lung tissue and exacerbating asthma and other respiratory diseases.at.
the district estimated that,even with air pollution controls,confined animal facilities were among the largest sources of vocs in the valley.nevertheless,california former california health safety code e exempted agricultural operations,including those that would be considered major sources under the caa,from the nsr permit obligations until.due to this blanket exemption,the epa would not accept the district proposed nsr rules to the sip because california could not give necessary assurances that it had authority under state law to carry out the sip.see,june.
in order to avoid sanctions and loss of federal highway funding,the california legislature passed senate bill sb in september,which removed the blanket exemption that had previously excused all agricultural sources from the caa nsr requirements.california state law then required major agricultural sources to meet the pollution controls required by the caa and the proposed nsr rules.however,sb retained narrow that excused certain minor agricultural sources from nsr permitting and offset requirements.
around this same time,the epa considered district rules and the nsr rules,which the district had submitted in to the epa for approval.the nsr rules required new source permits and offset requirements for all new and modified stationary sources of air pollution,whether major or minor.see.in evaluating the nsr rules,the epa failed to realize that the rules conflicted with sb,which continued to exempt certain minor agricultural sources.the epa approved the nsr rules sans exemptions for minor agricultural sources which became effective on june.see.may.
beginning in,air filed three citizen in the eastern district of california against dairy farms that were minor agricultural sources under the caa.see of irritated residents c r vanderham dairy,vanderham of irritated residents fred schakel dairy,cal.june,of irritated residents foster farms,llc.air alleged that the dairies violated the nsr rules by not obtaining a permit,purchasing offsets,or installing bact.see,vanderham,wl,at.in vanderham,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of air and held that the defendants violated the nsr rules.id.at.
c.the epa error 
after the vanderham decision,the epa realized that it had made an error in approving the nsr rules,because the district did not have authority under sb to enforce the permit and offset provisions of those rules against certain minor agricultural sources.specifically,the epa found that the district did not have authority under to require permits for new or modified minor agricultural sources with actual emissions less than percent of the major source threshold or to require new minor agricultural sources or minor modifications to agricultural sources to obtain emission reduction offsets.see,cal.health safety code,c.however,the caa requires sip revisions to be supported by necessary assurances from the state that the district will have adequate authority under state law to carry out the revised sip.see.at,a e.
in and,california submitted sip revisions to amend the nsr rules to include the state law exemptions.in,the epa proposed a rule that would modify its approval and correct the mismatch between state law and the sip.see.the new nsr rules,complete with the state exemptions,replaced the nsr rules and were incorporated into the sip.see.may.however,this fix was only prospective and did not eliminate the mismatch between the sip and state law that existed from to.
to correct this error retroactively,the epa relied on k of the caa which states 
whenever the administrator determines that the administrator action approving,disapproving,or promulgating any plan or plan revision or part thereof,was in error,the administrator may in the same manner as the approval,disapproval,or promulgation revise such action as appropriate without requiring any further submission from the state.such determination and the basis thereof shall be provided to the state and public.
k.specifically,the epa proposed correcting its error by amending its previous approval of the nsr rules so that the approval was limited to be consistent with state law.at.the epa considered a retroactive limited approval to be the most appropriate response because it was a narrowly tailored approach that retained most of the pollution control aspects of the nsr rules but still remedied the mismatch between the sip and state law.see.at.in light of this proposed action,the district court stayed the vanderham and other citizen suits cases pending judicial review of the epa final action.see vanderham,wl,at,fred schakel dairy,d,foster farms,minute order.
before the epa finalized its error correction in,it requested the california attorney general to interpret sb and its bearing on the district authority to require permits and offsets from minor agricultural sources.in two letters,the attorney general confirmed the epa view that sb did not give the district authority to apply the nsr rules to certain minor agricultural sources or require offsets.
the epa then revised the scope of its approval.at,and promulgated the final rule limiting its approval to cover only the air pollution controls allowed by state law.see.the new regulation states 
a approval of the new source review rules for the san joaquin valley unified air pollution control district rules and as approved on may,in c i b,and in effect for federal purposes from june,through june,is limited,as it relates to agricultural sources,to the extent that the permit requirements apply 
to agricultural sources with potential emissions at or above a major source applicability threshold and 
to agricultural sources with actual emissions at or above percent of a major source applicability threshold.
b approval of the new source review rules is limited,as it relates to agricultural sources,to the extent that the emission offset requirements apply to major agricultural sources and major modifications of such sources.the error correction was in the form of rulemaking,the same procedure the epa had used to approve the rules.
d.the instant lawsuit 
air challenges the epa promulgation of,the regulation that corrected the epa approval of the nsr rules,on two grounds.first,air claims that k of the caa authorizes the epa to correct only its own erroneous approval or disapproval and does not give the epa authority retroactively to limit or amend a sip.second,air asserts that even if the epa has authority retroactively to revise its approval of the sip,it did not need to correct the approval because a the plain meaning of sb does not exempt minor agricultural sources from obtaining permits and offsets under the district rules and b the savings clauses grant the district with the authority to regulate minor agricultural sources regardless of the other provisions.air requests that this court vacate.the following intervenors,representing various agricultural interests,organizations and an air pollution control district,appear on the epa behalf air coalition team act,dairy cares,foster farms,llc,foster poultry farms,and san joaquin valley unified air pollution control district.

ii.discussion 
standard of review 
the caa does not specify a standard of review of the epa actions.therefore,this court reviews the epa action under the standard set forth in the administrative procedure act apa.sierra club epa,cir.
section of the apa provides that a court may reverse an agency action found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.when applying this standard,the court does not substitute its judgment for that of the agency.motor vehicle mfrs.ass of,state farm mut.auto.ins,u,nw.ecosystem alliance united states fish wildlife,cir.instead,this court consider s whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors,citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,and whether the agency articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made,burlington truck lines united states.
when reviewing the epa interpretation of k of the caa,this court applies the analysis provided in chevron,natural res.def.council.first,the court must decide whether congress has unambiguously and directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.if so,this court will give effect to the congressional intent expressed in the statute.id.at.to discover the plain meaning of the statute,the court must look to the particular statutory language at issue,as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.k mart cartier.if,however,the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.epa interpretation of its own regulations is given considerable deference and must be given controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.comm.for a better arvin epa,wl,at cir.may,quoting thomas jefferson shalala.
b.the epa error determination 
we begin our inquiry by determining whether the epa made an error that needed to be corrected.we ask whether the epa acted arbitrarily or capriciously,abused its discretion,or contradicted the caa when it decided there was a mismatch between state law and the sip.see a.according to air,the district did have authority under state law to carry out the sip,thus there was no mistake.the parties disagreement arises out of conflicting interpretations of sb offset provision and savings clauses.
in reviewing agency action pursuant to 
although we presume regulations to be valid,our inquiry into their validity is a thorough,probing,review.
to determine whether the agency action was arbitrary and capricious,we must decide whether the agency considered the relevant factors and articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.an agency action must be reversed when the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.our review of an agency decision is based on the administrative record and the basis for the agency decision must come from the record.we can not substitute our judgment for that of the agency.
ass of home builders norton,cir internal citations omitted.thus,the court will uphold the epa action as long as the epa employed a rational,process to determine if it had made an error.
at the outset,we note that while our court is not required to defer to the attorney general,it need not interpret sb for itself as long as it determines that the epa did not clearly go against the plain meaning of the statute the pertinent provisions of sb are ambiguous,and both the epa and air provide permissible interpretations.in light of this ambiguity,it was appropriate and reasonable for the epa to rely on the interpretations of the attorney general and the california air resources board carb in its determination that sb provided certain exemptions that were not accounted for in the nsr rules.the epa made a rational connection between the state officials interpretations,the purposes of the caa,and the choice it made.see burlington truck lines,at.
the epa insists that it made an error in its approval because there was a substantive mismatch between the nsr rules and state law,meaning that the epa had failed to get the necessary assurances that the district had adequate authority under state law to carry out the sip.see a e see generally.both the epa and air offer logical readings of the sb provisions at issue the offset provision and savings clauses.because there is more than one plausible explanation,the wording of the statute is ambiguous.the epa gave adequate consideration to the relevant factors,including the attorney general interpretation,and arrived at a rational conclusion on sb meaning therefore,the epa error determination was not arbitrary or capricious.
interpretation of the offset provision 
sb offset provision states 
a district may not require an agricultural source to obtain emissions offsets for criteria pollutants for that source if emissions reductions from that source would not meet the criteria for real,permanent,quantifiable,and enforceable emission reductions.
cal.health safety code c.
according to the epa,the offset provision exempts minor agricultural sources from the emission offsets requirement because minor agricultural sources did not meet the statutory criteria during the time period that the nsr rules were in effect.see.the minor sources did not meet the criteria because,according to the epa,the attorney general,and carb,the words real,permanent,quantifiable,and enforceable emission reductions referred to the criteria for offset credit under the caa.see a ii c i to qualify for offset credit,emissions reductions must be surplus,permanent,quantifiable,and federally enforceable.since minor agricultural sources were not determined to meet these criteria and were not eligible to receive offset credit for,or bank,their emission reductions,they were not required to purchase emissions offsets as an equitable matter.at.this led the epa to conclude that the offset provision did not grant the same authority to the district as the nsr rules did.
according to air,the plain meaning of the offset offsets when their emission reductions are sip creditable,not offset creditable.to support this contention,air compares the words of the offset provision to the caa criteria for sip credibility in the general preamble for the implementation of title i of the caa.see,suggesting principles for a sip strategy that includes quantifiable emissions,enforceable measures,replicable measures,and an accountable control strategy.air then argues that since the epa has approved sip credit for emissions reductions by several types of minor agricultural sources,those minor agricultural sources meet the criteria of sb offset provision and are thus compatible with the district nsr rules.
because the listed criteria in the offset provision do not correspond precisely with either the requirements of sip credibility or offset credibility,it is reasonable to interpret the provision as requiring either one or even both.since the statute is ambiguous,as long as the epa provides a plausible and rational explanation for why it chose interpretation x over interpretation y,then the court must uphold the epa decision.see bowman,arkansas best freight,w e will uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency path may reasonably be discerned.
in reaching its final rule,the epa spent several years considering the issue of the interpretation of sb,issued multiple notices,and accepted and responded to several comments,but the epa main source of support for its decision was the attorney general and carb letters interpreting the pertinent provisions of sb in regard to minor agricultural sources.at.since the statute is ambiguous and technical,it was rational for the epa to request and accept the attorney general interpretation,especially since commenters,including air,had requested that the epa obtain the attorney general input.see.at.the attorney general second letter in march,which specifically addressed the application of the offset provision to minor agricultural sources,stated that these minor sources did not currently meet the criteria for real,permanent,quantifiable and enforceable emission reductions,so the statute suspend s the duty of a minor agricultural source to offset emissions from that source.letter from robert byrne,cal.acting.attny.to jared blumenfeld,epa regional administrator,march.the letter stated that this position was consistent with a carb letter written in.id.at.
the carb letter is the source of the epa argument that the offset provision criteria refer to offset credit,not just sip credit,as air argues.specifically the letter stated 
this limited exemption from the offset requirement means that agricultural sources that are not amenable to district prohibitory rules or control measures that would qualify for sip credit or that are unable to generate emission reductions that would qualify as offsets because they fail to meet one or more of the basic criteria for a creditable rule or for offset credit can not be required to provide offsets.
letter from james goldstene,exec.officer,carb to air pollution control officers,emphasis added.this interpretation reveals that the offset provision criteria refer to both sip creditability and offset creditability.the epa addressed this reading in its final rule 
t he use of the conjunction or by carb in its discussion of the offset provision means that,under carb interpretation,even if sip credit were approved for prohibitory rules or control measures,new or modified minor agricultural sources could not be required to provide emission offsets if they are unable to generate emission reductions that would qualify as offsets.
air argues that since the epa had already approved sip credit for emissions reductions by agricultural sources,it was arbitrary and capricious for the epa to say those sources do not meet the criteria under the offset provision.air argument misses the point.because the epa understands that the offset provision refers to both and requirements,it does not matter that the epa approved some minor agricultural sources for sip credit because those sources still do not meet the requirements for offset credit.according to the epa,none of the sources mentioned by air receive offset credit for the emission reductions required by the sip.therefore,the epa was not arbitrary or capricious in determining that the district lacked the power under state law to require offsets from minor agricultural sources from.
air argues that this court should not defer to the california attorney general interpretation of sb,nor to carb interpretation of the offset provision.if it were clear from the plain meaning of the statute that the epa interpretation was erroneous or unreasonable,then it may well have been erroneous for the epa to defer to a clearly wrong interpretation by the attorney general.however,that is not the situation presented by the instant case.
air seeks to rely on two decisions of this court,which air states hold that this court does not have to defer to an attorney general opinion on state law.see maldonado harris,cir virginia am.booksellers ass n,certified question answered sub nom.com.am.booksellers ass n.however,both decisions concerned facial constitutional challenges to state statutes that necessitated direct judicial review of the statute,whereas the present case involves judicial review of an agency use of the california attorney general and carb informal interpretation of a state statute.see maldonado,at involving first amendment challenge to california outdoor advertising act am.booksellers ass n,at interpreting the scope of a virginia statute prohibiting display of explicit material in certain situations.moreover,although the court is not bound by the california attorney general opinion,the epa may properly find an attorney general interpretation reasonable and persuasive.
other circuits have applied the arbitrary and capricious standard to the epa reliance on an attorney general or agency interpretation of an ambiguous state law.in ohio envtl.council epa,the sixth circuit held that the epa reliance on the ohio attorney general interpretation of ohio law was not arbitrary and capricious,particularly because the petitioner did not take its challenge to the ohio state courts prior to the action.see,cir.the sixth circuit also held that the epa determination based on the attorney general opinion was clearly consistent with its secondary role in forming sips under the caa.id.
similarly,in defenders of wildlife epa,the tenth circuit addressed the epa reliance on a letter from new mexico water quality control commission wqcc when interpreting an ambiguous new mexico state regulation,cir.the epa based its approval of the regulation on wqcc interpretation.the tenth circuit held that the epa was not arbitrary or capricious in doing so.see id.at t he epa did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in approving the regulation,particularly since the agency reserved the right to revoke approval if new mexico interpreted the regulation in the future in a way that would not comply with the clean water act.
in the instant case,the epa reliance on the attorney general and carb letters to interpret the ambiguous provisions of sb was not arbitrary,capricious,or unlawful.
interpretation of the savings clauses 
the epa and air interpret the savings clauses in sb differently and disagree on whether there was an error or mismatch that the epa needed to correct.the savings clauses provisions state 
any district rule or regulation affecting stationary sources on agricultural operations adopted on or before january,is applicable to an agricultural source.
cal.health safety code b.
nothing in this section limits the authority of a district to regulate a source,including,but not limited to,a stationary source that is an agricultural source,over which it otherwise has jurisdiction pursuant to this division,or pursuant to the federal clean air act or any rules or regulations adopted pursuant to that act that were in effect on or before january,cal.health safety code c.
according to air,the savings clauses provisions preserve the district authority to apply the district nsr rules adopted prior to january,to certain minor agricultural sources regardless of the meaning of the offset provision.air refers to the broad language of the clauses and asks that the court adhere to their plain meaning.
the epa proposes a more limited interpretation,contending that the provisions in the savings clauses do not override the provisions of sb that exempt minor agricultural sources from air pollution controls.nor,according to the epa,do the savings clauses authorize the district nsr rules.instead they only serve to preserve the district authority to regulate sources that had previously been,but were now considered agricultural because of sb new for agricultural sources moreover,section c does not grant authority to enforce the nsr rules.even though the definitional section of sb did not limit the district authority,other sections,such as the offset provision,might.
as was the case with the offset provision,the epa determination that the savings clauses did not give the district overriding authority to enforce the nsr rules was based on the california attorney general interpretation in the letter.at.the attorney general stated that the savings clauses do not authorize the rules permit and offset requirements because they were meant to be read in light of the definitional context of section.letter from robert byrne,cal.acting.attny.to jared blumenfeld,epa regional administrator,november.
before the legislature passed sb,california law had provided an exemption to agricultural sources from all new source review permitting requirements,but districts were allowed to adopt source review emission rules of general application that applied to agricultural stationary sources.id.section b was meant to preserve those rules only not nsr rules.id.the purpose was to preserve and validate those existing equipment governing regulations of general application that,without such a savings clause,might be construed as invalid because the regulated equipment was included as part of sb agricultural sources definition.id.this explanation is reasonable.if not limited to rule preservation,section b would be granting districts new authority to apply nsr rules authority that had previously not existed under california blanket exemption.
the attorney general also interpreted section c.id.s ubdivision c clarifies that section itself does not limit a district existing authority,but subdivision c does not concern whether some other provision of sb might limit a district authority.id.this explanation accounts for the statute as a whole.if the legislature intended for the savings clauses to allow the district to ignore the exemptions located elsewhere in sb,then it would have said that a district prior authority was not limited by any section in the statute.for the same reasons set forth above regarding the offset provision,the court finds that the epa reasonably relied on this interpretation from the attorney general and was not arbitrary or capricious in deciding that it had made an error because it fully considered the effect of the savings clauses on the district authority under state law.
the epa reasonably respected state law 
the epa desire to correct its approval to make it align with state law is not an arbitrary one,considering the aims and structure of the caa model of cooperative federalism.the caa grants primary authority to the states to develop emission limits.train natural res.def.council.the epa role under the caa scheme is secondary.id.therefore,by trying to respect california statutory limits on air pollution controls,the epa is properly considering the purpose and structure of the act it is entrusted to enforce.
before sb was enacted,california law included a blanket exemption for all agricultural sources,both major and minor,from the nsr air pollution controls.see.this legislative background indicates that california may have wished to preserve some form of agricultural exemption in its laws and intended for that exemption to carry into the sip.therefore,the epa interpretation of sb and its decision to correct its approval were reasonable and pass arbitrary and capricious review.
in sum,this court holds that the epa reasonably determined that california was inconsistent with the nsr rules.it was appropriate and reasonable for the epa to rely on the interpretations of the attorney general and carb when determining that the ambiguous california law provided certain exemptions that were not accounted for in the nsr rules the epa made a rational connection between the attorney general and carb interpretations,the purposes of the caa,and the choice it made.burlington truck lines,at.
c.the epa authority under k of the clean air act 
concluding that the epa reasonably decided it made an error that needed revising,we now address whether the epa had the statutory authority to correct the error in the way that it did.whether k of the caa gives the epa authority to retroactively revise the scope of an earlier approval of a state nsr rules presents a question of first impression.
the eleventh circuit has previously considered the epa action taken under k,but it did not interpret the meaning of the provisions in question.alabama envtl.council adm r,epa,cir determining that the epa had not made an error determination as required by the act.
section k reads 
whenever the epa determines that its action approving,disapproving,or promulgating any plan was in error,the epa may in the same manner as the approval,disapproval,or promulgation revise such action as appropriate without requiring further submissions from the state.such determination and the basis thereof shall be provided to the state and public.
k emphasis added.
this broad provision was enacted to provide the epa with an avenue to correct its own erroneous actions and grant the epa the discretion to decide when to act pursuant to the provision.see alabama envtl.council,at through the use of the terms whenever and may,section k confers discretion on the epa to decide if and when it will invoke the statute to revise a prior action.see also,discussing congress implementation of k to overturn a third circuit decision that held that the epa inherent authority to correct errors was narrow and could be used only to correct typograph
