facts and procedural history 
the forest service designed the angora project in response to damage caused by the angora fire,which consumed over acres of land.the forest service lake tahoe basin management unit ltbmu manages the affected national forest system land.the ltbmu developed the angora project pursuant to the ltbmu forest plan in an effort to balance the ecological needs of restoring the ecosystem and protecting area residents and visitors from falling trees and future fires.project activities include the removal of certain live and dead trees from portions of the forest.the forest service determined that,if no action was taken,surface fuels would accumulate as dead and damaged trees fall,increasing the risk of another harmful fire that would threaten both local communities and the forest ecosystem.
before implementing the angora project,the forest service prepared an ea and solicited public comment on the ea.the ea discussed the impact of the angora project on various species,including woodpeckers.the ea also responded to some concerns raised in the comments and assessed a alternative and the preferred alternative that the forest service determined would best reduce fuel loads and the severity of future fires.the forest service also briefly considered an option submitted by earth island institute that would limit removal of standing dead trees snags to those greater than inches in diameter.however,the forest service dismissed this alternative,because the agency concluded that this alternative would not effectively accomplish the forest service goals.
subsequently,the forest service issued a decision notice and a finding of no significant impact fonsi,and it approved the proposed project with some modifications.the decision authorized the removal of snags and downed trees and the thinning of live trees on approximately acres.the remaining burned area,consisting of approximately acres,would be left untreated to provide habitat diversity in the forest.
the angora project also creates twelve wildlife snag zones within the treated areas that would be subject to limited or no snag removal in order to address further concerns about providing habitat for species such as the woodpecker.the agency determined that about half of the habitat that is suitable for woodpecker habitat in the relevant area would be retained.the forest service concluded that the project would not lead to a change in the distribution of woodpecker s across the sierra nevada bioregion.
earth island institute and center for biological diversity plaintiffs filed suit over the angora project in,alleging noncompliance with nfma and nepa.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the forest service on all claims.plaintiffs timely appealed the decision.the district court and we both denied plaintiffs motions for an injunction pending appeal.

iii.discussion 
a.the lake tahoe forest plan did not require the forest service to demonstrate at the project level that the angora project would maintain viable population levels of management indicator species,including the woodpecker.
under nfma,the secretary was required to promulgate regulations that set out guidelines and standards to provide for diversity of plant and animal communities based on the suitability and capability of the specific land area g b.accordingly,in the forest service issued planning regulations known as the rule to implement nfma viability requirements.the rule require d the forest service to identify and monitor management indicator species mis and direct ed that fish and wildlife habitat shall be managed to maintain viable populations of existing native and desired vertebrate species.castaneda,at quoting,see also.however,the rule was superseded in.therefore,t he requirements of the superceded r ule apply only to the extent they are incorporated into the relevant forest plan.carlton,at quoting castaneda,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the language of the ltbmu forest plan did not incorporate the rule viability requirements.in carlton,at,we determined that a forest plan almost identical to the ltbmu forest plan did not clearly incorporate the viability requirements,because it did not contain specific provisions regarding wildlife viability.compare id.at management approach will provide the fish and wildlife habitat and other ecological conditions necessary to maintain viable populations of vertebrate species emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted,with ltbmu forest plan,iii the forest service must manage habitat to,at the least,maintain viable populations emphasis added.there is nothing significantly different about the words will and must,and certainly any distinction is not obvious enough that the forest service interpretation can be viewed as plainly inconsistent with the ltbmu forest plan.therefore,carlton requires that we rule in the forest service favor.see also castaneda,at t he presence of a few,isolated provisions cast in mandatory language does not transform an otherwise suggestive set of guidelines into binding agency regulations.quoting terbush united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted utah envtl.cong.richmond,cir holding that the rules were not incorporated because the forest plan did not expressly reference the regulations.
even if the ltbmu forest plan language did incorporate some aspects of the rule viability requirements,any species monitoring requirements for viability were expressly incorporated only at the planning level rather than the project level nfma and its implementing regulations provide for forest planning and management at two levels the forest level and at the individual project level.see ohio forestry ass sierra club,d.at the forest level,the agency develops a forest plan,which is a broad,planning document for an administrative unit of the national forest system.a forest plan establishes goals and objectives for management of forest resources.g.here,the relevant forest plan is the ltbmu forest plan.at the project level,projects must be consistent with the applicable forest plan.id.i idaho sporting cong.rittenhouse,cir.here,the relevant project is the angora project.
plaintiffs argue that the language in the ltbmu forest plan discussing the forest service obligation to manage habitat to,at the least,maintain viable populations of existing native and desired nonnative species incorporates the rule viability requirements.ltbmu forest plan,iii however,none of the language on which plaintiffs rely contradicts the forest service argument that any requirements regarding the monitoring and assessment of population trends have only been incorporated at the planning level.in fact,one of the provisions from the amendment to the forest plan cited by plaintiffs specifically disavows such a requirement.it states,t he viability requirements at the planning area scale are described under the first paragraph of the cfr these have already been met in each forest plan,as revised.amendment feis,emphasis added.for project level analysis t here is no requirement to track trends of species to evaluate viability.id.
in response,the forest service also cites to other provisions that illustrate that the agency only duty with respect to mis is to ensure that the project record contain s a discussion of the effects of the alternatives on the mis habitat s that will be directly affected by the forest service action.amendment record of decision,see also id.at the sole mis requirement that is applied at the project level is the assessment of habitat for mis there are no mis monitoring requirements in the project area or at the project level.therefore,because the forest service determined that the angora project would not significantly impact the woodpecker habitat,the forest service complied with any viability requirements.
plaintiffs reply,arguing that the passages relied on by the forest service only refer to monitoring,and that the forest service should still be required to analyze the quantity and quality of habitat necessary to support the woodpecker.however,this argument misunderstands the relationship between monitoring and viability trend assessment requirements.to understand this relationship,one must analyze the language of,and our case law analyzing this regulation.we agree with the plaintiffs that the text of the regulation requires that f ish and wildlife habitat shall be managed to maintain viable populations of existing species in the planning area.c.but one of the primary methods,through which the regulation requires that this viability management be accomplished,is through the monitoring of population trends of management indicator species.the regulation states 
to meet this viability goal,management planning for the fish and wildlife resource shall meet the following requirements certain species present in the area shall be identified and selected as management indicator species population trends of the management indicator species will be monitored and relationships to habitat changes determined.
id.a,emphasis added.
where a forest plan requires the forest service to monitor population trends at the project level,our case law has allowed the forest service to substitute direct monitoring of the species population trends with an analysis of the type and quantity of habitat that is necessary to support that species.this is sometimes referred to as habitat monitoring,or the approach.for instance,in native ecosystems council forest service,we explained that the forest service knowledge of what quality and quantity of habitat is necessary to support the indicator species can be used as a proxy for population monitoring of the management indicator species,cir id.at we have,in appropriate cases,allowed the forest service to avoid studying the population trends of the indicator species by using indicator species habitat as a proxy for indicator species population trends in a proxy on proxy approach.internal quotation marks omitted accord native ecosystems council tidwell,cir the approach effectively allows the forest service to avoid studying the population trends of the indicator species by using indicator species habitat as a proxy for indicator species population trends.internal quotation marks omitted.
thus,it is contradictory for plaintiffs to admit in their briefs and at oral argument that monitoring is not required,but then to argue that the forest service must still analyze the quantity and quality of habitat necessary to support the woodpecker,because that type of analysis is monitoring habitat monitoring,to be specific.see alliance for wild rockies kimbell,app x,cir describing habitat monitoring where the forest service describes the quantity and quality of habitat that is necessary to sustain the viability of the species group in question alteration in original omitted internal quotation marks omitted.
it is also unsurprising that plaintiffs are unable to cite to any case where the forest plan expressly disavowed a monitoring requirement at the project level,and yet the court still required the forest service to engage in habitat monitoring by identifying the appropriate quantity and quality of mis habitat.indeed,in tidwell,this court explained that the result aimed at establishing species population trends is only required in situations such as where the forest plan requires monitoring of the mis.at.the forest plan in tidwell was markedly different from the ltbmu forest plan,because it required monitoring without limiting this requirement to the planning level.see id.at viable populations of all existing wildlife species will be maintained by providing a diversity of habitats throughout the forest.wildlife indicator species have been identified and will be monitored to ensure that assumptions concerning the effects of management activities on wildlife habitat and populations are appropriate.emphasis added.thus,because monitoring is equivalent to either analyzing viable population trends or describing the quality and quantity of habitat necessary to sustain the viability of the woodpecker,lands council ii,at,and because the ltbmu forest plan expressly disavows this requirement at the project level,the forest service decision to not engage in that analysis for the angora project was not arbitrary and capricious.
indeed,we have already rejected very similar arguments in earth island institute carlton,in which the same plaintiff challenged another forest service project.at.the carlton court analyzed the language of the amendment to the forest plan and determined that the viability requirement pertains to the planning area,not the project area at issue in this case.id.at emphasis added.in reaching this conclusion,we analyzed virtually identical language to the language from the amendment to the sierra nevada framework plan in this case.compare carlton,at the sole mis requirement that is applied at the project level is the assessment of habitat for mis and there are no monitoring requirements for mis at the project level internal quotation marks omitted,with amendment record of decision,the sole mis requirement that is applied at the project level is the assessment of habitat for mis there are no mis monitoring requirements in the project area or at the project level.
plaintiffs attempt to distinguish carlton by arguing that the case analyzed only subsequent,amendments and said nothing about whether an individual forest plan contains a viability requirement.we do not find that distinction persuasive,because the issue in carlton was still whether these amendments had incorporated the rule into a specific forest plan.carlton,at.moreover,the analysis in carlton was not based on the type of document it was analyzing,but rather the type of language in the amendments.we made clear that the general viability language was not enough to incorporate the rules.id.plaintiff argument is further belied by the dissent in carlton,which discussed the binding effect of the viability language in the amendments on the individual forest plan at issue.id.at reinhardt,dissenting the forest service decision to simply ignore a binding viability requirement in the plumas national forest plan violates the nfma.
plaintiffs cite to lands council ii and castaneda in support of their arguments.but neither of these cases control the outcome here,because they only discussed the method for agencies to comply with viability assessment requirements,rather than the threshold for when an agency is required to comply with these requirements.see lands council ii,at the parties did not contest the forest plan requirement to manage the habitat of species that were listed to prevent further declines in populations the parties merely contested whether these duties had been fulfilled internal quotation marks omitted castaneda,at the parties did not contest the forest service requirement to measure p opulation levels of dependent species to m aintain viable population s of dependent species the parties merely contested whether these duties had been fulfilled alterations in original internal quotation marks omitted 
plaintiffs also argue that the forest service interpretation would allow projects to not comply with governing forest plans,which would contravene i.see also lands council ii,at after a forest plan is developed,all subsequent agency action,including plans must comply with the nfma and be consistent with the governing forest plan.however,the forest service interpretation is consistent with any viability requirements at the planning level in the ltbmu forest plan.though the forest service was not required to engage in monitoring either of habitat or indicator species at the project level,the forest service did engage in other viability management activities for the woodpeckers by disclosing the impacts the angora project will have on the woodpecker habitat.
in the final ea,the forest service explained that the angora project would not alter the existing trend in the ecosystem component,nor would it lead to a change in the distribution of woodpecker across the sierra nevada bioregion.furthermore,the ea discusses the amount of habitat that would be affected by treatment,and the amount of habitat in the left to the woodpecker.the ea also explains the many ways that the forest service monitors the woodpecker at the planning level.the ea notes that the forest service analysis was informed by both habitat and distribution population monitoring data that occurs at the planning level 
in lands council ii,at,we recognized that these types of activities fulfilled the viability requirements.for instance,we noted the fact that m onitoring surveys at the planning confirm ed that owls are using and were present in their historic habitat areas.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.also similar to this case,we noted the forest service conclusion that the owls would be able to maintain their current distribution also fulfilled viability requirements.id.at emphasis added.in addition,as here,the forest service conclusion that the agency action would not contribute to a trend toward a federal listing under the endangered species act also fulfilled viability requirements.id.at.
finally,even assuming there is ambiguity about whether the ltbmu forest plan incorporated the viability requirements,the forest service is entitled to deference to its interpretation of its own forest plans,unless the interpretation is plainly inconsistent with a forest plan.native ecosystems council,at castaneda,at if there is ambiguity we defer to the forest service reasonable interpretation of the forest plan requirements.a court will conclude that the forest service acts arbitrarily and capriciously only when the record plainly demonstrates that the forest service made a clear error in judgment in concluding that a project meets the requirements of the nfma and relevant forest plan.lands council ii,at.
reviewing the ltbmu forest plan requirements with deference to the agency,and given the absence of case law in support of plaintiff arguments,the forest service surely did not make a clear error in judgment in concluding that the ltbmu forest plan did not require it to assess the quantity and quality of habitat necessary to support the woodpecker at the project level.id.at.as a result,the forest service actions of discussing the impact of the angora project on the woodpecker habitat were not arbitrary and capricious under nfma.such a holding comports with our reluctance to require an agency to show us,by any particular means,that it has met the requirements of nfma every time it proposes action.id.at.
b.the angora project ea was not arbitrary and capricious under nepa.
nepa sets forth procedural rather than substantive requirements for agency.nepa seeks to ensure that agencies will make informed decisions about the environmental effects of proposed federal actions and to make this information available to the public.see castaneda,at.pursuant to nepa implementing regulations,an agency may prepare an ea to determine whether a proposed action may significantly affect the quality of the environment such that the agency needs to prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement eis.see b.an ea is a concise public document that b riefly provide s sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an eis or a finding of no significant impact fonsi.id.a see also bering strait citizens for responsible res.dev.army corps of eng rs,cir.
the forest service analysis of environmental effects in the angora project ea was not arbitrary and capricious under nepa,because the agency did not fail to ensure the scientific integrity of the final ea,properly respond to dissenting scientific opinion,properly consider proposed alternatives to the angora project in the final ea,or take the requisite hard look at the impacts of the angora project.
scientific integrity 
nepa requires that a gencies shall insure the professional integrity including scientific integrity,of the discussions and analyses in environmental impact statements.by its terms,this regulation only applies to preparation of an eis,but the forest service does not dispute that this scientific integrity requirement applied to their ea.therefore,we assume without deciding that this requirement does in fact apply to the angora project ea.
the ea assertion about woodpecker distribution is as follows d ata indicate that the woodpecker continue to be distributed across the sierra nevada current data at the rangewide,california,and sierra nevada scales indicate that the distribution of woodpecker populations in the sierra nevada is stable.these data were gathered by monitoring that takes place at various sample locations by avian point counts,spot mapping,and breeding bird survey protocols.
plaintiffs argue that the forest service failed to ensure the scientific integrity of the final ea by misrepresenting the facts regarding trends in the woodpecker population.however,this argument is based on an incorrect premise,because the agency was citing the studies primarily in regard to the historic geographic distribution of woodpeckers rather than population trend statistics.though the forest service listed a population trend index and noted the credibility problems with the data,the forest service was primarily making a claim about the geographic distribution of the woodpecker and whether the distribution was stable.
