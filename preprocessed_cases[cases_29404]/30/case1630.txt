in this case,we consider whether an airport land use commission conducted sufficient environmental review pursuant to the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et when it adopted a land use compatibility plan that embraces existing restrictions on residential housing development for a large area near an air force base.we conclude the commission adoption of the plan fell within an exemption from ceqa for projects that have no potential to cause a significant effect on the environment.see guidelines for implementation of cal.environmental quality act,tit,subd.b.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeal,which remanded for further proceedings.
background 
solano county airport land use commission commission was established,pursuant to the state aeronautics act pub,et,for the purposes of ensuring the orderly expansion of airports and promulgating appropriate land use measures in solano county,subd.a.
the commission first adopted a land use plan for the travis air force base area in,amending it in.in,the commission determined that preparation of a new plan was appropriate owing to changes in current and reasonably foreseeable aircraft operations at travis air force base,as well as development in the surrounding areas.in,the commission adopted by resolution the travis air force base land use compatibility plan talup that is the subject of this litigation.the commission resolution stated that based on advice provided by its legal counsel,the commission finds that the talup is not a project subject to ceqa because it would not cause a direct physical change or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment.
the talup sets forth land use compatibility policies applicable to future development in the vicinity of travis air force base.the policies are designed to ensure that future land uses in the surrounding area will be compatible with the realistically foreseeable,ultimate potential aircraft activity at the base and are intended to be reflected in the general plans and other policy instruments adopted by the entities having jurisdiction over land uses near the base.
the talup also sets forth criteria for determining the compatibility with travis air force base activities and mission of possible future development in several geographic zones.this litigation has centered on the talup regulation of compatibility zone c,which the talup defines to encompass locations exposed to potential noise from the base in excess of approximately db cnel together with additional areas occasionally affected by concentrated numbers of aircraft overflights,excluding developed residential areas within existing city limits.although the talup does not provide precise acreage or square mile measurements,maps included in the plan make clear that compatibility zone c covers a large land area within solano county,an area muzzy ranch represents to be greater than square miles extending more than miles through solano county.
the talup purports to restrict residential development within compatibility zone c to levels currently permitted under existing general plans and zoning regulations.specifically,the talup states that n o amendment of a general plan land use policy or land use map designation and no change of zoning shall be permitted if such amendment or change would allow more dwelling units in the affected area than are allowed under current zoning.
five days after adopting the talup,the commission filed with the clerk of solano county a notice of exemption,citing public resources code section,subdivision b,and declaring that the commission action created n o possibility of significant effect on the environment.
muzzy ranch muzzy ranch is a limited partnership holding ownership interests in more than acres within the area affected by the talup.following the commission adoption of the talup,muzzy ranch filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory relief,contending that the adoption of the talup violated ceqa.the trial court denied the petition and entered judgment for the commission.the court of appeal reversed,remanding with directions that the trial court issue a writ of mandate ordering the commission to set aside its adoption of the talup.we granted the commission petition for review.
discussion 
in order to e nsure that the protection of the environment,consistent with the provision of a decent home and suitable living environment for every californian,shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions pub.resources code,subd.d,ceqa and its implementing administrative regulations ceqa guidelines establish a process to ensure that public agencies inform their decisions with environmental considerations.no oil,city of los angeles cal d.the first tier is jurisdictional,requiring that an agency conduct a preliminary review to determine whether an activity is subject to ceqa.ceqa guidelines,see pub.resources code.an activity that is not a project as defined in the public resources code see and the ceqa guidelines see is not subject to ceqa.ceqa guidelines,subd.c.
the second tier concerns exemptions from ceqa review.the legislature has provided that certain projects,such as ministerial projects and repairs to public service facilities of an emergency nature,are exempt.pub.resources code,subd.b,ceqa guidelines,subd.b.in addition,pursuant to the legislature command see pub.resources code,subd.a,the ceqa guidelines list categorical exemptions or classes of projects that the resources agency has determined to be exempt per se because they do not have a significant effect on the environment.ceqa guidelines,et see,subd.b.
a project that qualifies for neither a statutory nor a categorical exemption may nonetheless be found exempt under what is sometimes called the common sense exemption,which applies w here it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the environment ceqa guidelines,subd.b.see generally davidon homes city of san jose th,d.
if a public agency properly finds that a project is exempt from ceqa,no further environmental review is necessary.no oil,city of los angeles,supra,cal d at.the agency need only prepare and file a notice of exemption see ceqa guidelines,subd.d,subd.a,citing the relevant statute or section of the ceqa guidelines and including a brief statement of reasons to support the finding of exemption,subd.a.if a project does not fall within an exemption,the agency must conduct an initial study to determine if the project may have a significant effect on the environment,subd.a.if there exists no substantial evidence that the project or any of its aspects may cause a significant effect on the environment,subd.b,the agency must prepare a negative declaration that briefly describes the reasons supporting its determination see,et.
ceqa third tier applies if the agency determines substantial evidence exists that an aspect of the project may cause a significant effect on the environment.in that event,the agency must ensure that a full environmental impact report is prepared on the proposed project.ceqa guidelines,subd.b see also pub.resources code,ceqa guidelines,et.
muzzy ranch objections to the commission proceedings in this case focus on the first and second tiers of the ceqa process.with respect to the first jurisdictional tier,muzzy ranch contends that in its resolution adopting the talup,the commission erred in concluding that adopting the talup was not subject to ceqa.with respect to the second exemptions tier,muzzy ranch contends the commission violated ceqa by failing to examine the potential environmental impacts of its adopting the talup before filing its notice of exemption claiming the common sense exemption.ceqa guidelines,subd.b.
our inquiry into whether the commission has complied with ceqa extends only to whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.pub.resources code.in a ceqa case,as in other mandamus cases,our review of the administrative record for error is the same as the trial court we review the agency action,not the trial court decision.county of amador el dorado county water agency th,d friends of the old trees of forestry fire protection th,d.throughout,we must bear in mind that t he foremost principle under ceqa is that the legislature intended the act to be interpreted in such manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language.laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal d.
first tier 
whether an activity constitutes a project subject to ceqa is a categorical question respecting whether the activity is of a general kind with which ceqa is concerned,without regard to whether the activity will actually have environmental impact.thus,for ceqa purposes,p roject means an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment,or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment,and which is any of the following a an activity directly undertaken by any public agency.b an activity undertaken by a person which is supported,in whole or in part,through contracts,grants,subsidies,loans,or other forms of assistance from one or more public agencies.c an activity that involves the issuance to a person of a lease,permit,license,certificate,or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies.pub.resources code.whether an activity is a project is an issue of law that can be decided on undisputed data in the record on appeal.fullerton joint union high school dist.state bd.of education cal d,questioned on another point in board of supervisors local agency formation com.cal th,d.
here,we are concerned only with public resources code section,subdivision a.that the commission is a public agency and in adopting the talup it engaged in an activity within the meaning of ceqa is undisputed.the question is whether the commission adoption of the talup is the sort of activity that may cause a direct physical change or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment pub.resources code,so as to constitute a project.
the commission maintains it is not.the commission contends that,as a matter of law,it had no duty to consider any displaced development the talup might generate by freezing residential densities in compatibility zone c,because such displacement is inherently too speculative to be considered a reasonably foreseeable effect of an airport land use compatibility plan.the commission further argues that because the talup merely advises the jurisdictions it affects,it can not be the legal cause of environmental changes that result if the jurisdictions follow its advice.we disagree on both counts.
displaced development 
the population of california is ever increasing.our legislature has declared that t he availability of housing is of vital statewide importance,and the early attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every california family is a priority of the highest order,subd.a.in order to assure that cities and counties recognize their responsibilities in contributing to the attainment of the state housing goal,subd.a,the legislature requires that local jurisdictions in their land use planning identify adequate sites for housing and make adequate provision for the existing and projected needs of all economic segments of the community,including the locality share of the regional housing need,subd.a.thus,no california locality is immune from the legal and practical necessity to expand housing due to increasing population pressures.
depending on the circumstances,a government agency may reasonably anticipate that its placing a ban on development in one area of a jurisdiction may have the consequence,notwithstanding existing zoning or land use planning,of displacing development to other areas of the jurisdiction.zoning,as california courts recognize,is subject to change,and amendment of a general plan is not a rare occurrence.stanislaus audubon society,county of stanislaus th,d.t he planning and zoning amendment process has become in many communities one of piecemeal adjustment by local planners and local legislators in response to development pressures.devita county of napa cal th,d.
that further governmental decisions need to be made before a land use measure actual environmental impacts can be determined with precision does not necessarily prevent the measure from qualifying as a project.for example,in fullerton joint union high school dist.state bd.of education,supra,cal d at pages,we considered whether the state board of education violated ceqa in approving a county committee plan to form a new school district by dividing an existing one.we concluded that the board of education should have undertaken at least an initial environmental study of the secession plan likely environmental impacts before approving it.fullerton at.in so doing,we expressly rejected the board argument that its approval was not a ceqa project merely because further decisions must be made before schools are actually constructed,bus routes changed,and pupils reassigned.fullerton at.that the board approval of the plan was an essential step leading to potential environmental impacts,including construction of a new high school,was sufficient.fullerton at.nor was the board approval exempt from ceqa merely because it had to be ratified by the voters.fullerton at.
as earlier noted,the definition of project for ceqa purposes is not limited to agency activities that demonstrably will impact the environment.ceqa does not speak of projects which will have a significant effect,but those which may have such effect.no oil,city of los angeles,supra,cal d at,fn.thus,contrary to the commission suggestion,nothing inherent in the notion of displaced development places such development,when it can reasonably be anticipated,categorically outside the concern of ceqa.
nonbinding advice 
the commission repeatedly characterizes the talup as containing merely recommendations,requests or advice to the affected jurisdictions.in so doing,the commission errs.the talup speaks in mandatory terms.the talup,by its terms,d efines the responsibilities of affected jurisdictions to modify their general plans and other policies for consistency with commission policies and to submit certain land use development actions to the commission for review.it provides that the county of solano and its affected cities shall utilize the talup as the basis for a m odifying their respective general plans,zoning ordinances,and other local land use policies to assure that future land use development will be compatible with aircraft operations and b m aking planning decisions regarding specific development proposals involving the lands impacted by aircraft activity.
pursuant to the statutory scheme authorizing it,the talup carries significant,binding regulatory consequences for local government in solano county.see,pub.government code section,subdivision a specifies that at all times a county or city general plan,as well as any applicable specific plans,shall be consistent with an airport land use commission plan and that every affected county and city must amend its general and specific plans as necessary to keep them consistent with an applicable commission plan,subd.b any local agency seeking to amend its general plan in a way that affects an area governed by an airport land use compatibility plan must first refer its proposed action to the responsible commission for a determination whether the proposed action is consistent with the airport land use plan.if the commission determines the amendment is not consistent,the agency may not enact it unless a supermajority of the agency governing body votes to override the commission disapproval and the agency makes specific findings that its proposed action is consistent with the purposes of the state aeronautics act,subd.b.thus,even in the event a local authority invokes the override provision,the state aeronautics act scheme still controls.
as muzzy ranch observes,under these statutes an airport land use compatibility plan can operate like a multijurisdictional general plan to trump the land use planning authority that affected jurisdictions might otherwise exercise throug
