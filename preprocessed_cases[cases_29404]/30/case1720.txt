plaintiff banning ranch conservancy appeals from the denial of its petition for a writ of mandate directing the city of newport beach city to vacate certification of an environmental impact report eir for the development of sunset ridge park.
plaintiff contends the eir wrongly defined the project to exclude the pending residential and commercial development on an adjacent property,banning ranch.it claims the park and development are one interrelated project to which the city is giving improper piecemeal review.
in addition,plaintiff asserts the eir was substantively inadequate in five ways.it contends the eir insufficiently analyzed the park cumulative traffic impact,impact,cumulative biological impact,impact on the california gnatcatcher habitat,and consistency with the california coastal act of coastal act pub.resource code,et.
we disagree with plaintiff contentions,and affirm.first,the eir project definition properly excluded the neighboring development,which is not a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the park.the two are separate projects with different proponents,serving different purposes.second,the eir adequately analyzes the park environmental impact.substantial evidence supports its conclusions,and the city did not prejudicially abuse its discretion by approving it.
the park,banning ranch,and the general plan 
the city bought land at the northwest corner of west coast highway and superior avenue in.the parcel is roughly.the anvil base faces roughly southwest,and runs along west coast highway.a scenic easement bars pavement or structures over the southern portion.the horn of the anvil the protruding part faces roughly southeast,and runs along a curved section of superior avenue.the top of the anvil faces roughly northeast and borders a residential neighborhood of the city.the remaining side of the anvil,opposite the horn,faces west.
this western boundary abuts property commonly known as banning ranch,which is controlled by newport banning ranch llc nbr llc.banning ranch covers over primarily undeveloped acres previously used for oil production.the property is roughly.its northern boundary runs contiguous to street in costa mesa,and largely borders a regional park.the northern half of its western boundary runs parallel to the santa ana river.the southern half of its western boundary curves south and east,approaching west coast highway.the property southern boundary runs along west coast highway.the southernmost section of the property eastern border abuts the city parcel.
also in,the city adopted a general plan to achieve the vision of what residents want newport beach to be now and in.the general plan focuses on conserving the existing pattern of land uses,and establishes strategies for the enhancement and revitalization of areas of the city that are not achieving their full potential.reaching beyond lands within the jurisdiction of the city of newport beach,the general plan also specifies policies for the adopted sphere of influence soi,encompassing banning ranch,which represent the city intentions for conservation and development of the property should it be annexed to newport beach.until that time,uses and improvements of the property are subject to the county of orange general plan.
in the introduction,the general plan states the city will s upport efforts to acquire banning ranch for permanent open space.but failing that,the general plan contemplates developing banning ranch.land use policy of the land use element provides,prioritize the acquisition of banning ranch as an open space amenity for the community and region,consolidating oil operations,enhancing wetland and other habitats,and providing parkland amenities to serve nearby neighborhoods.if the property can not be acquired within a time period and pursuant to terms agreed to by the city and property owner,allow for the development of a compact residential village that preserves the majority of the site as open space and restores critical habitat similarly,a policy overview provides,the general plan prioritizes the acquisition of banning ranch as an open space amenity for the community and region.oil operations would be consolidated,wetlands restored,nature education and interpretative facilities provided,and an active park developed containing playfields and other facilities to serve residents of adjoining neighborhoods.should the property not be fully acquired as open space,the plan provides for the development of a concentrated residential village that retains the majority of the property as open space.
the general plan states the city intends to c onstruct the circulation system described on the map entitled newport beach circulation element master plan of streets and highways the master plan of streets and highways indicates two unbuilt primary roads on banning ranch.one road starts on west coast highway and proceeds north before curving east.the other starts on west coast highway and winds north all the way to street.the orange county transportation authority master plan of arterial highways shows different potential roads crossing banning ranch.
the newport banning ranch nbr project 
in march,the city announced it was acting as the lead agency to prepare an eir for the newport banning ranch project it reported in its notice of preparation the newport banning ranch project project proposes the development of up to residential dwelling units,square feet of commercial uses,and overnight resort accommodations on a project site of approximately acres.because a majority of the project site is located in the unincorporated orange county area a s a part of the project,these unincorporated areas would be annexed to the city.
the city reported the nbr development would be constructed from south to north,starting in the southern portion of the project site closest to west coast highway.yet p ublic access to the project does not currently exist.
thus,the nbr project needed an access road.the city stated t he primary entrance to the project site is proposed from west coast highway,which may require the widening of a portion of the northern side of west coast highway.it described bluff road.as a part of the project,bluff road would be constructed from a southern terminus at west coast highway to a northern terminus at street bluff road would serve as the primary roadway through the project site the implementation of bluff road may be phased.the road would be a primary arterial,which is usually a,divided roadway designed to accommodate a typical daily capacity of vehicles per day.
and in the notice of preparation,the city repeatedly referred to its plans to build a park.its description of banning ranch neighbors included t he city of newport beach proposed sunset ridge park,located contiguous to the project site southeastern boundary.sunset ridge park is conspicuously labeled on the surrounding land uses diagram.the park is identified on the conceptual master land use plan,which also shows the planned location for bluff road labeled north bluff road and south bluff road.finally,the city stated,access into the city of newport beach proposed sunset ridge park is proposed from bluff road within the project site.
the sunset ridge park project 
two months after the city issued the nbr notice of preparation,it issued a notice of preparation for the park project.it propose d to develop the approximate acre site with active and passive recreational uses and an access road to the park through newport banning ranch.the access road would be constructed from west coast highway to sunset ridge park through the newport banning ranch site of the acres.the city further described the access road it would build as a part of the project,a park access road would be constructed from west coast highway through newport banning ranch a private property to the park.use of this adjacent property would require an access easement from the property owner as part of the proposed project,the city proposes the widening of a portion of the northern side of west coast highway from superior avenue to a point west of the access road additionally,the city is proposing a signal on west coast highway at the proposed access road.
the site plan shows the planned park,the access road,and what appears to be the property line between the city parcel and banning ranch.only once in the park notice of preparation does the city disclose that banning ranch is proposed for development by newport banning ranch.
the city issued its draft eir for the park project in october.it retained bonterra consulting to prepare the draft eir the same consultant preparing the eir for the nbr project.
the draft eir analyzed the park access road.it noted the road would extend northward from west coast highway for about feet,and then would follow a alignment for about feet to connect to the park parking lot.the road for the most part would be constructed as a foot wide undivided roadway with travel lanes.it projected the park would generate vehicle trips daily.
the draft eir also analyzed the proposed signal on west coast highway.it noted the general plan already assumes a roadway extension north through the newport banning ranch property to street,with additional connections at and street with or without development of that property.the park access road would also serve as one of the access points from the public street system to any future development on the newport banning ranch property widening of the park access road would be required.because the general plan designates the newport banning ranch property as open village,the signal warrants were conducted for general plan buildout under both general plan scenarios for the newport banning ranch property.whether banning ranch is used as open space or developed as a residential village,t he estimated average daily traffic volume on the park access road approach to west coast highway is forecasted to exceed the minimum volume requirements at least vehicles per day warranting a traffic signal.
plaintiff submitted comments to the city during the public review period.plaintiff planning consultant contended the draft eir had piecemealed the project by fail ing to fully acknowledge the full extent of the project.she noted it appears that the park access road in the draft eir for the park and the bluff road in the nbr notice of preparation are one and the same.the planning consultant further asserted the draft eir failed to analyze the park impacts.plaintiff biological consultant commented the draft eir failed to detect up to a of wetlands and fail ed to evaluate the significance that the entire project site is designated as critical habitat for the california gnatcatcher 
the city responded to the public comments and prepared a final eir.in a series of topical responses,the city addressed concerns about the access road and the nbr project.the city conceded the proposed sunset ridge park project and the proposed newport banning ranch project assume the generally same roadway alignment from west coast highway.it also acknowledge d that the proposed park alone would not generate enough traffic to warrant a traffic signal.
but the city respectfully disagree d with commenters who suggested that the proposed newport banning ranch project is a part of the sunset ridge park project and therefore should be analyzed in one eir and as a signal project.it noted both the general plan and the county master plan depict a roadway a,divided roadway through the newport banning ranch property extending from west coast highway to street.the city stated a primary road would be constructed through the newport banning ranch property from west coast highway to street whether the newport banning ranch property is developed in the future or whether it is acquired for open space it asserted that even if banning ranch was used as open space,the general plan provided for nature education and interpretative facilities and an active park containing playfields and other facilities to serve residents of adjoining neighborhoods and the construction of the primary road extending from west coast highway to a connection with an arterial roadway.and under future conditions,with the completion of a road in this location the intersection of the park access road with west coast highway would warrant a signal.
and the city maintained the two projects were distinct.it stated,neither the proposed sunset ridge park project nor the proposed newport banning ranch project must be approved or constructed in order for one or both of the proposed projects to be implemented.neither the sunset ridge park project eir nor the newport banning ranch project eir,the latter under preparation,assumes that any component of either project has been implemented.
in specific response to plaintiff piecemealing objection,the city claimed the banning ranch easement for the park access road is intended to be independent and does not presuppose development by the newport banning ranch applicant.the city council passed a resolution certifying the final eir at a public hearing on march.
at the same hearing,the city also approved an access agreement between it and nbr llc.the recitals provided the p arties desire to enter into this access agreement to facilitate city economical and efficient development of sunset ridge park while not precluding nbrllc access to and economical and efficient use of the nbr property.nbr llc agreed to grant a nonexclusive easement to the city to build and maintain an access road to the park.
in exchange for the banning ranch easement,the city agreed to design and construct the access road improvements from west coast highway to the park to match the proposed vertical and horizontal alignment of the east side of the proposed bluff road.the agreement provided the city preferred route for gaining access to the park will be pursuant to the route reference in the park project eir as eir option but if conditions require the access road improvements be built according to any alignment,other than eir option,the city agreed to the future relocation of all portions of the access road improvements that are not on the ultimate alignment of bluff road.the city agreed to construct t he proposed bluff road and west coast highway intersection and,with caltrans approval,the city will install a new signal at bluff road and west coast highway.further,the city will widen and improve the northerly side of west coast highway from superior road to bluff road to its ultimate general plan width to accommodate a double left turn lane on eastbound west coast highway as part of the project.the city agreed to provide completed drawings,plans and calculations and final engineering and landscaping plans for the proposed access road improvements on the easement area to nbrllc for review,comment,and approval.
plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of mandate in april,and later filed a supplemental petition.the court denied the petition in may.it found substantial evidence supports the city finding that the ceqa review could be limited to the park itself.the court finds that the eir properly focused on the park project and that there was no improper.it further found substantial evidence showed there was no cumulative effect of impact for the eir to address.and it concluded substantial evidence supported the city biological eir and mitigation proposals.
discussion 
ceqa,eirs,and piecemealing 
the foremost principle under ceqa is that the legislature intended the act to be interpreted in such manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language.laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal d,laurel heights.
with narrow exceptions,ceqa requires an eir whenever a public agency proposes to approve or to carry out a project that may have a significant effect on the environment.laurel heights,supra,cal d at.a n eir is an informational document id.at.its purpose is to provide public agencies and the public in general with detailed information about the effect which a proposed project is likely to have on the environment to list ways in which the significant effects of such a project might be minimized and to indicate alternatives to such a project.ibid.
project is a term of art.ceqa broadly defines a project as an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment,or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment,and that involves the issuance to a person of a lease,permit,license,certificate,or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies.citation.the statutory definition is augmented by the guidelines,tit,et,which define a project as the whole of an action,which has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment,or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment tuolumne county citizens for responsible growth,city of sonora th,tuolumne county.
under ceqa,the public is notified that a draft eir is being prepared citations,and the draft eir is evaluated in light of comments received.citations.the lead agency then prepares a final eir incorporating comments on the draft eir and the agency responses to significant environmental points raised in the review process.citations.the lead agency must certify that the final eir has been completed in compliance with ceqa and that the information in the final eir was considered by the agency before approving the project.citation.before approving the project,the agency must also find either that the project significant environmental effects identified in the eir have been avoided or mitigated,or that unmitigated effects are outweighed by the project benefits.laurel heights,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.
the eir is the primary means of achieving the legislature considered declaration that it is the policy of this state to take all action necessary to protect,rehabilitate,and enhance the environmental quality of the state.citation.the eir is therefore the heart of ceqa.citations.an eir is an environmental alarm bell whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached ecological points of no return.laurel heights,supra,cal d at.
consequently,like so many other matters in life,timing in eir preparation is essential.berkeley keep jets over the bay com.board of port cmrs.th,berkeley jets.an eir should be prepared as early as feasible in the planning process to enable environmental considerations to influence project program and design and yet late enough to provide meaningful information for environmental assessment.laurel heights,supra,cal d at.t he later the environmental review process begins,the more bureaucratic and financial momentum there is behind a proposed project,thus providing a strong incentive to ignore environmental concerns that could be dealt with more easily at an early stage of the project.this problem may be exacerbated where,as here,the public agency prepares and approves the eir for its own project.ibid.environmental review which comes too late runs the risk of being simply a burdensome reconsideration of decisions already made and becoming the sort of post hoc rationalization to support action already taken,which our high court disapproved in laurel heights.berkeley jets,supra,th at.
accordingly,ceqa forbids piecemeal review of the significant environmental impacts of a project.berkeley jets,supra,th at.agencies can not allow environmental considerations to become submerged by chopping a large project into many little ones each with a minimal potential impact on the environment which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences.bozung,supra,cal d at pp.eir required when city annexed land for anticipated development.
the california supreme court set forth a piecemealing test in laurel heights.we hold that an eir must include an analysis of the environmental effects of future expansion or other action if it is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the initial project and the future expansion or action will be significant in that it will likely change the scope or nature of the initial project or its environmental effects.laurel heights,supra,cal d at.under this standard,the facts of each case will determine whether and to what extent an eir must analyze future expansion or other action.ibid.
applying this test,the laurel heights court held a university wrongly piecemealed the environmental review of the relocation of its pharmacy school.the eir analyzed the school initial move into square feet of a building.laurel heights,supra,cal d at.it failed to discuss the additional environmental effects,if any,that will result from the university use of the remaining square feet when it becomes available after a tenant lease expired.ibid.but school officials had publicly announced their intention to use the whole building.id.at.and t he draft eir acknowledged that the university will occupy the entire laurel heights facility when the remainder of the space becomes available.id.at.thus,the future expansion and general type of future use is reasonably foreseeable and required analysis in the eir.ibid.
this is where the law gets murky.reasonably foreseeable is a familiar concept,but the courts have not comprehensively explored the meaning of consequence in this context.the cases tend to be,as predicted.see laurel heights,supra,cal d at.and the legal analysis can tend toward circularity.see,national parks and conservation county of riverside th,landfill eir could exclude processing plants partly because the design of the landfill treats them as separate projects leonoff monterey county bd.of supervisors d,no piecemealing because t here were two separate projects.the project definition is the starting point of a piecemealing challenge,not the finish line.the whole question is whether the project definition is correct.
the piecemealing case law defies easy harmonization.still,we can group the leading cases by their stated reasoning into some potentially useful categories.
first,there may be improper piecemealing when the purpose of the reviewed project is to be the first step toward future development.see,laurel heights,supra,cal d at university planned to occupy entire building eventually bozung,supra,cal d at city annexed land so it could rezone it for development city of carmel by the sea board of supervisors d,county rezoned land as a necessary first step to approval of a specific development project city of antioch city council d,antioch negative declaration wrongly issued the sole reason city approved road and sewer construction was to provide a catalyst for further development see also id.at c onstruction of the roadway and utilities can not be considered in isolation from the development it presages.
and there may be improper piecemealing when the reviewed project legally compels or practically presumes completion of another action.nelson county of kern th,eir for reclamation plan should have included mining operations that necessitated it tuolumne county,supra,th at home improvement center can not be completed and opened legally without the completion of a road realignment san joaquin rescue center county of stanislaus th,eir for residential development should have included sewer expansion that was a crucial element of development plan for arcadia,arcadia city council d,plan for arcadia shopping center,parking lot,and adjacent road widening should be regarded as a single project.
on the other hand,two projects may properly undergo separate environmental review,no piecemealing when the projects have different proponents,serve different purposes,or can be implemented independently.communities for a better environment city of richmond th,cbe refinery upgrade and construction of pipeline exporting excess hydrogen from upgraded refinery were independently justified separate projects with different project proponents planning conservation league castaic lake water agency th,castaic lake water transfer had significant independent or local utility from broader water supply agreement,and would be implemented with or without it sierra club west side irrigation dist.th,west side irrigation two assignments to city were approved by different independent agencies and could be implemented independently of each other plan for arcadia,supra,d at shopping center eir could exclude road work the city had long before decided would be needed due to new freeway.
the park project is not receiving improper piecemeal review 
plaintiff contends the eir incorrectly defined the project to include only the park and the access road.it asserts the whole of the action includes the nbr project in other words,the park project and the nbr project are one project the city is improperly reviewing in piecemeal fashion.we independently determine whether this is so.see vineyard area citizens for responsible growth,city of rancho cordova cal th,vineyard whether eir should have evaluated the project foreseeable future uses was properly reviewed as a matter of law tuolumne county,supra,th at the question concerning which acts constitute the whole of an action is a question of law cbe,supra,th at applying de novo review to piecemealing claim.
this case meets part of the laurel heights test the nbr project is reasonably foreseeable.laurel heights,supra,cal d at.it is imminent,in fact.nbr llc has already proposed developing banning ranch,and the city is already preparing an eir for the nbr project.these specific,pending plans distinguish cases rejecting piecemealing claims on the ground the future actions were too speculative.see,berkeley jets,supra,th at airport eir could omit future projects that existed only as concepts in plans that were subject to constant revision national parks and conservation county of riverside,supra,th at landfill eir could omit detailed analysis of processing plants because it is not known where the plants will be situated and who will be operating them del mar terrace conservancy,city council th,disapproved on another ground in western states petroleum superior court cal th,fn.highway eir could omit detailed analysis of anticipated,but still contingent,expansion.
and the nbr project will likely change the scope or nature of the initial project or its environmental effects.laurel heights,supra,cal d at.the park project involves widening west coast highway,installing a traffic signal on west coast highway,and constructing a foot,access road for daily use by vehicles.the nbr project will change the scope and nature of the road.it doubles the road width from two lanes to four lanes,extends the first feet of the road to street,and contemplates daily use by thousands of cars 
what remains is that key word consequence.while the nbr project may make reasonably foreseeable changes to the scope and nature of the park project at least to its access road,we must determine whether it is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the initial project.laurel heights,supra,cal d at,italics added.where does the park project fit in among our categories of cases 
to some extent,this case fits in the first step category.when the city issued the park notice of preparation,it knew the nbr project was coming the city had already issued the nbr notice of preparation.both projects need an access road.building the park access road obligates the city to do some work that benefits the nbr project.that includes widening west coast highway,installing a traffic signal at west coast highway to accommodate thousands of vehicles daily,and constructing a section of nbr llc road at their grades,subject to nbr llc approval.all this is reasonably seen as easing the way for the nbr project.
but the park access road is only a baby step toward the nbr project certainly it is a much smaller step than the reviewed actions in the first step cases.the park project does not take the major step of changing banning ranch zoning to accommodate the nbr project.bozung,supra,cal d at annexing land for rezoning and development city of carmel by the sea board of supervisors,supra,d at rezoning land for specific development project.nor is the park being built to induce banning ranch development the nbr project has already been planned.antioch,supra,d at road and sewer was catalyst for future development.the access road furthers the nbr project,but relatively modestly.laurel heights,supra,cal d at initial relocation into of building.expanding the park access road into bluff road will still require an enormous undertaking,doubling the number of lanes and extending it thousands of feet to street.and the nbr project is much more than just bluff road that road will service new residential units,new square feet of commercial space,and a new resort hotel.the access road is consistent with the nbr project,no doubt.but it is a stretch to say the nbr project is a consequence of the access road.
the park project fits more closely into the no piecemealing category.the park project and the nbr project have different project proponents.cbe,supra,th at they serve different purposes,one provides recreational opportunities for existing residents,the other develops a new neighborhood.ibid.independently justified separate projects see also castaic lake,supra,th at reviewed project had significant independent or local utility.and the city can and will build the park regardless of any development on banning ranch.see castaic lake,supra,th at reviewed project intended regardless of whether other project completed west side irrigation,supra,th at projects could be implemented independently of each other.
finally,and importantly,the city general plan calls for construction of bluff road or its equivalent.see plan for arcadia,supra,d at but see tuolumne county,supra,th at.the city intends to build a north and south road from west coast highway to street whether it acquires banning ranch to preserve it as open space or annexes banning ranch as part of the nbr project.
plaintiff contends no roads will be built across banning ranch if it is acquired for open space,but we disagree.the general plan has only one master plan of streets and highways.and it shows two intersecting roads over banning ranch that take the same basic path as the nbr project bluff road except one continues through the parcel to be used for the park.plaintiff correctly notes the general plan eir responded to one comment by stating,if an open space option is ultimately selected and implemented,no roadways would be anticipated upon banning ranch.but that response also referred to a transportation study,which provides the roadways must be built even without development.one of the referenced pages of the study states,if the open space preservation occurs,roadway segments through the property bluff road and street will not be constructed,the relief to superior avenue at coast highway will not be provided by the new connections,and superior avenue at coast highway will experience level of service los e conditions.if the banning ranch property is acquired for open space,superior avenue at coast highway is expected to operate at los e in both the am and pm peak hours without improvements.the study continues,previous analysis has indicated that necessary improvements to achieve acceptable los exceed the existing planned roadway substantially.therefore,a roadway crossing the banning ranch open space would still be required.all that means is this,if no developer builds roads across banning ranch,then unacceptable traffic conditions will occur at superior avenue and west coast highway the current standard for acceptable level of service in the city of newport beach is,and so the roads would need to be built anyway.if bluff road will be built in any event,the nbr project is not a consequence of the park project just because the park access road will accommodate expansion into bluff road.
we conclude the eir adequately defines the project,without inclusion of the nbr project.the park project and the nbr project are separate actions.the city is not giving them improper piecemeal review.
the eir adequately addressed the park project environmental impacts 
even if the eir properly defined the park project,plaintiff contends the eir inadequately analyzed five points the cumulative traffic impact,the impact,the cumulative biological impact,the impact on habitat for the california gnatcatcher,and its consistency with the coastal act.we disagree.
cumulative traffic impact.plaintiff contends the park eir insufficiently addresses the cumulative impact that the park project and nbr project might have on traffic.it notes the draft eir traffic analysis lists the nbr project as one of the cumulative projects,the reasonably foreseeable projects in the park project vicinity that are in various stages of the application and approval process,but have not yet been approved.but the actual cumulative impact analysis fails to account for any traffic from the nbr development.
cumulative impacts analysis evaluates the incremental impact of the project in conjunction with,or collectively with,other closely related past,present,and reasonably foreseeable probable future projects.city of long beach los angeles unified school dist.th,long beach.cumulative impact analysis assesses cumulative damage as a whole greater than the sum of its parts.id.at.t he discussion of cumulative impacts should be guided by the standards of practicality and reasonableness.id.at.
we review an agency decision regarding the inclusion of information in the cumulative impacts analysis under an abuse of discretion standard.the primary determination is whether it was reasonable and practical to include the projects and whether,without their inclusion,the severity and significance of the cumulative impacts were reflected adequately.long beach,supra,th at.ceqa requires an eir to reflect a good faith effort at full disclosure it does not mandate perfection,nor does it require an analysis to be exhaustive.id.at.therefore,n oncompliance with ceqa information disclosure requirements is not per se reversible prejudice must be shown.citations.citations.failure to comply with the information disclosure requirements constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion when the omission of relevant information has precluded informed decisionmaking and informed public participation ibid.
the traffic cumulative impact analysis was reasonable and practical,at least as set forth in the final eir.in a response to public comment on the draft eir,the city stated the park access road was consistent with the general plan.the general plan,as already noted,calls for the construction of bluff road or its equivalent and the general plan eir assumed worst case conditions,including alternate residential and commercial development on the banning ranch property,and analyzed the traffic impact from the proposed bluff road and its intersection with west coast highway.see las virgenes homeowners federation,county of los angeles d,eir met cumulative impact requirement by referencing general plan that necessarily addressed the cumulative impacts of buildout to the maximum possible densities allowed by those plans.additionally,the park eir traffic signal analysis does address the cumulative impact of the park access road and bluff road to some extent.to be sure,the cumulative impact analysis in the park eir could have been set forth more directly.but an eir need not achieve perfection.long beach,supra,th at.the city effort here was adequate.
growth inducing impacts.plaintiff contends the eir astonishingly concludes that the park project will have no impacts,d espite the obvious connections between the sunset ridge park infrastructure and the proposed nbr project.
the eir evaluated t he potential effects of the project in three ways.would the project have an effect on undeveloped land that may not be designated on any general plan for urban development,but would nonetheless experience increased growth pressure due to the presence of the project.would the project have an effect by removing constraints,thereby facilitating the construction of previously approved projects.would the project influence redevelopment of areas at a higher intensity than currently exists it concluded the park would serve an identified need by filling a citywide park deficiency,rather than induce population growth new development in the city it noted the park was compatible with adjacent land uses consistent with the city general plan,coastal land use plan,and zoning designations for the site and would not induce substantial new unforeseeable development in the area.
under ceqa,a public agency is not always required to make a detailed analysis of the impacts of a project on future housing and growth.citation.nothing in the ceqa guidelines,or in the cases,requires more than a general analysis of projected growth.the detail required in any particular case necessarily depends on a multitude of factors,including,but not limited to,the nature of the project,the directness or indirectness of the contemplated impact and the ability to forecast the actual effects the project will have on the physical environment.citation.in addition,it is relevant,although by no means determinative,that future effects will themselves require analysis under ceqa.muzzy ranch solano county airport land use com.cal th,accord clover valley foundation city of rocklin th,clover.
the substantial evidence standard applies to challenges to the scope of an eir analysis of a topic,the methodology used for studying an impact and the reliability or accuracy of the data upon which the eir relied because these types of challenges involve factual questions.citation.substantial evidence is defined as enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion,even though other conclusions might also be reached.bakersfield citizens for local control city of bakersfield th.in reviewing for substantial evidence,the reviewing court may not set aside an agency approval of an eir on the ground that an opposite conclusion would have been equally or more reasonable,for,on factual questions,our task is not to weigh conflicting evidence and determine who has the better argument.vineyard,supra,cal th at.
here,substantial evidence supports the eir conclusion that the park will not have a impact,particularly in regard to the nbr project.most notably,the nbr project was proposed first the park is not inducing it.as our piecemealing analysis showed,the nbr project is not a consequence of the park.see clover,supra,th at no impact because purpose of sewer construction was first to meet the needs of the current project.and the nature of the project is not to facilitate additional development antioch,supra,d at impact because the sole reason to construct the road and sewer project is to provide a catalyst for further development in the immediate area stanislaus audubon society,county of stanislaus th,proposed country club may induce housing development in the surrounding area,which was undeveloped.the park has the independent purpose of providing recreational facilities that,as the eir noted,are badly needed to serve the city existing residents.
other considerations support the eir impact analysis.first,the eir noted the park access road is consistent with the general plan.see clover,supra,th at growth has already been analyzed in the city general plan eir,which the project eir incorporated when it referenced the reader to it friends of the eel river sonoma county water agency th,acceptable for agency,i n considering the growth inducing impacts of the project to incorporate the discussion contained in general plan eir.second,any impact on growth is indirect because the access road removes only one of potentially numerous obstacles and approval requirements for developing the nbr project.clover,at.finally,the nbr project is undergoing its own environmental review.id.at it is relevant that future effects will themselves require analysis under ceqa.
cumulative biological impacts.plaintiff notes the draft eir biological resources analysis does not mention the nbr project at all in its cumulative impacts discussion.
even so,the biological resources cumulative impact analysis in the final eir was reasonable and practical.the city responded to public comment by stating,the newport banning ranch property is assumed in the cumulative biological resources analysis both properties are within the boundaries of the nccp.that is a reference to the natural communities conservation plan habitat conservation plan for the subregion which,as explained in the draft eir,plays an important role in mitigating cumulative impacts through the preservation
