introduction 
the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,
et requires that a public agency prepare an environmental impact report eir whenever the agency undertakes a discretionary project that may have a significant impact on the environment.courts have concluded that the touchstone for determining whether an agency has undertaken a discretionary action that requires the preparation of an eir is whether the agency would be able to meaningfully address the environmental concerns that might be identified in the eir.friends of westwood,city of los angeles d,friends of westwood.if an agency lacks such authority,then environmental review would be a meaningless exercise.mountain lion foundation fish game com.cal th,mountain lion foundation.
after an initial eir is certified,ceqa establishes a presumption against additional environmental review.an agency has jurisdiction to prepare a subsequent or supplemental eir only if the agency grants a discretionary approval on the project guidelines,c and certain statutorily enumerated new circumstances occur.see also guidelines,a.
in this case,we conclude that the city of san diego the city was not required to prepare a subsequent or supplemental eir regarding the potential impact of a redevelopment project called the navy broadway complex project the project,on global climate change,because the city did not grant a discretionary approval that would provide it with the authority to address the project impact on this environmental issue.
factual and procedural background 
a.the project and the initial eir 
in,the city entered into a development agreement with the united states of america for the redevelopment of certain waterfront property in downtown san diego.the development agreement contemplated that the developer of the project would be permitted to build up to square feet of office space,square feet of hotel space,square feet of retail space,and square feet of museum or other public attraction space.
the development agreement also established a development plan and a series of urban design guidelines related to the aesthetic design of the project.the development agreement required that the developer submit its construction documents to the centre city development corporation ccdc so that the ccdc could determine whether the developer submittals were consistent with the aesthetic criteria established in the development plan and the urban design guidelines.
at the time it entered into the development agreement,the city certified an eir that analyzed the project potential environmental impacts 
b.the ccdc determines that no further environmental review is warranted 
in connection with ccdc consistency reviews,and the city upholds the 
ccdc determinations 
in and,the developer,real party in interest manchester pacific gateway llc manchester,submitted its construction plans to the ccdc in connection with its consistency reviews,the ccdc determined that no further environmental review of the project was warranted under ceqa.the san diego navy broadway complex coalition the coalition,a nonprofit public benefit organization whose members have an interest in ensuring informed and responsible growth,appealed the ccdc decision to the city council in january,and again in february,the city council denied the coalition appeals and upheld the ccdc ceqa determinations.
c.the coalition petition for writ of mandate 
in february,the coalition filed a petition for writ of mandate in which it claimed,among other contentions,that the city had violated ceqa in january in determining that no further environmental review of the project was required.in march,the coalition amended its petition to add a challenge to the city february ceqa determination 
the coalition filed a brief in support of its amended petition for writ of mandate in which it argued that the city was required to prepare an updated eir to address the project impacts on numerous environmental issues,including,groundwater contamination,and air pollution,and the project emissions and vulnerability to.in arguing that the ccdc consistency determinations constituted discretionary actions under ceqa sufficient to require further environmental review,the coalition acknowledged that the scope of ccdc determinations was limited to the issue of submittals consistency with the development plan and urban design guidelines as set forth in the development agreement,but claimed that the ccdc had made a subjective determination as to whether manchester submittals were of sufficient quality and beauty so as to be consistent with the development plan and urban design guidelines.
the city and manchester filed a joint opposition to the amended petition.in their opposition,the city and manchester argued that the coalition had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies,and that it had failed to fairly present all of the evidence in the administrative record that was relevant to its claims.as to the merits of the coalition claims,the city and manchester acknowledged that the city had previously concluded,at the administrative level,that ccdc evaluation of the plans and specifications submitted by manchester would involve a measure of discretion and judgment sufficient to trigger ceqa,and that the city,as the lead agency and party to the development agreement,had a duty to evaluate whether any of the conditions of section were met.the city argued that none of the environmental concerns that the coalition had raised met the conditions of section,including the project greenhouse gas emissions and its potential impact on global climate change.
in addition to the joint opposition,manchester also filed a supplemental opposition to the amended petition.in its supplemental opposition,manchester argued that the ccdc consistency reviews did not constitute discretionary actions sufficient to trigger potential further environmental review under section.manchester argued that u nder friends of westwood,review is not discretionary if it does not allow the agency to shape the project specifically,manchester contended that,to the extent ccdc exercises any discretion,it is limited to aesthetics and that a modicum of discretion regarding aesthetic ideals does not require environmental review under ceqa.
after further briefing and a hearing,the trial court denied the amended petition.in its order denying the amended petition,the court concluded,as a threshold matter,that the coalition had failed to adequately exhaust its administrative remedies as to several of the issues that it raised in its amended petition,including its claims pertaining to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change,because it had failed to adequately present those issues to the city council the court also denied the amended petition on the procedural ground that the coalition had not fairly presented all of the relevant evidence from the administrative record in its brief.on the merits,the trial court concluded that ccdc consistency determinations were not discretionary actions under ceqa.the court also concluded that ceqa did not require the city to prepare an updated eir concerning the project greenhouse gas emissions or global climate change impacts because,at the time the city considered whether an updated eir was required,ceqa did not require an analysis of these environmental issues.
the trial court subsequently entered a judgment denying the coalition amended petition for writ of mandate.the coalition appeals 
discussionthe trial court properly denied the coalition amended petition for writ of mandate 
the coalition argues that the trial court erred in denying its amended petition for writ of mandate in which it sought an order that the city prepare an updat ed eir addressing the project impacts on global climate change.specifically,the coalition argues,t he trial court decision should be reversed and the city should be ordered to perform a legally sufficient analysis of the project greenhouse gas emissions and impacts.we apply the de novo standard of review in considering the threshold issue of whether the city took a discretionary action of a nature that would require it to prepare a subsequent or supplemental eir,if one of the circumstances specified in section occurred.health first march joint powers authority th,health first applying de novo standard of review in determining whether agency took discretionary action under ceqa.
governing law 
an agency is required to prepare an eir only when the agency 
has the authority to address to the environmental concerns that 
might be raised therein 
ceqa generally applies only to discretionary projects proposed to be carried out or approved by public agencies,italics added.the guidelines define a discretionary project as follows discretionary project means a project which requires the exercise of judgment or deliberation when the public agency or body decides to approve or disapprove a particular activity,as distinguished from situations where the public agency or body merely has to determine whether there has been conformity with applicable statutes,ordinances,or regulations.guidelines.
in explaining the significance of the fact that the requirement of environmental review under ceqa is limited to discretionary projects,the court in friends of westwood held that the touchstone for determining whether an agency is required to prepare an eir is whether the agency could meaningfully address any environmental concerns that might be identified in the eir 
as applied to private projects,the purpose of ceqa is to minimize the adverse effects of new construction on the environment.to serve this goal the act requires assessment of environmental consequences where government has the power through its regulatory powers to eliminate or mitigate one or more adverse environmental consequences a study could reveal.thus the touchstone is whether the approval process involved allows the government to shape the project in any way which could respond to any of the concerns which might be identified in an environmental impact report.friends of westwood,supra,d at.
the friends of westwood court explained the rationale for its conclusion that an agency need not prepare an eir when it lacks the discretion to respond to potential environmental concerns in the eir,as follows 
no matter what the eir might reveal about the terrible environmental consequences of going ahead with a given project the government agency would lack the power that is,the discretion to stop or modify it in any relevant way.the agency could not lawfully deny the permit nor condition it in any way which would mitigate the environmental damage in any significant way.the applicant would be able to legally compel issuance of the permit without change.thus,to require the preparation of an eir would constitute a uselessand indeed wastefulgesture.friends of westwood,supra,d at.
in mountain lion foundation,the california supreme court embraced this aspect of friends of westwood,stating that the limitation of ceqa to discretionary projects implicitly recognizes that unless a public agency can shape the project in a way that would respond to concerns raised in an eir,or its functional equivalent,environmental review would be a meaningless exercise.mountain lion foundation,supra,cal th at,citing friends of westwood.
in leach city of san diego d leach,this court adopted the reasoning of friends of westwood,holding that a municipality was not required to prepare an eir before the municipality would be permitted to draft water from a reservoir,because the city had little or no ability to minimize the environmental impacts that might be identified in an eir 
in spite of the environmental consequences,the city could do little or nothing to prevent or modify drafting of water between reservoirs to mitigate the environmental damage in any significant way.friends of westwood,supra,d at.to require an eir every time drafting of a reservoir is proposed for the ultimate purpose of supplying the community with water would indeed be useless and wasteful.leach,supra,d at.
one treatise has summarized this case law as follows 
under the reasoning set forth in leach,ceqa does not apply to an agency decision simply because the agency may exercise some discretion in approving the project or undertaking.instead to trigger ceqa compliance,the discretion must be of a certain kind it must provide the agency with the ability and authority to mitigate environmental damage to some degree.leach,supra,at see also friends of westwood,supra,d at the touchstone question is whether the agency can shape the project to address environmental impacts.remy et,guide to the california environmental quality act ed.
after an initial eir is certified,there is a strong presumption 
against additional environmental review 
after an initial eir is certified,there is a statutory presumption against additional environmental review.moss county of humboldt th,after a project has been subjected to environmental review,the statutory presumption flips in favor of the developer and against further review.in melom city of madera th,the court explained that section prohibits agencies from requiring additional environmental review after an initial eir is certified unless certain specified conditions are met 
s ection provides that,when environmental review has been performed,no subsequent or supplemental eir shall be required by the lead agency or any responsible agency unless substantial changes are proposed in the project that will require major revisions of the eir,or substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project will be undertaken that will require major revisions in the eir,or new information,which was not known and could not have been known when the eir was certified,becomes available.
this provision represents a shift in the applicable policy considerations.the low threshold for requiring the preparation of an eir in the first instance is no longer applicable instead,agencies are prohibited from requiring further environmental review unless the stated conditions are met.citation.
thus,public resources code section provides a balance against the burdens created by the environmental review process and accords a reasonable measure of finality and certainty to the results achieved.citation.at this point,the interests of finality are favored over the policy of favoring public comment,and the rule applies even if the initial review is discovered to have been inaccurate and misleading in the description of a significant effect or the severity of its consequences.citation.citation.
s ection comes into play precisely because review has already occurred,the time for challenging the sufficiency of the original eir has long since expired citation,and the question is whether circumstances have changed enough to justify repeating a substantial portion of the process.citation.
the requirement to prepare a subsequent eir or a supplemental 
eir arises only where the agency has discretion to respond to the 
environmental concerns raised in the new eir,and one of the 
circumstances specified in section has occurred 
as with the preparation of an initial eir,an agency is required to prepare a subsequent or supplemental eir only where the agency grants a discretionary approval.see guidelines,c,both implementing section cucamongans united for reasonable expansion city of rancho cucamonga th,cucamongans a public agency may require a subsequent eir only when the agency grants a discretionary approval.in the absence of such discretionary approval,the agency has no jurisdiction to prepare a subsequent or supplemental eir.cucamongans,supra,th at.this jurisdictional limitation is consistent with the notion that it is nonsensical to require an agency to prepare a subsequent or supplemental eir unless the agency has the authority to take action that would respond to any concerns that might be raised in the updated eir.mountain lion foundation,supra,cal th at.
guidelines,section c provides 
c once a project has been approved,the lead agency role in project approval is completed,unless further discretionary approval on that project is required.information appearing after an approval does not require reopening of that approval.if after the project is approved,any of the conditions described in subdivision a occurs,a subsequent eir or negative declaration shall only be prepared by the public agency which grants the next discretionary approval for the project,if any.in this situation no other responsible agency shall grant an approval for the project until the subsequent eir has been certified or subsequent negative declaration adopted.
see also guidelines,a,providing that an agency may prepare a supplemental eir rather than a subsequent eir if the conditions described in section would require the preparation of a subsequent eir,and o nly minor additions or changes would be necessary to make the previous eir adequately apply to the project in the changed situation.
in health first,supra,th at page,the court considered whether an agency approval of a design plan application for a large warehouse facility constituted a discretionary action under ceqa,such that the agency would be required to prepare a subsequent or supplemental eir if one of the circumstances specified in section had occurred.in,the agency approved a plan to reuse a portion of a military base as a business center.health first,supra,th at.together with its approval of the plan,the agency certified an eir ibid,and established a series of design guidelines that set forth standards for landscaping,parking,architecture,and other design elements.id.at.in,a company submitted a design plan application to place a large warehouse distribution facility in the business center.id.at.the agency performed a consistency review and determined that the proposed application was consistent with the plan,the eir,and the design guidelines.id.at.a citizen group filed a petition for writ of mandate,challenging the approval as unlawful under ceqa id.at,and the trial court granted the petition.ibid.
the agency and the company appealed,claiming that the agency approval of the design plan application did not constitute a discretionary action under ceqa.health first,supra,th at.in determining whether the agency had taken a discretionary action,the health first court cited case law in which courts had considered the meaning of discretionary as used in section.health first,supra,th at.specifically,the health first court quoted the supreme court statement in mountain lion foundation that ceqa applies only to an agency discretionary actions because unless a public agency can shape the project in a way that would respond to concerns raised in an eir,or its functional equivalent,environmental review would be a meaningless exercise.health first,supra,th at,quoting mountain lion foundation,supra,cal th at.in concluding that the agency had not undertaken any discretionary action in approving the design application,the health first court noted that the agency review of the company design plan application involved deciding whether the application was consistent with the requirements,fixed standards,and proposed mitigation of the plan,the eir,and the design guidelines.health first,supra,th at.the health first court concluded that no additional environmental review was warranted,and reversed the trial court judgment.id.at.
b.the city was not required to prepare a subsequent or supplemental eir 
concerning greenhouse gas emissions or global climate change 
the coalition acknowledges that u nless there is discretionary action on the proposal after the initial approval is given there is no basis for further environmental review the coalition claims that the ccdc action in conducting consistency reviews of manchester submittals constituted such discretionary action.specifically,the coalition argues that the development agreement required the ccdc to exercise its subjective judgment as to numerous aesthetic issues related to the project.for example,the coalition notes that the development agreement required the ccdc to determine whether manchester submittals were consistent with specified design requirements in the development agreement,including 
pacific highway frontage shall be designed to reinforce the street role as a major landscaped gateway boulevard facades shall be substantially transparent to maximize the sense of contrast between indoor and outdoor activities.
the design of the streets shall emphasize pedestrian access through wide sidewalks and continuous landscaping.
colorful awnings,arcades,similar features shall be incorporated into the facade design to reinforce the pedestrian environment.
towers shall be designed as slender structures to minimize view obstructions.
a palette of colors and building materials shall be developed for the broadway complex to ensure harmonious treatment.italics omitted.
the coalition argues that d etermining whether such subjective standards have been met involves the exercise of judgment and deliberation,leaving ccdc with substantial leeway to decide whether manchester submittals were of sufficient quality and beauty,and thus,that the ccdc determinations constitute discretionary acts within the meaning of ceqa.
assuming for purposes of this opinion that in performing the consistency reviews,the ccdc was required to exercise discretionary authority guidelines,c with respect to various aesthetic issues on the project,the coalition has made no showing that the scope of the ccdc discretion extended to the project potential impacts on global climate change.we conclude that the failure to make such a showing is fatal to the coalition claim.
the rationale for requiring an eir is to inform the agency of the potential environmental consequences of its approval of a project.laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal d,a fundamental purpose of an eir is to provide decision makers with information they can use in deciding whether to approve a proposed project accord guidelines,e when the agency decides whether to approve the project,the body shall consider the previous eir as revised by the supplemental eir.where an agency has no authority to modify a project based on the analysis contained in the eir,there is no basis for requiring the agency to prepare the eir.this principle has been repeatedly stressed in cases in which courts have considered the limitation of ceqa to discretionary projects in the preparation of an initial eir,friends of westwood,supra,d at,and we see no reason why the same principle should not apply with equal force in the context of considering whether an agency is required to prepare a subsequent or supplemental eir.to hold that an agency must prepare a subsequent or supplemental eir concerning an environmental issue over which its discretionary authority does not extend would be inconsistent with friends of westwood and its progeny,and with the statutory presumption against additional environmental review,as discussed in the case law interpreting section.see moss county of humboldt,supra,th at.
the fact that the ccdc could arguably exercise discretionary authority to alter the aesthetics of the project so as to make the project consistent with the development agreement does not demonstrate that the ccdc had the authority to modify the project in accordance with a proposed updated eir so as to reduce the impact of the project on global climate change.the limited scope of the ccdc discretionary authority in conducting consistency reviews is underscored by the fact that the development agreement provides that the ccdc could not unreasonably withhold its consistency determinations,and that the ccdc could not require any change which is inconsistent with the environmental impact statement for the project the development agreement thus makes clear that the ccdc role in performing a consistency review is strictly limited to determining whether manchester submittals were consistent with the aesthetic guidelines contained in the development agreement.
we reject the coalition argument that the fact that the ccdc discretion in conducting the consistency reviews centered around aesthetic issues,is of no consequence,because a esthetics are built into ceqa definition of environment.whether ceqa may be applied to address issues pertaining to aesthetics is irrelevant to this appeal,because the coalition is not requesting that the cit
