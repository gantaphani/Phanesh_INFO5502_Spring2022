the question we consider is whether this action is barred by the time limitation in f,the judicial review provision of the fishery conservation and management act of magnuson act,et.section f provides for judicial review of r egulations promulgated under the magnuson act,but only if a petition for such review is filed within days.
consistent with its authority under the magnuson act,the national marine fisheries service nmfs issued regulations reopening the part of the longline fishery that targets swordfish the swordfish fishery.see fisheries off west coast states and in the western pacific,april.the fishery had been closed since due to its impact on endangered sea turtles.approximately five months after publication of the regulation,the turtle island restoration network,lele,and the center for biological diversity collectively turtle island filed suit against nmfs,the united states department of commerce and the secretary of commerce collectively nmfs.the hawaii longline association intervened as a defendant.turtle island complaint did not reference the magnuson act,but instead alleged violations of the migratory bird treaty act mbta,the national environmental policy act nepa,the endangered species act esa,and the administrative procedure act apa.
the district court denied turtle island motion for preliminary injunctive relief and dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.we agree with the district court that turtle island claims,though framed in terms of violations of the apa and environmental statutes were in actuality challenge s to the reopening of the fishery.because the claims are appropriately characterized as an attack on the regulations reopening the fishery,the magnuson act statute of limitation applies,and turtle island petition is barred because it was filed beyond the time limitation.
background 
i.the magnuson act 
the magnuson act established a national program for the management and conservation of fishery resources.a.congress delegated fishery management authority to the secretary of commerce and established regional fishery management councils councils to assist the secretary in carrying out these duties.the councils prepare fishery management plans and amendments to those plans,which contain conservation and management measures consistent with the magnuson act and any other applicable law.a.
the councils may also propose regulations implementing the fishery management plans or plan amendments,which nmfs must review for consistency with the magnuson act and other applicable law.b.if approved,nmfs publishes such implementing regulations in the federal register for a public comment period of fifteen to sixty days.b a.nmfs then promulgates final regulations with an explanation of any differences between the proposed and final regulations.b.
the magnuson act provides for judicial review in accordance with the apa of r egulations promulgated by the secretary and actions that are taken by the secretary under regulations which implement a fishery management plan but only if a petition for such review is filed within days f.
ii.longline fishing and the reopening of the swordfish fishery 
this dispute concerns the longline fishing of swordfish and its impact on endangered sea turtles and two species of migratory seabird,the and laysan albatross.longline fishing involves the use of vessels that trail mainlines up to sixty miles long.these mainlines are set horizontally near the water surface and generally contain over a thousand baited hooks.in the course of fishing for swordfish,other species,including sea turtles and seabirds,can become hooked or incidentally caught.this method of fishing swordfish has been particularly controversial because it results in more incidental catches than other types of longline fishing because of the specific gear and techniques used,the shallower depth at which the longlines are set,and the time of day the fishing takes place.
on april,nmfs promulgated a final rule regulations implementing a fishery management plan amendment recommended by the western pacific fishery management council western pacific council,which is responsible for fisheries in hawaii.a h.the regulations reopened the swordfish fishery,which had been closed by previous regulations.see fisheries off west coast states and in the western pacific.at.the regulations also restricted the types of bait and hooks that could be used for swordfish fishing to minimize the adverse impacts on sea turtles.id.
regulation of the longline fishing of swordfish has been the subject of extensive litigation.in fact,the regulations were adopted after previous regulations,which prohibited the longline fishing of swordfish the regulations,and the related biological opinion were vacated and remanded to nmfs by court order.see hawaii longline ass marine fisheries,d,the regulations prohibited the longline fishing of swordfish due to its impact on endangered sea turtles.following the court order,nmfs commenced the formal rulemaking process that led to the current regulations 
nmfs had first published a notice of intent in december announcing an accelerated management action schedule that is necessary to avoid a lapse in sea turtle conservation measures after the june,final rule is vacated on april.under this accelerated schedule,nmfs would issue two separate supplemental environmental impact statements seiss one addressing the fishery potential impact on threatened sea turtle populations,to be completed first,and another addressing issues such as seabird interactions,to be completed later.notice of intent.
upon the recommendation of the western pacific council,in january,nmfs published a proposed rule that would eliminate the prohibition on longline fishing during april and may,and require the use of certain bait and hook combinations to reduce sea turtle interactions.see fisheries off west coast states and in the western pacific,proposed.the proposed rule announced that the consultation process mandated by section of the esa was currently underway,and that the rule itself might be revised,as necessary,to comport with the biological opinion.in addition,the proposed rule indicated that in accordance with nepa,the western pacific council and nmfs prepared a draft seis for this regulatory amendment scheduled to be filed in for comments.id.at.the western pacific council held a public hearing in february to receive comments regarding the draft seis,notice of public hearing on draft seis,and another public hearing in march regarding the fishery management plan amendment,notice of public meetings.
nmfs issued a biological opinion in february,which concluded that reopening the swordfish fishery to allow a limited number of sets per year would not likely jeopardize the continued existence of any esa listed species,provided that certain bait and hook combinations were used.the biological opinion also included an incidental take statement authorizing the fishery to take up to sixteen leatherback and seventeen loggerhead sea turtles.see fisheries off west coast states and in the western pacific.at.
in early march,the western pacific council issued a regulatory amendment to the fishery management plan and a final supplemental environmental impact statement final seis,which supplemented the earlier eis issued before the regulations and assessed various alternatives.the western pacific council recommended that nmfs allow swordfish sets to be made annually and require the use of certain types of hooks and other new technologies shown to reduce and mitigate interactions with sea turtles.
the final seis focused primarily on the impact of renewed swordfish fishing on endangered sea turtles and said relatively little about the potential impact on seabirds this approach was apparently deliberate,as nmfs was motivated by the need to implement new regulations by the deadline of april.see notice of intent.at.
on march,nmfs signed a record of decision authorizing the reopening of the swordfish fishery the main element of this action is to establish a swordfish fishery of limited scale that will permit environmentally responsible swordfish longlining while minimizing impacts on protected species of sea turtles in the pacific ocean.the seabird seis was not issued until may,after turtle island commenced this suit.see seabird interaction mitigation methods,may,
turtle island participated in the formal rulemaking process before the regulations were issued.in a detailed comment letter submitted in february,turtle island opined that the proposed regulations are completely unlawful.substantively,they violate the esa and mbta while procedurally the draft eis is inadequate under nepa.
iii.turtle island claims and the district court proceedings 
on august,approximately five months after publication of the regulations,turtle island filed suit in the district of hawaii seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.turtle island did not seek relief under the magnuson act,but instead alleged that nmfs violated three other statutes,nepa,mbta,and esa,when it reopened the swordfish fishery.as the jurisdictional basis for its suit,turtle island invoked federal question declaratory judgment and further relief and the judicial review provision of the apa.
the essence of turtle island challenge is set out in its first and second claims for relief,which allege that nmfs violated nepa and mbta by issuing an amended fishery management plan for the pelagic fisheries of the western pacific region reopening the swordfish fishery and eliminating the partial ban on tuna longlining by issuing a record of decision on or about march,to do so,and by issuing regulations implementing those regulations effective april,in the absence of an adequate eis prepared in accordance with applicable procedures and in the absence of a valid permit from the fish and wildlife service allowing the take of migratory birds by the longline fishery turtle island third claim for relief alleges that nmfs issuance of the incidental take statement violated the esa because it permits takings of sea turtles in the course of l ongline fishing by the pelagic fisheries of the western pacific which is unlawful,in that it violates nepa and mbta.
the judicial review provision of the apa is the vehicle for each of turtle island claims.neither nepa nor mbta authorize a private right of action.by contrast,the esa contains a citizen suit provision,g,whereby private parties may enforce the substantive provisions of the esa bennett spear,d.however,turtle island brought its esa claim under the apa.see id.at.holding that under of the esa,claims can be brought pursuant to the apa.although the apa itself contains no specific statute of limitations,a general civil action statute of limitation applies to challenges under the apa.a e very civil action commenced against the united states shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues.sierra club penfold,cir holding that a applies to the apa.turtle island contends that this general limit,not the provision of the magnuson act,applies to its claims.
turtle island complaint requests a declaratory judgment that nmfs violated various statutes and an injunction to stop all longline fishing of swordfish until nmfs complies with the apa,nepa,mbta,and esa.
the district court granted nmfs motion to dismiss and denied turtle island motion for a preliminary injunction.the district court determined that its jurisdiction in this matter turn ed on whether turtle island claims are accurately characterized as violations of various environmental statutes,or if they are actually attacking the regulation promulgated pursuant to the msa,thus implicating the time bar of f.the court concluded that turtle island claims all flow from the reopening of the fishery pursuant to a properly promulgated amendment to the fishery management plan.therefore,judicial review is limited under f and this court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate this matter.
i.the magnuson act judicial review provision section f 
resolution of this case is found in the plain language of f.when looking to the plain language of a statute,we do more than view words or subsections in isolation.we derive meaning from context,and this requires reading the relevant statutory provisions as a whole.cal.ex rel.lockyer ferc,cir internal quotation marks omitted.o ur task is to construe what congress has enacted.navajo nation dep t of health human,cir en banc quoting duncan walker,d.section f provides 
f judicial review.
regulations promulgated by the secretary under this chapter and actions described in paragraph shall be subject to judicial review to the extent authorized by,and in accordance with the apa,if a petition for such review is filed within days 
after the date on which the regulations are promulgated or the action is published in the federal register,as applicable except that 
a section of such title is not applicable,and 
b the appropriate court shall only set aside any such regulation on a ground specified in section a,b,c,or d of such title 
upon a motion by the person who files a petition under this subsection,the appropriate court shall assign the matter for hearing at the earliest possible date and shall expedite the matter in every possible way.
the congressional directive is clear and uncomplicated a party seeking judicial review of r egulations promulgated by the secretary under the magnuson act must do so within thirty days of their promulgation.f.see northwest envtl.def.ctr.brennen,cir holding that regulations are promulgated within the meaning of this subsection when published in the federal register.
provided that a complaint is filed within thirty days,the court reviews the contested regulations in accordance with the apa except that f a precludes preliminary injunctive relief,a remedy ordinarily available under the apa the statute also limits the grounds for relief.under f b,a court may only set aside regulations if they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,a contrary to constitutional right,power,privilege,or immunity,b in excess of statutory jurisdiction,authority,or limitations,or short of statutory right,c or without observance of procedure required by law,d.finally,a party may seek expedited review of the regulations under f 
ii.turtle island challenge to the reopening of the fishery 
the plain language of f leaves no room for discussion the time limit applies whenever a party challenges r egulations promulgated by the secretary under the magnuson act.see norbird fisheries,national marine fisheries,cir section f,deprives the district court of jurisdiction to hear an attack on the regulations if review is not sought within days.the question then is whether turtle island claims are properly cast as challenges to the regulations.
the essence of turtle island complaint is not in challenges the reopening of the swordfish fishery.that opening came about as a result of the regulations published on april,yet turtle island did not file suit until almost five months later,well beyond the limit.turtle island attempts to gloss over its statute of limitations problem by assiduously avoiding citation to the magnuson act and instead alleging claims under various other environmental statutes.this effort to circumvent the strict time limits under the magnuson act is to no avail.
to be sure,invocation of the magic words,the magnuson act,is not a predicate to application of f if the substance of the challenge is to the regulations themselves.notably,f does not state that challenges under the magnuson act must be brought within thirty days,but instead that judicial review of r egulations promulgated by the secretary under the magnuson act must be brought within the stated time limit.emphasis added.
to allow parties to avoid this limitation through manipulation of mention of the magnuson act in the in substance challenging the regulations,would permit parties through careful pleading to avoid the strict jurisdictional limits imposed by congress.cal.save our streams council,yeutter,cir see block north dakota,d it would require the suspension of disbelief to ascribe to congress the design to allow its careful and thorough remedial scheme to be circumvented by artful pleading.quoting brown gsa,d.
