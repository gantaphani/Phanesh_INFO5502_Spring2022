introduction 
we confront here the converse of our usual california environmental quality act ceqa issue.here,we are asked to order an environmental impact report,not to assess the impact of a proposed project on the present environment,but to assess the impact of the present environment upon a proposed project.the argument is that the environment needs to be cleaned up to make it suitable for the project,rather than vice versa.
petitioner south orange county wastewater authority socwa appeals from a judgment of the superior court denying its petition for a writ of mandate.socwa wanted the city of dana point city to prepare an environmental impact report eir for a project to develop property next door to a sewage treatment plant socwa operates in dana point.we find that under ceqa,the project would not have the environmental impact necessary to require an eir.
socwa also contends the amendment paving the way for this development made the city general plan internally inconsistent.the trial court did not address this precise issue,probably because of the unusual manner in which socwa presented it.we find no inconsistency.the trial court properly denied socwa petition.
socwa operates a sewage treatment plant near the shoreline at dana point.in,the city received an application from a developer,makar properties,llc makar,to change the city land use so that eventually makar could develop a site adjacent to socwa plant.as relevant to this appeal,the three components of makar application were amending the city general plan,to create a new,designation adding to the city zoning code a new zone,allowing mixed residential and commercial development and rezoning the makar site under the new zone the city approval of these changes was only the first step,however.because of the site proximity to the shore,the california coastal commission would also have to sign off before anything could actually be constructed.
the city planning commission commission staff began the environmental review process required by ceqa whenever a public agency receives an application to approve a project it determined the land use changes makar sought qualified as a project and then conducted an initial study to ascertain whether the project could have a significant adverse effect on the environment.there is no dispute that all of the necessary formalities were observed regarding notices,reviews,and public meetings.having determined that any environmental effects caused by the project could be mitigated so as to render them insignificant,the commission issued a mitigated negative declaration mnd in february.the mnd was revised and reissued in october,after the staff analyzed the effects of development more thoroughly.
the commission held four public hearings on the proposed zoning changes in general and the makar rezoning in particular,including one site visit open to the public the city ultimately amended the general plan,approved zoning changes although not the ones makar had initially requested,adopted the mnd,and passed a resolution requesting coastal commission certification.
socwa objected throughout this process.its initial objections,lodged by letter in march,were based on noise and bad smells from plant operations and water runoff from the property the runoff issue was dealt with in the course of the review process.that left the noises and the bad smells.although the smells would be,according to socwa,intermittent and fleeting,it still professed to worry that prospective residents of the makar site would be subjected to them.
while this concern on socwa part for the comfort of residents of a project that was as yet but a gleam in the developer eye appears to be quite,in reality socwa had a concealed agenda.its recommended method of dealing with the bad smells intermittent and fleeting though they were represented to be was to cover the plant aeration tanks,at makar expense.the price tag was initially million,later reduced to million 
at the commission public meetings regarding the land use and zoning changes,the effects of the rezoning were thoroughly discussed.for example,the commission was not satisfied that the initial traffic studies for the makar site reflected the realities of a summer weekend in dana point and required a.various limits on the maximum number of residential units per acre and the area to be devoted to commercial space were debated,as well as the odor issue.the commission ultimately refused to recommend covering the tanks as a mitigation measure and recommended approval of the changes and the mnd without the more onerous measures sought by socwa the amendment to the general plan creating a new mixed use designation,the new zoning category,and the change in the zoning of the makar site were all approved by the city council on june,the specifics of the new zoning category were approved on july.the city council also reviewed and adopted the mnd on the same date.
socwa then petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandate.socwa asserted that a eir was required,not just a negative declaration,in order to address the odor issue socwa also alleged the amendment to the general plan rendered the elements of the general plan internally inconsistent.
the trial court denied the writ petition.the court pointed out that the ceqa project under review was not the construction of any residences or commercial buildings but rather the change in the city land use.the city had evaluated the possible environmental effects of rezoning the makar site at the levels permitted in the resolutions although not required by ceqa to do so,it had taken into account the possible effects of the proximity of the socwa sewage plant,by requiring a buffer zone between the plant and future structures,visual screening,air conditioning,and notifications in escrow instructions.the court also found the city had properly exercised its discretion with respect to the adoption of the new zoning description and this new zone was not inconsistent with the city general plan.the court observed that the coastal commission had not yet approved the city resolutions and the developer had not yet submitted specific plans for the site for review.socwa objections to the project as inconsistent with the general plan were thus premature.the court issued a statement of decision on june.
socwa now appeals from the final judgment denying its petition for writ of mandamus.
discussion 
ceqa standard of review and burden of proof 
ceqa does not purport to approve or disapprove environmentally related activities.instead,it sets up a process for public agencies to follow whenever an activity they undertake or regulate may affect the environment.see laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal d.this process relies heavily on the collection and dissemination of information regarding possible environmental consequences and on the ability of interested parties especially the public to participate in making decisions.concerned citizens of costa mesa,dist.agricultural cal d.what this means for the courts is that we do not decide whether something is good or bad for the environment which we are to do.laurel heights improvement regents of university of california,supra,cal d at.instead,courts determine whether the public agency passing judgment on the project followed the ceqa process.
under public resources code section,a court review of an agency environmental findings,determinations,or decisions is restricted to whether the agency acted as required by law or to whether substantial evidence supported the determination or decision.an appellate court review of the administrative record for legal error and substantial evidence in a ceqa case,as in other mandamus cases,is the same as the trial court the appellate court reviews the agency action,not the trial court decision in that sense appellate judicial review under ceqa is de novo.vineyard area citizens for responsible growth,city of rancho cordova cal th.i n reviewing the adoption of a negative declaration,the concern of both trial courts and appellate courts is whether there is substantial evidence in the record supporting a fair argument of significant environmental impact.citations.architectural heritage assn county of monterey th.
socwa bears the burden of proof to demonstrate,by citation to the administrative record,the existence of substantial evidence supporting a fair argument of significant environmental impact.league for protection of oakland.historic resources city of oakland th,see also,subd.c.unless the administrative record contains this evidence,and socwa cites to it,no fair argument that an eir is necessary can be made.cathay mortuary,san francisco planning com.d.socwa has restricted the impact at issue in this appeal to odors from the sewage plant.
ii.purpose of ceqa review of land use projects 
the key ceqa issue in this appeal is whether an eir was required on the impact of odors from socwa sewage plant on the changes sought by makar.it is important to pinpoint the component of the makar project that required consideration of an eir.the only component that could even arguably have had an immediate impact on the environment was the rezoning of the makar site from coastal recreation to.we hold that no eir was necessary for this component,basing our holding on both the legislative intent and the unambiguous statutory language used to carry out this intent.
when the legislature enacted the ceqa in,it stated the act purpose in unmistakable terms.the maintenance of a quality environment for the people of this state now and in the future is a matter of statewide concern,subd.a.every citizen has a responsibility to contribute to the preservation and enhancement of the environment,subd.e.it is the intent of the legislature that all agencies of the state government which regulate activities of private individuals,corporations,and public agencies which are found to affect the quality of the environment,shall regulate such activities so that major consideration is given to preventing environmental damage,while providing a decent home and satisfying living environment for every californian,subd.g.to be sure the message got across,the legislature enacted an additional legislative intent section,which included d evelop and maintain a environment now and in the future,and take all action necessary to protect,rehabilitate,and enhance the environmental quality of the state,and e nsure that the protection of the environment,consistent with the provision of a decent home and suitable living environment for every californian,shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions,and r equire governmental agencies at all levels to develop standards and procedures necessary to protect environmental quality,subds.a,d,f.
from the earliest ceqa cases,the courts have interpreted the act to realize the legislature intent.see,friends of mammoth board of supervisors cal d,legislature intended the c eqa to be interpreted in such manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment,disapproved on other grounds in kowis howard cal th bozung local agency formation com.cal d,concerned citizens of costa mesa,dist.agricultural,supra,cal d at.at the same time,courts have recognized that ceqa is not a weapon to be deployed against all possible development ills.for example,although ceqa requires public agencies to evaluate the possible negative environmental effects of constructing retail stores,air pollution from traffic,noise and light pollution,destruction of open space,the fact that they may drive smaller retailers out of business is not an effect covered by ceqa.see waste management of alameda county,county of alameda th,ceqa not intended to protect competition among commercial enterprises.only if the loss of businesses affects the physical environment for example,by causing or increasing urban decay will ceqa be engaged.see anderson first coalition city of anderson th,bakersfield citizens for local control city of bakersfield th,friends of davis city of davis th,citizens for quality growth city of shasta d,subd.e economic changes significant only if they cause physical change to environment.
ceqa defines environment as the physical conditions which exist within the area which will be affected by a proposed project,including land,air,water,minerals,flora,fauna,noise,objects of historical or aesthetic significance,italics added.an eir is required on any project that may have a significant effect on the environment,subd.a,subd.a.a significant effect on the environment means a substantial,or potentially substantial,adverse change in any of the physical conditions within the area affected by the project,italics added.
socwa objection to the adoption of mnd for the rezoning essentially turns ceqa upside down.instead of using the act to defend the existing environment from adverse changes caused by a proposed project,socwa wants to use the act to defend the proposed project the future residences from a purportedly adverse existing environment smells from the sewage treatment plant.in actuality,of course,socwa wants to protect itself from nuisance complaints by potential neighbors based on bad smells from the plant,while sticking makar with the bill the statutory definition of environment the physical conditions which will be affected by a proposed project precludes any such application of ceqa.
baird county of contra costa th baird,on which the trial court relied,correctly dealt with this exact situation.in baird,some neighbors of an addiction treatment facility opposed an expansion of the facility to treat young drug addicts and alcoholics.id.at.they professed to be concerned about the environmental impact of the project not the impact of the project on the environment,however,but rather the impact of the environment on the project and its future and alcoholic residents.the neighbors claimed that the proposed site was contaminated by oil,mercury,wastewater,and sewage,all of which would harm the future residents.ibid.an eir was therefore required.the county disagreed and approved the permit for the expansion,issuing a negative declaration that the project would not have a significant effect on the environment.id.at.the neighbors sued and got the trial court to agree with them about the eir.
the appellate court reversed.to require an eir in the present context,where the proposed project is challenged on the basis of preexisting environmental conditions rather than an adverse change in the environment,would impose a requirement beyond those stated in ceqa or its guidelines,and is thus prohibited.baird,supra,th at.an eir is required if substantial evidence supports a fair argument that the project may have a significant effect on the environment.id.at.significant effect on the environment means a substantial,or potentially substantial,adverse change in the environment.because the expansion project contemplated no change at all in the environment the physical conditions affected by the proposed project,no eir was necessary.baird,supra,th at see also city of long beach los angeles unified school dist.th,purpose of eir to identify effects of project on environment,not effects of environment on project.
this case presents the same issue.the makar rezoning contemplated no changes in the sewage plant or in its operations.an eir was not required for the zoning change because the initial study turned up no significant and irreversible adverse environmental effects the environmental effects the study did identify could be mitigated.one purpose of an initial study is to e liminate unnecessary eirs,subd.c.
the purpose of an eir is to provide public agencies and the public in general with detailed information about the effect which a proposed project in likely to have on the environment,italics added.socwa has identified no effect on the environment attributable to the rezoning that would justify an eir.silveira las gallinas valley sanitary dist.th,no eir necessary if no environmental impacts.
socwa has not cited any cases in which the environment effect on a project was held to require an eir.likewise,it has not given us any statutory authority for extending the eir requirement to situations where the environment has an effect on a project,instead of the other way around.socwa refers to an appendix to the guidelines,appendix g,which is a sample checklist form that is suggested for use in preparing an initial study.see,subd.f.a few questions in the checklist deal with exposure of people to environmental hazards.would the project e xpose people or structures to a significant risk of loss,injury,or death involving wildland fires a few questions on a suggested checklist in an appendix to the guidelines do not seem to us to provide a strong enough foundation on which to base a reversal of the entire purpose of ceqa.
socwa also refers to one of the guidelines,ccr section,entitled consideration and discussion of significant environmental impacts,which deals with the content of an eir.subdivision a states,in part,the eir shall also analyze any significant environmental effects the project might cause by bringing development and people to the area affected.for example,an eir on a subdivision astride an active fault line should identify as a significant effect the seismic hazard to future occupants of the subdivision.the subdivision would have the effect of attracting people to the location and exposing them to the hazards found there.similarly,the eir should evaluate any potentially significant impacts of locating development in other areas susceptible to hazardous conditions,floodplains,coastlines,wildfire risk areas 
while identifying the environmental effects of attracting people to an area certainly comports with ceqa legislative intent and statutory framework,we can not help but notice that the examples given in subdivision a are not examples of environmental effects wrought by development.a true example with respect to,say,wildfires would be increasing the risk in a area by people using their fireplaces or their backyard barbeques or by children playing with matches.the guidelines are entitled to great weight,except when they are inconsistent with controlling law.laurel heights improvement regents of university of california,supra,cal d at fn.communities for a better environment california resources agency th,see also azusa land reclamation main san gabriel basin watermaster th,guidelines invalid if they exceed statutory scope.we should also point out that the guideline deals with the content of an eir after it has been determined one is necessary.it does not address the question at issue here whether an eir is necessary at all.
the legislature has expressly forbidden courts to interpret ceqa or the regulatory guidelines to impose procedural or substantive requirements beyond those explicitly stated in the act or in the guidelines.see also sunset sky ranch pilots county of sacramento cal th,legislature limited ceqa scope.this prohibition would encompass expanding ceqa to cover situations in which the project,not the environment,is alleged to be at risk.
socwa also criticizes the city for dealing only with the zoning changes instead of the entire future development the construction of residences and commercial space,citing cases holding that ceqa does not allow a project to be approved piecemeal,because doing so could mask the cumulative effects of environmental change.see,california native plant society city of rancho cordova th,citizens for sensible development of bishop area county of inyo d,subd.b.this principle certainly holds true for projects that actually affect the environment.chopping them up into small pieces,each of which would have only a small environmental impact,could result in quite large adverse effects at the end of the entire process.see,communities for a better environment california resources agency,supra,th at,plan for arcadia,city council of arcadia d.but these cases do not apply to this situation.the odors from the sewage plant are what they are.whether the makar project proceeds in one phase or in a hundred phases will not affect what emanates from the plant.because socwa is trying to make ceqa work in reverse,the cases about the cumulative effects of multiple small environmental changes are inapposite.
the legislature did not enact ceqa to protect people from the environment.other statutes,ordinances,and regulations fulfill that function.see,health,et location of residences near hazardous waste site et location of structures near earthquake faults,subd.a construction of structures in floodways silveira las gallinas valley sanitary,supra,th at bay area air quality management district regulation regarding residential construction near waste treatment plant.the south coast air quality management district regulates socwa operations see health,and regulation of odor emission forms part of the district oversight of air pollution.this is the framework established by the legislature to protect people from odors such as the ones socwa sewage plant might produce.ceqa serves another purpose.
the city acted as required by law.it examined the makar application to alter the city general plan,to create a new zoning description,and to apply the new description to makar property to see whether approving the application would have a significant effect on the environment,subd.b.the effect with which socwa is concerned odors from the sewage plant is not an adverse change in any of the physical conditions within the area affected by the makar project.see.an eir was therefore unnecessary with respect to these odors.
iii.consistency with general plan 
all cities and counties must adopt comprehensive,general plans for physical development.government code section requires that a general plan and the elements and parts thereof comprise an integrated,internally consistent and compatible statement of policies for the adopting agency.subsequent land use decisions must be consistent with the general plan and its elements.endangered habitats league,county of orange th.a general plan must include a land use element,which designates the proposed general distribution and general location and extent of the uses of the land for housing,business,industry,open space,including agriculture,natural resources,recreation,and liquid waste disposal facilities,and other categories of public and private uses of land the land use element shall include a statement of the standards of population density and building intensity recommended for the various districts and other territory covered by the plan,subd.a.government code section permits a legislative body to amend all or part of an adopted general plan when amendment is in the public interest,subd.a.
internal consistency of general plan 
although it is not entirely clear,socwa appears to be arguing at least at one point that the city improperly amended its general plan to include a new designation.according to socwa,the amendment created an internally inconsistent general plan,specifically an internally inconsistent element in the general plan.
the adoption or amendment of a general plan is a legislative act.citation.a legislative act is presumed valid,and a city need not make explicit findings to support its action.citations.a court can not inquire into the wisdom of a legislative act or review the merits of a local government policy decisions.citation.judicial review of a legislative act under code of civil procedure section is limited to determining whether the public agency action was arbitrary,capricious,entirely without evidentiary support,or procedurally unfair.citations.a court therefore can not disturb a general plan based on violation of the internal consistency and correlation requirements unless,based on the evidence before the city council,a reasonable person could not conclude that the plan is internally consistent or correlative.citation.federation of hillside canyon assns city of los angeles th.socwa has the burden of proof to demonstrate that the amendment to the general plan rendered the plan internally inconsistent.see garat city of riverside th,disapproved on other grounds in morehart county of santa barbara cal th.
a general plan is internally inconsistent when one required element impedes or frustrates another element or when one part of an element contradicts another part of the same element.for example,a element calling for substantial increases in population is
