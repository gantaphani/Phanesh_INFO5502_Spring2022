sierra club brought this clean air act caa citizen suit against otter tail power company,mdu resources group,and northwestern energy,who own and operate the big stone generating station,a coal fired power plant near the border between south dakota and minnesota.sierra club alleged that otter tail violated the caa by failing to obtain permits for a series of modifications to the plant and by exceeding applicable emission limits.the district granted otter tail motion to dismiss,and sierra club timely appealed.we affirm.
since the factual allegations underlying this controversy are tied into the caa and its related regulations,we begin with an examination of the applicable statutory and regulatory framework.then we will turn to the factual and procedural background of the case.
congress enacted the clean air act amendments of seeking to guarantee the prompt attainment and maintenance of specified air quality standards.alaska dep t of envtl.conservation epa,quoting union epa.to that end,it directed epa to devise national ambient air quality standards naaqs limiting various pollutants,which the states were obliged to implement and enforce.envtl.defense duke energy,citing.
a central part of the caa regulatory scheme was the new source performance standards nsps program,which required epa to develop performance standards designed to limit emissions from major new sources of pollution.chevron,natural res.defense council,see b.new sources include both newly constructed facilities and those that have been modified such that their emissions increase.duke energy,at citing a.it is unlawful for any owner or operator of any new source to operate such source in violation of applicable performance standards.e.
the supreme court has pointed out that the nsps program did too little to achieve the ambitious goals of the amendments.duke energy,at quoting belden,clean air act alteration omitted.merely setting emissions limits failed to improve air quality in those areas that had already attained the minimum standards of the naaqs because polluters had no incentive to diminish emissions below the established limits.congress therefore amended the caa again in to add the prevention of significant deterioration psd program,which seeks to ensure that the air quality floor established by the naaqs does not in effect become a ceiling.sierra club thomas.
under the psd program,n o major emitting facility may be constructed or modified unless it meets certain preconditions.a c the term construction includes modification.among the preconditions relevant here are that the facility must obtain a permit setting forth applicable emission limitations,a,and that it must be subject to best available control technology bact,a.bact,despite what the term implies,is not a particular type of technology.rather,it is an emission limitation based on the maximum degree of reduction of each pollutant subject to regulation which the permitting authority,on a basis,taking into account energy,environmental,and economic impacts and other costs,determines is achievable for the facility in question.id.
the psd program is primarily implemented by the states through state implementation plans sips.id.states have broad discretion in designing their sips,but the plans must include certain federal standards and are subject to epa review and approval.see alaska dep t of envtl.conservation,at.at all times relevant to this case,south dakota had not yet incorporated approved psd provisions into its sip and the federal psd regulations set forth at therefore govern this case.see id.a 
in congress again amended the caa to require each covered facility to obtain a comprehensive operating permit setting forth all caa standards applicable to that facility.see a.these title v permits do not generally impose any new emission limits,but are simply intended to incorporate into a single document all of the caa requirements governing a facility.see romoland sch.dist.inland empire energy,llc,cir.similar to other caa programs,title v is implemented primarily by the states under epa oversight.see id.in states with epa approved programs,title v permits are issued by the state permitting authority,but are subject to epa review and veto.see id.at.
the big stone generating station is a megawatt coal fired power plant located in big stone city,south dakota otter tail power company operates the plant,which it jointly owns with mdu resources group and northwestern energy the three appellees will be collectively referred to as otter tail.big stone has undergone various physical and operational modifications since it began operating in.sierra club alleges that three of those modifications triggered psd and nsps obligations which otter tail has violated.
the first modification at issue was a change in the primary fuel used at big stone.the plant was originally designed to burn lignite coal,but in it switched to subbituminous coal.sierra club claims that this significantly increased big stone emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter,meaning that otter tail was required to obtain a psd permit before making the change.otter tail did not seek one.
in big stone boiler was modified to increase the surface area of its primary superheater.sierra club claims that this modification increased the plant emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides and that otter tail was accordingly obligated to obtain a psd permit for it.otter tail did not apply for such a permit.
finally,in big stone underwent physical and operational modifications to allow it to supply steam to a nearby ethanol plant.otter tail applied to the south dakota department of environment and natural resources denr the agency responsible for administering south dakota title v an amendment to its title v permit to allow the ethanol plant project.denr invited public comment on the permit application,but sierra club did not participate in the permitting process.after evaluating the proposed project and concluding that it did not involve modifications that triggered nsps or psd requirements,denr approved the amended permit.sierra club now alleges that the ethanol plant project did trigger nsps and psd obligations.
sierra club commenced this suit in june under the caa citizen suit provision,a,seeking assessment of civil penalties against otter tail as well as declaratory and injunctive relief.it alleged that otter tail had violated the caa by failing to obtain psd permits before commencing the three modifications described above.it also claimed that otter tail continued to violate the caa by operating without permits and without abiding by the bact emission limits which would have been imposed as part of the psd permitting process.finally,sierra club alleged that big stone was operating in violation of nsps limits triggered by the ethanol plant project.
otter tail moved to dismiss,arguing that sierra club psd claims were untimely and that the nsps claim was an impermissible collateral attack on otter tail operating permit.the district court granted the motion.it interpreted the caa psd provisions as imposing upon operators only a one time obligation to obtain a permit before construction or modification of a facility,as opposed to imposing ongoing conditions on its operation.it reasoned that any violation of these provisions would have thus occurred when modifications were commenced.since the last modification was begun in,sierra club psd civil penalty claims were barred by the five year statute of limitations in.although does not apply to equitable relief,the district court decided that sierra club claims for equitable relief were foreclosed under the concurrent remedy doctrine because its civil penalty claims were time barred.
the district court dismissed the nsps claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.because that claim essentially attacks the terms of otter tail amended title v permit rather than otter tail compliance with the permit,the district court concluded that sierra club should have raised the nsps issue in administrative proceedings during the permitting process.since judicial review of issues that may be raised through that process is vested exclusively in the courts of appeals,the district court determined that it lacked jurisdiction over the nsps claim.
the district court denied sierra club subsequent motion for reconsideration under.e,and sierra club timely appealed.it advances three arguments on appeal.first,it maintains that the caa psd provisions establish ongoing conditions on the operation of polluting facilities.otter tail continues to violate those conditions each day that it operates,sierra club argues,and therefore the psd civil penalty claims are timely.second,it contends that the district court misapplied the concurrent remedy doctrine and that its claims for equitable relief are timely even if its psd civil penalty claims are not.finally,sierra club argues that the district court erred in concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the nsps claim related to the modifications at big stone.
we address each of these three arguments in turn.in doing so,we accept as true the complaint factual allegations and review de novo the district court legal conclusions.braden,at.
we first consider whether sierra club timely asserted its claims for civil penalties under the clean air act psd provisions.the caa itself establishes no limitation period for the commencement of citizen suits.the parties agree,however,that the general federal statute of limitations at applies.see parks conservation,tennessee valley authority,cir parks cir.section provides that an action,suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any civil fine,penalty,or forfeiture shall not be entertained unless commenced within five years from the date when the claim first accrued 
a claim first accrues as soon as the right to institute and maintain a suit arises.konecny united states,cir.a provides that n o major emitting facility may be constructed unless it meets the various psd requirements,and the caa citizen suit provision authorizes suit against any person who proposes to construct or constructs any new or modified major emitting facility without a psd permit id.a.it is thus clear that each of sierra club psd claims first accrued upon commencement of the relevant modification at big stone 
since the last of the modifications at issue here were done in and sierra club did not file suit until,its civil penalty claims are barred by unless it can identify a wrongful act that took place within five years of its filing.parks conservation,tennessee valley authority parks cir,cir.sierra club maintains that it can.it reads a and related regulations to prohibit operation of a facility without a psd permit and the bact emission limits that come with it,rather than only prohibiting construction or modification without satisfying those requirements.sierra club contends that otter tail violates the a new claim day that big stone operates without the applicable permits.
we are thus presented with a pure question of statutory interpretation.do the caa and related regulations prohibit only construction or modification of a facility without a psd permit and bact,or do they impose ongoing operational requirements if they apply only to construction and modification,sierra club psd civil penalty claims are time barred.if they impose operational requirements,however,the psd claims would still be viable.this is a question of first impression in our circuit.two other courts of appeals have addressed it and have reached different conclusions.compare parks,at finding that psd regulations in tennessee sip impose ongoing duties to obtain a psd permit and apply bact,with parks,at finding no ongoing obligations in alabama sip.each side in this case urges reliance on the precedent supporting its desired outcome 
we begin our inquiry with the language of the statute.as already indicated,the operative statutory provision states that n o major emitting facility may be constructed without meeting the psd requirements.a emphasis added.this language unambiguously indicates that the psd requirements are conditions of construction,not operation.see parks,at v iolations of the preconstruction permitting requirements occur at the time of construction,not on a continuing basis.quoting new york niagara mohawk power,d,united states.power,d,t he plain language of the psd provisions demonstrates that any preconstruction violation occurs when the actual construction is commenced,and not at some later point in time.see also sierra club franklin county power of,llc,cir.
the language of the caa citizen suit provision is similarly limited to construction or modification,for it authorizes suit against any person who proposes to construct or constructs a facility without a permit.a emphasis added.thus,neither the statutory provision that creates the legal duty at issue here nor the provision for private enforcement gives any indication that the caa imposes ongoing operational conditions under the psd program.in short,o peration of a facility without a permit is not articulated as a basis for a violation under either a or a.parks,at 
our interpretation of a and a is bolstered by the observation that other parts of the caa clearly establish operational conditions,and they do so by employing plain and explicit language.e makes it unlawful to operate a facility in violation of nsps.title v likewise prohibits operat ion except in compliance with a permit id.a a.where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.russello united states,alteration and citation omitted.the fact that these sections actually use the word operate supports the inference that the term was intentionally omitted from the psd provisions.where congress has intended to establish operational conditions under the clean air act,it has clearly said so.but it has not done so for the psd program.
sierra club contends,however,that several regulatory provisions establish an ongoing duty for a polluting facility to obtain a psd permit and to employ bact as conditions of operation.it points first to a section of south dakota sip which provides that a person may not construct,install,modify,revise,or operate any source or unit until the applicable preconstruction permit or part operating permit has been issued admin.sierra club argues that this rule prohibits operation without a permit,but a close reading shows that interpretation is incorrect.
rule addresses preconstruction permits and operating permits in the says a source may not be operated until the applicable preconstruction permit or operating permit is issued emphasis added.sierra club reads those requirements in the conjunctive,effectively replacing or with and.in fact the rule simply says that a facility must have the permit applicable to the activity it seeks to construction or it does not indicate which permit is applicable to which activity.it thus provides no interpretive guidance here.
sierra club next points to a provision in the federal psd regulations which it contends establishes an ongoing duty to obtain a permit.r provides 
any owner or operator who constructs or operates a source or modification not in accordance with the application submitted pursuant to this section or with the terms of any approval to construct,or any owner or operator of a source or modification subject to this section who commences construction without applying for and receiving approval hereunder,shall be subject to appropriate enforcement action.
some courts have read similar language in state sips to mean that it is unlawful to operate a facility not in accordance with an approved psd permit.see,united states.power coop,d,construing materially identical provision in kentucky sip.once again,a close reading of the regulation reveals flaws in such an interpretation.with respect to operation,r requires compliance with two specific items the permit application submitted and any approval to construct.these provisions do not by their terms establish a freestanding duty to obtain a permit.instead,they presume a permit application has been submitted and require operation in compliance with refer to the application submitted,not an application.power,d at concluding that analogous kentucky regulation prohibits operation not in accordance with a submitted application emphasis added.
insofar as r imposes an obligation to obtain a permit in the first place which it does in its second clause,it ties that obligation explicitly to construction and not operation,subjecting to enforcement action any owner or operator who commences construction without applying for and receiving approval.the clear language of this regulation is thus consistent with our interpretation of a and a.read as a whole,r obliges a facility to obtain a permit before commencing construction and requires that,having done so,the facility operate in accordance with the permit application and approval.where,as here,the operator never applied for any psd permits,there is no application and no approval with which it can comply.thus,while otter tail may have violated r by failing to apply for psd permits in the first place,it does not continue to do so by failing to comply with a hypothetical set of operational parameters that would have been developed through the permitting process.
sierra club also argues that j imposes an ongoing duty to employ bact,regardless of whether a facility obtained a psd permit before construction or modification.that regulation provides that a major modification shall apply best available control technology for each regulated nsr pollutant this requirement applies to each proposed emissions unit at which a net emissions increase in the pollutant would occur as a result of a physical change or change in the method of operation in the unit.emphasizing the imperative phrase shall apply,the sixth circuit interpreted similar language in tennessee sip as creating an ongoing obligation to apply bact,regardless of what terms a preconstruction permit may or may not contain.parks,at.
we can not agree with this interpretation.the context of j shows that the command to apply bact is not a freestanding requirement.rather,it is tied specifically to the construction process.subsection j applies to each proposed unit emphasis added see parks,at.in addition,a ii provides that paragraphs j through r of this section apply to the construction of any new major stationary source or the major modification of any existing major stationary source in light of these provisions,j is best understood as requiring that bact limits be incorporated into a facility construction plans and psd permits,not as establishing an ongoing duty to apply bact independent of the permitting process.
this conclusion is bolstered by the practical nature of bact.bact limits are tailored to each facility on a basis during the psd permitting process.see also b.they are thus inextricably linked to the permitting process.having determined that there is no ongoing duty to obtain psd permits,it would make little sense to conclude that otter tail must nevertheless abide by the bact limits which are a product of such permits.see parks,at finding no ongoing duty to apply bact where sip did not provide a way for a party who had undertaken a modification to obtain a determination of bact limits outside the preconstruction permitting process.the duty to obtain a psd permit and the duty to apply bact are most sensibly construed as going hand in hand.
the sixth circuit national parks decision is distinguishable from the present case for this very reason.that decision relied on a provision in the tennessee sip which allowed for the issuance of a psd permit even after construction had been completed to assure that regulatory requirements are met.parks,at quoting.comp.regs.e.because this rule would allow a facility to obtain a determination of bact limits through a postconstruction permitting process,the sixth circuit conclusion that in tennessee there were ongoing duties both to obtain a permit and to employ bact made sense.sierra club has pointed to no similar rule in south dakota,and its contention that there is an independent ongoing duty to apply bact is therefore not persuasive.parks,at distinguishing sixth circuit decision because alabama sip lacked provision similar to e.
finally,sierra club and epa as amicus curiae argue that the caa and psd regulations should be interpreted as establishing operational duties because the purpose of the psd program is to limit emissions on a continuous basis and because psd permits impose requirements on the operation of the facilities they govern.some district courts have taken this approach.see,united states duke energy,d,united states ohio edison,wl,at.while it is true that psd permits establish emission limits and thus regulate operation,that does not compel the conclusion sierra club reaches.even though the preconstruction permitting process may establish obligations which continue to govern a facility operation after construction,that does not necessarily mean that such parameters are enforceable independent of the permitting process.see parks,at t he statutory provisions governing preconstruction requirements can not reasonably be construed to mean that building or altering a machine without a permit is a violation that continues as long as the machine exists or is operated.quoting.power,d at.
for these reasons we conclude that the plain language of the statute and the regulations applicable to otter tail prohibited only modification of the big stone plant without a psd permit or bact,not its operation if otter tail violated the caa psd provisions,it did so more than five years before sierra club brought this action.accordingly,sierra club claims for civil penalties for otter tail alleged psd violations are barred by the five year statute of limitations in.
we next consider the district court dismissal of sierra club claims for equitable relief based on otter tail alleged psd violations.by its terms applies only to claims for any civil fine,penalty,or forfeiture,and therefore does not bar equitable remedies.parks,at.the district court nevertheless dismissed sierra club claims for declaratory and injunctive relief under the concurrent remedy doctrine.that doctrine,as explained by the eleventh circuit,provides that where a party legal remedies are,that party concurrent equitable claims generally are barred as well.id.because the civil penalty claims were barred by,the district court concluded that the concurrent equitable relief sierra club sought was barred as well.
sierra club argues that the district court misapplied the concurrent remedy doctrine.it contends that the doctrine applies only to equitable remedies that are similar in nature to the legal remedy sought.sierra club argues that the equitable relief it seeks is different in nature and serves different purposes than the civil penalties and is thus not concurrent.otter tail maintains in contrast that regardless of the different natures of the remedies,the doctrine applies whenever equitable relief could be available for the same cause of action as a time barred legal remedy.
while sierra club understanding of the concurrent remedy doctrine has limited support,see united states cinergy,d,the great weight of authority supports otter tail view.in russell todd,the supreme court explained that when the equity jurisdiction of the federal court is concurrent with that at law,or the suit is brought in aid of a legal right,equity will withhold its remedy if the legal right is barred by the local statute of limitations.numerous federal courts have understood this principle to bar equitable relief wherever time barred legal remedies would have been available to vindicate the same right.for example,in saffron dep t of the navy,the plaintiff sued for wrongful discharge,seeking both reinstatement and damages.id.at.the court reasoned that while the former remedy was equitable and the latter legal,there was in fact but a single right and a single default involved.id.at alteration and citation omitted.this,the court determined,was the kind of parallelism that demonstrates applicability of the concurrency rule.id.citing russell,at.
other circuits have applied the doctrine similarly.see,williams walsh,cir section plaint
