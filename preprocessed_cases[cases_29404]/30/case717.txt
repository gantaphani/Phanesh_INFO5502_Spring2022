avenal power center llc avenal power applied to the united states environmental protection agency epa for a prevention of significant deterioration permit permit,to build and operate the avenal energy project,a megawatt natural power plant in the city of avenal,california.although epa had a statutory duty under the clean air act to either grant or deny the permit application within one year,c,it failed to do so.after the deadline passed but before taking any final action,epa tightened the applicable air quality standards.avenal power filed suit and sought to compel epa to issue the permit under the old standards that would have applied had epa acted within the statutory deadline.initially,epa responded that it could not legally do so,because the clean air act explicitly requires any newly constructed facility to employ the best available control technology bact for regulated pollutants and meet air quality standards in effect at the time a permit is issued.see a.months later,however,epa reversed course and granted avenal power the permit without regard to the new regulations,which by then had gone into effect.epa contends that,under narrow circumstances,it has the authority to grandfather certain permit applications like avenal power,and that its decision is entitled to deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d.the sierra club,greenaction for health and environmental justice,center for biological diversity,and el pueblo para el aire y agua limpio collectively petitioners,challenge epa action.
applying chevron,we hold that the clean air act unambiguously requires avenal power to demonstrate that the avenal energy project complies with the regulations in effect at the time the permit is issued.because congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,chevron,at,epa can not waive this requirement.we therefore grant the petition for review,vacate the decision to issue the permit,and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
avenal power proposes to build and operate a power plant,the avenal energy project,near the agricultural communities of avenal,huron,and kettleman city,within california san joaquin valley pollution control district.the facility would generate electricity from two megawatt natural gas combustion turbine generators,and a megawatt steam turbine generator that utilizes heat from the combustion turbines.according to epa,the facility will be equipped with control technology and will be one of the lowest emitting power plants of its kind.it is undisputed,however,that its expected emissions of several pollutants,including nitrogen dioxide,carbon dioxide,and sulfur dioxide,are sufficient to subject it to regulation under the clean air act.
on february,avenal power submitted an application to epa for a permit.the regional administrator determined the application to be administratively complete on march.as of that date,epa had not yet promulgated national ambient air quality standards naaqs for or emissions,or bact requirements for greenhouse gases,including.naaqs,which are regularly reviewed and revised by the epa administrator,set hourly limits on the emission of designated pollutants.see,d b.the bact requirement consists of an emission limitation based on the maximum degree of reduction of each regulated pollutant that epa determines is achievable through application of production processes and available methods,systems,and techniques in view of energy,environmental,and economic impacts and other costs.
on june,after the decision making period had elapsed,see c,the regional administrator finally issued a statement of basis describing the reasons for the proposed approval of the permit.the statement of basis is subject to notice and comment procedures that afford the public an opportunity to participate in the review process by submitting written comments and appearing at a hearing to voice support or concern.see a.during the comment period in this case,epa held an informational meeting and two hearings.concerned that the avenal energy project would adversely impact the environment and health and quality of life of local residents,petitioners filed comments opposing issuance of the permit.
while avenal power permit application was still under consideration,epa adopted more stringent naaqs and revised the bact requirement.specifically,epa tightened naaqs for,capping hourly emissions at parts per billion ppb,with the new regulations to take effect on april.see primary national ambient air quality standards for nitrogen dioxide.epa further subjected greenhouse gases such as to bact requirements,effective january.see reconsideration of interpretation of regulations that determine pollutants covered by clean air act permitting programs.finally,epa published a final rule establishing a new hourly naaqs of ppb,to become effective august.see primary national ambient air quality standards for sulfur dixoide.june.
facing a slew of new regulations,and frustrated by the delay,avenal power filed suit on march,in the united states district court for the district of columbia,to compel epa to issue the permit.two months later,epa requested that avenal power complete a cumulative air impact assessment of the avenal energy project hourly emissions to address its compliance with the revised naaqs.although avenal power cooperated and submitted additional documentation,the process took months.
in late august,after the new and naaqs had gone into effect,avenal power requested an expedited judgment on the pleadings from the district court in an effort to compel epa to issue the permit without consideration of the newly effective regulations.epa opposed the motion,arguing that even though it missed the statutory deadline to act on avenal power application,the clean air act prohibits the agency from granting the permit unless avenal power complies with the superseding standards.in support of its position,epa cited public guidance issued by the director of its office of air quality planning and standards see memorandum from stephen page,epa office of air quality planning and standards,applicability of the federal prevention of significant deterioration permit requirements to new and revised national ambient air quality standards,hereinafter page memo,available at http.epa also promised the district court it would issue a final decision by december,that is,before the revised regulations on greenhouse gases went into effect on january.it eventually became clear,however,that a final decision would not be forthcoming by that date,further forestalling administrative proceedings and sure enough,the deadline passed without a final decision.
at this point,after conducting what it described as a policy review,epa reversed course.in a declaration submitted to the district court,epa contended that epa believes it is appropriate to grandfather,exempt,avenal power application from the and hourly naaqs,and the bact requirement for greenhouse gases.epa concluded that it possessed inherent grandfathering authority even absent express authorization under the clean air act or related regulations.the epa administrator then transferred authority to issue a final decision on avenal power application from the regional administrator for region to the assistant administrator for the office of air and radiation.consistent with its representation to the district court,epa issued a supplemental statement of basis proposing to grandfather the application under the old air quality standards in effect at the time the application was submitted.
petitioners submitted comments to epa objecting to issuance of the permit,and epa assertion of grandfathering authority.on may,as the administrative process continued to drag on,the district court granted in part avenal power motion for judgment on the pleadings and ordered the epa administrator to render a decision by may,and a final,agency action ripe for judicial review by august.the next day,the assistant administrator for the office and air and radiation published epa responses to the public comments,and issued the permit.
petitioners appealed to the environmental appeals board,which declined to exercise jurisdiction to review epa asserted grandfathering authority,given the time constraint imposed by the d.district court for a final administrative action,but otherwise upheld issuance of the permit petitioners timely filed two separate petitions for judicial review,chiefly challenging epa interpretation of its statutory authority under the clean air act.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to b,and consolidated the two petitions for review.avenal power successfully moved to intervene in these proceedings,and the united association of plumbers and pipefitters local,international brotherhood of electric workers local,and insulators local successfully moved to file a brief as amici curiae.
as an initial matter,avenal power,though not epa,suggests that petitioners lack standing.it falls to petitioners,as the parties invoking federal jurisdiction,to demonstrate standing lujan defenders of wildlife,d.however,only one petitioner must establish standing to enable review.massachusetts epa,d.
an association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right,the interests at stake are germane to the organization purpose,and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.wilderness soc y,rey,cir quoting friends of the earth,laidlaw envt l servs.toc,d.the record reflects,and avenal power does not dispute,that the interests at stake are germane to petitioners organizational interests,and that personal participation by petitioners individual members is not necessary.id.
the only question remaining,therefore,is whether petitioners individual members have standing in their own right.on that score,petitioners must first show that their members have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of id.citing simon.welfare rights,d.and finally,the injury will likely be redressed by a favorable decision.id.at internal quotation marks omitted citing simon,at.
we first consider whether petitioners,through the declarations of their members,have established an injury in fact.an individual bringing a substantive claim related to environmental harms may establish an injury in fact by showing a connection to the area of concern sufficient to make credible the connection that the person life will be less enjoyable that he or she really has or will suffer in his or her degree of aesthetic or recreational satisfaction if the area in question remains or becomes environmentally degraded.watersheds project kraayenbrink,cir quoting ecol.rights found.pac.lumber,cir.in addition,evidence of a credible threat to the plaintiff physical from airborne pollutants may establish an injury in fact.hall norton,cir.
here,although we have doubts as to the sierra club standing,we are satisfied that greenaction for health and environmental justice,center for biological diversity,and el pueblo para el aire y agua limpio,possess associational standing to challenge epa action.
marciela mares alatorre,the leader of el pueblo para el aire y agua limpio,lives in kettleman city,which is located approximately miles from the site of the avenal energy project.she was recently diagnosed with breathing difficulty and symptoms that indicate asthma,problems she avers are exacerbated when the air is more polluted.she fears that the pollution expected from the avenal energy project will impair her health.likewise,mavi sandoval,a member of el pueblo para el aire y agua limpio,as well as center for biological diversity,lives in kettleman city,works in avenal,and states that she is concerned that her respiratory problems will also be exacerbated by pollution from the proposed plant.maria saucedo,a member of greenaction for health and environmental justice,lives in avenal and avers that her husband and daughter suffer from serious respiratory problems associated with air pollution.she believes that air pollution created by the proposed facility may further jeopardize the health of her family,and impact her husband ability to work.these health threats are credible,concrete,and,assuming the project goes forward,imminent in sum,cognizable injuries in fact.id.
as to causation and redressability,it is undisputed that the avenal energy project will generate many tons of air pollutants known to threaten public health,including and.further,epa implemented the revised and hourly naaqs precisely because exposure to those pollutants at ambient levels is associated with asthma and other respiratory ailments.see u.a a commanding epa administrator to identify and regulate emissions which,in his judgment,cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare see also primary national ambient air quality standards for nitrogen dixoide.at concluding that exposure to ambient or concentrations of increased airway irritation for asthmatic individuals,and primary national ambient air quality standards for sulfur dixoide.at finding causal relationship between exposure to ambient and asthma and other respiratory symptoms.epa also noted in its supplemental statement of basis that exposure to likely causes adverse effects on the respiratory system.given this record,we have little trouble concluding that and emissions from the proposed project will likely cause the identified injuries.indeed,remedying such injuries is exactly the purpose and function of these particular emissions limits,and more broadly,the clean air act.it is therefore sufficiently clear that judicial review of epa refusal to enforce the relevant regulations will provide petitioners members with redress.
accordingly,we conclude that at least greenaction for health and environmental justice,center for biological diversity,and el pueblo para el aire y agua limpio,have association standing to proceed.we need not decide whether sierra club has standing.see kaahumanu hawaii,cir citing watt energy educ,d because we hold that one plaintiff has article iii standing,we need not reach the question whether another plaintiff also has article iii standing.
we now turn to the substance of petitioners challenge,that is,whether epa exceeded its authority under the clean air act.when we review an agency interpretation of a statute that it is responsible for administering,f irst,always,is the question whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.only if the statute is silent or ambiguous,id.at,must we decide how much weight to accord an agency interpretation.mcmaster united states,cir quoting tualatin valley builders supply,united states,cir.
epa contends there is ambiguity or tension between two mandates in the clean air act one,requiring it to enforce current naaqs and bact requirements,a,and the other,requiring epa to act on applications within one year,id.c.more specifically,epa argues that the statute does not specify what it should do when,as was the case here,it failed to act by the statutory deadline,and revised air standards have been promulgated since the deadline passed.thus,the argument goes,epa decision to grant avenal power the permit is entitled to chevron deference.petitioners,on the other hand,insist that the statutory language is clear epa must enforce the regulations in effect at the time the permit was issued.
we begin with the statute to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning barnhart sigmon coal,d quoting robinson shell oil,d.in so inquiring,we must endeavor to read the clean air act as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme,fda brown williamson tobacco,d quoting gustafson alloyd,d,and fit,if possible,all parts into a harmonious whole.id.quoting ftc
