introduction 
in,the city of pacifica city issued a development permit to plaintiff and appellant north pacifica llc north pacifica authorizing north pacifica to construct a residential development on coastal property within the city.a city resident filed an appeal with the california coastal commission commission challenging the validity of the permit.ensuing litigation delayed any action on the appeal until december,at which time the commission determined it had jurisdiction over the appeal and sent out notice of a hearing on the appeal.north pacifica objected to the notice as untimely,but the commission proceeded with the north pacifica protest and without its that the appeal raised a substantial issue warranting a subsequent de novo hearing on the merits.
at north pacifica request,the commission postponed the de novo hearing to allow north pacifica to prepare for the hearing.north pacifica,however,subsequently objected to the commission holding the de novo hearing on the ground that the commission had lost any jurisdiction it may have had over the appeal because of the untimely notice of the first hearing on the appeal.north pacifica filed a petition for writ of mandate and a complaint for declaratory relief in the trial court seeking to prohibit the commission from holding the de novo hearing.but before the trial court could rule on the merits of north pacifica civil action,the commission held the de novo hearing on the without north pacifica denied the permit application.thereafter,the trial court held a hearing on the merits of north pacifica petition and complaint in the civil action and entered a judgment denying the petition and other claims for relief.
north pacifica appeals from that judgment on several grounds,including the contention that the commission did not substantially comply with statutory and regulatory notice requirements in connection with the first hearing on the appeal,thereby invalidating all of the subsequent actions taken by the commission on the appeal and divesting the commission of any jurisdiction over the appeal.we hold that the commission substantially complied with the statutory and regulatory notice requirements upon which north pacifica relies and that,in any event,north pacifica was not prejudiced by the commission technical noncompliance with those requirements.we therefore affirm the judgment.
factual background 
appeal to the commission 
north pacifica applied for and obtained a coastal development permit cdp from the city in the summer of authorizing north pacifica to develop a housing project on a site in the city known as the bowl property.john curtis,a resident of the city,appealed the city approval of the project to the commission curtis appeal.because the city contended that its decision to issue the cdp for the bowl project was not appealable,the commission scheduled a hearing in december to determine initially whether the city decision was within the commission appellate jurisdiction.the commission also suspended the cdp pending the outcome of the appealability determination and any subsequent appeal.
north pacifica responded by filing actions in state and federal court challenging the commission authority to hold any hearings on its cdp.those actions and related appellate proceedings,which were resolved against north pacifica and in favor of the commission,delayed the appealability hearing before the commission until december.on that date,the commission determined that the city decision to approve the cdp was within its appellate jurisdiction.the commission also determined that the curtis appeal would be deemed filed as of december,for purposes of calculating the period within which to set a hearing on the appeal pursuant to public resources code section based on that december,filing date,the commission calculated that it had through and including february,to hold a hearing on the curtis appeal.
on december,the commission sent a notice to the city entitled commission notification of appeal.the notice was addressed to the city planner and identified north pacifica cdp and the bowl project.it also stated that the commission hearing date has been tentatively set for january,in san pedro.the notice further required the city to provide the commission with copies of all relevant documents and materials used in the city consideration of north pacifica cdp the notice concluded by advising that a commission staff report and notice of the hearing will be forwarded to you prior to the hearing.the notice was mailed to keith fromm,one of the two principals of north pacifica,at la salle avenue,oakland,california.robert kalmbach,north pacifica other principal,explained that the la salle address was a post office box that kalmbach maintained on behalf of north pacifica.
according to the commission,staff mailed the december,notification to the address on file for north pacifica,which is the same address to which various previous documents,including both previous meeting notices,had been mailed.fromm testified,however,that his office is in westwood,california,that he had recently requested that notices from the commission be mailed to that address,and that he did not receive the december notice prior to january.jaquelynn pope,north pacifica outside counsel,also denied receiving a copy of the december,notice prior to january.and kalmbach testified that although he eventually saw a copy of the december notice when he checked the oakland post office box on january,he did not read it carefully.
on december,the commission posted the agenda for its january meeting on its website the posted agenda explained that new appeals were processed as follows when staff recommends the finding of a substantial issue,a public hearing on the question will only be held if or more commissioners ask for it.if three or more commissioners do not request a hearing on the substantial issue question,the matter automatically proceeds to de novo public hearing either at this or a later commission meeting.
on friday,december,the commission posted on its website the report on the curtis appeal prepared by the commission staff staff,which report listed the hearing date for the,the first page.the report contained extensive detail concerning the staff analysis of the issues raised by the curtis appeal.
on the next business day,january,the commission mailed out a formal notice of the hearing on the curtis appeal entitled important public hearing notice new appeal.according to north pacifica,neither its principals nor its outside counsel received this notice until january.
on january,both is an attorney and acts as north pacifica corporate pope filed formal,written objections to the hearing on the curtis appeal.both objections asserted that the january,notice of hearing on the curtis appeal violated california code of regulations,title,section in that it was mailed less than days prior to the hearing and therefore provided north pacifica with insufficient time to prepare for the hearing.pope attached to her objection the declarations of two environmental consultants,each of whom stated that he needed more time to prepare for the hearing.both objections asserted that the commission lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal due to the defective notice and demanded that the hearing not take place.neither objection requested a continuance or proposed alternative dates for the hearing.
the commission responded the same day,stating that commission staff does not understand north pacifica objections to be requesting postponement of the hearing until a later date.if north pacifica does wish to postpone the hearing,please notify the staff immediately.north pacifica did not respond to the commission letter.
on january,the commission convened a public meeting at which it addressed the curtis appeal.in response to north pacifica objections,the staff reported to the commission that we have asked north pacifica,yesterday,whether they would like to request postponement of the hearing,to provide them more time to respond,but we have not heard back from them on that request.in order to postpone,they would have to waive the hearing rule for an appeal,so lacking that postponement request from north pacifica,we are here today.we have also examined the claim of defective notice that north pacifica makes,and while it is true that the paper notice of this hearing was not timely mailed to north pacifica,we believe north pacifica,nonetheless,had constructive notice of this hearing by other means,including the notification of the appeal that was mailed to north pacifica on december.that notice indicated that the appeal was tentatively set for this date,january through the.the staff therefore concluded that based on our belief that north pacifica had adequate notice of this hearing,as well as time to address the question of whether there are wetlands on the bowl project site,and that they have not responded to our request to postpone the substantial issue hearing,we are recommending that the commission consider the substantial issue question.however,given north pacifica clear statements about the need for more time to address the merits of the de novo hearing,we would recommend that the commission postpone the de novo hearing to a later date to allow the applicant sufficient time to prepare.
after considering the recommendations of the commission staff and chief counsel,the chairman inquired if there were three or more commissioners who wanted to hold a hearing on the question of whether the curtis appeal raised a substantial issue.when none of the commissioners requested a hearing,the chairman concluded,seeing no request for a hearing,a substantial issue is found.the commission then followed the staff recommendation and postponed the de novo hearing on the merits of the appeal to allow north pacifica adequate time to prepare.
on february,pope wrote to the commission on behalf of north pacifica and advised that north pacifica can not,as set forth below,even under protest and full reservation of rights,adequately respond to the issues raised by the staff report until after april.accordingly,pope asked the commission to please confirm that the de novo hearing will not be calendared for any meeting prior to may.the commission thereafter set the de novo hearing on the curtis appeal for may.
on may,pope sent the commission a letter objecting to the commission holding the de novo hearing on may,on the grounds that each of the commissioners had violated the open meetings sic act and the commission own regulations when they found at the january,hearing that the curtis appeal raised a substantial issue.among other things,pope accused the commission of engaging in unfair tactics in connection with the civil action that north pacifica had filed in the superior court of los angeles county on march.according to pope,north pacifica had scheduled a hearing on the merits of its civil sought,inter alia,to enjoin the commission from holding the may de novo april,but due to the commission filing of a motion to change venue,that hearing had been vacated pending the june,hearing on the commission venue motion.pope demanded that the commission dismiss the curtis appeal because the january,substantial issue finding was void,and the statute of limitations had run on the appeal,thereby divesting the commission of jurisdiction to hear it.
on may,the commission convened a public meeting at which it went forward with the de novo hearing on the curtis appeal.north pacifica did not attend the meeting or submit any materials for consideration by the commission.the commission noted north pacifica objections to the hearing and found that the commission had substantially complied with the hearing notice requirements for the curtis appeal.the commission then denied north pacifica permit application because the bowl project is inconsistent with the policies of the city local coastal program lcp concerning protection of wetlands,water quality and esha.according to the commission,the p roject revisions necessary to bring the development into conformity with the certified lcp while feasible,would involve substantial site design and engineering work.such fundamental project revisions are beyond the scope of project changes typically achieved through conditions of approval on a permit application.rather,it is the project applicant responsibility to revise the project plans to address the issues that the commission has identified.
north pacifica did not avail itself of the opportunity to redesign the bowl project to address the issues the commission had identified.instead,it chose to pursue its civil action in the trial court.
civil action 
in march,north pacifica filed a petition for writ of mandate and a complaint for declaratory relief in the trial court seeking,inter alia,i a writ commanding the commission to vacate the actions taken at the january,meeting with respect to the curtis appeal and to dismiss the curtis appeal ii a judicial declaration that the actions taken by the commission at the january,meeting with respect to the curtis appeal were null and void and that by virtue of the defective notice of the first hearing the commission had lost any jurisdiction it may have had over the curtis appeal,and iii an injunction prohibiting the commission from holding a de novo hearing on the curtis appeal.in june,north pacifica amended its petition and complaint to add claims challenging the validity of the commission actions taken at the may,meeting with respect to the de novo hearing on the curtis appeal.
on january,the trial court held a hearing on north pacifica petition and complaint.by a minute order entered that same day,the trial court denied north pacifica petition and requests for relief in the complaint.on april,the trial court entered an amended statement of decision and a judgment.in its amended statement of decision,the trial court found that north pacifica was equitably estopped from challenging the commission actions at the may,de novo hearing on the curtis appeal and that north pacifica had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies.
north pacifica filed its notice of appeal from the judgment on may.
discussion 
standards of review 
as the parties agree,with the exception of the trial court ruling granting the commission leave to amend to conform to proof,each of north pacifica challenges to the other rulings of the trial court raise issues of law subject to a de novo standard of review because the material facts are undisputed.see lisa henry mayo newhall memorial hospital cal th,d,when the facts are undisputed and no conflicting inferences can be drawn,the issue becomes one of law see titan electric los angeles unified school dist.th,fn,d of course,on issues of law our review is de novo.if we reach north pacifica challenge to the trial court ruling granting the commission leave to amend its return to plead equitable estoppel,we would review such a ruling for abuse of discretion.see hunt smyth d.when an order granting or denying leave to amend is attacked on appeal the reviewing court will uphold the trial court action unless an abuse of discretion is clearly shown.
procedures 
the commission argues that north pacifica claims under government code section,subdivision a seeking a writ of mandamus,declaratory relief,and an injunction were procedurally defective.according to the commission,north pacifica was required at the conclusion of the administrative proceedings to raise its contentions by a petition for writ of administrative mandamus under code of civil procedure section,instead of by a code of civil procedure section petition for a writ or by a complaint in equity for declaratory relief.we disagree.
the act,in government code section,subdivision a,authorizes any interested person to pursue a civil action to nullify state actions taken in violation of government code sections and state actions that violate those open meeting and notice provisions can be challenged by way of mandamus,injunction,or declaratory relief.there is no express statutory language requiring the interested person to proceed by way of administrative mandamus in making such a challenge.
the civil action authorized by section government code section,subdivision a must be commenced within days from the date the challenged state action was taken.that narrow time frame for bringing an action to nullify under government code section manifests a legislative intent that such actions be commenced and resolved promptly.requiring an interested party to proceed in court by way of administrative the commission impractical in view of the time limitation especially because the administrative process and preparation of the administrative record alone generally takes more than days from the type of state action challenged here.
north pacifica action in the trial court did not challenge the substance of the commission findings at either the january,or may,hearings by,for example,contending that those findings were not supported by substantial evidence.instead,north pacifica action sought to nullify the administrative proceedings at which those findings were made by making a direct challenge to the commission jurisdiction to hold such hearings.proceeding in that manner is consistent with the remedial action authorized under government code section,subdivision a and the apparent legislative intent behind the creation of such a remedy.north pacifica was not required to proceed by way of administrative mandamus.

the commission followed the applicable procedures set forth above in response to the curtis appeal.it set a hearing on january,the limitations,because three or more commissioners did not request a hearing on the substantial issue question,the commission adopted without debate or public comment the staff recommendation on the substantial issue question.the commission then postponed the de novo hearing to allow north pacifica time to prepare.the finding of a substantial issue at the january,hearing satisfied the requirement of public resources code section.encinitas country day school,california coastal,supra,th at,d.the commission therefore had the jurisdiction to conduct the de novo hearing on the curtis appeal after february,last day of the limitations,as north pacifica contends,the substantial issue finding was null and void due to faulty notice of the january,meeting.the issue therefore is the consequence of the commission untimely notice of the january,hearing.
compliance with the act notice requirements 
the act requires advance notice to the public and all interested persons of public meetings held by state bodies.government code section provides in pertinent part a the state body shall provide notice of its meeting to any person who requests that notice in writing.notice shall be given and also made available on the internet at least days in advance of the meeting,and shall include the name,address,and telephone number of any person who can provide further information prior to the meeting,but need not include a list of witnesses expected to appear at the meeting.the written notice shall additionally include the address of the internet site where notices required by this article are made available.b the notice of a meeting of a body that is a state body shall include a specific agenda for the meeting,containing a brief description of the items of business to be transacted or discussed in either open or closed session 
although government code section uses mandatory language with respect to the notice period and the required contents of the notice,government code section,subdivision b expressly provides that a state body may substantially comply with those requirements.an action taken in violation of the act shall not be determined to be null and void if any of the following conditions exist the action taken was in substantial compliance with sections and,subd.b.
