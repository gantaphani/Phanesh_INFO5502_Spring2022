michael kuhn was sentenced to six months at a halfway house and six months of supervised release following his conviction for improperly discharging a pollutant into navigable waters,causing an employee to falsify test results in records submitted to the government,and signing and submitting a report to the government that he knew contained false test results.the government now appeals a downward departure granted by the district court to kuhn.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse,and remand the case for resentencing.
kuhn was the superintendent of the bay city,michigan,wastewater treatment plant the plant.the wastewater that comes into the plant goes through a number of stages before being released into the saginaw river.on or about august,during the midnight shift,staff at the plant began cleaning the chlorine contact chamber,which is the penultimate stage of the process.the plant had a national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit that governed its operation under the clean water act cwa.the plant was obligated to notify the michigan department of environmental quality deq within five days of any accidental spill or bypass of the treatment system.at the end of august,sludge from the chlorine contact chamber was illegally pumped into a ditch while the chlorine contact chamber was being cleaned.this was done on kuhn orders.in november,kuhn had the soil from the ditch excavated and hauled away.
pursuant to the plant npdes permit,the plant was required to submit monthly discharge monitoring reports to the deq.as superintendent,kuhn certified the accuracy of the information in these reports.the reports contained data regarding laboratory findings charting both the material coming into the plant influent and the material being discharged from the plant effluent.a plant technician drew kuhn attention to very high numbers for on a sample drawn may.kuhn asked the technician to change the results,and the technician refused.the technician made a copy of the original printout,suspecting that the numbers might be altered in the final report to the deq.later,another technician gave the final report for the month of may to kuhn for his review and signature.he told her that the test results for suspended solids,total phosphorous,and for may must be wrong and asked her to change the numbers to the averages for the month.she refused.however,when she checked the final report,the data for may had been changed to the monthly averages kuhn then asked yet another technician to change the test results,which he did.the technician wrote a memo memorializing the fact that he had changed the test results at kuhn direction.kuhn signed the final,altered report on june,and submitted it to the deq.
kuhn was subsequently indicted in a indictment that charged first,that between august and,kuhn knowingly caused plant workers to dispose of sewage sludge improperly,which resulted in the sludge flowing into a ditch on the plant property and then into the saginaw river,a navigable waterway,in violation of a and second,that between the same dates he knowingly caused the sewage sludge to be discharged from the ditch into the saginaw river,in violation of a and third,that on june,he caused an employee to assist in falsifying test results that were included in records that,under the cwa,were required to be filed,in violation of c and and fourth,that on june,he signed and submitted to the deq a discharge monitoring report,required by the cwa,which he knew contained the false test results,in violation of c.
after a jury trial,the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts.kuhn filed a motion for judgment of acquittal.the district court granted this motion in part,dismissing count two on double jeopardy grounds.the presentence report psr calculated kuhn sentencing range at months,with a total offense level of nineteen.this number was reached by finding a base offense level of six for count one a.the psr then recommended two increases for specific offense characteristics pursuant to b b,due to the offense involving a discharge or release of a pollutant and pursuant to b,due to the offense involving a discharge without a permit or in violation of a permit.the psr recommended two additional increases pursuant to c for kuhn role as an organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor in a criminal activity and pursuant to due to his abuse of a position of public trust in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of this offense.this resulted in a recommended adjusted offense level of eighteen for count one.
for counts three and four,the psr recommended a base offense level of six a with the same two increases for leadership role and abuse of a position of public trust.this resulted in a recommended adjusted offense level of ten for counts three and four.according to the grouping rules,found at,one offense level was added to the group with the highest adjusted offense level.therefore,the recommended combined adjusted offense level was nineteen.
at the sentencing hearing,the defense objected to the addition of the increases for the two specific offense characteristics.the court overruled this objection,finding that application of the two specific offense characteristics did not constitute.next,the government objected to the psr omission of its requested enhancement pursuant to b because the offense resulted in a substantial likelihood of death or serious bodily injury.the court overruled the government objection.next,the government objected to the psr failure to include a increase for obstruction of justice,pursuant to and application note b,based on kuhn false testimony given at trial.the court overruled the government objection.
the defense did not object to the two increases for kuhn leadership role and abuse of a position of public trust.the defense,however,did move for a downward adjustment or departure,based on,application notes and,which advise the court that upward and downward departures are appropriate depending upon the harm or risk associated with the offense.the court departed downward two levels with regard to each offense characteristic,for a total of four levels subtracted from the adjusted offense level for count one.the court explained that testing of the affected areas did not indicate any presence of pcbs,that the chlorine contact chamber was the last stage that polluted water reached before it was released into the environment,and that there were serious questions in the court mind as to whether any of the contents of that ditch ever made it into the saginaw river.
at this point,the adjusted offense level for count one stood at fourteen.the court then calculated that,pursuant to,two levels were to be added to that for grouping purposes.this resulted in a combined offense level of sixteen.the defense then moved for a downward departure based on kuhn acts of a charitable or public service nature within the community.
the court denied the motion,but went on to state that it doubted that a to term of incarceration serves the ends of justice in this case.the court stated that it questioned the two adjustments for role in the offense and abuse of a position of public trust.it stated that the offense in this case did not necessarily entail an abuse of trust that was separate and apart from the defendant position that permitted him to be a leader or organizer of the activity.therefore,the court concluded,scoring the two adjustments in a single case constituted an.moreover,the court stated that,although applying the two specific offense characteristics did not constitute,it put undue weight on the offense characteristics for this specific offense,because the offense for which kuhn was convicted consisted of a single discharge.the court also noted that it felt that the sentence in the case 
ought to be fashioned around the fact that the discharge in this case resulted from essentially a single incident that occurred over a day or two,and was motivated by the defendant desire to make the plant more efficient so that it would perform the function of enhancing the environmental quality as opposed to degrading it.
therefore,the court departed downward by four additional levels.
in its judgment,the court added more reasons for granting the additional downward departure,indicating that t he circumstances of this case,including the defendant motivation and purpose,takes this case out of the heartland of offenses contemplated by the sentencing guidelines.first,the court reiterated that kuhn was motivated by a desire to clean up and improve the efficient operation of the bay city wastewater treatment plant.apparently,the court concluded that kuhn was taking a shortcut,engaging in conduct not authorized by the permit issued to the plant,and violated the clean water act in so doing.the court went on to say 
given the defendant background,however,his length of service in the area of public waste management,and other minor factors such as his community involvement and exemplary personal record of achievements in the community,the court finds credible the defendant professed motive that the efficient,operation of the bay city wastewater treatment plant was his ultimate goal.
therefore,the court imposed a sentence based on offense level twelve and a criminal history category of kuhn was sentenced to six months at a halfway house,six months of supervised release,and the minimum fine of.
the government filed a timely notice of appeal,appealing the unguided downward departure it first argues that the district court gave no notice to the government of its intention to depart on the basis of kuhn role in the offense and abuse of a position of public trust enhancements,nor on the basis of the application of the specific offense enhancements of.the government argues that even if it had received proper notice,the downward departure on these bases was improper.finally,the government argues that the additional reasons for the downward departure added in the district court judgment were not supported by any factual bases and are discouraged factors for downward departures under the sentencing guidelines,and that the district court did not give notice of its intent to depart downward on these bases.
we review a district court decision to grant a downward departure for an abuse of discretion.see united states reed,cir citing koon united states,d.a sentencing court may impose a sentence outside the guidelines range only if the court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind,or to a degree,not adequately taken into consideration by the sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines quoting b.a district court abuses its discretion when it fails to give notice of its intention to depart.see burns united states,d united states yang,cir.the district court departed downward based on three reasons.we consider the validity of these reasons separately below.
departure based on enhancements for kuhn role in the offense and abuse of a position of public trust.
the district court failed to give notice to the government of its intention to depart on this basis.rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure provides that 
before the court may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified for departure either in the presentence report or in a party prehearing submission,the court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a departure.the notice must specify any ground on which the court is contemplating a departure.
the district court failure to notify the government that it was planning to depart on this basis was error.see yang,at.
even if the district court had given the government notice,the downward departure based on these enhancements was improper.during the sentencing hearing,defense counsel conceded,and the district court found,that both enhancements were proper in this case.however,the district court stated that the enhancements,if applied cumulatively,because the offense in this case did not necessarily entail an abuse of trust that was separate and apart from the defendant position that permitted him to be a leader or organizer of the activity.in its judgment,the district court added to its rationale,stating that the abuse of trust enhancement should be discounted because a significant number of members of the general public did not enjoy a beneficial or relationship with the defendant in his role as a public servant.
the abuse of a position of public trust enhancement applies to persons who abuse their positions of trust to facilitate significantly the commission or concealment of a crime,comment.backg.a position of public or private trust is characterized by professional or managerial discretion,substantial discretionary judgment that is ordinarily given considerable deference.id.at comment.as the district court impliedly found when it applied the enhancement,kuhn satisfied these elements.
the district court reasoning that the abuse of trust enhancement should be discounted because a significant number of members of the general public did not enjoy a beneficial or relationship with the defendant in his role as a public servant is invalid under our opinion in united states white,cir.there we held that the general public may be victims of a government employee crimes for purposes of deciding whether the employee sentence may be enhanced pursuant to.id.at.the defendant in white was a general superintendent at a drinking water treatment plant who was convicted of filing false reports.although the question there was whether the enhancement should apply to white,while here we are reviewing a downward departure after the enhancement has already been applied,the court holding is relevant here.the district court statement in departing downward seems to indicate that it believes the enhancement should not have been applied.if this is the case,then the district court should not have applied the enhancement in the first place.however,it is clear that the enhancement was properly applied.kuhn was a government employee,charged with the safe and efficient operation of a wastewater treatment operation.he was convicted of knowingly causing sewage sludge to be discharged into a navigable waterway and falsifying reports.the statutes that were violated were in place to protect the general public from this sort of activity.it is difficult to see how members of the general public were not in a beneficial relationship with kuhn,as significant numbers of the public depended upon kuhn to prevent or ameliorate water pollution in the area.moreover,his position with respect to his public function of wastewater treatment,contributed in some significant way to facilitating the commission of his offense,comment.
the aggravating role enhancement increase s the offense level based upon the size of the criminal organization and the degree to which the defendant was responsible for committing the offense,comment.backg.it generally addresses a defendant relative responsibility for the crime.again,the district court found that kuhn satisfied these elements when it applied the enhancement.the aggravating role enhancement relates to kuhn role as a supervisor over others in the operation of the plant.kuhn directed others to discharge the contents of the chlorine contact chamber into the ditch,and directed technicians to change test results.
applying these two enhancements cumulatively does not,as each enhancement has elements that are not necessary for the determination of the other.in white,this court addressed the appropriateness of applying both a leadership and an enhancement.see white,at.the district court in white applied the enhancement solely because it found the defendants used a special skill in committing their offenses.id.at.when it declined also to apply the enhancement because of the abuse of a position of public trust,the district court foreclosed the government from seeking an aggravating role enhancement under.ibid.citing if this adjustment is based solely on the use of a special skill,it may not be employed in addition to an adjustment under aggravating role.we reversed,and remanded the case to the district court,directing that it apply the enhancement and to consider the propriety of also enhancing white sentence pursuant t
