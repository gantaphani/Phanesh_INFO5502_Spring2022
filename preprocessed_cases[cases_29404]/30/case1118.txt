in this appeal,we must decide whether sand and gravel are valuable minerals within the meaning of the pittman underground water act the act or the pittman act,the act provided grants,or patents,of federal public lands to people who found underground sources of water in the deserts of nevada.under the terms of the act,these patents reserved all the coal and other valuable minerals to the united states.pittman act.
plaintiff bedroc limited brought this action to quiet title in a parcel of land granted under the act in to bedroc predecessor in interest.citing the mineral reservation,the united states has claimed title to the sand and gravel on the parcel bedroc contends that sand and gravel are not valuable minerals within the meaning of the act and thus were not reserved to the government.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the united states.we affirm.
we hold that sand and gravel are encompassed by the reservation of valuable minerals to the united states.the purpose of the act and its legislative history instruct us to construe the reservation broadly.moreover,government documents concerning minerals,published contemporaneously with the statute enactment,describe the market for sand and gravel.
facts and procedural history 
historical background 
in,only people lived in nevada.the federal government owned most of the land in nevada.the lack of a tax base held back development of the state infrastructure.the homestead acts,a successful tool for development in other western states,had failed to populate nevada because of the lack of water available for agricultural cultivation.cong.rec.
at the time,it was thought that the future development of the state depended largely on the discovery of underground water,which could be used to irrigate land for agricultural purposes.nevada congressional representatives,however,failed to gain the necessary support to fund projects to explore for underground water.id.as an alternative,nevada senator key pittman proposed the pittman underground water act as a means of encouraging private citizens to search for underground water in order to cultivate nevada arid lands.
passed in,the act provided that the department of the interior would certify certain nonmineral public lands to parcel out to prospective settlers.pittman act.initially,the government issued permits,giving settlers the exclusive right to drill wells in a parcel of up to acres.id.if a settler could demonstrate successful irrigation of at least acres,the united states would grant the settler a patent of up to acres.pittman act.the remaining acres would be divided into homesteads and distributed under the homestead act.pittman act.
the act and the patents issued pursuant to the act contain the following mineral reservation 
that all entries made and patents issued under the provisions of this act shall be subject to and contain a reservation to the united states of all the coal and other valuable minerals in the lands so entered and patented,together with the right to prospect for,mine,and remove the same.the coal and other valuable mineral deposits in such lands shall be subject to disposal by the united states in accordance with the provisions of the coal and mineral land laws in force at the time of such disposal.

bedroc patent 
on march,newton and mabel butler received a patent under the act for acres of land in lincoln county,nevada.i n conformity with the act,the patent reserved to the united states all the coal and other valuable minerals in the lands so granted,together with the right to prospect for,mine,and remove the same upon compliance with the conditions of and subject to the limitations of section eight of said act.
in the early,a lessee began taking sand and gravel from the property.earl williams purchased the property in and continued to extract sand and gravel.the bureau of land management blm issued trespass notices to williams on march and april.williams challenged the notices.in response,the blm issued a decision stating that williams removal of the sand and gravel trespassed against the government reserved interest in the valuable minerals on the property.the interior board of land appeals upheld that decision on appeal,relying on the legislative history of the act and on the intent of congress in enacting it.earl williams.
bedroc acquired the property from williams in and continued to remove sand and gravel.pursuant to an agreement with the department of the interior,bedroc placed money in escrow from the sale of each cubic yard of sand and gravel removed,pending final resolution of the ownership dispute.
district court proceedings 
in the district court,bedroc sought to quiet title in the sand and gravel and to determine how much of the funds in escrow should be paid to the government if the district court concluded that the mineral reservation included sand and gravel.bedroc and the government filed for summary judgment on the issue of ownership.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the united states.
before the district court resolved the remaining issues,the parties reached a settlement regarding the funds in escrow.the settlement provided that bedroc could appeal only the ownership issues to this court.the district court entered a final judgment pursuant to the parties stipulation,and this timely appeal followed.

discussion 
a.the statutory text 
the word mineral is used in so many senses,dependent upon the context,that the ordinary definitions of the dictionary throw but little light upon its signification in a given case.pac.ry.soderberg.a review of the dictionary definitions of mineral bears out that principle.broadly,a mineral includes anything that is neither animal nor vegetable.webster third new int l dictionary unabridged ed.some definitions name sand specifically as an example of a mineral.see,dictionary,available at.but,neither the text of the statute nor dictionary definitions answer the precise question here did congress intend sand and gravel to be included in the reservation of valuable minerals under the pittman act pittman act emphasis added.
the word valuable does not clarify the ambiguity.for purposes of statutory construction,we must determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.robinson shell oil,d emphasis added.although the ordinary meaning of the phrase valuable minerals does not evoke images of sand and gravel,neither does the phrase obviously exclude those substances.sand and gravel are not valuable in the way that diamonds or gold might be.however,century dictionaries confirm that valuable did not simply mean precious as it does today,valuable also described an object utility.see joseph worcester,a dictionary of the english language defining valuable as having value or worth being possessed of worth or useful properties useful.in that sense,sand and gravel have value,both for their usefulness and for their commercial worth.
when the mineral reservation is read in context,the significance of the modifier valuable diminishes.the mineral reservation provision,section of the act,refers to minerals several times.sometimes the modifier valuable is used,but at other times variants of the word minerals appear without qualification.for example,the statute provides that all t he coal and other valuable mineral deposits in such lands shall be subject to disposal by the united states.pittman act.however,section also provides that a ny person who has acquired from the united states the coal or other mineral deposits may enter the property with the consent of the patent holder.for that phrase to make sense,the united states must already have owned the coal or other mineral deposits.when considered in context,the modifier valuable does not,by itself,clearly limit the scope of minerals reserved to the united states.
in addition to containing the qualifier valuable,the statute requires that land granted under the act must first be certified as nonmineral.pittman act.bedroc argues that this certification means that the government thought that the land contained no minerals at all and thus disclaimed any mineral deposits of which it was unaware at the time of grant.by contrast,the government asserts that,by granting patents only of lands that were nonmineral,congress expressed its intent to part only with the surface estate and to reserve all mineral deposits in the lands to the united states.both interpretations are plausible the requirement that the patented lands be designated nonmineral does not resolve the ambiguity 
we conclude that the phrase valuable minerals in the pittman act reservation is ambiguous.the text of the statute does not conclusively convey congress intent as to whether sand and gravel are included within the scope of the reservation.because the text is unclear,we turn to a discussion of the statutory purpose,the legislative history,and other sources outside the statute to determine congressional intent.
b.the purpose of the act 
as stated in committee reports,the purpose of the act was to encourage the exploration for and development of artesian and subsurface waters in the state of nevada,at.the legislative purpose did not stop there,however.if water was discovered,it was meant to be put to use irrigating lands for agricultural development.of course,part of the act purpose was to create an incentive for private individuals to risk time,labor,and money in prospecting for water.but this reward was not an end in itself.rather,the act granted land to water prospectors because their labor furthered the larger goal of irrigating arid lands for farming.
the threshold showing required to obtain a patent proves this point the permit holder had to demonstrate that there were underground waters in sufficient quantity to produce at a profit agricultural crops other than native grasses upon not less than twenty acres.pittman act.once that prerequisite was met,the remaining area under the permit was open to entry only under the homestead act.pittman act.
in the legislative history,numerous references to nevada agricultural future confirm that the larger goal of the act was to encourage the cultivation of land for agricultural purposes the primary object of the bill is to encourage the development of the agricultural portions of the public domain in the state of nevada,not susceptible of irrigation from any known source of surface water supply,at the future development of the agricultural land of the state seems to depend largely upon the development of artesian water,at see also,at stating same it is evident that the retarding of agricultural development in nevada is due entirely to the failure of the government to provide laws under which the land could be acquired and the waters of the state developed and conserved,at the geographical situation of the state of nevada,the absence of large streams or other large bodies of surface waters,the aridity or semiaridity of the soil,the other conditions peculiar to the state,fully warrant a special law designed to meet the situation and promote agricultural development.cong.rec.statement of pittman,reading a letter from the secretary of the interior.
if the aim of the land grants was to promote agriculture,it follows that the government meant to reserve minerals for other uses.in fact,full reservation of mineral rights was the policy in place at the time of the act passage.
in united states union oil of california,cir,we held that geothermal steam was reserved to the united states in grants made under the homestead act srha which was enacted only three years before the pittman act.we summarized the treatment of agricultural and mineral entries onto public land at the turn of the last century 
prior to,public lands were disposed of as either wholly mineral or wholly nonmineral in character.this practice led to inefficiencies and abuses.in and again in,president theodore roosevelt pointed out that some public lands were useful for both agriculture and production of subsurface fuels,and that these two uses could best be served by separate disposition of the right to utilize the same land for each purpose to that end,the president recommended enactment of such legislation as would provide for title to and development of the surface land as separate and distinct from the right to the underlying mineral fuels in regions where these may occur 
id.at citation omitted quoting cong.rec.the president said that this system will encourage the separate and independent development of the surface lands for agricultural purposes and the extraction of the mineral fuels in such manner as will best meet the needs of the people.id.at quoting cong.rec.
in watt western nuclear,d,the supreme court considered the same legislative history when it decided that gravel was reserved to the united states in grants made under the srha.the court relied heavily on the agricultural purpose of the srha and on the policy in place at the time of its enactment to sever the mineral estate from agricultural grants.the court noted that,s ince congress intended to facilitate development of both surface and subsurface resources,the determination of whether a particular substance is included in the surface estate or the mineral estate should be made in light of the use of the surface estate that congress contemplated.id.at.the court reasoned that,
i f we were to interpret the srha to convey gravel deposits to the farmers and stockmen who made entries under the act,we would in effect be saying that congress intended to make the exploitation of such deposits dependent solely upon the initiative of persons whose interests were known to lie elsewhere.
id.at.thus,the court agreed with our sentiment in union oil that the mineral reservation is to be read broadly in light of the agricultural purpose of the grant itself,and in light of congress equally clear purpose to retain subsurface resources for separate disposition and development.union oil,at.
as we have said,congress passed the srha in,just three years before the pittman act.the floor debates surrounding the pittman act reveal that congress intended the mineral reservation to serve the same purposes and have the same scope as the reservation under the srha.see,at section of the bill contains the same reservations of minerals,with the facility for prospecting for and developing and mining such minerals as was provided in the srha.thus,congressional debates support the government position,consistent with both western nuclear and union oil,that the mineral reservation in the pittman act is to be construed broadly.
congressional debate concerning the mineral reservation 
senator pittman,the sponsor of the act that bears his at length the scope of the mineral reservation in the pittman act.see williams,at discussing the voluminous history of the pittman act see also kalvinskas cal.inst.of,cir giving substantial weight to statements made by a bill sponsor.excerpts of the debates on this issue reveal that the mineral reservation was the product of a legislative compromise,without which the bill likely would not have passed.
during debates on the bill,senator thomas from colorado moved for an amendment to remove the mineral reservation.cong.rec.senator pittman responded 
b efore the senator does that,i trust that he will consider the matter for a minute.this bill,as it was originally prepared by me,did not contain that reservation.when a similar bill was introduced in the house of representatives,at my request,it met with serious opposition on the very gr
