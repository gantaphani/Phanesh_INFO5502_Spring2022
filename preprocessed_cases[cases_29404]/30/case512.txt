in this successive appeal,we confront another chapter in the long history of certain superfund sites located near bloomington,indiana.the sites are contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs,dioxin,and other toxic chemicals.sarah frey,kevin enright,and the organization protect our woods to whom we refer collectively as frey are before us once again,trying to invoke the citizen suit provision of the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of cercla.that law,in general,permits a plaintiff to challenge cleanup efforts at superfund sites once the environmental protection agency epa and other responsible parties proclaim their work to be completed.h frey epa,cir frey i.frey argues that her suit meets the statutory criteria,because epa has completed the excavation of pcbs and has not yet selected further remedies.the district court saw matters differently it found that frey action was still premature because epa has made it clear that it is studying further cleanup options for the three sites challenged in this lawsuit lemon lane landfill,neal landfill,and bennett dump.we conclude,however,that because epa has failed to provide any objective referent by which to measure its progress,frey is finally entitled to her day in court.we reverse.
on january,the united states initiated a civil action under cercla,et,against viacom formerly the westinghouse electric corporation and then the cbs corporation,until it merged into viacom to clean up two pcb contaminated dump sites in bloomington,indiana.after the city of bloomington sued viacom in connection with two other contaminated sites,the cases were consolidated and an additional two sites were added,bringing the total to six.in,the parties entered into a consent decree that directed viacom to excavate fully meaning literally down to bedrock and incinerate the pcbs at the six sites.this plan proved to be controversial,because it required viacom to construct an incinerator.in,frey filed suit to challenge the proposed incineration remedy we dismissed that action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.schalk reilly,cir.
although frey lawsuit was unsuccessful,the indiana state legislature acted in to block construction of the incinerator.this forced the parties to the consent decree into further negotiations to find alternative remedies for the contaminated sites.in the course of these discussions,epa and viacom came to an impasse.viacom believed that it should be required only to excavate highly contaminated soil known as hot spots,while epa took the position that hot spots excavation would be appropriate only if water treatment and sediment removal were included as part of the alternative remedy.in,the district court issued an order stating that the sites had to be remediated by.
to assist the parties in breaking the deadlock in time for the deadline,the court appointed a special master to see that the aims of the consent decree are carried out expeditiously and to resolve possible disputes between the parties.the special master report recommended that the remediation deadline be moved back one year to.it noted that the parties had reached agreement on some alternative methods of pcb excavation and that they had also agreed to complete the source control excavation work by the end of.while the excavation work was underway,viacom agreed to investigate water treatment and sediment remediation solutions at the three sites.according to the schedule proposed by the special master,the parties were to engage in further settlement negotiations regarding water treatment and sediment removal aspects of remediation at neal landfill and lemon lane landfill,including negotiations for permanent water treatment solutions for these sites,approximately one year following the completion of source control activities at each site.the district court adopted the special master report and recommendations on february,noting in its order that the schedule required that excavation work at neal landfill and bennett dump be completed by the end of and that the work at lemon landfill be completed by the end of.it instructed the parties to engage in further settlement negotiations regarding the water treatment and sediment removal phases of the remediation.
after the incinerator option was abandoned,epa took steps to select a new source control remedy for excavation of pcbs at the three sites.the national oil and hazardous substances pollution contingency plan ncp,pt,establishes the criteria and procedures to be followed in comparing remedial alternatives and choosing a response.this regulatory process requires epa to develop a list of effective remedial alternatives and to assess their feasibility.id.at d e describing the remedial study phase.after each alternative is evaluated against nine established criteria,epa selects a preferred remedy and presents it to the public in a proposed plan for review and comment.following a period of public comment,including the possibility of a public meeting,epa selects a final remedy and memorializes it in a public document called a record of decision rod.id.at f f.
on march,epa issued an amendment of the rod for the source control operable unit for neal landfill.this document explained that the original remedy for neal landfill called for the excavation of cubic yards of pcb contaminated landfill material and treatment through construction of an approved incinerator.the modified remedy called for the excavation and removal of material with a high level contamination the hot spots to be followed by the construction of a landfill cap.prior to adopting the hot spots excavation remedy,epa considered alternatives,including the total excavation of the landfill.it concluded that the hot spots remedy was superior to total excavation in light of the nine regulatory criteria.as required by the regulations,epa took public comment and held a hearing in bloomington on the proposed remedies.this rod amendment dealt only with the source control component.it stipulated that s ubsequent actions are planned to address fully the principal threats posed by this site.future remedial decisions will be made regarding additional interim and final water treatment and sediment removal.
on may,epa issued a rod amendment for lemon lane landfill.epa again adopted the hot spots excavation technique for pcb removal after considering other alternatives,including total excavation.it explained that the new rod amendment only addresses source control measures,and future remedial decisions will be made regarding treatment of contaminated groundwater 
when frey brought the present suit,the materials we have been discussing were presented to the district court.epa also offered an affidavit and testimony from thomas alcamo,the remedial project manager responsible for directing and overseeing the cleanup activities at the three sites.alcamo also oversaw the development of the specific remedial approaches adopted by epa.alcamo affidavit establishes that water and sediment investigations are in progress at all three sites.he confirmed that all of the work in connection with the bureaucratically dubbed source control operable unit at neal landfill was completed in november,including the excavation and disposal of tons of pcb contaminated material.he further explained that,pursuant to the consent decree,viacom had constructed a water treatment plant at neal landfill that became operational in.epa was still evaluating the need based upon risk for expanding the viacom water treatment plan including increasing the volume of spring water to be captured and treated,storage of storm water and adding additional water processing equipment to decrease the pcb concentrations in the effluent.he also indicated that epa was concurrently evaluating based upon risk to both human and ecological receptors the need to remove pcb contaminated sediments from surrounding creeks.
turning to lemon lane landfill,alcamo affidavit represented that the source control operable unit corresponding to that site was completed in november.it involved the excavation and disposal of tons of pcb contaminated material.after epa determined
