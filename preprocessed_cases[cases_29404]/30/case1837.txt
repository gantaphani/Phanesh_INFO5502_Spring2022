citizens for responsible open space and californians for property rights collectively,citizens petitioned the superior court to invalidate the annexation to the midpenninsula regional open space district mrosd of acres along the coast of san mateo county.they appeal from the judgment entered in favor of defendants san mateo county local agency formation commission lafco and san mateo county rejecting their petition.citizens contend the annexation should be invalidated for numerous reasons because public notice of the hearing to protest the annexation omitted a statement of reasons for the annexation and included an ambiguous map of the affected area,and because lafco delegated the task of verifying the written protests to a separate county department and assertedly determined incorrectly the number of registered voters residing in the annexation area.in a,lafco contends the trial court erred in finding that it improperly excluded protests by registered voters who did not include their residence address on the protest form.we reject citizens claims,but agree with lafco that it properly excluded those protests that did not include a residence address within the annexation area

factual and procedural history 
in,san mateo county coastside voters passed an advisory ballot measure approving mrosd annexation of approximately acres on the san mateo county coast extending west from the existing mrosd boundary to the pacific ocean,north to the southern boundary of the city of pacifica,and south to the santa mateo county border.over the next five years,mrosd held over public hearings,prepared an environmental impact report and developed a coastal program service plan.in june,mrosd certified the environmental impact report and formally initiated the annexation process by adopting a resolution of application.
lafco considered numerous reports and held three extensive public hearings on mrosd application.opposition to the annexation focused on potential use of eminent domain by mrosd in the coastal area,underestimation of fiscal impacts to school districts and other agencies,lack of ability to vote on the annexation proposal,future taxation by mrosd without voter approval,lack of coastal representation on the mrosd board following annexation,mrosd lack of expertise in agricultural land management,adverse impacts of public lands on adjacent coastal agricultural lands and adverse impacts of public lands on public safety services such as fire and police protection.in response to these concerns,mrosd adopted a resolution precluding use of the power of eminent domain within the annexation area mrosd also assured lafco and coastside residents that it could fund its basic service plan through grants and existing revenue and that no additional taxes would be imposed on coastside residents without voter approval.mrosd adopted a resolution agreeing not to seek a property tax transfer from any of the affected agencies in connection with the annexation and entered into an agreement with the affected school district to address losses in property tax revenue due to mrosd proposed acquisition of property within the annexation area.mrosd also agreed to work with coastside residents to develop a redistricting plan that would allow representation of the coastal area on its board and to work with the san mateo county fire department on a memorandum of understanding that includes a mutual aid agreement and contract for services.
on april,lafco adopted resolution,which made findings and approved the annexation.lafco initiated the protest process by publishing a notice of the protest hearing in the san mateo times and in the half moon bay review.the notice identified the date and location of the hearing,eligibility for filing a protest,the necessary content of a protest,and the deadline for filing.a protest form was included in the published notices.the notices included a map of the area to be annexed but did not contain a statement of reasons for the annexation.at the close of the protest period,protests were received by lafco.
at the direction of lafco executive officer,the task of verifying and tabulating the protest forms was performed by the san mateo county elections division elections division.the elections division issued a written protest certification in which it found that as of the close of the protest period there were registered voters in the protest area and that valid protests had been submitted and not withdrawn.an additional protests were certified following a recount ordered in separate judicial proceedings san mateo county super.court.
thereafter,lafco executive officer adopted the findings in the elections division protests certification.based on the conclusion that less than percent of the registered voters filed valid protests,the annexation was ordered to become effective without an election.
in november,citizens filed the present action seeking to invalidate the annexation.following a bench trial,the court entered judgment in favor of lafco.the court found that some protests had been erroneously invalidated,but concluded that even when those protests were included,less than percent of the registered voters had filed valid protests.the court also concluded that other claimed deficiencies in the process,described more fully below,were not prejudicial and did not require invalidation of the annexation.
citizens filed a timely notice of appeal.thereafter,lafco filed a timely notice of.
discussion 
standard of review 
this appeal is governed by the standard of review set forth in section,which provides a this division shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.no change of organization or reorganization ordered under this division and no resolution adopted by the commission making determinations upon a proposal shall be invalidated because of any defect,error,irregularity,or omission in any act,determination,or procedure which does not adversely and substantially affect the rights of any person,city,county,district,the state,or any agency or subdivision of the state.b all determinations made by a commission under,and pursuant to,this division shall be final and conclusive in the absence of fraud or prejudicial abuse of discretion.c in any action or proceeding to attack,review,set aside,void,or annul a determination by a commission on grounds of noncompliance with this division,any inquiry shall extend only to whether there was fraud or a prejudicial abuse of discretion.prejudicial abuse of discretion is established if the court finds that the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record.citizens have made no claim of fraud.thus,under subdivisions b and c,the court must determine whether substantial evidence supports lafco factual determinations and,if not,under subdivision a,whether any such error was harmless in that it did not adversely and substantially affect the rights of any person.citizens contentions that lafco made procedural errors with regard to implementing the protest process are similarly subject to the harmless error standard set forth in section,subdivision a.
contrary to citizens argument,the protest process under the act does not implicate a fundamental right to vote.broadmoor police protection dist.san mateo local agency formation com.th,d oxnard harbor dist.local agency formation com.th,d.thus,lafco approval of the annexation application is not subject to a heightened standard of review.ibid.
lafco omission of a statement of reasons for the annexation in the public notice of the protest hearing was not prejudicial.
citizens contend that the annexation must be invalidated because the notice of the protest hearing did not include a statement of the reasons for the annexation as required by section,subdivision e.the trial court acknowledged this deficiency but concluded that the notice was in substantial compliance with the statutory mandate.the court also found no evidence that the omission adversely and substantially affected the rights of any person.the court explained that the administrative record is replete with references to notice of the annexation proceedings and the reasons for the annexation.the matter was the subject of public debate for over six years.more than public meetings,including citizens advisory committee meetings and mrosd board meetings were devoted to the annexation issues mrosd also conducted an advisory vote on the annexation program.the campaign to collect valid protests was extraordinary.supporters and opponents of the annexation met the public in front of local businesses,lawn signs were displayed and newspaper coverage of the issue was extensive.
citizens argue that the failure to include a statement of reasons was not a technical deficiency so that the doctrine of substantial compliance should not apply,and that when a notice omits necessary information and thereby deprives interested persons of an opportunity for public participation and informed,the prejudice is manifest.
whether or not the substantial compliance doctrine applies in this context,the omission of the statement of reasons from the public notice clearly was not prejudicial in this case.there is nothing in the record to suggest that the omission adversely and substantially affect ed the rights of any person,subd.a.to the contrary,as the trial court concluded,the overwhelming weight of evidence establishes that the public was aware of the arguments in favor and against the annexation and given a meaningful opportunity to participate in the protest process.in addition to the evidence cited by the trial court,the notice of the march,public hearing at which lafco approved resolution included a statement of the reasons for the annexation.the disputed notice of the protest hearing advised the public that resolution,which also includes a statement of the reasons for the annexation,could be obtained at the lafco offices.accordingly,the omission provides no basis to invalidate the annexation 
any potential ambiguity in the maps of the annexed territory was not prejudicial.
according to citizens,the administrative record includes at least three different versions of maps relied upon by mrosd and lafco purporting to identify the boundaries of the proposed annexation area while citizens argue that members of the public raised various and specific objections to lafco maps,only two ambiguities are addressed by citizens with even minimal specificity.
the first is related to an approximately parcel that is alternatively included in differing locations or not included at all on lafco maps.the parcel is geographically within mrosd boundaries,but was previously excluded from the district.it is near the former western boundary of the district and nearly adjacent to the much larger annexation area depicted on all of the relevant maps.the acres is accurately depicted on the map appended to this opinion,which is the map included in mrosd application for annexation.
the second asserted ambiguity relates to the location of mrosd western boundary near skyline ridge.the annexation area is directly adjacent to mrosd western boundary.this boundary is correctly depicted on all maps that were utilized in the annexation process,but in public statements by lafco members and in lafco memoranda was sometimes referred to as running along skyline boulevard.literally,however,this major thoroughfare is within the boundaries of the mrosd.citizens suggest that lafco failed to respond to claims by the public noting great difficulty in assessing the proposed boundaries along skyline ridge.they argue that to this very day lafco continue s to describe the annexation boundaries along the jagged skyline ridge area incorrectly and inconsistently.the map found on mrosd own website depicting the proposed coastside protection program plainly contradicts lafco assertion that the boundaries of the annexation area are defined by skyline boulevard.as shown on the map produced by mrosd staff,is substantially mrosd holdings.without further elaboration,citizens assert that lafco failure to respond to repeated complaints about inaccurate and insufficient maps prejudiced the ability of appellants and other interested citizens to adequately raise sufficient protests to the proposed annexation.
we have carefully reviewed the map that was published with the notice of the protest hearing.we conclude that the map was a sufficient description of the exterior boundaries of the subject territory for purposes of section.as lafco explains,the map was not intended to be a precisely surveyed guide to the exact limit of the annexation area,but a description of its external boundaries in a manner that would effectively inform the reader.there is no doubt that the map included with the notice complied with the statutory requirement.
while citizens are correct that the parcel was not correctly placed on the map that accompanied lafco resolution,the error was insignificant.the map depicted an annexation area of some acres and the acres were within the district boundaries.the error could have been of no importance to property owners not within the acres.there is no evidence that any resident of the acres failed to receive proper notice of the annexation or did not understand that the acres were included in the proposed annexation.there is no evidence that with proper notice any additional residents of the area would have filed protests.nor is there evidence that enough registered voters resided within the area to have pushed the protest count over the percent threshold even if they all had filed protests.
likewise,citizens have failed to establish any prejudice resulting from confusion regarding the eastern boundary of the annexation area.lafco maps all properly depict this boundary.the fact that lafco documents sometimes refer to the boundary as skyline boulevard,a,identifiable thoroughfare not far from the actual boundary,rather than laboriously describing verbally the precise but jagged contours of the actual boundary,was not likely to have resulted in prejudice.certainly citizens have not demonstrated that lafco description of the boundary adversely and substantially affected anyone rights,subd.a.
the annexation was properly finalized without an election.
at the close of the protest period,written protests were submitted.in the verification process,lafco found that of these protests were valid.in earlier proceedings,the san mateo superior court ordered a recount,which resulted in the inclusion of an additional protests as valid.in the present proceedings,the trial court conducted an extensive review of the remaining disallowed protests and concluded that an additional should be included,resulting in a grand total of valid protests.based on lafco finding that there were registered voters in the affected area as of the june,protest hearing,the trial court concluded that less than percent of the registered voters had submitted valid protests.
while citizens do not challenge the finding that valid protests were submitted,they argue that lafco improperly delegated to the elections department the task of counting and verifying the protests.citizens also argue that lafco used an incorrect date on which to determine the proper number of registered voters in the affected area,and that the total number of registered voters as of the correct date was only.in its,lafco challenges the trial court determination that some protests excluded by lafco should have been included in the protest count.
initially,we note that even if citizens are correct that there were only registered voters residing in the annexation area on the relevant date,and assuming the trial court properly included the protests challenged in the,the annexation would not be invalidated.at most,only out of registered voters,or percent,filed valid written protests to the annexation.we shall nonetheless address each of the parties contentions in turn.
lafco did not improperly delegate its statutory responsibilities to the elections division.
section directs that u pon conclusion of the protest hearing,the commission shall determine the value of written protests filed and not withdrawn.the value of written protests shall be determined in the same manner prescribed in sections,and for determining the sufficiency of petitions filed with the commission.section provides,if a petition is signed by registered voters,the executive officer shall cause the names of the signers on the petition to be compared with the voters register in the office of the county clerk or registrar of voters and ascertain both of the following a the number of registered voters in the affected territory.b the number of qualified signers appearing upon the petition.the task of verifying the signatures on the protest forms is purely ministerial.see friends of bay meadows city of san mateo th,d the role of an election official in verifying a petition has been repeatedly described as purely ministerial,involving no exercise of discretion see also alliance for a better downtown millbrae wade th,d.
in this case,lafco satisfied its obligations under the statute.its executive officer caused the names of the signers on the protests to be verified by delegating that ministerial task to the elections division.then,based on the information received from that division,the executive officer determine d the value of written protests filed and not withdrawn.she expressly approved the criteria used by the elections division to verify the protests and adopted the division findings 
nothing in the act required the executive officer personally to ascertain the number of qualified signers who filed protests.nor does the act require the executive officer personally to supervise the elections division verification process.lafco executive officer appropriately delegated to the governmental division competent to perform the task the responsibility of applying to each of the challenged protests criteria that the executive officer approved.there was no improper delegation of lafco duty to determine the value of the written protests.
lafco properly determined the number of registered voters residing within the annexation area as of the date of the protest hearing.
the act does not indicate the date on which the number of registered voters should be counted for the purpose of determining whether an election is required under section.relying on section,citizens argue that the proper date is january,the date on which lafco issued the certificate of filing for the annexation application.section requires that the number of registered voters be determined as of the date that the certificate of filing is issued,but only for the purpose of determining whether an area is inhabited or uninhabited,which affects the procedure lafco must follow in acting on the application section is not expressly or implicitly applicable to the protest process.as no other provision expressly governs this issue,the matter remains vested in lafco discretion.
citizens suggest that determining the number of registered voters residing within the affected area at the outset of the proceedings is appropriate because it would ensure that all registered voters eligible to participate in the protest receive proper notice of the protest proceedings.determining the number of registered voters at the time the certificate of filing is issued,however,has no effect on the public notice of the protest hearing.notice of the protest hearing is required to be given by publication,not by individual mailing to the registered voters in the affected area,subd.a.
more importantly,lafco provides a reasonable explanation for counting the number of residents as of the close of the protest period,rather than the commencement of annexation proceedings.as lafco explains,the and thresholds for triggering an election or blocking the annexation,respectively,represent number of valid protests over the total number of registered voters.it requires only simple logic to conclude that the denominator and numerator of the fraction should be measured at the same time.residents who register to vote after the application is certified are eligible to submit protests and,thus,they should also be included in the final count of registered voters for purposes of section.likewise,voters who move from the affected area prior to the end of the protest period should be excluded from the final count.lafco decision is also consistent with section which,as quoted in full above,required lafco executive officer to ascertain,at the time the protests were being verified,both the number of registered voters in the affected territory and the number of qualified signers who submitted protests.thus,lafco did not abuse its discretion in counting the number of registered voters in the affected territory for purposes of section as of the date of the protest hearing.
contrary to citizen assertion,the written protest certification prepared by the department of elections is substantial evidence in support of lafco determination that there were voters in the annexed area as of june.under evidence code section,this official document is entitled to a presumption of correctness.the presumption is not overcome because the certification was executed subsequent to the date to which it applies,on july,or because the elections department did not produce the records from which the determination was made accordingly,because less than percent of registered voters protested the annexation,lafco properly ordered the annexation without election.
lafco properly excluded protests that did not include the protester residence address.
after reviewing each of the challenged protests,the trial court determined that lafco improperly excluded protests filed by registered voters that did not include the voter residence address the court regarded the situation as unusual because a large number of the registered voters in the affected area have mailing addresses that are different from their residence addresses.although it considered the requirement that the residence address be i
