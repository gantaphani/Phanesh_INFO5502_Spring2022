raven crest contracting,llc raven crest operates a surface coal mine near racine,west virginia,known as the boone north surface mine the boone north mine.this action challenges the adequacy of the environmental review conducted by the army corps of engineers the corps before the corps issued a permit pursuant to section of the clean water act,authorizing raven crest to discharge fill material into waters of the united states in conjunction with that mine.
the are a consortium of environmental groups,collectively ovec,that have engaged in advocacy efforts involving surface coal mining operations in west virginia in the past.ovec claims that the corps violated both the national environmental policy act nepa,et,and the clean water act by failing to consider evidence that surface coal mining is associated with adverse effects in nearby communities.the district court disagreed,and granted the corps and raven crest motions for summary judgment,holding that the corps properly determined that the connection between surface coal mining and public health was an issue not properly within the scope of its environmental review.ovec appealed.because this case is materially indistinguishable from our precedent in ohio valley environmental coalition aracoma coal company,cir,in which we rejected a similar challenge,we affirm.
at the boone north mine,raven crest planned to provide for the safe and efficient extraction of approximately million tons of steam grade bituminous coal from a area.to carry out its proposal,raven crest was required to obtain permits under each of four federal regulatory provisions the surface mining control and reclamation act of smcra,et.and sections,and of the clean water act.we review each of these permitting requirements below,focusing particularly on raven crest section permit,as that is the specific permit ovec has challenged in this case.
smcra permit 
smcra is a federal statute that mandates certain minimum requirements for state programs that regulate surface mining.if the state regulatory program meets those requirements,smcra grants that state exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations within the state borders.west virginia federally approved smcra program is administered by the west virginia department of environmental protection wvdep.
anyone wishing to undertake surface coal mining operations in west virginia must obtain a smcra permit from wvdep.aracoma,at citing a.the smcra permit application must provide detailed information about possible environmental consequences of the proposed operations,as well as assurances that damage to the site will be prevented or minimized during mining and substantially repaired after mining has come to an end.id.at see.
wvdep issued a smcra permit to raven crest on september,authorizing raven crest to engage in surface mining at the boone north mine.
certification 
section of the clean water act,requires a prospective mine operator to obtain a certification from the state in which the mine will be located stating that any discharge from the mine site will comply with all applicable water quality standards.aracoma,at.notably,the clean water act requires that state water quality standards be submitted to the federal environmental protection agency epa for approval,and that they be sufficiently stringent to protect public health.see c.without a certification,no other federal license or permit to conduct any activity which may result in any discharge into waters of the united states is valid.a.
wvdep issued a certification for the boone north mine on may,representing that raven crest proposed activities would not cause a violation of west virginia water quality standards.
section npdes permit 
under section of the clean water act,no person may discharge pollutants into the waters of the united states without a permit issued pursuant to the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes.as with smcra,the clean water act sets up a approach in which states may administer their own npdes permitting program so long as the state program meets certain minimum federal requirements.west virginia npdes permitting program is also administered by wvdep.
raven crest plan for the boone north mine involved the discharge of both treated water and stormwater runoff into several creeks and tributaries at the boone north mine.wvdep issued an npdes permit on may,authorizing those discharges.
section permit 
finally,under section of the clean water act,no person may discharge dredged or fill material into waters of the united states without a permit from the corps.raven crest plan for the boone north mine involved mining through streams,a process in which stream channels are excavated in order to recover coal reserves that lie directly beneath and adjacent to them,and then are backfilled,regraded to their approximate original contour or higher,and the affected channels restored.because this process involves discharging fill material into streams,raven crest needed a section permit from the corps before it could proceed.below,we first provide an overview of the corps permitting process,then recount the specifics of raven crest efforts to obtain a section permit for the boone north mine.
in reviewing a section permit application,the corps must ensure that the proposed discharge of fill material will not cause s ignificantly adverse effects on human health or welfare,on aquatic life and other wildlife dependent on aquatic ecosystems,on aquatic ecosystem diversity,productivity,and stability,or on recreational,aesthetic,and economic values.aracoma,at quoting c.in addition,the corps must conduct a public interest review for each permit application through which t he benefits which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.id.quoting a.
because the corps is a federal agency,its review of a section permit application must also comply with nepa,which requires agencies to produce an environmental impact statement eis before undertaking any major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c nepa requirements are procedural,not substantive.thus,even agency action with adverse environmental effects can be so long as the agency has considered those effects and determined that competing policy values outweigh those costs.aracoma,at.
to determine whether an action is a major one requiring an eis,agencies prepare an environmental assessment ea,a concise public document meant to provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an eis or a finding of no significant impact.a see friends of back bay army corps of eng rs,cir.if the ea results in a finding of no significant impact,the agency need not prepare an eis.
raven crest initiated the section permitting process for the boone north mine on october,by submitting a permit application to the corps.after receiving raven crest application,the corps issued a public notice summarizing the application and soliciting public comments.ovec submitted a lengthy response letter.in that letter,it expressed a concern that v arious studies have shown that coal mining has significant impacts on the health of those living in the coal fields,and contended that t hese impacts must be considered by the corps during the permitting process.
on august,the corps issued a permit evaluation and decision document that included both the section required public interest review and the ea,and ultimately granted raven crest section permit.the public interest review portion of the document concluded that issuing the permit would not be contrary to the public interest.the ea portion of the document concluded that granting the permit would not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment,and that therefore the corps did not need to prepare an eis.
the corps did not consider the studies ovec cited in its comment letter,explaining that the issues those studies raised regarding the relationship between surface coal mining and public health are not within the purview of the corps regulatory authority,bu
