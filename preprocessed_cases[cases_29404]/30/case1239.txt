background 
wasatch powderbird guides wpg has continuously operated a guided helicopter skiing business in the and uinta national forests since.it operates pursuant to special use permits periodically issued by the forest service.in this appeal,citizens committee to save our canyons and utah environmental congress collectively soc,challenge the renewal permit issued to wpg in.prior to the permit,wpg operated under a permit issued in.
soc are organizations comprised of members who use the areas in which wpg operates for uses such as backcountry skiing,snowshoeing,hiking,and camping.they claim their recreational opportunities and experiences are diminished by wpg operations and argue the forest service failed to comply with relevant laws when issuing wpg most recent permit.
a.the and uinta forest plans 
under the national forest management act,the forest service manages national forests pursuant to forest plans periodically developed for each forest.the and uinta forest plans were initially adopted in.at that time,the plan expressly recognized helicopter skiing as a legitimate use of the national forest and called for one helicopter ski special use permit on the present permit area.the original uinta plan also directed the forest would be open to helicopter skiing under a special use permit.
the forest service revised the plan in.the plan established the following as goals manage for an array of recreation opportunities and settings to improve the quality of life for a variety of forest recreation users.balance growth and expansion of recreation by managing within the capability of sustainable ecosystems found on the forest for today and the future.specifically regarding helicopter skiing,the plan provides,
helicopter skiing will continue to operate as a component of the recreation picture in the central wasatch.helicopter skiing and ski mountaineering will continue to compete for untracked conditions,and those users seeking quiet in the winter backcountry may continue to object to helicopter skiing.information will continue to be available to all backcountry visitors to help them make informed decisions and avoid conflicts it is uncertain,however,whether helicopter skiing can be managed to remain profitable over the long term while accommodating a reasonable level of compromise with competing backcountry uses.
the uinta forest plan was also revised in.the uinta plan provides for d iverse and suitable recreational opportunities responsive to public demand while maintaining ecosystem health and contribution to social and economic sustainability.the uinta plan specifically provides for helicopter skiing consistent with the resource capability,other land uses,and other resource management goals.
wpg permit 
although soc challenges wpg permit,the dispute in this case goes back to the permitting process for wpg permit.
when wpg applied for its permit,the forest plans governed the permitting decision.the forest service at the time interpreted the forest plans as requiring the forests to allow helicopter skiing.accordingly,when the forest service began developing an environmental impact statement eis for the permit decision,the forest service identified that the purpose and need of the proposed action was to c ontinue one helicopter ski special use permit on the present area.this need would be met by a llowing for an economically viable helicopter skiing operation.
the final eis for the permit thus analyzed each option based on whether it would allow wpg to remain economically viable.the permit the forest service ultimately approved set forth a number of restrictions on wpg operations,including limiting wpg operating season,closing the national forests to helicopter skiing on sundays and mondays,limiting wpg to using one helicopter in certain areas,and limiting the number of skiers wpg could serve.
wpg appealed the decision to the regional forester,arguing the restrictions threatened its economic viability.based on the understanding that the forest plans required the forest service to ensure its helicopter skiing permittee was economically viable,the regional forester ordered a financial analysis of wpg operations.the financial analysis revealed that limiting weekend operations and limiting wpg to one helicopter in certain areas were key constraints on wpg economic viability.but rather than amending the permit,the forest service decided to incorporate the information gleaned from the financial analysis into the analysis for the next permit application.
wpg permit 
wpg permit was issued under the new forest plans,rather than the forest plans that governed the permit.to highlight the change in focus of the forest plans,the draft eis for the permit provided,
the forest service emphasizes the fact that the agency is not responsible for any permittee economic viability.while private sector economic concerns are not necessarily those of the federal government,the success or failure of a permittee may have a considerable bearing on the forest service ability to meet the mandate to provide a range of quality recreational opportunities on lands under our administration.

accordingly,the draft eis analyzed a range of alternatives,including not issuing a permit and various limitations on wpg operating season,days,and area.the draft eis incorporated much of the analysis from the eis,which was prepared for the permit.see encouraging agencies to incorporate material by reference.particularly,it incorporated the eis analysis of the safety impact of wpg use of explosives to test slope stability and the noise impacts of wpg operations on other backcountry users.
but the draft eis also distinguished its analysis from the eis 
the eis provided a detailed analysis of the impacts of various permit terms on wpg economic viability.however,the revised forest plans for the and uinta national forests clarify the relationship between the forest service and outfitter and guide permittees,including the agency perspective on permittee economic viability.the agency concern is provision of a range of recreational opportunities on the lands under their administration.while it is recognized that a permittee can not continue to provide a recreational opportunity if the permitted operation is not economically viable,viability in itself is not an agency concern.
er.it then concluded 
therefore,the focus of this analysis is on whether or not the terms of a given permit would provide wpg with adequate operational flexibility to continue to provide a quality experience economic viability,per se,was determined to be outside the scope of the analysis on the basis of the current forest plan direction.
numerous comments on the draft eis,including one from soc,accused the forest service of considering wpg economic viability,in the guise of operational efficiency,in violation of the forest plans.soc also suggested the term operational efficiency should be defined,and set forth reasons why wpg economic viability would not actually be threatened by increased restrictions.er.
in response to comments like these,the forest service in the final eis defined operating efficiency as how the operational conditions of the permit negatively or positively affect the permittee ability to provide the type and level of recreational opportunity desired by the forest service.er.the forest service reiterated the economic viability of outfitter and guide permittees is not the agency concern.er.rather,
the forest service interest is in retaining as a recreational opportunity on the and uinta national forests,as long as other values are maintained.to meet this objective in a sustainable way,and with the least environmental impact,requires an efficient operation.thus,while wpg economics are not a forest service concern,their operational efficiency is.
prior proceedings 
on october,the forest service issued a record of decision outlining the decision to issue another permit to wpg and adopting the following permit restrictions wpg may operate between december and april,plus five additional days outside of this period,but days used before december must be for noncommercial purposes not operate in the most heavily used area of the forest on sundays and mondays,except that wpg may operate on three mondays if it does not operate on the preceding saturday operate on three sundays or mondays if it collects skiers at the end of the day by van rather than helicopter use two helicopters in the most heavily used area five days per season provide total skier days in the permit area,half of which may be used in the most heavily used area and use up to explosive charges per season to test slope stability.er.
soc appealed the record of decision,and the regional forester affirmed.soc then filed this action in federal district court challenging the regional forester decision.soc argued the forest service violated the national forest management act nfma because the permitting decision was inconsistent with the and uinta forest plans and violated the national environmental policy act nepa by failing adequately to consider potential environmental impacts.
the district court found for the forest service,and soc appeals.
ii.discussion 
soc first argues the forest service violated the forest management laws embodied in nfma.soc contends that,by the forest service own interpretation of the forest plans,the forest service should not have considered wpg economic viability.by considering wpg operational efficiency,the forest service in effect considered economic viability in violation of the forest plans.
second,soc argues the forest service violated the environmental laws contained in nepa in two ways the forest service prevented the public from commenting on wpg economic viability,a significant factor,by insisting that it would not consider economic viability and couching the consideration of economic viability in the term operational efficiency and the forest service did not sufficiently analyze increasing recreational pressures in the forests that affect the safety of forest users and noise impacts associated with wpg operations.
we agree with the district court that the permitting decision complied with both nfma and nepa.

we turn to whether the forest service permitting decision in this case complied with nfma and nepa.
nfma requires the forest service to develop,maintain,and,as appropriate,revise land and resource management plans for units of the national forest system.a.all permits the forest service issues for the use and occupancy of national forest system lands shall be consistent with the land management plans.id.at i.
soc argues wpg permit is inconsistent with the forest plans.soc argues the forest service interpreted its own forest plans as prohibiting the consideration of wpg economic viability,but then employed economic considerations in the permitting decision.
to support its argument,soc quotes a single sentence from the section of the eis discussing public involvement and issues reviewed by the forest service.it suggests the following language embodies the forest service extant interpretation of the forest plans economic viability,per se,was determined to be outside the scope of this analysis on the basis of current forest plan direction.er.
given the context of this statement and the document as a whole,we can not agree this sentence alone constitutes the forest service interpretation of the forest plans.taken as a whole,the eis shows the forest plans require the forest service to balance a variety of recreational activities in the permit area,including,if possible,helicopter skiing.nothing in the eis prohibits the consideration of broad economic factors in the permitting process.rather,the eis interprets the forest plans as redirecting the perspective of the forest service to recreational opportunities as a whole,with a due consideration for the effect of permit conditions on proposed operations.
the eis goes to great lengths to explain the role of economic viability in its analysis.it explains,for example,how the forest plans changed the focus of the permitting decision from requiring consideration of a permitee economic viability to a more balanced approach and how,consistent with this change in focus,considering wpg operating efficiencies better meets the new forest plans goals than examining wpg economic the forest service had prior to issuing the permit.
in particular,the very paragraph soc quotes from explains that the forest plans require the forest service to provide a range of recreational opportunities on the lands under their administration including the forest service interest in retaining as a recreation opportunity within the forests.er.the eis explicitly acknowledges that certain restrictions on permittee operations could limit the kinds of recreational opportunities available in the forests and interfere with forest plan goals if permittees can not operate under the established restrictions.er.
in accordance with this interpretation of the forest plans,the eis examined various options and concluded an acceptable balance between helicopter skiing and other uses could be reached by imposing certain restrictions on wpg operations.these restrictions reflect no special consideration for wpg economic viability beyond the goal of providing a range of diverse,recreational opportunities including helicopter skiing.er.the eis thoroughly explains the forest service approach,and the permit includes a number of reasonable restrictions on wpg with the goal of allowing both helicopter skiers and other backcountry users to enjoy the national forests.in the end,the forest service permit reflected the type and level of it thought appropriately balanced the competing recreational uses in the forests.
taking the interpretation of the forest plans represented by the eis as a whole,the eis and the ultimate permitting decision comply with the forest service interpretation of its forest plans.the forest service properly considered how particular options would affect the range of recreational opportunities available in the forests and balanced interests in a way it believed promoted multiple forest uses.rather than violating the forest plans,this approach of promoting a variety of recreational opportunities is directly in line with the forest plans goals.
in short,we can not conclude this result or the process used to reach it violates nfma directive that permits be consistent with forest plans.
under nepa,a federal agency must prepare an eis before it takes any action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.the eis must examine i the environmental impact of the proposed action,ii any adverse environmental effects which can not be avoided should the proposal be implemented,iii alternatives to the proposed action,iv the relationship between local uses of man environment and the maintenance and enhancement of productivity,and v any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented.id.
nepa places upon federal agencies the obligation to consider every significant aspect of the environmental impact of a proposed action.it also ensures that an agency will inform the public that it has considered environmental concerns in its process.utah shared access alliance forest,cir quoting baltimore gas natural res.defense council,d accord ecology center,at.
nepa does not,however,require agencies to elevate environmental concerns over other appropriate considerations it requires only that the agency take a hard look at the environmental consequences before taking a major action.in other words,it prohibits than action.utah shared access alliance,at quotation omitted.the role of the courts in reviewing compliance with nepa is simply to ensure that the agency has adequately considered and disclosed the environmental impact of its actions and that its decision is not arbitrary and capricious.id.at quotation omitted.
soc argues the eis was inadequate under nepa because the forest service failed to adequately disclose and solicit public comment in the way it handled the issue of operational efficiency,and the forest service inadequately analyzed other environmental impacts,including usage,safety and noise.
public comment 
under nepa regulations,the agency must publish a draft eis for public comment and respond to those comments in the final eis.the goal is to inform decisionmakers and the public of the reasonable alternatives which would avoid or minimize adverse impacts or enhance the quality of the human environment.eiss shall be written in plain language and may use appropriate graphics so that decisionmakers and the public can readily understand them.soc argues the forest service failed to comply with these regulations because it did not identify wpg economic viability as a significant issue in the eis and the public therefore had no opportunity to comment on one of the major factors the forest service considered in its decision.
as discussed above,the draft eis explained how the forest plans altered the focus of the permitting decision when compared to the forest plans.while the draft eis explained the forest plans had shifted the focus away from a mandate of the permittee economic viability,it explicitly acknowledged the success or failure of a permittee may have a considerable bearing on the forest service ability to meet the mandate to provide a range of quality recreational opportunities.er.
in response to the draft eis,the forest service received comments to the effect that it should not consider wpg economic viability at all and that operational efficiency should be defined.er.in particular,soc itself commented on the draft eis,as it argued in this appeal,that the forest service was effectively considering wpg economic viability in the guise of operational efficiency.er.soc even went on to explain how wpg could continue to operate as an economically viable business even under more restrictive permit conditions.er.
the forest service response to these comments reiterated that the forest service was not concerned with wpg economic viability,but that its goal was retaining as a recreational opportunity on the and uinta national forests,as long as other values are maintained.er.the forest service again repeated that a more efficient helicopter skiing operation would better meet this objective in a sustainable way,and with the least environmental impact.er.in the draft eis and the response to public comments,the forest service clearly articulated its decisionmaking criteria and the basis for its eventual decision.the forest service explained that the term operational efficiency obviously subsumes some element of economic consideration.the public,including soc,had a full opportunity to comment on these criteria,and the public in fact submitted relevant comments.no one was misled.
because the forest service articulated a rational basis for its consideration of operational efficiency and considered public comments,the forest service action was not arbitrary and capricious on this account.
environmental impact 
soc also argues the permitting decision was arbitrary and capricious for failure to consider important environmental consequences.it claims the forest service insufficiently analyzed the risk to other forest users from wpg explosives and the effect on other users of helicopter noise.in particular,soc argues the discussion of these issues in the most recent eis relied on the eis,and that backcountry use had increased so dramatically that the forest service needed to develop a new analysis of patterns of backcountry use,and the forest service needed to develop a more comprehensive analysis of helicopter noise patterns.
under nepa,the eis should take a hard look at the impacts of a proposed action.friends of the bow thompson,cir see c.but nepa hard look does not necessarily require the agency to develop hard data.ecology center,at.the forest service meets the hard look requirement by present ing the environmental impacts of the proposal and the alternatives in comparative form,thus sharply defining the issues and providing a clear basis for choice among options.o nce environmental concerns are adequately identified and evaluated by the agency,nepa places no further constraint on agency actions.friends of the bow,at quotation omitted.
the eis in this case adequately identified and evaluated increasing recreational use of backcountry areas,the impact of wpg operations on the safety of other forest users,and the noise impacts of wpg helicopters in the permit area.the forest service thus complied with nepa hard look requirement.
increased backcountry usage 
the forest service identified and evaluated as an important issue increasing usage of backcountry recreation areas.the eis for the permit recognized that use of the backcountry for winter recreation has been increasing,but r eliable estimates of the number of individuals recreating in the central wasatch backcountry during the winter are still not available.the question can be addressed at one level by looking at national trends,which show that alternatives to resort skiing have gained significant popularity over the past decade.er.based on trends in equipment sales,calls to the utah avalanche forecast center,and observations by forest service personnel,wpg employees,and backcountry users themselves,the eis concluded,most of the anecdotal information reviewed for this analysis suggests that winter backcountry use is high and growing,and that the trend is likely to persist.some incremental shifts in the types and patterns of backcountry recreation other than may have occurred but can not be reliably documented.er.accordingly,the eis adopted the eis analysis of backcountry usage patterns,while allowing for an overall increase in usage.er 
in response to public comments on the absence of hard data,the forest service concluded the updated but still largely qualitative information on other backcountry use in the permit area considered in this analysis is sufficient for public disclosure and informed decision making.er.t he forest service acknowledges that the backcountry sees relatively high levels of recreation use,and such use is likely to increase over time however,the eis provi
