petitioned for a writ of mandate to compel respondents community redevelopment agency of the city of los angeles agency and city of los angeles city to set aside the september design guidelines design guidelines for the north hollywood redevelopment project area project area.the trial court denied the requested relief and entered a judgment of dismissal.finding no error,we affirm.
background 
appellants are private developers of several properties located within the project area.the project area has been subject to a community redevelopment plan since the redevelopment plan or plan,when the original plan was approved by the agency and city under the state community redevelopment law crl.health,et the redevelopment plan was amended in,and.
as authorized by section of the plan,in september,the agency adopted the design guidelines that are at issue in this litigation.section of the plan provides subject to applicable state and city laws and regulations regarding design for development and within the limits,restrictions,and controls established in this plan,the agency in consultation with the pac project area committee is authorized to establish floor area ratios,heights of buildings,land coverage,setback requirements,design criteria,traffic circulation,traffic access,and other development and design controls necessary for proper development of both private and public areas within the project area.
in december,appellants filed the present action seeking to overturn the design guidelines as facially invalid on the theory that they conflict with applicable state and local laws.as we understand the allegations,one of appellants main concerns is that the design guidelines have effectively the maximum allowable densities of the project area commercial core.although appellants do not claim a vested right or entitlement to the maximum allowable densities under the zoning code,they argue that the design guidelines have effectively amended the zoning code without complying with the procedural and individualized notice requirements of the state planning and zoning law,thereby rendering the zoning code inconsistent with the general plan.citing,et lesher communications,city of walnut creek cal d,a zoning code that is inconsistent with the general plan is invalid when passed,and a zoning code that was originally consistent but later became inconsistent with the general plan must be brought into conformity with the general plan.
the trial court denied the requested relief.it found by substantial evidence that because the decision to impose the disputed land use regulations was made years ago when the redevelopment plan was approved,the statute of limitations has long expired.it also disagreed that the design guidelines effectively amended the zoning code,and found the evidence insufficient to establish that the design guidelines are inconsistent with state density bonus law the city general plan or the zoning code.finally,the court rejected,based on both the merits and the statute of limitations defense,the allegation that the design guidelines were approved in violation of the california environmental quality act ceqa.pub.resources code,et the trial court entered a judgment of dismissal from which appellants have timely appealed 
discussion 
appellants contend on appeal that because the design guidelines effectively amended the zoning code a the design guidelines were approved in violation of the procedural requirements of the state planning and zoning law,et and b the zoning code no longer conforms to the general plan,which is a violation of government code section,subdivision a in addition,appellants assert that the design guidelines conflict with state density bonus law,were adopted without justification,and were adopted in violation of ceqa requirements.
standard of review 
in determining whether the administrative decision to adopt the design guidelines was consistent with applicable law,we exercise our independent judgment.see associated builders contractors,san francisco airports com.cal th,d.in reviewing the trial court factual determinations,we apply the substantial evidence standard.the substantial evidence standard,not the independent exercise of the court judgment,governs judicial review of the findings and determinations of an agency and legislative body in the adoption and approval of a redevelopment plan.citations.fosselman,city of alhambra d.
ii.california redevelopment law 
in evaluating appellants contentions,we must bear in mind the crl purpose of addressing problems of urban blight.as stated in evans city of san jose th,d,the california redevelopment act was enacted in to address problems of urban blight.it provides that cities and counties can establish redevelopment agencies with the authority to acquire and sell real property,to impose land use and development controls,and to finance their operations by borrowing from federal or state governments the provisions of the california redevelopment act are contained in health and safety code,section et,known as the california community redevelopment law crl.id.at,d,fn.omitted evans.
in city of diamond bar th,d,the court explained that a prerequisite to invoking redevelopment under the crla is the determination that the project area is afflicted with blight the goal of addressing urban blight is the central focus of any redevelopment plan.accordingly,the crl empowers redevelopment agencies to prepare and carry out plans for the improvement,rehabilitation,and redevelopment of blighted areas in the city or county,but must act in accordance with the statutory provisions of the crl.a redevelopment agency is unique among public entities in that it works in conjunction with the private lenders,developers,owners and order to achieve the goal of eliminating blight.evans,supra,th at,d.
when a redevelopment agency adopts and implements a redevelopment plan under the crl,it is carrying out state,not local,policy.the principle is well established that the local governing body is carrying out state policy when it acts in proceedings under the community redevelopment law.as the court explained in gibbs city of napa d.the policy question,whether a city redevelopment agency shall function,is of a legislative nature.but when the need for the agency to function is determined,all considerations of wisdom,policy and desirability connected with the functioning of a redevelopment plan become settled the agency acts thereafter fall within the executive or administrative functions.and case authority makes it clear that once the legislative policy is established the administrative acts following therefrom are not subject to referendum.andrews city of san bernardino d.redevelopment agency city of berkeley d.city of berkeley.
iii.the design guidelines are not a zoning ordinance within the meaning of the government code 
appellants claim that the design guidelines regulate the use of buildings,structures and lands within the project area and specify the location,height,size of lots,allowable density,and other matters fundamentally within the purview of the zoning laws.they assert,there can be little question but that the design guidelines are patently a zoning ordinance,or an amendment to a zoning ordinance,within the meaning of the state planning and zoning law.thus,appellants allege,respondents were required to approve the guidelines in accordance with the procedures established in the state planning and zoning law,et.
respondents contend that the design guidelines implemented the redevelopment plan and did not constitute a zoning change.thus,they argue,the government code provisions do not apply.we agree.
appellants fail to take into account the difference between adopting a redevelopment plan and implementing one.the city that creates a redevelopment agency must approve a redevelopment plan for a blighted area,and adopt the plan by ordinance.health.county of solano vallejo redevelopment agency th,d.while appellants are correct that the redevelopment agency must find that the redevelopment plan conforms to the general plan,that determination is made prior to the adoption of the plan.health.the government code pr
