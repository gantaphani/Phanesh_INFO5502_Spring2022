these two consolidated cases involve the california global warming solutions act of the act health saf.code,et stats,ch,enacting assem.bill reg.sess,popularly known as ab the act was passed by a simple majority vote of both legislative houses.its general purpose is to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions to protect the environment.
plaintiffs and allied amici curiae do not quarrel with the act or its goals,but attack one part of the implementing regulations adopted by the state air resources board board.the board created a program that includes the auction sale of some but not all ghg emissions allowances.covered large emitters of ghgs must either surrender sufficient compliance instruments emissions allowances or offset credits to cover the amount of pollutants they discharge,or face monetary penalties or other negative consequences.see cal.code,tit.the board distributes some emissions allowances for free,but sells others at quarterly auctions.a covered entity that can not reduce its emissions below the amount authorized by its free allowances and any offset credits it has obtained must purchase more allowances at the board quarterly auctions,or on a secondary market where allowances are sold or traded without board control.
as in the trial court,on appeal plaintiffs assert the auction sales exceed the legislature delegation of authority to the board to design a emissions reduction system,and the revenue generated by the auction sales amounts to a tax that violates the supermajority vote requirement of proposition.cal,art.xiii a.the trial court rejected these two claims in a thorough written decision.
as for the first question,we hold that the legislature gave broad discretion to the board to design a distribution system,and a system including the auction of some allowances did not exceed the scope of legislative delegation.further,the legislature later ratified the auction system by specifying how to use the proceeds derived therefrom.
as for the second question,although our reasoning differs from that of the trial court,we agree that the auction sales do not equate to a tax.as we shall explain,the hallmarks of a tax are that it is compulsory and that the payor receives nothing of particular value for payment of the tax,that is,the payor receives nothing of specific value for the tax itself.contrary to plaintiffs view,the purchase of allowances is a voluntary decision driven by business judgments as to whether it is more beneficial to the company to make the purchase than to reduce emissions.reducing emissions reduces air pollution,and no entity has a vested right to pollute.further,once purchased,either from the board or the secondary market,the allowances are valuable,tradable commodities,conferring on the holder the privilege to pollute.indeed,speculators have bought allowances seeking to profit from their sale,and as one party puts it,taxes do not attract volunteers.these twin aspects of the auction system,voluntary participation and purchase of a specific thing of value,preclude a finding that the auction system has the hallmarks of a tax.
the bulk of the briefing in the trial court and on appeal discusses the test to determine whether a purported regulatory fee is instead a tax subject to proposition.the key authority is sinclair paint state bd.of equalization cal th sinclair paint and its progeny.however,as we explain in more detail,post,the sinclair paint test is not applicable herein,because the auction system is unlike other governmental charges that may raise the tax or fee question resolved thereby.the system is the voluntary purchase of a valuable commodity and not a tax under any test.
accordingly,we shall affirm the judgments denying the petitions in these consolidated cases.
background 
in the legislature passed and governor schwarzenegger signed the act,which requires that covered entities reduce ghg emissions to levels by the year.the act did not pass by a vote of each legislative house.
a decision by another appellate court summarized the act as follows 
the act is supported by legislative findings that global warming poses a serious threat to the economic,public health,natural resources,and the environment of california,and that global warming will have detrimental effects on some of california largest industries,subds.a,b.
the act designates the board as the state agency charged with monitoring and regulating sources of emissions of greenhouse gases that cause global warming in order to reduce emissions.in making this designation,the legislature codified its intention that the board design emissions reduction measures to meet the statewide emissions limits for greenhouse gases in a manner that minimizes costs and maximizes benefits for california economy,improves and modernizes california energy infrastructure and maintains electric system reliability,maximizes additional environmental and economic for california,and complements the state efforts to improve air quality,subd.h.
the act subjects the board to several directives.among other things,the board is required to adopt regulations for statewide reporting and monitoring of ghg emissions establish a statewide ghg emissions limit to be achieved by that is equivalent to the state ghg emissions level adopt rules and regulations to achieve the maximum technologically feasible and greenhouse gas emission reductions subject to the criteria and schedules set forth in the act and adopt and implement a list of discrete early action ghg emission reduction measures.our children earth foundation state air resources bd.th,our children earth.
the board promulgated regulations that created a system which included an auction component.cal.code,tit,et see association of irritated residents state air resources bd.th,fn.residents describing how a system works generally.its purpose is to reduce emissions of ghg associated with entities identified in this article through the establishment,administration,and enforcement of the california greenhouse gas program by applying an aggregate ghg allowance budget on covered entities and providing a trading mechanism for compliance instruments.cal.code,tit.covered entities must reduce their emissions below a threshold point,or obtain offset credits or emissions allowances,either from the board or the open market.the board distributes some allowances for free,retains some in a price containment reserve to buffer against unexpectedly high auction prices,and auctions the rest periodically.after each compliance period,an entity must surrender unused allowances.but as the trial court found,allowances are tradable,which creates a market for carbon allowances.covered entities include manufacturing,production,and utility operations that emit threshold amounts of ghgs.see cal.code,tit.
the regulatory system has been summarized briefly as follows 
effective january,the board implemented the california cap on greenhouse gas emissions and compliance mechanisms pursuant to its authority under the act.see cal.code,tit.the purpose of this program regulation is to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from sources covered by the program by applying an aggregate greenhouse gas allowance budget on covered entities and providing a trading mechanism for compliance instruments.cal.code,tit.entities covered are from a broad spectrum of industries,including electricity,natural gas and fuel suppliers,each of whom has previously reported ghg emissions that exceed a threshold established by the board 
the program imposes a cap on the aggregate ghg emissions these covered entities may emit during the annual compliance period.cal.code,tit,subd.a.the board enforces the cap,which is lowered over time,by issuing a limited number of allowances,the total value of which is equal to the amount of the cap.each allowance represents a limited authorization to emit up to one metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gases,subject to stated restrictions.ibid.covered entities demonstrate compliance with the program by the timely surrender of allowances which correspond to that entity compliance obligation during the relevant compliance period which is calculated pursuant to a formula set forth in the program regulation.subject to restrictions and limitations,allowances are tradable,which means that individual participants can buy,bank or sell allowances which are used by the covered entities to satisfy their compliance obligations.
a covered entity can also use offsets to meet a percentage of its compliance obligation under the program.citations.an offset is a voluntary reduction from a source that is not directly covered by the program which is used by a covered entity to comply with the program ghg emissions cap.our children earth,supra,th at.
in crafting these regulations,the board was required to follow nine statutory guidelines,to the extent feasible and in furtherance of achieving the statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit,subd.b.these guidelines directed the board to attempt to minimize costs,maximize the total benefits to california,encourage early action to reduce ghg emissions,avoid disproportionate impact on communities,award appropriate credit for early voluntary reductions,complement existing federal and state standards,consider,consider overall societal benefits,minimize administrative burdens of implementation and compliance,minimize leakage,subd.b,and c onsider the significance of the contribution of each source or category of sources to statewide emissions of greenhouse gases,subd.b.
the legislature expressly authorized the board to adopt regulations which establish compliance mechanisms in furtherance of achieving the statewide ghg emissions limit,subd.b see,subd.a.the act defines a compliance mechanism as either of the following a system of declining annual aggregate emissions limitations for sources or categories of sources that emit greenhouse gases.greenhouse gas emissions exchanges,banking,credits,and other transactions,governed by rules and protocols established by the state board,that result in the same greenhouse gas emission reduction,over the same time period,as direct compliance with a greenhouse gas emission limit or emission reduction measure adopted by the state board pursuant to this division,subd.k.our children earth,supra,th at.
over time,the number of allowances the cap will decrease to reduce the total ghg emissions which in theory should increase the value of remaining allowances.the auctions are expected to generate a great deal of money over the life of the program.by,the board plans to auction about half of the total allowances.the board,citing materials in its unopposed request for judicial notice,asserts without dispute by any party that as of january,about million allowances have been distributed for free,about million have been auctioned,and that the price containment reserve has not been tapped 
at auction,there is a single round of sealed bidding,and winning bidders pay the settlement or clearing price,that is,the lowest price that will clear all allowances in that tranche.see cal.code,tit,subds.a,e.thus,some bidders will pay less than they were willing to pay.first by regulation and now by statute,the proceeds are kept in a fund to further the act purposes,subd.b see code.
in the legislature passed four bills specifying how auction proceeds would be used to effectuate the act,and diverting million to the general fund for related purposes.none passed by a vote of each house 
the first suit was then filed by the california chamber of commerce and taxpayer larry dicke jointly,calchamber against the board,its members,and its executive officer,seeking to invalidate the auctions.the environmental defense fund and natural resources defense council jointly,edf intervened on behalf of the board,and nam intervened against the board.in a second suit,morning star packing company morning star and other entities sued the same defendants,attacking the same regulations on essentially the same grounds 
the trial court deemed the two cases to be related,heard a joint oral argument,and issued a joint written decision rejecting the petitions.
plaintiffs timely appealed in each case,and we accepted a stipulation by the parties to consolidate the appeals 
discussion 
ilegislative delegation 
the first question resolved by the trial court was whether the legislature vested the board with discretion to create a distribution system that included an auction.we agree with the trial court that the legislature conferred on the board extremely broad discretion to craft a distribution system,and the fact the legislature did not explicitly refer to an auction of allowances does not mean such an auction falls outside the scope of the delegation.moreover,by later specifying how the proceeds of the auctions would be used,the legislature effectively ratified the auction system created by the board.
standard of review 
we have set out the general standard for determining the validity of administrative regulations in a prior case as follows 
government code section provides the general standard of review for determining the validity of administrative regulations.that section states that w henever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt regulations to implement,interpret,make specific or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute,no regulation adopted is valid or effective unless consistent and not in conflict with the statute and reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute.
under the first prong of this standard,the judiciary independently reviews the administrative regulation for consistency with controlling law.in short,the question is whether the regulation is within the scope of the authority conferred if it is not,it is void.this is a question particularly suited for the judiciary as the final arbiter of the law,and does not invade the technical expertise of the agency.
by contrast,the second prong of this standard,reasonable necessity,generally does implicate the agency expertise therefore,it receives a much more deferential standard of review.the question is whether the agency action was arbitrary,capricious,or without reasonable or rational basis.morning star board of equalization th,morning star.
in reviewing the regulations in this case,we keep in mind that the burden is on the party challenging a regulation to show its invalidity.california school bds.state bd.of education th,california school bds.see association of california ins.companies jones cal th,jones.
b.the act is broad enough to encompass an emissions allowance auction 
the board contends authorization to d esign the regulations,including distribution of emissions allowances where appropriate,as well as authority to adopt a system of declining annual aggregate emission limits,subject to specified criteria,vested it with authority to sell some allowances at auction,subds.b,c,d f.for the board to prevail,we need only find that the auction regulations are consistent and not in conflict with the organic statute morning star,supra,th at they are.
plaintiffs emphasize that any implied administrative powers must be essential to the declared objects and purposes of the enabling act not simply convenient,but indispensable.any reasonable doubt concerning the existence of the power is to be resolved against the agency.addison department of motor vehicles d,quoting former d,administrative law,now d administrative law.but here,there is an explicit delegation to the board to design a method to distribute allowances.when an agency exercises discretion explicitly conferred on it,it is presumed to act within legislative intent.an agency is not limited to the exact provisions of a statute in adopting regulations to enforce its mandate.the absence of any specific statutory provisions regarding the regulation of an issue does not mean that such a regulation exceeds statutory authority citations.an agency is authorized to fill up the details of the statutory scheme.ford dealers department of motor vehicles cal d,see california school,supra,th at.
nfib contends an auction is not reasonably necessary to the act purposes and,somewhat similarly,cmta argues the board did not properly balance the relevant statutory factors.the board aptly replies that such argument conflates two distinct parts of the analysis of rulemaking the question of authority which the court reviews independently,giving weight to the agency construction and the question of reasonable necessity which the court reviews with great deference to the agency.see also jones,supra,cal th at.it was rational for the board to include an auction component in the regulations,given the broad statutory delegation.we may not superimpose our own policy judgment upon the agency in the absence of an arbitrary and capricious decision.pitts perluss cal d,see western states petroleum state of health services th,the existence and weight to be accorded the facts and policy considerations that support the regulation fall within agency bailiwick see also jones at.
plaintiffs launch a number of challenges to the conclusion that the legislature gave the board sufficient discretion to adopt an auction component if it adopted a program.the trial court summarized plaintiffs arguments as follows 
petitioners do not dispute that the program requires emission allowances to be distributed in some manner.however,petitioners argue that the text,structure,and legislative history of ab show that the legislature did not intend to authorize the sale of allowances.according to petitioners,the board discretion is limited to choosing a method for distributing the allowances free of charge or at least in a manner.petitioners raise the following arguments in support of their position the statute does not explicitly authorize the board to auction allowances the legislative history includes no discussion of the term auction at the time of ab enactment,most program allowances were distributed for free construing ab as authorizing the sale of allowances renders the administrative fee provision of the act surplusage the chief sponsor of ab ostensibly assured his colleagues on the floor of the legislature,just before the vote,that the only funds to be generated under ab were those generated by the administrative fee provision there is no guidance in ab as to how to spend any auction revenues and the legislature failed to enact a bill in that would have expressly authorized the board to auction the allowances.
because the briefing on appeal largely replicates these seven points,for convenience we will discuss them in the order assigned by the trial court.we then address an eighth point briefed on appeal,regarding the doctrine of constitutional doubt.
no explicit authorization 
contrary to the view posited by plaintiffs,there was no requirement that the legislature explicitly authorize or even discuss emissions auctions in the act in order for the board to adopt regulations calling for such auctions.
the act is a mere pages long see stats,ch,and it broadly sets forth its goals.the legislature obviously intended the program to be a creature of the board,either in deference to the board expertise,or out of pragmatic necessity to secure passage,or for both reasons.from the generality of the act,it is clear that the board has been granted considerable discretion to determine what is necessary to accomplish residents,supra,th at see jones,supra,cal th at the legislature goals.as another court observed,the breadth of legislative delegation was generous in this case 
the board is directed to consult with all state agencies with jurisdiction over sources of greenhouse gases and to receive public input,to consider all relevant information pertaining to greenhouse gas emissions reduction programs in other jurisdictions,to evaluate the total potential costs and total potential economic and noneconomic benefits of the plan to california economy,environment,and public health,using the best available economic models,emission estimation techniques,and other scientific methods and,ultimately,to identify and make recommendations on direct emission reduction measures,alternative compliance mechanism s,compliance mechanisms,and potential monetary and nonmonetary incentives for sources and categories of sources that the board finds are necessary and desirable to facilitate the achievement of the maximum feasible and reductions of greenhouse gas emissions by.these directives are exceptionally broad and.they leave virtually all decisions to the discretion of the board,from determining the nature of a scoping plan,to determining the best available research techniques,to determining incentives for emissions reduction that are necessary and desirable,to weighing economic,environmental and public health benefits,to determining what is most feasible and.residents,supra,th at,citations omitted,first italics in,second italics added see our children earth,supra,th at.
in particular,in adopting regulations,to the extent feasible and in furtherance of achieving the statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit,the state board shall do all of the following design the regulations,including distribution of emissions allowances where appropriate,in a manner that is equitable,seeks to minimize costs and maximize the total benefits to california,and encourages early action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,subd.b,italics added.
the statute allowing the board to design regulations that include distribution of emissions allowances,subd.b gave the board great flexibility.plaintiffs assertions that this statute does not permit an auction system are unconvincing 
the petitions do not dispute that the act permitted the board to adopt a system,as opposed to,for example,a more traditional regulatory enforcement system sometimes referred to as a system.but once such a system was chosen,the board had to decide who would capture the value of distributed allowances,the covered entities or the state.as the trial court explained,allowances can be allocated free of charge,sold by the regulating authority through an auction or direct sale,or allocated by some combination of these methods.if covered entities receive the allowances free of charge,they capture the value associated with the allowances.if allowances are sold or auctioned,the government captures the value created by the cap.whatever the allocation,whoever receives the initial allocation of allowances will receive a windfall equal to the value created by the constraint.fn.omitted.
the legislature presumably knew that if the board chose a system,some entity would capture the constraint value,but did not specify the recipient.as burtraw points out,the idea of auctioning some or all allowances long had been debated by scholars.see mcallister,the overallocation problem in moving toward stringency colum.envtl,stavins,a meaningful system to address climate change harv.envtl,ackerman stewart,reforming environmental law stan.
further,as the trial court observed,petitioners admit that at least two programs preceding the adoption of ab the federal clean air act and the european union emission trading system authorized allowances to be sold or auctioned.citation.similarly,the epa guide tools of the trade a guide to designing and operating a cap and trade program for pollution control states that the first major step is to decide whether allowances will be allocated at no cost or auctioned.the act requires the board to consider all relevant information pertaining to ghg emissions reduction programs in other states,localities,and nations,including the northeastern states of the united states,canada,and the european union,subd.c.tellingly,the trial court also found as follows 
in march of,five months before ab was enacted,the state of california climate action team submitted a report to the governor and the legislature noting that in a program for reducing ghg emissions,e mission allowances can be auctioned,sold or given away.citations.it is therefore reasonable to assume that the legislature understood the phrase distribution of emissions allowances to potentially encompass both giving away allowances and selling them via an auction or direct sale.it follows that,having broadly delegated the choice of distribution methods to the board,if the legislature had meant to exclude the sale of allowances,it would have said so.italics added.
we agree.the act itself references the climate action team.see,subd.i.the team report provided to the legislature before the act was that w hen allowances are given to entities covered by the cap,those entities receive something of value the emission allowances.when the allowances are auctioned,the government collects a portion of the value of the allowances in the amounts paid in the auction.it also explains a hybrid approach,where some allowances are sold and some are auctioned,the model ultimately adopted by the board.thus,the legislature knew that an auction was a possible component of a program.if the legislature had wanted to direct who would receive the constraint value if the board chose a system,it was free to do so,but did not.thus,it seems clear that the legislature meant for the board to decide whether to create a system including an auction for some emissions allowances 
lack of discussion in the legislative record 
plaintiffs assert that the power to create a program generating billions of dollars in revenue would not have been delegated to an agency without explicit discussion,and no such discussion appears in the legislative record.see in re christian cal th,we are not persuaded the legislature would have silently,or at best obscurely,decided so important and controversial a public policy matter ailanto properties,city of half moon bay th,the legislature does not,one might say,hide elephants in mouseholes fda brown williamson tobacco,d,we are confident that congress could not have intended to delegate a decision of such economic and political significance to an agency in so cryptic a fashion.plaintiffs point is that the statutory authority to create a distribution system could not encompass a multibillion dollar administratively created program.nam adds that the dearth of explicit discussion is particularly stark because of the legislature unique role in collecting and distributing state revenue.see in re attorney discipline system cal th,the power to collect and appropriate the revenue of the state is one peculiarly within the discretion of the legislature.
we disagree that the lack of discussion of an auction means the legislature precluded its adoption by the board.first,t he depth of the debate is the domain of the legislature.in re christian,supra,cal th at.legislative silence on an issue,or failure to anticipate all ramifications of a bill,does not change the scope of the statutory language.as stated in the context of interpretation of a purportedly ambiguous statute,t hat a statute can be applied in situations not expressly anticipated does not demonstrate ambiguity.it demonstrates breadth.estate of earley th.as we have discussed see part,ante,the act is worded broadly enough so as to encompass an administratively created auction,which was foreseeable based on material available to the legislature.
second,the act reflects the legislature desire for a massive,historic,and immediate change in behavior regarding ghg emissions.the legislature could have spent many years considering,analyzing,and dictating the best way to achieve its ambitious goals.but that delay itself would have impeded the goals.instead,the legislature chose to pass a flexible bill,with the understanding that the board,as the agency with expertise in air quality matters,was better equipped to study the problem and design a program to effectuate those goals.see jones,supra,cal th at.viewed in this light,the lack of explicit legislative discussion of one of one possible emissions reduction system that is,adoption of a program rather than a program is of no moment.
structure of other programs 
plaintiffs contend that other programs distribute all allowances for free,or are,or arose with explicit legislative authorization for auctions.we accept these asserted facts as true.
but the fact that other methods of distribution were possible is not compelling,or even noteworthy.as the trial court pointed out,our legislature did not mandate a cap program,therefore it had no need to detail the minutiae of such a program.while the legislature knew how other jurisdictions tackled ghg emissions problems,it was not compelled to follow in.neither was the board.
administrative fee provision 
although the parties discuss at length an administrative fee provision in the act,we find that provision irrelevant to the legislative delegation question.
the provision,section,allows the board to adopt a schedule of fees to be paid by the sources of ghg emissions regulated pursuant to this division,consistent with section.the revenues collected shall be deposited into the air pollution control fund and are available upon appropriation,by the legislature,for purposes of carrying out this division.stats,ch.the statute,which applies to many fees,encourages efficient and operation of the programs requiring such fees,and requires that the amount of each fee is not more than is reasonably necessary to fund the efficient operation of the activities or programs for which the fee is assessed,subd.a.
plaintiffs contend that the existence of this fee provision precluded the board from generating any other revenue under the act by any other mechanism.we disagree.
section is a pedestrian measure to pay for the costs of implementing the act.see cal.code,tit.this fee has no bearing on the delegation question.as the trial court put it it only proves the legislature intended to ensure the board could collect fees to pay for the administrative costs directly incurred in carrying out the provisions of the act.
we do not see this as an appropriate usage of the adage expressio unius est exclusio alterius,as contended by some plaintiffs see people ex rel.cranston bonelli d,legislative enumeration of certain exceptions by necessary implication excludes all other exceptions,because the administrative fee does not speak in any way to the legislative delegation question,and because it is not an exception to a general statutory rule.
floor debate and related statements 
plaintiffs attempt to bolster their contention regarding the administrative fee provision just discussed by referencing floor statements made by the author of the act,former assembly speaker fabian nuñez speaker nuñez assured legislators who expressed qualms about an open checkbook for the board,and an suv tax and the like,that this bill authorized only administrative fees to cover program costs.plaintiffs read much into the speaker usage of the words this bill and construe it to mean that the speaker was promising that no part of the act would have any other fiscal impact regardless of how it was implemented.but the speaker was referring to a market system in carbon credits before he made his assurance about program costs.further as explained in a february,legislative analyst report contained in the joint appendix a carbon tax would not function like a program with an auction component,and this report outlined alternatives the legislature could choose if it disagreed with the board rulemaking decisions the legislature did not disagree.
the enrolled bill report prepared by the board states fee authority.ab grants the board the authority to adopt a schedule of fees to be paid by regulated ghg emission sources for program administration.republicans feel that the fee authority language provides the board with carte blanche authority to collect fees on anything including imposing a tax on sport utility vehicles suv.to clear confusion,speaker nuñez added a letter to the file to clarify that the fee is limited to the board direct implementation costs only.the referenced letter by speaker nuñez referred only to the administrative fee provision,section.
a later portion of the enrolled bill report,discussing expected fiscal impact,states in part while the board has the authority to adopt a schedule of fees to be paid by regulated ghg emitters,two matters need to be resolved before this authority can be exercised.first,the governor made a policy commitment not to impose additional costs on industry beyond their own costs of compliance.second,collection mechanisms need to be created through mandatory reporting regulations which come in.similarly,regulatory development activity needs to get off the ground before the universe of regulated facilities and the appropriate schedule of fees can be determined.but when this passage was drafted,it was not known whether or not the board would create a cap program at all,therefore the omission to discuss the impact of auctioning allowances is understandable.nor does the governor purported policy commitment change the act.
calchamber refers to the governor proposed signing statement,prepared by the board.it provides in part i want to join the speaker in assuring that any fees that may be collected from sources of global warming emissions will only be used to support the essential and direct program costs associated with the bill.this,too,appears to be reference to the administrative fee provision 
none of these statements individually,nor all of them in combination,speak to the board ability to adopt an auction component within its program.
further,as we explain in part ii,post,the auction sales are not fees,they are the purchase price of a valuable commodity,an emissions allowance,therefore discussion of limiting fees in the legislative record is unpersuasive.
lack of guidance for disposing of auction proceeds 
in the legislature passed four bills that specified how the auction proceeds would be used to effectuate the act see fn,ante.in echo of their earlier argument,plaintiffs observe that the act itself did not address the disposition of auction revenue.but there was no need for the act to address the disposition of auction proceeds,because it was then unknown whether the board would create a program,rather than what the record calls a program,that would have mandated emissions reductions by regulatory order.see alliance of small industry south coast air quality management dist.th,fn.describing an early command and control program converted to a program,and making reference to the theoretical use of an auction system,although that program did not use an auction.
as we have said,that a bill has unknown or unanticipated consequences does not mean those consequences,when manifested,must be deemed to conflict with or exceed the scope of the legislation.see estate of earley,supra,th at.
unenacted bill 
morning star points to the failure of senate bill,which would have explicitly authorized auctions,as evidence of legislative intent.see bill reg.sess,as amended.we have explained that t he unpassed bills of later legislative sessions evoke conflicting inferences.some legislators might propose them to replace an existing prohibition others to clarify an existing permission.a third group of legislators might oppose them to preserve an existing prohibition,and a fourth because there was no need to clarify an existing permission.the light shed by such unadopted proposals is too dim to pierce statutory obscurities.as evidences of legislative intent they have little value.sacramento newspaper guild sacramento board of supervisors d,cited with approval by,fair employment housing com.cal d.
the limited circumstances under which an unenacted bill is relevant,such as where the legislature has studied an issue or court ruling and thereafter declines to change the law or adopt a new proposal see,western land office,cervantes d,seibert sears,roebuck d,or passes a bill without a specific provision contained in a prior version of the bill see,people hunt th,are not present here.instead,as in the general run of cases,it may be said only that the failure of the legislature to enact the proposed bill,in one form or another,is some evidence that the legislature does not consider it necessary or proper or expedient to enact such legislation.sterling city of oakland d.
thus,we find that the proposed but unenacted bill does not assist plaintiffs 
constitutional doubt 
on appeal,plaintiffs raise an eighth point,namely,the constitutional doubt canon of construction.they argue that because there are doubts about whether the auction is constitutional either because of the unlawful delegation claim or because of the tax argument see part ii,post we should interpret the act to preclude the auction.our supreme court has described the application of the constitutional doubt canon as follows 
if a statute is susceptible of two constructions,one of which will render it constitutional and the other unconstitutional in whole or in part,or raise serious and doubtful constitutional questions,the court will adopt the construction which,without doing violence to the reasonable meaning of the language used,will render it valid in its entirety,or free from doubt as to its constitutionality,even though the other construction is equally reasonable.citations.the basis of this rule is the presumption that the legislature intended,not to violate the constitution,but to enact a valid statute within the scope of its constitutional powers.harrott county of kings cal th.
but the canon has a narrow application,as we have recently reemphasized 
the constitutional doubt canon applies if and only if the statute is realistically susceptible of two interpretations and the interpretation to be rejected must raise grave and doubtful constitutional questions.citation.it is a tool for choosing between competing plausible interpretations of a statutory text,resting on the reasonable presumption that congress or,mutatis mutandis,the legislature did not intend the alternative which raises serious constitutional doubts.siskiyou farm bureau federation department of fish wildlife th,siskiyou.
under this standard,we find no basis to apply the interpretive canon herein,either as to the delegation question or the proposition question see part ii,post.we have not been offered alternative,plausible,statutory interpretations from which to choose 
conclusion as to legislative delegation 
for all of the above reasons,we agree with the trial court that plaintiffs have not carried their burden see california school,supra,th at to show the auction portion of the regulations exceeds the scope of legislative delegation.
c.the legislation 
the four bills passed in see fn,ante show that whatever the collective intention of the legislature,the legislature affirmatively ratified the board auction system.
legislative ratification 
we have held that whatever the legislature has power to authorize to be done it has power to ratify and confirm when done irregularly or not in the mode previously described.rock creek dist.county of calaveras d,see southern cal.gas public utilities com.cal d,regulations authorized by subsequent legislation even if the legislature can not confirm that such authority always existed it may furnish the missing authority nunc pro tunc.contrary to calchamber view,applying the ratification doctrine is not the same as using the acts of a later legislature to illuminate a prior legislature intent.see peralta community college dist.fair employment housing com.cal d,the declaration of a later legislature is of little weight in determining the relevant intent of the legislature that enacted the law.it instead treats later acts as curative of purported defects in prior acts 
thus,even were we to find that the act did not authorize the regulations adopted by the board,the legislature surely ratified them in by directing how the money is spent.see professional engineers in california government schwarzenegger cal th,although the governor,at the time he acted,lacked legislative authority to furlough state employees,the legislature enactment of the revisions to the budget act operated to ratify the use of the furlough program see,also,morning star,supra,th at there is strong evidence the legislature knows full well about a regulatory interpretation and the legislature is fine with that interpretation.this is strong evidence the regulation does not conflict with statutory law.the legislative will to ratify the board auction system by passage of the statutes is clear,and we need not discuss it further.
proposition 
morning star but not the other plaintiffs contends that any reliance on the statutes to ratify the auction component of the regulations would be invalid under proposition.we disagree.
proposition was passed by the people,in the exercise of their reserved initiative powers,in response to the perceived efforts of state and local governments to bypass the spirit of proposition and related measures,in particular by couching exactions as regulatory fees exempt from a supermajority vote.see schmeer county of los angeles th,schmeer voter information guide,elect,text of proposed laws.
in part,proposition amended our constitution so that any change in state statute which results in any taxpayer paying a higher tax is subject to the requirement that the change be passed by a vote of each legislative house.cal,art.xiii a,subd.a.proposition defines a tax as any levy,charge,or exaction of any kind imposed by the state with exceptions.cal,art.xiii a,subd.b.in defending against a proposition challenge,the state bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a levy,charge or other exaction is not a tax,that the amount is no more than necessary to cover the reasonable costs of the governmental activity,and that the manner in which those costs are allocated to a payor bear a fair or reasonable relationship to the payor burdens on,or benefits received from,the governmental activity.cal,art.xiii a,subd.d.
however,proposition,passed in,is not generally retrospective in operation.see brooktrails township community services dist.board of supervisors of mendocino county th.thus,it can not affect the act itself,passed in,and no party not even morning star contends otherwise.
the arguable relevance is the language broadening the definition of a tax and changing the burden of proof.morning star contends that proposition bars the use of the legislation to ratify the auction regulations,because the board has not proven the auction charges are not taxes as defined by proposition.
but the legislation did not change the cost of allowances,whether purchased at auction or on the secondary market it specified how the proceeds of auctions sales would be handled.thus,no state statute was changed in any way that could possibly increase any charge of any kind imposed by the state as provided by proposition.see western states petroleum board of equalization cal th,regulation changing method of assessing certain property that resulted in a higher bill for some taxpayers was not a state statute within the meaning of proposition southern california edison public utilities com.th,proposition plainly defines a tax as a change in state statute which results in a higher tax citation,not an agency decision that resulted in a fee.
accordingly,proposition interposes no bar to using the statutes to evince a legislative ratification of the auction regulations adopted by the board we thus must turn to the question of whether proposition poses an obstacle to the auction component of the board program.
whether the auctions sales violate proposition 
the second question presented to the trial court by the plaintiffs was whether the auction system is a tax subject to proposition.the trial court found this to be a close question in part because of the novelty of the charges at issue,but ruled the system was more like a regulatory fee than a tax,applying principles derived from sinclair paint and related cases,while acknowledging no prior case precisely governed this case.
although we disagree with its method of analysis,we agree with the trial court ultimate conclusion that the auction system does not equate to a tax subject to proposition.this is so for two interrelated reasons first,the purchase of emissions allowances,whether directly from the board at auction or on the secondary market,is a decision,not a governmentally compelled decision second,unlike any other tax to which we have been referred by the parties,the purchase of an emissions allowance conveys a valuable property interest the privilege to pollute california air that may be freely sold or traded on the secondary market.thus,the trial court correctly identified the two facts we find make the auction system unlike a tax,participation is voluntary,and entities receive a thing of value in exchange for obtaining allowances.
we discuss the trial court thoughtful decision in some detail.its reasoning drives much of the parties briefing and accurately outlines several relevant points.
standard of review 
under a sinclair paint analysis,whether a statute imposes a tax or fee under proposition is a question of law decided upon an independent review of the record.california farm bureau federation state water resources control bd.cal th,farm bureau.the challenger must establish a prima facie case showing that the fee is invalid.ibid.then the state must show the estimated costs of the service or regulatory activity and method of apportionment,to establish the charges allocated to a payor bear a fair or reasonable relationship to the payor burdens on or benefits from the regulatory activity.id.at see sinclair paint,supra,cal th at.this allocation of burdens presupposes that sinclair paint applies to the charge whether it applies is a purely legal question.
proposition and the trial court ruling 
proposition and its aftermath 
the language of proposition most relevant to this case is as follows 
a ny changes in state taxes enacted for the purpose of increasing rates or changes in methods of computation must be imposed by an act passed by not less than of all members elected to each of the two houses of the legislature.cal,art.xiiia,former,italics added,added by initiative,primary june,popularly known as the initiative,see mills county of trinity d,mills,and sometimes referred to as the people initiative to limit property taxation,see farm bureau,supra,cal th at,fn.
proposition was designed to provide tax relief,but purported loopholes were found,leading to later initiative measures to limit the use of regulatory fees in lieu of taxes.see schmeer,supra,th at discussing history of various subsequent measures.sinclair paint set forth rules to evaluate purported regulatory fees to determine if they were in reality taxes subject to proposition.
sinclair paint involved a program to remediate the effects of lead,funded by fees imposed on entities who contributed to lead contamination.sinclair paint,supra,cal th at.the court held the act imposes bona fide regulatory fees.it requires manufacturers and other persons whose products have exposed children to lead contamination to bear a fair share of the cost of mitigating the adverse health effects their products created in the community.viewed as a mitigating effects measure,it is comparable in character to similar police power measures imposing fees to defray the actual or anticipated adverse effects of various business operations.id.at.
sinclair paint stated that regulatory fees that do not exceed the reasonable cost of providing the services for which the fees are charged and are not levied for any unrelated revenue purposes were not subject to section of proposition,which defined special taxes and which the court viewed as bearing on the proper application of section of proposition,applicable to state taxes.schmeer,supra,th at see sinclair paint,supra,cal th at.
acknowledging that the word tax has no fixed meaning see mills,supra,d at,sinclair paint found the lead paint fee should be analyzed as a regulatory fee imposed under the police power,which is not deemed a special tax provided that the fees do not exceed the reasonable cost of accommodating the activity and are not levied for unrelated revenue purposes.sinclair paint,supra,cal th at see california building industry san joaquin valley air pollution control dist.th,building industry.
sinclair paint left open the possibility the challenger could show either that the amount of fees exceeded the reasonable cost of providing the protective services for which the fees were charged,or that the fees were levied for unrelated revenue purposes or that no clear nexus exists between its products and childhood lead poisoning,or that the amount of the fees bore no reasonable relationship to the social or economic burdens its operations generated.sinclair paint,supra,cal th at see california of scientists department of fish game th,scientists state must show the estimated costs of the service or regulatory activity,and the basis for determining the manner in which the costs are apportioned,so that charges allocated to a payor bear a fair or reasonable relationship to the payor burdens on or benefits from the regulatory activity.
the trial court ruling 
the trial court correctly observed that,generally,taxes are compulsory,enforced contributions for the support of the government.but,acknowledging that the term tax had no fixed meaning,the trial court found cases distinguishing taxes from fees provide helpful guidance.the cases have recognized several general categories of compulsory fees or charges that are distinguishable from taxes these categories are special assessments and related business charges,development fees,user fees,and regulatory fees.the trial court discussed cases analyzing charges under these four categories,and reasoned as follows 
t he charges are like a development fee in that they are used to mitigate impacts related to the fee payer business operations.however,unlike a development fee,the charges are not imposed in return for the privilege of developing land,and the amount of the charge is not tied to the individual payer impact on the community.
like a user fee,those who purchase allowances receive something that is not received by those who do not pay a tradable right to emit ghg.however,unlike a user fee,the charges are not imposed to offset the cost of a government product or service.
like a regulatory fee,the charges are collected as part of a regulatory program and the funds collected are used to carry out regulatory activities.however,unlike a traditional regulatory fee,the charges are not intended to shift the costs of a specific regulatory program.the proceeds of the sales will be used to pay for a wide range of regulatory programs ostensibly related to ab.
the trial court outlined four points militating in favor of finding a tax,as follows 
the charges are not entirely voluntary because the covered entity either must reduce its ghg emissions to zero which,generally speaking,is impractical or impossible or acquire allowances.further,the court thought the purchase of allowances is little different from an emissions tax.
a n allowance has no value independent of the regulatory scheme.while those who purchase allowances may be said to acquire a benefit vis other covered entities,they do not acquire any benefit vis other entities,which retain the right to freely emit ghgs without the need for acquiring any allowances.
t he amount charged is determined,at least in part,by government fiat.although the auction relies on bidding,there is only one round of bidding,using sealed bids,and the auction operator will not accept bids that fall below a auction reserve price.the auction reserve price is a price floor set by government fiat.in addition,sales of allowances from the containment reserve are sold at prices fixed by the government.moreover,by definition,the government has artificially constrained the supply of allowances indeed,this is the very purpose of the cap.thus,it is not factually accurate for the board to claim that the price is determined by the market.
under the legislation,the proceeds must be used to further ab regulatory goal however,since nearly every aspect of life has some impact on ghg emissions,it is difficult to conceive of a regulatory activity that will not have at least some impact on ghg emissions.
next,the trial court outlined four correlative points weighing against finding a tax 
the allowances have economic value and can be traded,and i f the atmosphere capacity to assimilate ghgs is viewed as a limited public resource,selling emissions allowances can be analogized to selling a right to use a public resource,similar to a hunting or fishing license,a mineral extraction permit,or a wireless electromagnetic spectrum license.
t he purchase of allowances is,in some respects,voluntary.because covered entities receive a significant portion of the allowances for free,covered entities have some control over when,and perhaps if,they participate in sales of allowances.covered entities may be able to reduce their ghg emissions to reduce or completely avoid their need to purchase allowances.further,they are not compelled to purchase allowances from the board.fn.omitted.
t he price of allowances is determined at least in part by market forces.
the proceeds will further the regulatory purposes of the act and the charges were imposed ostensibly,at least for regulatory purposes.
ultimately,the trial court found the primary purpose of the charges is regulatory,the fees collected will not exceed the costs of the regulatory activities because revenue will advance the act goals,and given that the charges are a byproduct of the implementation of a regulatory program and the proceeds are received in exchange for the purchase of a valuable,tradable right to emit ghgs,a sufficient reasonable relationship exists between the charges and the covered entities collective responsibility for the harmful effects of ghg emissions.thus,the trial court found no proposition violation.
c.the auction of allowances is not a tax 
we shall first explain why we are not bound to apply the sinclair paint test to assess the legality of the auction system.part,post.we then describe the twin traditional hallmarks of a tax a tax is a compulsory exaction that confers nothing of particular benefit to the payor.part,post.we next explain why the purchase of allowance credits,either directly via board auction or indirectly via the secondary market,is not compulsory.part,post.we then explain why the emissions allowances constitute valuable property rights albeit only as between private parties.this valuable property right consists of the privilege to pollute california air,a privilege no party has a vested right to continue doing.part,post.we conclude that the auction system created by the board is part of the distribution system the board was charged with developing,and the choice to participate in that market does not equate to a tax payment.part,post.finally,we briefly address the use of the auction revenue,discussed in detail in the briefing,and explain that we need not decide the propriety of any specific expenditure in this case.part,post.
sinclair paint does not control this case 
we reject morning star claim,echoed by others,that sinclair paint established criteria that lower courts must use to determine whether a revenue generating measure is a tax under proposition or a regulatory fee.italics added.sinclair paint did not hold that its analysis applied to any revenue generating measure.instead,it analyzed whether the exaction at issue was exempt from proposition as a purported regulatory fee.sinclair paint,supra,cal th at see tomra pacific,chiang th,sinclair paint set out guidelines for determining whether a denominated fee is,in fact,a bona fide regulatory fee and not a disguised tax.as the board pointed out in oral argument,sinclair paint did not create a binary world where every payment to the government must be either a fee or a tax.the board regulations do not purport to impose a regulatory fee on polluters,but instead call for the auction of allowances,a different system entirely.san diego gas electric san diego county air pollution control dist.d,fees imposed on polluters upheld in part because a reasonable way to achieve proposition goal of tax relief is to shift the costs of controlling stationary sources of pollution from the public to the industries themselves.because the issue is different,sinclair paint does not control and we are not compelled to apply its test.cases are not authority for propositions not considered therein.siskiyou,supra,th at,fn.
morning star points to senate bill,a proposed budget act,which in part would have found the funds generated by the program are regulatory fees that conform with sinclair paint.bill reg.sess.as introduced,subd.c.but senate bill died and therefore is meaningless.see order of railway conductors swan.instead,the budget act of assem.bill.included language ensuring the money would be spent on projects to reduce greenhouse gases,and contains no reference to sinclair paint.see stats,ch.
in a related claim,calchamber points to a legislative counsel opinion purportedly concluding any auction system would have to pass muster under sinclair paint.although two legislative analyst reports in the record refer to such a legislative counsel opinion,the opinion is not in the record,and the legislative counsel supervising librarian has advised this court that no publicly available opinion on that subject has been issued.thus,although calchamber seeks support in that purported opinion,because its reasoning is unknown,it lacks any persuasive value.pacific gas electric zuckerman d,the value of expert opinion rests in the factors considered and the reasoning employed.
in short,we reject the claim that sinclair paint controls this case.
hallmarks of a tax 
having concluded the sinclair paint test does not apply,we must next consider what test does apply to ascertain whether a tax is being imposed.although the term tax has different meanings in different contexts,we find that,generally speaking,a tax has two hallmarks it is compulsory,and it does not grant any special benefit to the payor.
first,the word tax,in its common acceptation,denotes some compulsory exaction,which a government makes upon persons or property within its jurisdiction,for the supply of the public necessities.people naglee cal,italics added see sinclair paint,supra,cal th at most taxes are compulsory rather than a response to a voluntary decision to develop or to seek other government benefits or privileges.
such voluntariness concerns have arisen in development fee cases.one case involved a local scheme referred to as indirect source review isr intended to encourage developers to reduce indirect pollution,mobile source emissions,caused by new development projects.under isr,the developer can reduce emissions by incorporating features in the project,or by paying a fee to fund offsite projects that will reduce emissions,or by a combination of the two.building industry,supra,th at.a developer can accomplish the required emission reductions onsite by incorporating measures to reduce vehicle miles traveled,vehicle trips areawide sources of emissions such as fireplaces,wood stoves and landscape equipment.alternatively,the emissions can be reduced through paying a fee to fund offsite emission reducing projects.finally,the developer can use a combination of onsite emission reduction measures and a fee to fund offsite emission reduction projects.id.at,italics added.it has also been held that whereas taxes are compulsory in nature,development fees are imposed only if a developer elects to develop.california.industry governing bd.d,italics added.similarly,regulatory fees are not compulsory.rather,fee payers have some control both over when,and if,they pay any fee,when or if they elect to engage in a regulated activity,the amount of the fee they are compelled to pay.for example,fee payers can modify their conduct to pollute less or consume less water.building industry,supra,th at,italics added see scientists,supra,th at describing a prior regulatory fee case,where it was important that the payors had some control over the amount of the regulatory fee they were compelled to pay by the degree to which their respective activities impacted the environment.the more they polluted the air and consumed the water,the more they paid.
second,as witkin succinctly puts it,no compensation is given to the taxpayer except by way of governmental protection and other general benefits.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.taxation,italics added.taxation promises nothing to the person taxed beyond what may be anticipated from an administration of the laws for individual protection and the general public good.d state and local taxation,see cooley,supra,taxes,their nature kinds,fn.omitted in exchange for enforced contributions,the state is supposed to make adequate and full compensation,in the protection which it gives to his life,liberty and property,and in the increase to the value of his possessions,by the use to which the money contributed is applied arnold city of knoxville quoting cooley schulz dixon county similar.
our supreme court has similarly characterized the general nature of taxation ordinarily taxes are imposed for revenue purposes and not in return for a specific benefit conferred or privilege granted.farm bureau,supra,cal th at,quoting sinclair paint,supra,cal th at.
thus,in considering whether the auction system represents a tax of some sort,we first consider whether participation therein by covered entities is compulsory,and then consider whether and to what extent participants receive anything of particular value for their payment.
participation in the auction is voluntary 
plaintiffs and allied amici curiae posit the view that participation in the auction sales or secondary emissions allowances market is compulsory.we reject this view.
as intervener edf points out,regulated entities can comply with the rule without participating in the auction or reserve,including by reducing emissions,purchasing allowances from third parties,using banked allowances from prior years,and purchasing or earning emission offsets credits generated from voluntary emission reductions made outside the capped sectors.
as shown by materials in the board initial and unopposed request for judicial notice,entities buy allowances,either to speculate,or to retire them and reduce emissions.see new palgrave dict.of economics law the bids in the us auctions also revealed another kind of valuation.environmental groups submitted bids by winning the bidding they ensured that those licenses would not be utilized.nam concedes that some buy allowances to retire them.that fact cuts sharply against the view that the auction is compulsory,because,as edf notes,taxes do not attract volunteers.
it is not necessary to obtain extra allowances or offset credits unless an entity chooses to pollute beyond a certain level,something the government does not compel it to do.see building industry,supra,th at entities can modify their conduct to pollute less.indeed,the whole point of the act is to stop entities from polluting excessively.
morning star,echoed by other plaintiffs and allied amici curiae,argues that in order to stay in business in california it must obtain a sufficient number of emissions allowances from somewhere.because morning star does not receive all the required emissions allowances free of charge from the board,it must obtain them through other means,which it views as a necessary cost of staying in business in california.in morning star view,it is compelled to purchase allowances,shut down,or move out of state.morning star asserts it is impossible for it to operate without allowances given current technology,it would be more expensive to buy allowances on the secondary market,and therefore it is both false and ridiculous to deem allowance purchases to be voluntary.
in support of its petition,morning star submitted a declaration by an employee,which we have referred to as the rabo declaration in our request for supplemental briefing.taking its contents as true,which we shall do for purposes of this opinion it establishes as follows 
janet rabo is an economist employed by morning star,and her duties include analyzing data in connection with domestic tomato processing plants and farming operations as well as international economics affecting morning star businesses.a key responsibility is ensuring compliance with the act,including bidding at auctions to obtain allowances.morning star has three tomato processing plants in california that account for percent of california processed tomato production and percent of the nationwide ingredients for tomato paste and diced tomatoes.morning star uses natural gas to process tomatoes,but does not receive enough free allowances,and rabo knows of no means to reduce emissions.in her view,purchasing allowances on the open market will be far more expensive than purchasing them at auction from the board.in her ultimate view which is in reality a legal conclusion rather than a expert opinion it is both false and ridiculous to assert that participation in the auction is voluntary.
we agree that compliance with the program may increase the cost of doing business in california for covered entities such as morning star.but rabo does not explain why morning star can not absorb the increased cost of doing business or mitigate the increase in some other fashion.as the board pointed out at oral argument,a covered entity has a menu of options to achieve compliance,as we have referenced ante.rabo does not describe any potential mechanism to recoup costs nor why any efforts to recoup costs would fail or prove insufficient.although morning star may ultimately make the business decision that it must pay for allowances in order to maintain its operations in california,making the business decision to pay is not the same as being compelled to do so by the state 
the fact that some businesses may choose not to participate in the program and may instead choose to leave the state is a potential side effect which the act itself contemplates.see,subd.b.but the possibility of leakage lends no weight to the argument that the scheme amounts to a tax.a number of requirements for businesses,whether taxes,safety regulations,minimum wage statutes,or pollution control regulations,might cause a particular business to become unprofitable.this unfortunate reality does not translate into a compelled purchase of auction credits.
compliance instruments are demanded only as often as a party of his own accord,chooses to perform certain acts.people naglee,supra,cal.at.this is similar to the rationale supporting exaction of developer fees,which require a developer to dedicate land or pay impact fees for the privilege of new development,which exactions are not viewed as compulsory.see trent meredith,city of oxnard d,even though the developer can not legally develop without satisfying the condition precedent,he voluntarily decides whether to develop or not to develop kern county farm bureau county of kern th,russ.partnership city and county of san francisco d.
albeit not explicitly,plaintiffs seem to rely on the foundational premise that covered entities have some vested right to continue polluting california air without paying for the privilege to do so.therefore,in their view,compelling them to incur costs for engaging in business as usual is somehow compulsory.for example,morning star asserts that the only benefit successful bidders receive here is the requirement to pay for what they had been doing before for free.although this observation may well be accurate,morning star does not support its theory that bidders ever had the right to pollute for free.they did not.as edf points out,the board could instead have imposed a declining cap on morning star emissions under a system and ordered morning star to stop emitting ghgs beyond a certain amount however,under the auction system,morning star has more options.it can continue polluting the environment as much as it was before,except that now it must pay for the privilege of doing so.the right to continue polluting is a substantial benefit that morning star was previously allowed to pollute for free does not change that fact.contrary to suggestions by plaintiffs,implicit or otherwise,there is no vested right to pollute in california.see,communities for a better environment south coast air quality management dist.cal th,communities hardesty sacramento metropolitan air quality management dist.th.
as another court observed here it appears the oil companies are asking us to determine they have a fundamental vested right to release gasoline vapors while dispensing fuel to their customers.how are we to answer the public,on the other hand,who assert a fundamental vested right to breathe clean air if either exists,it must be the latter.we are not presented with the enforcement of a rule which effectively drives the oil companies out of business.at most it puts an economic burden on them increasing the cost of doing business.mobil oil superior court d,mobil oil,italics added see building industry,supra,th at.as we explain more fully in the next section,the right to pollute is a valuable privilege for which a cost may properly be imposed.
allowance credits are valuable commodities 
the purchase of an allowance,whether at auction or in the secondary market,conveys a valuable asset the privilege to pollute the air.this is unlike any tax we know.as edf contends,unlike taxes,which offer no discrete benefits to the payers,the auction and reserve provide participants valuable,tradable emission allowances as consideration for the purchase price.they may be used for current compliance,banked for future compliance,or sold,each of which returns value to the holder.because participants bids presumably reflect the value they ascribe to the allowances,the revenue generated by the auction and reserve will not exceed the aggregate value to purchasers of the allowances sold.
under the board regulatory definitions,property right means any type of right to specific property whether it is personal or real property,tangible or intangible.cal.code,tit,subd.a.a compliance instrument is an offset credit or emissions allowance,subd.a.a substantive regulation provides each compliance instrument issued by the executive officer represents a limited authorization to emit up to one metric ton in of any greenhouse gas specified in section,subject to all applicable limitations specified in this article.no provision of this article may be construed to limit the authority of the executive officer to terminate or limit such authorization to emit.a compliance instrument issued by the executive officer does not constitute property or a property right,at,subd.c,italics added.
although,when read in isolation,these regulations could be interpreted to mean that emissions allowances do not constitute property or a property right,when examined in context it becomes clear that this passage refers only to property rights as against the state,not rights as between private parties.a property right can mean different things in different contexts.for example,a winemaker received federal colas or certificates of label approval,which purported to allow the use of napa on wine labels where the wine was produced from grapes not grown in napa valley.a california statute prohibited the use of misleading geographic names on wine labels.see bronco wine jolly cal th,holding state labeling statute was not preempted by federal law.we upheld the state statute as against a claim that it effected a taking of a property right conferred by the federal colas.bronco wine jolly th,bronco wine.in doing so,we distinguished between property rights for purposes of a takings analysis and property rights for purposes of a procedural due process analysis,finding that the latter embraces a broader conception of property rights 
in determining whether permits or licenses are property,the courts consider whether the permit or license is transferable,the extent to which the government has the right to regulate the underlying activity,or to revoke,suspend,or modify the permit or license,and whether there has been a legislative or regulatory expression that issuance of the permit does not create a property right.citation.
considering these hallmarks of property,the courts generally have found that licenses and permits do not constitute property rights for purposes of the takings clause.citations.however,where a license bears the hallmarks of property,it has been held to be a protectable property right.citation.
contrary to the assumption in a prior case,the due process and takings clause concepts of property are not coterminous.the due process clause recognizes a wider range of interests in property.citations.bronco wine,supra,th at,italics added.
this distinction between property rights for purposes of a takings analysis that is,property rights as between the government and an individual and property rights as between private individuals,has been articulated in cases analogous to this one 
we have previously held that in california,the right to pollute the air can be bought and sold.air quality management districts have created a valuable commodity,the emission reduction credit erc.the erc is evidenced by transferable certificates approved,banked,and issued by the districts.simply put,a polluter who pollutes less can sell the erc to allow the purchaser to pollute more.jopson feather river air quality management dist.th,jopson,italics added.the regulatory system in jopson follows the model adopted by the board,rather than a model,and in that model,transferability of allowances conveyed value.
similarly,by statute federal clean air act allowances analogous to ghg allowances under the board regulations are said to confer no property rights an allowance allocated under this title is a limited authorization to emit sulfur dioxide in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter.such allowance does not constitute a property right.f,italics added.however,despite this language,very similar to the regulation governing allowances under the act cal.code,tit,subd.c a compliance instrument does not constitute property or a property right,the transferability of such allowances made them valuable as between private parties.see ormet ohio power cir,the transferability of allowances having durable economic value is expected to create incentives for aggressive and innovative efforts to control pollution see also cabo distributing,brady.supp,holder of colas entitled to procedural due process protections elk hills power,llc board of equalization cal th,fn.even if by statute ercs are not property,an assessor may properly consider their presence when valuing a power plant there,the statute gave erc holders exclusive right to use them ferguson ferguson alaska,although regulations provided fishing quota allocations do not convey property rights they were an asset subject to marital property division,because the holder could transfer them gehing streck,emissions trading,envt,between the contracting parties,it seems that all normal property rights are available.utilities and all other allowance holders can exclude all others,besides the government,from interfering with their possession,use,and disposition of allowances italics added.
thus,the regulations declaring that the allowances confer no property rights preclude an allowance holder from asserting a takings claim against the state,but the free alienability of the allowances means they are of value to the holder.indeed,that is the whole point of the trade part of the system,the free alienability of the allowances as between private parties.see jopson,supra,th at.that makes them property for due process purposes,because t he right to exclude others,and to sell,assign or otherwise transfer ownership are traditional hallmarks of property.bronco wine,supra,th at conti united states,where holder could not transfer fishing permit,no property interest found.it is difficult to see why any entity would be willing to trade in allowances in the first instance,if the allowances did not constitute property of any kind.
as discussed by the parties in their supplemental briefing,this point was addressed during the rulemaking process.the board initial statement of reasons states in part that property rights can not attach to the compliance instruments because,in the event of federal preemption in the market or other conditions,california must have the ability to revoke the compliance instruments without creating a loss to the people of california.italics added.the board final statement of reasons confirmed the need for the ability to revoke compliance instruments to protect the state.
but as just explained,this does not mean compliance instruments,including emissions allowances,lack value to the holders.as the trial court found,emissions allowances consist of valuable,tradable,private property rights.
the auction scheme does not create a tax subject to proposition 
as we have described,no covered entity is forced to buy emissions allowances,and such allowances are things of value to the owner.these two aspects of the auction system are alien to any reasonable conception of a tax,as that term has been used at common law and through sinclair paint and beyond.as we have explained,the twin hallmarks of a tax are that it is compulsory,and that it conveys nothing of particular value to the payor.the auction system meets neither of these conditions,and therefore it is not a tax.
the parties offer hypotheticals which we find unpersuasive.many californians are compelled to pay income taxes,but despite this compulsion receive no particular thing of value.similarly,a person may choose to buy a pencil,knowing sales tax will be added to the price,but the buyer receives nothing of particular value for the tax.neither of these scenarios is akin to buying an emissions allowance,whereby a party chooses to purchase a valuable right to pollute.cooley,supra,taxes,their nature kinds,pp,witkin,supra,p.
morning star argues the payments are not voluntary because they merely allow it to do what it is already doing.that argument might have relevance if morning star had a vested legal right to continue polluting.as we have discussed ante,it does not.see communities,supra,cal th at the boiler permits give conocophillips no vested right to pollute the air at any particular level mobil oil,supra,d at.thus,it is not accurate to liken the auction system to payment for the privilege to stay in business in california.it is a payment for the privilege to pollute the air in california.
some plaintiffs posit that if we find the auction regulations are not a tax,the legislature could construct similar ways to extract money from californians and evade proposition and perhaps other initiatives.for example,they hypothesize the state could create a program for vehicle mileage each registered vehicle would be given a periodic allowance,and would have to obtain additional allowances to exceed the base allotment.this would reduce road decay and reduce ghg emissions.nam,echoed by calchamber,states no one would doubt that such a scheme would impose a tax on driving.putting aside proposition,which is not implicated by this case,we do doubt it.after all,the state could instead enact a rationing system for drivers,but the hypothetical provides a bypass for those drivers who choose to exceed their base allotment.such a scheme would not be a mileage tax,as plaintiffs suggest instead,the market would set the price,and drivers could choose how to exercise and modify their driving behavior.in any event,we can confront such hypothetical situations if and when they arise we do not offer any advisory opinions at present.
in short,because the board regulations do not compel anybody to buy emissions allowances,and confer on voluntary buyers a valuable commodity,they do not create a tax as that term is generally understood.the auction sales program does not violate proposition.
use of the auction revenue 
plaintiffs and allied amici curiae contend that under various statutes the by an unelected,state board is being used to support diverse programs that would otherwise be paid for from general fund sources.their point is the legislature has effectively adopted a cash cow sired by the board and is milking it for a purportedly endless number of programs that have at best a tenuous connection to the discharge of ghgs by covered entities.at oral argument this was referred to pejoratively as a slush fund.
we conclude this issue is not ripe,but we address it briefly to explain why it is important to decouple the issues of generation of revenue from the expenditure thereof,when evaluating whether a payment to the government equates to a tax.
in the trial court,morning star argued without contradiction that a bill requires a set aside of of auction revenues to projects benefitting disadvantaged communities,and at least of that fund must go toward projects actually located in such communities.although it may be a good thing to benefit disadvantaged communities there is little if any relationship that has been established between reducing greenhouse gas emissions and benefitting disadvantaged communities.plaintiffs also reference certain legislation allocating revenues to a wide variety of programs.we granted morning star request for judicial notice of these bills,ante.
we have reviewed the three petitions in this case,and none seeks to invalidate any of the legislature decisions about how to spend the auction proceeds instead,their joint object is to invalidate the auction sales,although some parts of some petitions mention some uses of auction proceeds.but the legality of any particular expenditure was not attacked in the trial court,and no plaintiff seeks to abrogate any specific expenditure in their briefing or supplemental briefing.
if the legislature appropriated auction proceeds in a manner violating the current statute governing such revenues code,no doubt a suit could be filed to restrain such misuse of revenue by analogy to the special fund cases.see city of azusa cohen th,veterans of foreign wars state of california d,veterans see also edgemont community service dist.city of moreno valley th.but the mere possibility that the legislature may err at times in making an expenditure of allotted revenue does not speak to the legality of the collection of that revenue.although,broadly speaking,the analysis of how a collected amount is spent may be relevant to the fee versus tax determination applied in sinclair paint,which we have discussed ante,it does not inform our analysis here.for reasons we have explained,we are not presented with a program triggering the sinclair paint analysis 
to the extent the proceeds expenditure may seem inappropriate to some,those who seek to challenge it may do so.as demonstrated by the special fund cases,californians have shown little hesitation in challenging alleged improper diversions by the legislature.and the remedy in such cases is generally restoration of the money to its proper purpose,and preclusion of future unlawful diversions,not return of money to the payors.see,veterans,supra,d at shaw,supra,th at invalidating legislative transfers of certain funds.therefore,we do not see how any hypothetical misappropriation of funds here would either nullify the program or transform the auction revenues into a tax.
more broadly,whether any program will advance the act goals is a legislative question in the first instance.see collier city and county of san francisco th,scientists,supra,th at.courts presume legislation is valid and legislative findings are supported by evidence,in deference to the separation of powers of state government see cal,art.iii,and a challenger can not simply go to court with contrary facts and launch a battle of experts to try to show the legislature made a poor decision about how well a given program effectuates legislative purposes.see schabarum california legislature th,attack on budget expenditure does not permit of legislative fact finding but neither does the judiciary rubber stamp acts the invalidity of which plainly appear.a legal avenue may be open to challenging a specific use of auction proceeds on the ground the expenditure is insufficiently related to the statutory purpose,but this case does not make such a challenge.thus we have no occasion to prescribe the legal standards such an action must meet to succeed.it is enough to say that the possibility that an erroneous diversion might occur does not bolster the claim that the auction system creates an unlawful tax.
disposition 
the judgments are affirmed.in each case appellants shall pay the appellate costs of respondents.see cal.rules of court,rule.
i concur in part i of the opinion as to part ii,i dissent.
the majority concludes the auction program is not a tax because the purchase of auction credits by businesses is voluntary,the purchasing entities receive a thing of value in the nature of a commodity by their purchase,that is,the right to pollute the air and we need not be concerned in this appeal about the use of the auction proceeds.
on this record,the purchase of auction credits by morning star or other businesses similarly situated is not voluntary,the auction credits do not confer property rights in the nature of a commodity or otherwise to morning star or businesses who are similarly situated,and the use of the auction proceeds,a hallmark,if not the gold standard,for determining if a state exaction is a tax must be considered.
i conclude that the auction program is a tax,therefore,i dissent.
preliminarily,the majority begins its analysis by circumscribing for our purposes our supreme court holding in sinclair paint state bd.of equalization cal th sinclair paint insofar as that holding relates to the case we are now considering.i agree that sinclair paint is of limited use but not of no use in deciding the issue before us.sinclair paint decided that the state exaction there at issue was a regulatory fee and not a tax,whereas all parties to these appeals seem to agree that the auction program is not a regulatory fee.appellants contend that the auction program is not a regulatory fee and,if it is not a fee,it must therefore be a tax.respondents,when questioned on that point during oral argument,took the position that the auction proceeds are not a fee but are something else.and indeed,the respondents can not take any other position on this point because sinclair paint describes a regulatory fee as one that was made in connection with regulatory activities which fees do not exceed the reasonable cost of providing services necessary to the activity for which the fee is charged and not levied for unrelated revenue purposes.id.at citing pennell city of san jose cal d.respondents can not possibly fit the auction program within sinclair paint formulation of a regulatory fee.
thus,the issue before the court is whether this something else is in fact a tax.
voluntariness 
turning then to the question of the voluntariness of participating in the auction program,the only evidence in the trial court and the only evidence in this record on the question of voluntariness is the declaration of janet rabo,an economist with appellant,morning star packing company.rabo declared,in pertinent part,as follows 
i am an economist with the morning star packing company morning star,and i am authorized to sign this declaration on its behalf my job duties include economic and statistical analysis for morning star business enterprises,including analysis of data in connection with domestic tomato processing plants and farming operations,as well international economics affecting morning star businesses.one of my key responsibilities is to ensure that morning star is in compliance with all aspects of ab,and its implementing regulations,including the cap and trade regulation governing emissions of greenhouse gases.this includes registering morning star as a covered entity,participating in auctions,estimating morning star compliance obligations for each compliance period,bidding on and purchasing emissions allowances at auctions to meet the compliance obligations,and keeping abreast of ab regulatory developments.as the person who bids for greenhouse gas emissions allowances for morning star,i believe i am uniquely qualified to describe morning star goals in participating in the auctions,and methodologies for achieving those goals.
morning star is headquartered at main street in woodland,california.
morning star was founded in by chris rufer,as a one truck delivering tomatoes to canneries.
currently,morning star has three tomato processing plants in the san joaquin and sacramento valleys that account for over of the california processing tomato of the ingredient for tomato paste and diced tomato revenues of approximately million.
each of morning star three tomato processing plants produce carbon emissions through the use of natural gas for tomato processing and canning.
beginning in,morning star has been regulated as a covered entity under california cap and trade regulation.under the current cap and trade regulation,morning star,as a covered entity,is required to purchase and surrender california carbon allowances equal to the amount of carbon emitted as calculated by the regulation.
morning star will receive some allowances based on a benchmark set by emissions.but these allowances will not be enough to cover all of the emissions at morning star plants.
morning star is required by the cap and trade regulation to surrender emissions allowances equal to our emissions in future years.if we fail to be in possession of the required amount of allowances at the time they are due,we are subject to costly penalties.
we do not know what our emissions will be in any future year.we can estimate our emissions based on previous years,but there will be variations due to weather,yields,pests,disease,and other uncontrollable obstacles agricultural industries face.for example,in,the tomato crop was hit by a very damaging pest carrying a disease that wiped out thousands of acres of planted and growing tomatoes.as a result,planters had to replant their crops,and tomatoes that were expected to be ready for harvest in july will not be ready until october.that means that morning star will have to keep its tomato processing plants running longer than planned,thereby burning more natural gas and emitting more this year than would be estimated based on past years.
in an effort to mitigate our risk and control costs associated with compliance with the cap and trade regulation,morning star found it necessary and essential to participate in the first two auctions held by carb.to be in compliance with the cap and trade regulation,morning star estimated that it needs to purchase more than allowances for.this number is likely to be greater based on the lengthening of the harvest season,as set forth in paragraph.
carb has structured the allowance market so that allowances will be more expensive in future years.there will be an increase in demand because more facilities will become covered entities,and the emissions cap will diminish over time,which will ultimately have the effect of supply of allowances made available for auction,as we get closer to the final compliance date of.
this is reflected in the settlement price of the three auctions held to date.the first auction held in,had a price floor of,and a settlement price of the auctions held in,have a floor price of,thereby automatically making allowances purchased in those auctions more expensive than those purchased in the first auction in.the second auction settled at,while the third auction settled at.due to this mechanism by which prices increase with each succeeding auction,it is economically imperative to purchase allowances early in the program.
there are no technologies of which morning star is aware that would reduce our emissions of,and prevent us from having to purchase emissions allowances.further,it is infeasible for our food processing plants to run under the ton per year threshold of the cap and trade regulation.we would just have to shut down all of the california plants.morning star has absolutely no choice but to participate in the auctions if it wants to stay in business in california.
purchasing emissions allowances on the open market from others,rather than purchasing them at auction,would make no economic sense because such purchases would be far more expensive than obtaining them directly from carb at the auctions.that is how the auction market is rigged in carb favor.were it not so,financial firms would not even consider participating in the auctions.financial firms participate because they believe they will be able to buy low at auction and sell high in subsequent trades.covered entities,on the other hand,do not have that luxury because they must use the allowances for purposes of complying with the cap and trade regulation,and must surrender the allowances to carb at the end of each compliance period.
the notion that,as a covered entity,morning star participation in the carb auctions is somehow voluntary is both false and ridiculous.
morning star has no way of determining the total expenditures that may be required by all covered entities in california to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions sufficient to comply with the goals of the cap and trade regulation.
morning star has no way of determining the total expenditures that may be required by all covered entities in california to deal with the issues raised by global warming.
rabo declaration was admitted into evidence in the trial court without objection.there was no evidence admitted in the trial court contradicting her declaration.thus,there was no evidence contradicting rabo declaration that morning star participation in the auction program was voluntary only in the sense that morning star could voluntarily cease doing business in california if morning star did not participate.
while the trial court did not expressly accept or reject rabo evidence that morning star could not continue to do business in california without purchasing the state credits,the court did note that 
contrary to what arb argues,the charges have some traditional attributes of a tax.first,the charges are not entirely voluntary.it is important to remember that the allowances have value to covered entities only because the government has forbidden covered entities from emitting ghg without an allowance noting that v irtually every tax is in some sense voluntary in that one can avoid the tax by choosing not to engage in the taxed activity.taken to its logical extreme,even income,sales,and property taxes would not be compulsory because they must be paid only if one voluntarily earns income,purchases goods,or owns property.yet no one would dispute these are taxes.the covered entity either must reduce its ghg emissions to zero which,generally speaking,is impractical or impossible or acquire allowances.thus,from the perspective of a covered entity,the purchase of allowances is little different from an emissions tax.in the case of an emissions tax,covered entities obtain the right to emit ghgs by paying the tax in the case of the auction,they obtain this right by purchasing all allowances.emphasis added.
the trial court at least impliedly accepted rabo declaration to the effect that morning star could not continue to do business in california without participating in the auctions and purchasing the necessary credits.
and,while it is true that the trial court did not by the italicized language above find that a covered entity had to acquire allowances from the state,i note that the state,beginning in,reserved to itself percent of the current year allowances remaining after free allocation and set aside for reserves cal.code,tit,subd.c which reservation will increase to approximately percent by.opn.at.
since the majority recognizes that the word tax,in its common acceptation,denotes some compulsory exaction,which a government makes upon persons or property within its jurisdiction,for the supply of the public necessities.the people naglee cal,italics added naglee see sinclair paint,supra,cal th at most taxes are compulsory rather than a response to a voluntary decision to develop or to seek other government benefits or privileges opn.at rabo declaration presents the majority with a problem,that is,it is the only evidence in the record on the issue of the voluntariness of the purchase of credits,voluntary purchases being one of the three major underpinnings of the majority analysis.
confronted with that problem,in concluding that the state auction program is voluntary,the majority seems to decide that,notwithstanding rabo uncontradicted declaration,morning star could stay in business by acquiring outside of the auction program the number of credits morning star needed to continue to operate its business.there is no evidence to support that conclusion.
further,the majority characterizes rabo declaration as demonstrating only that participation in the auction program results in nothing more than an increase in costs to do business saying that the fact the auction system may result in costs does not make the auction system a tax.opn.at,fn.
rabo does not explain why morning star can not absorb the increased cost of doing business or mitigate the increase in some other fashion.as the board pointed out at oral argument,a covered entity has a menu of options to achieve compliance,as we have referenced ante.rabo does not describe any potential mechanism to recoup costs nor why any efforts to recoup costs would fail or prove insufficient.although morning star may ultimately make the business decision that it must pay for allowances in order to maintain its operations in california,making the business decision to pay is not the same as being compelled to do so by the state.opn.at,fn.omitted italics omitted.
the majority then goes on to take the rabo declaration to task by stating that the rabo declaration in large part hinged on the claimed lack of awareness of feasible alternative technologies,but does not set forth what steps morning star took to educate itself.nor did morning star include declarations from engineers or scientists that support its economist view that no feasible alternatives to emissions control methods exist.opn.at,fn.
the majority finally dismisses rabo declaration by speculating,at respondent invitation,that morning star had a menu of options that it could have turned to that would have allowed it to comply with the law without participating in the auctions and stay in business at the same time.but there is no evidence in the record that such is a fact.at its essence,the majority is saying that it simply disbelieves rabo when she declares that morning star could not continue to do business in california without participating in the auctions,a credibility finding not often made in the first instance in my experience by a court of review,especially given the fact that the trial court apparently credited her declaration.in support of its statement of disbelief,the majority cites two cases for the proposition that,unless done arbitrarily,a trier of fact may reject the testimony of a witness even though that testimony is uncontradicted.see opn.at,fn.we are not a trier of fact.
while it may be true that some participate in the auctions voluntarily as investors or those who would seek to credits,on this record,morning star participation is not voluntary except in the sense,as noted by the trial court,that california income taxes are voluntary because one need not earn income or live in california as are property taxes as one need not own property.
the majority also says that,even though under the law,a business may be required to absorb an increase in costs,those costs can not be considered a tax even if the increased costs require it to go out of business in california,that is,results in leakage,which the act anticipated.opn.at.
but in all of this the majority misses the point.this is an increase in costs that businesses such as morning star must bear if they wish to continue to do business in california an increase in costs that is,in that sense,compulsory.it is no different than saying that an increase in income taxes is nothing more than an increase in costs that a private business or citizen must bear even though it may require it or him or her to leave california or an increase in property taxes are merely an increase in costs even though it may require the property owner to give up its property in california.the point is,the increase in costs is compulsory and not voluntary unless one opts to voluntarily close their business in the state of california.
i can not agree that,on this record,morning star participation in the auctions is voluntary as that word is used in the context of determining whether a state exaction is a tax.
finally,i must take exception to the majority observation that albeit not explicitly,plaintiffs seem to rely on the foundational premise that covered entities have some vested right to continue polluting california air without paying for the privilege to do so.opn.at.that is not what the plaintiffs are saying at all.
we must keep in mind this is not a challenge to the cap and trade program overall which requires covered entities to purchase credits if they can not operate within the guidelines.plaintiffs accept that.what they are challenging is the lawfulness of the legislature and the arb reservation to itself of sufficient credits to require purchase of credits from the state as opposed to purchasing such credits on the free market which revenue is used by the state as if it were general fund money,without calling that revenue generation a tax.
auction credits as commodities 
working from the premise that the payment of taxes does not ordinarily convey a property right,the majority decides that the auction credits convey a property right in the nature of a commodity.the majority sees the state is selling a right to pollute.this is a curious construction to say the least.while,without question,the state,in exercising its police powers,has the ability to legislate in an effort to achieve healthy air quality,it does not mean,conversely,that the state thereby also owns rights to pollute which it can sell to others.in any event,i do not find that construct persuasive.
the majority finds the auction proceeds convey a property right notwithstanding the provisions of california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision c which reads 
each compliance instrument issued by the executive officer represents a limited authorization to emit up to one metric ton in of any greenhouse gas specified in section,subject to all applicable limitations specified in this article.no provision of this article may be construed to limit the authority of the executive officer to terminate or limit such authorization to emit.a compliance instrument issued by the executive officer does not constitute property or a property right.italics added.
if i read the majority opinion correctly,it avoids what would otherwise be the plain language of this regulation by finding that it speaks only to property rights as against the state while the auction credits retain private property rights between private parties.opn.at.accepting at face value that this may be so,the analysis does not recognize that this litigation is not between private parties,but between the plaintiffs and the state.the question is whether the state exaction of money through the auction program from a business that must participate in that auction in order to stay in business is a tax.the question can not be avoided by finding the auction credits are valuable assets in the nature of commodities as between private parties buying and selling them as investments.
in my view,in light of the plain language of section,subdivision c which describes an authorization to emit as limited,as something that can be terminated or limited at the sole discretion of the state and as something that,by regulation does not convey a property right,the conclusion can not be avoided that where,as here,entities such as morning star are required to purchase auction credits to stay in business,what they purchase is no more a thing of value than is the payment of property taxes to keep ownership of one home.whatever else these authorizations are,as to morning star and others similarly situated,their value as a property right is ephemeral and the auction program can not be said to convey a property right in the nature of a commodity or otherwise when emission authorizations can be limited or terminated by the state at any time.
the majority effort to distinguish the auction programs from a tax by finding that the program conveys property rights in the form of a commodity to morning star is not analytically sound.
i note that in support of their analysis,the majority relies in part on jopson feather river air quality management dist.th jopson.but in jopson,an opinion in which i joined,the court simply stated that emission reduction credits issued by air quality management districts were a valuable commodity that could be sold between private parties.jopson does not advance the majority opinion here because,first,the court description of emission credits as a valuable commodity in jopson was simply background used to explain the litigation there at hand and,second,the court observation was made without analysis or citation to any authority.jopson certainly did not decide,or even discuss,whether limited authorizations to emit,authorizations that can be limited or terminated at any time,sold by the state to private businesses to be used by those businesses solely to stay in business in this state can or can not be deemed a valuable commodity.
finally,as to jopson,the framework of the opinion assumed the purchase and sale of such credits would be among private parties,a different situation than we have here.
for plaintiffs,it can not accurately be said that what morning star and others in their situation buy at the auctions are commodities carrying property rights.the auctions are instead a revenue vehicle for the state,a vehicle by which businesses are compelled to pay the state and obtain,in return only the ability to remain in business in california a state exaction that has all the components of a traditional tax.
use of the auction proceeds 
the majority finds that the use of the revenue generated by the state auctions is a matter not ripe for adjudication because it is appropriate to decouple the issues of revenue generation and revenue expenditures.opn.at.but an attempt to avoid factoring in the use of auction revenue on the question of whether or not the auction revenues arise from a tax does not stand up to careful scrutiny.
the cases recognize that tax has no fixed meaning,and that the distinction between taxes and fees is frequently blurred,taking on different meanings in different contexts.russ.partnership city and county of san francisco d,terminal plaza city and county of san francisco d,mills county of trinity d,county of fresno malmstrom d.in general,taxes are imposed for revenue purposes,rather than in return for a specific benefit conferred or privilege granted.shapell industries,governing board th,county of fresno malmstrom,supra,d at taxes are raised for the general revenue of the governmental entity to pay for a variety of public services.sinclair paint,supra,cal th at.
as noted in the quote above,in general taxes are imposed for revenue purposes,that is for the general revenue of the governmental entity to pay for a variety of public services quoting county of fresno malmstrom,supra,d at page.
the majority reasons that,because none of the petitions before us seeks to invalidate known uses of the funds,we can ignore the hardly disputable fact that revenue from the auctions does in fact pay for a broad variety of public services.opn.at.the majority position regarding the relevance of the expansive use of the auction proceeds conveniently avoids having to deal with the broad range of uses reflected in this record which uses,by the authorities quoted above,suggest a particular government exaction is a tax.once again,i think the majority misses the mark.
the use of the revenue from government exactions is a hallmark,probably the most important one,in determining whether that exaction is a tax.although not alone determinative,the use of the money must be factored into the analytical equation.if the state treats the revenue as general revenue to be used to pay for public services,that strongly suggests the exaction is a tax.
i would note this court decision in morning star board of equalization th morning star wherein,being asked whether a state exaction imposed as part of a comprehensive state overhaul concerning hazardous wastes was a tax or a regulatory fee,we determined that it was a tax relying largely on the use of the revenue.thus,the exaction is not regulatory because it does not seek to regulate the company use,generation or storage of hazardous material but to raise money for the control of hazardous material generally.the charge is therefore a tax.at its most basic level the charge is not a regulatory fee because it is not regulatory.it is monetary.id.at.
while i recognize that morning star was a tax versus regulatory fee case,its recognition that the use of the funds plays a singular role in the definition of a tax was,and still is,accurate.
the majority analysis on this point is,roughly,that none of the plaintiffs challenged the use of the funds as those uses are reflected in this record,therefore we need not consider those uses.but,accepting the majority premise that the plaintiffs could have challenged those uses,does their failure to do so mean that we can ignore those uses for judging whether or not the program exacts a tax i think not the majority answer does not meet the challenge because there is nothing in the law that says that plaintiffs must have raised such challenges before we are required to consider the use of the money in deciding the question before us.there is a disconnect in the majority analysis.and i note that while perhaps such individual challenges to expenditures could have been made each time the money was spent,it would make no practical or legal sense to piecemeal the litigation as opposed to challenging the entire program as a tax.

to the obvious broad use of the auction revenues,and in order to avoid having to consider the effect of the use of the proceeds on the question before us,respondents argue that the uses of the proceeds are merely advancing the intent of the program,that is,to reduce greenhouse gases and are,therefore,used more narrowly than general revenue funds.
asked during oral argument what the expenditures on affordable housing had to do with emissions,respondents said the affordable housing was to be built near places of employment and transportation hubs to encourage public transportation and reduce greenhouse gas emissions accordingly.following that line of argument would probably allow the proceeds to be spent on education on the theory that a better educated populace on the question of greenhouse gas emissions would be more likely to seek to reduce those emissions in the future.
respondents argument conflates funding of the costs of administering the auction program with funding of the goals of.
and here is the magic,the sleight of hand,of respondents argument.since an argument can be,and has been,made that nearly all human activity and,apparently,some animal activity increases greenhouse gases,voila,auction funds can be used to address nearly any human activity without being considered a tax that generates general revenue,thus avoiding the prohibitions of proposition,so long as the use of the funds has any tenuous connection to the reduction of greenhouse gases,connections that can always be found if one reaches far enough.
howard jarvis taxpayers county of orange th howard jarvis is instructive.there,the city of huntington beach amended its city charter effective july to mandate the city participation in a retirement system,gave the city council discretion to establish reasonable compensation and fringe benefits as appropriate and established an excise tax on real property to fund the retirement program.
after that,and after the passage of proposition,the city added to those city retirement benefits and collected increased excises tax to fund those additional benefits.a taxpayer brought suit contending the excise tax,to the extent it funded additional retirement benefits granted after july,violated proposition.
the city argued there was no violation because the city charter language gave the city a right to levy the excess tax for virtually anything so long as the costs the excess tax funded related to city employee retirement benefits including giv ing a house to every employee as they retire howard jarvis,supra,th at.
the court disagreed and observed that the city argument would eviscerate proposition adding under city interpretation,it would have virtually unfettered power to spend whatever sum of money and levy excess taxes to obtain the revenue,as long as the expenditure was designated retirement.this was one of the very things proposition was enacted to combat.howard jarvis,supra,th at.
so too here.the state argument gives it virtually unfettered power to spend whatever money the auction program raises so long as the purpose of the money is to a theoretical reduction of greenhouse gases.
despite the practically unlimited use of the auction program revenues for state projects,the state seeks to the provisions of proposition by labeling the wide and varied uses of that revenue as uses that address not necessarily reduce,however tangentially,greenhouse gas emissions.the majority decoupling of the question of the use of the revenues generated by the auction program is,to say the least,unconvincing.
the auction program as a tax 
it needs to be noted that the auction program revenues are not necessary to the funding of the program in general or the auction program in particular.
health and safety code section says 
the air resources board may adopt by regulation,after a public workshop,a schedule of fees to be paid by the sources of greenhouse gas emissions regulated pursuant to this division,consistent with section.the revenues collected pursuant to this section,shall be deposited into the air pollution control fund and are available upon appropriation,by the legislature,for purposes of carrying out this division.
pursuant to the statutory authority granted by section,the air resources board adopted section cal.code of,tit,which provides 
the purpose of this subarticle is to collect fees to be used to carry out the california global warming solutions act of stats.ch.health and safety code sections et,as provided in health and safety code section.
the air resources board also adopted section which further provides 
a total required revenue trr.
the required revenue rr shall be the total amount of funds necessary to recover the costs of implementation of ab program expenditures for each fiscal year,based on the number of personnel positions,including salaries and benefits and all other costs,as approved in the california budget act for that fiscal year.
the rr shall also include any amount required to be expended by arb in defense of this subarticle in court.
if there is any excess or shortfall in the actual revenue collected for any fiscal year,such excess or shortfall shall be carried over to the next year calculation of the total revenue requirement.if arb does not expend or encumber the full amount authorized by the california legislature for any fiscal year,the amount not expended or encumbered in that fiscal year shall be carried over and deducted from the next year calculation of the total revenue required.
the annual total revenue requirement is equal to the annual rr adjusted for the previous fiscal year excess or shortfall amount,as provided in subsection a.cal.code of,tit.
it would thus appear that auction proceeds are not intended,or,more importantly needed,to pay for the costs of implementation of assembly bill.
the only reasonable conclusion one can reach is that the auction proceeds are intended to,and do,generate general revenue to the state of california.it is apparent that by respondent express acknowledgement,this revenue may be used for any program that,arguably,might reduce greenhouse gases.but,as noted above,the effort to reduce greenhouse gases essentially encompasses all aspects of human activity and thus the use of the auction revenues by the state is virtually unlimited.thus,the purchase of auction credits which,on this record,are imposed on morning star and businesses similarly situated,creates revenue to pay for a nearly unlimited variety of public services.see,county of fresno malmstrom,supra,d at taxes are raised for the general revenue to pay for a variety of public service.this is a tax increase on businesses knowingly structured to avoid the provisions of proposition.
accepting the argument that there is social value to the program,questions of the social value of any given law are the province of the legislature and the governor.it is the province of the courts to decide questions of law and the constitutionality of the laws and to do so based solely on the law regardless of the social value of the challenged legislation.
my colleagues and i have worked diligently on what is obviously a complex and difficult appeal.they,in good faith,have reached a conclusion different than mine.i simply can not agree with their analysis or their result.
given that the auction program is,for morning star and businesses that are similarly situated,compulsory if they are to remain in business in california and that the auction program creates,in actual effect,general revenue,i can only conclude that the program is a tax in something else clothing and that the auction program,not having been passed by a vote in the legislature,violates proposition.
i would reverse the judgment.
further undesignated statutory references are to the health and safety code.
although regulations state that the allowances confer no property rights cal.code,tit,subd.a,subd.c,the trial court correctly found they are valuable commodities,a point we explain below see part,post.

intervener national association of manufacturers nam correctly points out that a board regulation can not restrain the legislature,nor can one legislature bind the hands of a future one see in re collie cal d,therefore another legislature might attempt to change current limits on the use of auction proceeds.

we have received substantial amicus curiae briefing as follows the california taxpayers association caltax the california manufacturers and technology association cmta and the national federation of independent business small business legal center,independent drivers association,and associated california loggers nfib,on behalf of plaintiffs and dallas burtraw and other economics and public policy scholars,assisted by students from the uc berkeley school of law environmental law practice project burtraw and the nature conservancy,assisted,inter alia,by students from the ucla frank wells environmental law clinic,on behalf of the board and edf.in response to a supplemental briefing order,we received an amicus brief by the international emissions trading association ieta,in part representing offset credit developers and major power producers including pacific gas electric,the sacramento municipal utility district,and southern california edison ieta brief supports the board regulations as against the proposition challenge.
the fact the legislative analyst opined that an allowance auction was not necessary to meet the act goal is not dispositive.it is the board opinion that counts,and even if an auction were not strictly necessary,the board could find it was more effective and therefore reasonably necessary,a finding well within its legal purview.
the board followed eight other commands in crafting regulations,including to minimize leakage,subd.b,which is a reduction of emissions offset by an increase outside the state,subd.j.leakage includes businesses choosing to leave california rather than comply with the regulations.the regulations classify industrial sectors by risk of leakage,and adjust the amount of free allowances accordingly.see cal.code,tit.
although we have granted calchamber unopposed request for judicial notice,tendering dictionary definitions of distribution,we find no serious ambiguity in the term as used herein.miller brewing department of alcoholic beverage control d,finding ambiguity in distribution as used in the context of liquor marketing,and giving it the broadest meaning california.public utilities com.cal d,similar holding.we need not address whether distribution of allowances has a technical meaning as discussed in the briefs.
the board was concerned windfalls could pass to entities contrary to the public good,as had happened during the first phase of the european union emissions trading scheme.researchers emphasize that windfalls occurred because facilities were awarded free allowances and yet still passed opportunity costs through to consumers.amici curiae burtraw and the nature conservancy emphasize and elaborate on these economic fairness concerns.
it is true,as calchamber points out,that the epa guide also states existing programs allocated free allowances.that does not change the fact that the legislature knew a choice would have to be made about whether or not to auction allowances,if the board decided to adopt a program.
nam and calchamber argue such a broad delegation if intended would be unlawful,but fail to provide coherent analysis or separately head the point,which therefore is forfeited.see in re th.moreover,there was no abdication of legislative power,because the act sets the boundaries of the board discretion,and the policy goals.see hess collection winery agricultural labor relations bd.th.we note that taxes must be levied by the legislative,not executive,branch.see hilliard,law of taxation,cooley,law of taxation ed.nature of the power to tax,cooley.nor can the legislature delegate the power to tax to an administrative board,although a board can value property and collect taxes.see d state and local taxation.here,because we find no tax see part ii,post,we need not consider whether,if the revenue generated by the auction sales were a tax,it could have been created by the board and then ratified by the legislature.see part,post.
we have acknowledged that floor statements provide cognizable legislative history of a bill.kaufman broad communities,performance plastering,th,kaufman.
the legislative analyst opinion,in part,was that a program differs from a carbon tax in that the cost of emitting each ton of is not decided by the regulator.rather,the cost is determined,in effect,by the emissions sources themselves through trading of emissions allowances.
in addition to the proposed signing statement,the enrolled bill report also includes three different draft veto messages.their inclusion shows that not all documents found in such reports are relevant or persuasive indications of legislative intent.see jones,supra,cal th at kaufman,supra,th at.
according to a legislative analyst report in the record,traditionally,california has relied upon direct regulatory measures to achieve emissions reductions and meet other environmental goals.such regulations,commonly referred to as measures,typically require specific actions on the part of emissions sources to achieve the desired emissions reductions or other goals.in contrast,mechanisms provide economic incentives to achieve emissions reductions,without specifying how emissions sources are to achieve those reductions.either way,the legislature could have specified how the proceeds would be used if the board adopted a program.but it could also conclude such a specification might tilt the scale in favor of such a program,rather than ensuring the board the agency with expertise in the subject matter had maximum flexibility,within legislative parameters.
we note that the trial court found a senate committee report on senate bill no.reflects an understanding that assembly bill no.already authorized auctions.
contrary to the board evident view,the constitutional doubt canon is distinct from the constitutional avoidance doctrine,whereby it is often deemed prudent to address a statutory or other ground to avoid reaching a constitutional ground.see,people mckay cal th,fn.
also contrary to calchamber apparent view,nothing in shaw people ex rel.chiang th shaw addresses ratification.rather,the case involved legislative violation of spending strictures,an issue we address in part,post.
we were not asked to decide whether an administrative or legislative attempt to extend the rules promulgated under the act beyond would be subject to proposition terms,and do not purport to do so.
in contrast,as mentioned earlier,proposition shifted to the state or local government the burden of demonstrating that any charge,levy or assessment is not a tax.schmeer,supra,th at.
this provision was amended by proposition,discussed in part,ante.
the plaintiffs emphasize this last finding,arguing that it is possible to connect any human activity to ghg emissions,meaning there is no definable regulatory horizon.our dissenting colleague appears to accept this view.
a point pressed by the board and edf,in defense of the trial court ruling,is that the board had no purpose to generate revenue,and therefore any auction revenue is merely a byproduct of the regulations.they point out that proposition restricted changes for the purpose of increasing revenues cal,art.xiii a,former and contend revenue generation was not the purpose of the auction system.but the board concedes it knew the auctions would generate revenue,and it adopted the regulations with such knowledge,therefore it intended to generate revenue,whether or not that was its prime motivation.see people colantuono cal th,oblique intention where the actor knows likely consequence,is not explicitly motivated to achieve it,yet still acts,the actor intends the consequence city of madera black cal,persons,even when acting officially,are presumed to intend the necessary consequences of their acts evid.code.therefore,as plaintiffs maintain,we can not characterize billions of dollars of anticipated auction revenues as a fortuitous byproduct of the regulations.
