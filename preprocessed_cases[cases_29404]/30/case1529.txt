mountain states legal foundation and the blue ribbon coalition hereafter mountain states appeal the dismissal of their complaint challenging six presidential proclamations as unconstitutional and ultra vires actions for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b.mountain states contends that the district court erred by limiting its review to the face of the proclamations rather than conducting factfinding to determine whether the president had complied with the limitations,structure,and purposes of the antiquities act the act.absent such judicial review,it contends,the act constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of congressional authority.mountain states maintains that its complaint stated a claim because the proclamations reach far beyond the purpose,scope,and size of any national monuments contemplated by congress under the act and are contrary to various statutes relating to the protection of environmental values on federal land.we have no occasion to decide the availability or scope of judicial review of a presidential proclamation designating federal lands as a national monument under the antiquities act,for mountain states has failed to present any factual allegation sufficient to warrant review of its ultra vires claim.accordingly,we affirm the dismissal of the complaint.
near the end of his second term in office,president clinton exercised his authority under the antiquities act to issue a series of presidential proclamations designating a handful of national monuments in the western united states.among these designations are the six proclamations that mountain states challenged in its complaint the grand national monument,a geological treasure that encompasses an important watershed for the colorado river and the grand canyon in northwest arizona,proclamation,fed.reg,the canyons of the ancients national monument in southwest colorado,a rugged landscape containing the highest known density of archaeological sites in the nation,proclamation,fed.reg.june,the national monument,a biological crossroads in southwestern oregon where the cascade range intersects with adjacent ecoregions,proclamation,fed.reg.june,the hanford reach national monument,a habitat in southern washington that is the largest remnant of the ecosystem that once dominated the columbia river basin,proclamation,fed.reg.june,the ironwood forest national monument,an arid terrain in southern arizona marked by rock art sites and other archaeological objects of scientific interest,proclamation,fed.reg.june,and the sonoran desert national monument,a desert ecosystem containing an array of biological,scientific,and historic resources,proclamation,fed.reg.
mountain states alleged in its complaint that the president acted unconstitutionally and ultra vires under the property clause,art.iv,cl,in issuing these proclamations.in the district court mountain states argued that the president lacked the authority to designate the monuments because the property clause confers on congress all powers relating to federal land.the focus of its argument shifted,however,when the government invoked the antiquities act in its motion to dismiss the complaint under rule b and b.the government argued that because the president had issued the proclamations under the antiquities act,judicial review was limited to whether the president exercised his discretion in accordance with the standards in the act,and that review of the face of the proclamations sufficed to dispose of mountain states arguments.mountain states responded that factfinding was required to ensure that the president had acted within the scope of his statutory authority,and in particular that the court should review,in light of the statutory standards,the basis on which the president acted.according to mountain states,congress intended only to preserve ruins,artifacts,and other manmade objects situated on public the land the smallest possible reservation of public land necessary for protection of the monument.
the district court dismissed the complaint,ruling that the property clause was not at issue and that under the antiquities act only facial review of mountain states arguments was appropriate.upon facial review,the court concluded that the president had referenced the relevant statutory standards and had not acted ultra vires.
on appeal,mountain states contends that,in light of the presumption of judicial reviewability of executive action,substantive review was required to ensure that substantial evidence existed to support the president issuance of the proclamations.arguing that the proclamations nature,size,and scope facially contravene congress limited purpose,which was to preserve rare and discrete objects,such as prehistoric ruins and ancient artifacts,mountain states further contends that the presidential actions violate other statutes governing the withdrawal of land from public use and the protection of environmental values on federal land.hence,mountain states maintains,the district court erred in dismissing its complaint based only on facial review of the proclamations.
our review of the grant of a motion to dismiss is de novo.wilson pena.in ruling on a motion to dismiss a complaint the district court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff,maljack,motion picture ass of,and must not dismiss the complaint unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of its claim that would entitle it to relief.conley gibson,d.despite federal rule of civil procedure simplified notice pleading standard,the court need not accept inferences drawn by plaintiffs if such inferences are unsupported by the facts set out in the complaint.nor must the court accept legal conclusions cast in the form of factual allegations.kowal mci communications.with this standard in mind,we turn to mountain states contentions.

the president of the united states is authorized,in his discretion,to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks,historic and prehistoric structures,and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon lands owned or controlled by the government of the united states to be national monuments,and may reserve as a part thereof parcels of land,the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected 
presidential proclamations designating national monuments have been challenged in only a handful of cases in each the court has upheld the president action the supreme court has considered the antiquities act in three cases,each time confirming the broad power delegated to the president under the act.united states california,d cappaert united states,d cameron united states.
although the supreme court has never expressly discussed the scope of judicial review under the antiquities act,the court has directly addressed the nature of review of discretionary presidential decisionmaking under other statutes.the court has highlighted the separation of powers concerns that inhere in such circumstances and has cautioned that these concerns bar review for abuse of discretion altogether.united states george bush,for example,involved c of the tariff act of,which provided that the president
