the basic substantive issue in this consolidated appeal is whether a coalition of environmental groups collectively,ouachita is correct that the forest service forest service changes to certain forest in the southern of the united states failed to comply with the national environmental policy act nepa and the national forest management act nfma.the district court never reached that issue,concluding instead that the majority of ouachita claims were not ripe for review.that conclusion was wrong,since it was based primarily on a construction of the ripeness doctrine that is generally standard but does not apply in nepa suits.because we find no merit in the forest service claims that ouachita lacks standing and that certain claims are now moot both of which it raised for the first time on appeal,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings.
background 
the central dispute between the parties in this case centers on environmental impact statements and records of decision collectively,eiss for forests in three subregions of the southern region specifically,the appalachian mountains subregion,the coastal subregion and the mountains subregion.these eiss,which the forest service completed following our decision in sierra club martin,cir,relate to revisions and amendments to the forest service procedures for collecting information on proposed,endangered,threatened and sensitive species,commonly called pets.ouachita argues that these eiss fail to consider and are inconsistent with three earlier vegetative management plans and eiss collectively,vmeiss for the southern region,which the forest service completed in.
the vmeiss cover more than million acres of national forest land spanning states.they specifically consider five distinct methods of vegetation management along with pursuant to measures to mitigate any potential damages that those methods might cause.
the vmeiss require that when the forest service considers using one of the five vegetation management methods,it perform a biological evaluation of the effects on pets as part of its consideration.specifically,the vmeiss provide that 
w hen adequate population inventory information is unavailable,it must be collected when the site has a high potential for occupancy by a threatened,endangered,proposed,or sensitive species.
chattooga conservancy,vol.iv,tab at.the forest service interpreted this language to require population inventories only if the site has a high potential for occupancy by pets.martin,at.information about the habitats,it reasoned,satisfied the monitoring requirement.id.the forest service later amended the forest plans for each forest at issue in this case to include this language.
in,several plaintiffs involved in the present appeal sued the forest service,arguing that its interpretation of the language was incorrect.on appeal,we concluded that the plain language of the vmeiss provision required the forest service to perform population inventories in project areas where such inventories were not available.id.
not long after martin,the forest service amended the forest plans of three national forests to adopt revised provisions.this new language provided that,in certain circumstances,the forest service need not perform inventories but could instead assume the presence of pets if suitable habitats were present the forest service has since replaced these amendments and adopted new language 
in response to the amendments and before the adoption of the new language,several environmental groups sued the forest service on july.chattooga conservancy jacobs,d.the basic theory of chattooga conservancy was that these amendments were a thinly veiled attempt to avoid the requirements of martin.specifically,the complaint alleged that the forest plan amendments and revisions violated the governing regional vmeiss.in addition,the complaint alleged that the forest service violated nepa in several ways,including by failure to prepare supplements to the regional vmeiss before making the plan amendments and revisions.
in response to the complaint,the forest service gave notice of its intention to prepare supplements to the vmeiss and to amend the forest service manual to include a new requirement of a time to perform population inventories for pets species.both the forest plan amendments and the manual revision eliminated the requirement that the forest service collect population inventory data on pets species.
on may,many of the plaintiffs involved in chattooga conservancy filed another suit challenging a number of projects on several national forests,most of which were severed and transferred.forest conservation council jacobs,d.the portion of the complaint in that action relevant to the present appeal challenged the forest service nepa compliance with respect to amendment to the ouachita national forest plan which specifically revised that plan so that the forest service could rely upon habitat information instead of population inventories.the forest service now claims that ouachita challenge to amendment is moot.chattooga conservancy and forest conservation council the latter of which the parties refer to as wild south were consolidated for the purposes of this appeal.

threshold justiciability considerations 
the forest service has challenged ouachita claims on ripeness,mootness and standing latter two of which it raised only on appeal.we begin with the standing consideration,since we have an obligation to assure ourselves of a litigant standing under article iii,which provides a fundamental limitation on a federal court authority to exercise jurisdiction.daimlerchrysler cuno,d.
resolving the forest service claim that ouachita lacks standing requires analysis under both the constitutional and the nonconstitutional or prudential standing doctrines.kowalski tesmer,d.since this case involves a coalition of environmental groups,the rules for associational standing also apply.that is,a n association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right,the interests at stake are germane to the organization purpose,and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d.valley,at.so long as one party has standing,other parties may remain in the suit without a standing injury.clinton city of new york,d.
the requirements for constitutional standing are familiar ouachita must show that it has suffered an injury in fact that was caused by the forest service actions and that can be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.friends of the earth,at.citing lujan defenders of wildlife,d.in environmental suits,the inquiry tends to be more searching than the causation or redressability considerations.sierra club johnson,cir see also citizens for better forestry dep t of,cir cantrell city of long beach,cir.
although the statutory scheme,acronyms and terms of art make this case appear somewhat confusing at the outset,the fundamental dispute with respect to which we analyze standing is rather straightforward ouachita alleges that the forest service has shirked its duties under nepa and nfma,with the result that already vulnerable species and their habitats are now more vulnerable.the injury that ouachita asserts is a procedural injury,but that does not fundamentally alter the constitutional standing analysis.see city of sausalito,cir.to show a cognizable injury in fact in a procedural injury case,a plaintiff must allege that the agency violated certain procedural rules,that these rules protect a plaintiff concrete interests and that it is reasonably probable that the challenged action will threaten these concrete interests.johnson,at.
because the forest service has raised the issue of ouachita standing for the first time on appeal,we must look to the declarations in the record to determine whether ouachita has standing to maintain the suit.region forest serv.timber purchasers council alcock,cir.turning to the declarations requires that we pause briefly to resolve two motions pending before us the forest service motion to strike declarations that ouachita filed with its reply brief and ouachita for leave to file those declarations.
although we generally do not consider evidence that the parties did not submit in the district court,we have the power to do so when doing so is in the interests of justice and judicial economy.young devaney ex rel.city of augusta,cir.where additional material would be dispositive of pending issues in the case,we are often more willing to allow supplementation of the record.id.here,the record indicates that the forest service challenged ouachita general standing to maintain this suit for the first time on appeal,although it did make standing challenges in the trial court.given that the declarations in question resolve the standing issue and illuminate the mootness issue,and given the length of time that these environmental suits have been pending,we conclude that it is in the interests of justice and efficiency to consider the supplemental declarations.we therefore deny the forest service motion to strike the declarations and grant ouachita motion for leave to supplement the record on appeal.
having resolved the motions pending before us,we return to the issue of constitutional standing.all ouachita needs to establish associational standing is one person in each region who can establish standing.it is well settled that,in a nepa suit,a cognizable procedural injury exists when a plaintiff alleges that a proper eis has not been prepared when the plaintiff also alleges a concrete as an aesthetic or recreational is threatened by the proposed actions.johnson,at.
applying that standard to the present facts,we conclude that ouachita easily meets the constitutional test for injury in fact.ouachita declarations indicate that many of its plaintiffs use and will continue to use the forests in the three regions covered by the vmeiss and the eiss for recreation and,in some cases,for their livelihoods.see,wild south,ex.m,decl.of tracy davids regarding the appalachian mountains subregion,noting i also use and enjoy the biological,recreational and aesthetic values of some of the forests at issue,and appreciate the complex interactions of plant and animal species which indicate the health of the national forests the forest service secretary failure to adequately analyze the environmental impacts of these timber sales has prevented the implementation of proactive measures that can prevent the decline of this area.appellant reply,decl.of norman buzz williams regarding the appalachian mountains subregion,noting,i engage in hiking,canoeing,fishing,birdwatching,archeological and cultural studies throughout each of the three national forests in the chattooga watershed,wild south,ex.b,decl.of lamar marshall regarding the coastal subregion,noting i regularly participate in a wide range of recreational activities in the national forests in mississippi,often in the areas that are the subject of this lawsuit,wild south,ex.h,decl.of alvin brooks regarding the subregion,noting i have suffered personal harm due to forest service activities h erbicide drift from forestland above me contaminated my pond so that i could not claim the cattle i sold were organic.these declarations also allege quite clearly that the forest service failure to analyze the potential environmental impact of various projects and policy changes make it substantially more likely that the declarants interests will be harmed.see,wild south,ex.l,decl.of steven krichbaum regarding the appalachian mountains subregion,noting the implementation of certain projects without compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations will cause substantive injury to my scientific use and recreational and aesthetic enjoyment of a forest at issue.appellant reply,decl.of norman buzz williams regarding the appalachian mountains subregion,noting,during these excursions,i have witnessed excessive siltation of the chattooga river and ma n y of its tributaries from management activities on national forests,including logging,road building,burning,and other vegetative management,wild south,ex.d,decl.of brandt mannchen at regarding the coastal subregion,noting i complained that the impacts that the sierra club observed reduced biodiversity of the riparian zone by removing or injuring hardwoods and other vegetation,increased sedimentation,and reduced shade on the stream and thus warmed the water.i also complained that the burning and logging make the trail less interesting to hike because there is less diversity of vegetation to observe,chattooga conservancy,ex.t,decl.of david reagan regarding the subregion,noting the forest service failure to collect population inventory data on proposed,endangered,threatened,and sensitive species pets has deprived both the agency and interested members of the public of information needed to assess the impacts of the agency vegetation management on rare,sensitive,and declining wildlife and plants,and on wildlife generally this directly impacts my use and enjoyment of the forest,as these rare and sensitive species are a significant part of why i recreate there,chattooga conservancy,ex,decl.of jerry williams regarding the subregion,noting i have used the forests for hunting fishing recreation,observation of wildlife,and checking of forest service activities due to concern for damage to the forest resources i intend to keep using the forests at issue,all of which will be harmed if these projects proceed forward as planned.in short,ouachita exhaustive declarations establish far more than a general public interest in the forests.
constitutional standing also requires that ouachita establish causation and redressability.once,however,a plaintiff has established injury in fact under nepa,the causation and redressability requirements are generally more relaxed.see cantrell,at.to establish causation,ouachita must demonstrate only that it is reasonably probable that the challenged actions will threaten its concrete interests.see,citizens for better forestry,at.
the forest service argues that none of the ouachita plaintiffs can show that any alleged forest service activities will cause harm to any pets species.the forest service argues instead that the revisions and amendments to the forest plans for which ouachita alleges that the eiss were insufficient have no impact.since,the forest service argues,ouachita can not demonstrate that the revisions and amendments demonstrably increase the risk of actual harm to at least one pets species,ouachita can not establish causation.
this formulation of the causation test,especially in the nepa context,is far too rigid.the proper focus on causation is not harm to the environment,but harm to the plaintiffs.laidlaw,at.here,as we discussed earlier,the plaintiffs were harmed when their procedural rights under nepa were violated.since the forest service according to ouachita failed to follow nepa,it is clear that the forest service caused ouachita alleged injury.that is the extent of ouachita burden to establish causation.
the final piece of constitutional standing is redressability.the court,if it concludes that the forest service has failed to follow nepa,has the power to order the agency to comply.as the injury ouachita asserts is the forest service failure to comply with nepa,that injury is plainly redressable.see,utah babbitt,cir.ouachita has therefore satisfied the elements of constitutional standing.
concluding that ouachita meets the constitutional standing test does not entirely resolve the standing still must demonstrate that it has satisfied the nonconstitutional or prudential standing requirements.the relevant prudential inquiry is whether a particular plaintiff has been granted a right to sue by the statute under which he or she brings suit.city of sausalito,at.because nepa does not
