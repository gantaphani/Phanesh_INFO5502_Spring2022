michael peters and jeffrey jackson appeal their convictions on three counts of knowingly operating a defective and damaged wastewater tank in violation of the clean air act one count of making a false writing as to material matters within the jurisdiction of the environmental protection agency and one count of conspiracy to make the false writing they argue that the district court reversibly erred by making coercive statements and giving supplemental instructions to the jury foreperson during an ex parte meeting allowing the wastewater tank conviction to stand even though the government provided no evidence that they do not qualify under an exception to the regulations and denying their rights to speedy sentencing and appeal.although we find no error in the judge application of the wastewater tank regulations to the defendants or the speed with which sentencing occurred,we conclude that the judge ex parte communications with the jury foreperson were reversible error.we reverse the convictions and remand the case to the district court for a new trial.
huntsman petrochemical corporation owns and operates an aromatics and olefins production plant in port arthur,texas.the port arthur plant used benzene to produce ethylene,propylene,and cyclohexalene.from to,appellant peters was the environmental manager for huntsman jefferson county operations jco in southeast texas.jco consisted of four facilities,including the port arthur plant,for which peters oversaw environmental policy and programs.the managers of each of the four plants managed its daily operations.jackson served as a plant manager from early through.
the indictment alleged federal statutory violations involving two of the port arthur plant components.first,the plant used a tower to cool water used to cool processes in the light olefins unit.water pumps through the processes,takes the heat and then circulates through the cooling tower.after being notified by the texas natural resource conservation commission commission that the tower was a potential source for significant airborne benzene emissions,huntsman discovered that benzene was leaking into the cooling system on a continuous basis.peters drafted a letter to the commission that characterized the benzene leak as a major upset in normal operations,which would exempt the plant from sanctions under state law.a few weeks later,peters drafted,and jackson signed,a notice of continuous release for the benzene releases from the cooling tower that was sent to the epa and state officials.a continuous release is one that is routine,anticipated,and incidental to normal operations the government argued at trial that the notice to the epa that characterized the leak as continuous contradicts peters earlier letter to the commission,which characterized the leak as a major upset.further,the government argued that peters letter knowingly used benzene emission samples from a different location that had lower level emissions to give a false representation of emissions.
the second alleged violation involved a wastewater tank used to store wastewater prior to treatment.tank tank was used as a backup tank to hold wastewater.tank operated by way of an external floating roof,but when the level of wastewater in the tank dropped below a certain level,the floating roof came to rest on its legs instead of the wastewater.lightning struck the tank in november,causing a fire that damaged the tank seal.after the fire,jackson stated that he would continue to use the tank.huntsman repaired the tank in april.jackson,peters,and other huntsman employees met with state officials to discuss elevated benzene levels in the area of the port arthur plant in july.although peters and jackson prepared a chronology before the meeting that showed tank wastewater level as below the level at which the roof would float on the wastewater,this information was not part of the chronology that huntsman presented to the state officials.
a federal grand jury indicted peters and jackson.the indictment alleged that they attempted to prevent the united states from discovering the unauthorized release of volatile organic compounds.it alleged further that peters and jackson violated the clean air act by operating tank in violation of epa standards.the case was tried to a jury.
the heart of this appeal focuses on an ex parte meeting between the judge and the jury foreperson that occurred during the jury three days of deliberations.the jury foreperson sent the judge a note stating,i not going to take insults and i ask to be relieved.in response,the judge informed the attorneys that he wanted to meet privately with the foreperson.the judge told the attorneys that the meeting would be limited to what was bothering the foreperson.the attorneys did not object to the meeting.
during the ex parte meeting,the judge and juror discussed what was bothering the foreperson,but the discussion continued into other areas.the foreperson told the judge that the jury was eleven to one on one count,and the pressure that was involved on the one person to agree was tremendous.the juror asked the judge what effect the jury inability to agree on one count would have on the overall verdict.the judge,in addition to answering his question,told the juror,it is my hope that there would hopes the jury will be able to conclude the verdict on all counts.he went on to tell the juror to reach a unanimous verdict on as many counts as you can without doing violence to anyone conscience and so on.the foreperson told the judge three times that he was concerned with causing a mistrial,and the judge assured him that the meeting would not do so.the judge went on to tell the foreperson that he would not declare a mistrial until and unless i know that,after necessary instructions and so on,it impossible for the jury to proceed and obtain a unanimous verdict on the issues that are before you.the judge also told the foreperson i anticipated that this jury would be out at least two days,probably longer,i mean,yesterday and then today and tomorrow.finally,the conversation led to inadvertent supplemental instructions.the foreperson asked,in order to have one overt act to be found guilty of,there may be several parts,and all the parts have to be combined in order to make the one true the judge answered,yeah,and the foreperson responded,okay.later in the ex parte meeting,when discussing documents involved in the case,the judge instructed the juror to also remember the testimony about the document.
a court reporter recorded the ex parte meeting,but the judge sealed the transcript until after the trial.the judge told the attorneys that the jury foreperson vented his frustrations.the transcript was unsealed after the trial.it showed the jury deadlock on one count the judge instruction that everyone hopes the jury will be able to conclude the verdict on all counts the foreperson questions about the effect of the jury answers on the entire verdict,the possibility of a mistrial because of the meeting,or the meaning of an overt act and the judge instructions in response to the foreperson questions.
the jury found both defendants guilty the day after the meeting.defendants moved for a new trial based,among other things,on the ex parte meeting.the motions were denied.
defendants argue that the judge meeting with the foreperson was reversible error under united states gypsum and united states cowan they argue that the judge comments and instructions rise to the level of impermissible coercion,and violate their right to be present,to object,and to clarify supplemental instructions when given.
the supreme court and this court have warned of the dangers inherent in any ex parte meeting between judge and juror,despite good intentions 
any ex parte meeting or communication between the judge and the foreman of a deliberating jury is pregnant with possibilities for error e ven an experienced trial judge can not be certain to avoid all of the pitfalls inherent in such an enterprise 
the court in gypsum gave three reasons for the great possibility of error.first,a judge can not predict or control the direction a conversation may take,and u nexpected questions
