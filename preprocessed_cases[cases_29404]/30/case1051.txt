the opinion filed on september,and published at cir,is withdrawn and superceded by the opinion filed concurrently herewith.
with the filing of the new opinion,appellants pending petition for rehearing en banc is denied as moot,without prejudice to refiling a subsequent petition for rehearing rehearing en banc.see cir.a.
the district court held,sua sponte,that two environmental organizations who have never litigated the validity of several timber sales are precluded from doing so because counsel for other organizations,a year earlier,signed a dismissal with prejudice of a similar suit.we have in this nation a historic tradition that everyone should have his own day in court,and presume,consequently,that a judgment or decree among parties to a lawsuit resolves issues as among them,but it does not conclude the rights of strangers to those proceedings.richards jefferson county,d quoting martin wilks,d.while there are narrow exceptions to this principle,usually denominated by the term privity,the district court here applied the privity doctrine without establishing,among other prerequisites,that the present plaintiffs were adequately represented in the prior suit,and without giving plaintiffs an opportunity to demonstrate that they were not.we reverse,and remand for consideration of the preclusion question after full adversary airing and a development of an appropriate record.
background 
on may,six environmental groups and two individuals american lands plaintiffs filed suit against the forest service challenging various timber sales,including the and silver fork timber sales.american lands alliance williams.the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on october,which advanced nine claims for relief under the national forest management act nfma,the national environmental policy act nepa,and the administrative procedures act apa,challenging nineteen united states forest service logging programs in the willamette,hood,rogue river,and siskiyou national forests.the complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief requiring the forest service to complete an environmental impact statement under nepa and otherwise to comply with nfma,nepa,and apa procedural requirements before implementing the logging plans.both the and silver fork areas are located within the rogue river national forest in southwestern oregon.
on december,before any developments in the case apart from the filing of a scheduling order and an amended,that is,any litigation on the,as far as the record shows,without receiving any concessions from the defendants,the american lands plaintiffs stipulated to a dismissal of their complaint with prejudice.on january,district judge ann aiken issued the dismissal.the american lands complaint was not denominated a class action,and there is no indication that judge aiken reviewed the fairness of the stipulation as it affected third parties.
more than one year later,on february,one of the american lands plaintiffs,the wildlands center wildlands center,represented by a new attorney,filed a new complaint regarding the and silver fork timber sales,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under nfma and nepa.wildlands center united states forest.the forest service moved for judgment on the pleadings based upon res judicata,because of the wildlands center participation in the american lands suit.in response,on june,the wildlands center filed a motion for relief from the judgment,conceding that res judicata would bar the lawsuit but arguing that the court should grant relief from the american lands judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.the wildlands center motion alleged that the attorney in the american lands suit did not have authority to enter into the settlement agreement.on july,judge michael hogan granted the forest service motion for judgment on the pleadings in and dismissed the action without prejudice.the wildlands center did not appeal that judgment.
the present record is silent as to when the plaintiffs here headwaters learned of the american lands and litigation.on july,three days after judge hogan dismissed the wildlands center lawsuit,headwaters instigated suit in the same district court in which the american lands and suits had been filed,using the same lawyer and a similar complaint as in but not as in american lands.the current complaint challenges the and silver fork timber sales,the same two sales challenged by the wildlands center in alleges,differently than did the american lands complaint,the plaintiffs interest in and use of the forests and relates its claims to particular endangered species,which the american lands complaint did not do.on july,judge hogan,to whom the present case was also assigned,dismissed the headwaters complaint sua sponte under the res judicata doctrine.headwaters,united states forest,d.he neither held a hearing nor received any briefing on either the merits of the case or the applicability of res judicata id.headwaters appeals.
a district court judgment based upon res judicata is a mixed question of law and fact in which legal issues predominate.accordingly,we review the district court order de novo.see gregory widnall,cir united states geophysical,cir.
ii.discussion 
the doctrine of res judicata provides that a final judgment on the merits bars further claims by parties or their privies based on the same cause of action,and is central to the purpose for which civil courts have been established,the conclusive resolution of disputes within their jurisdiction.in re schimmels,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the elements necessary to establish res judicata are an identity of claims,a final judgment on the merits,and privity between parties.council,tahoe reg l planning agency,cir quotation marks and citation omitted radio servs.glickman,cir.we shall discuss each element in turn,but,as we shall explain,the central issue is whether,as required to find privity,headwaters was adequately represented in the earlier litigation.
identity of claims 
in determining whether a present dispute concerns the same claims as did prior litigation,the ninth circuit considers 
w hether rights or interests established in the prior judgment would be destroyed or impaired by prosecution of the second action whether substantially the same evidence is presented in the two actions whether the two suits involve infringement of the same right and whether the two suits arise out of the same transactional nucleus of facts.the last of these criteria is the most important.
costantini trans world airlines,cir internal citation omitted.
headwaters complaint alleges an infringement of the same right and arises out of the same nucleus of facts present in both the american lands and litigation.the complaint in this case challenges the timber sales on the grounds that the forest service violated nepa,nfma,and the apa.all three of these claims were present in the prior suits.further,the and silver fork timber sales are part of the underlying nucleus of facts that forms the basis for all three of these suits.accordingly,an identity of claims exists.
final judgment on the merits 
the district court in american lands entered a final judgment when it dismissed the action with prejudice pursuant to the stipulated dismissal.we have held that a stipulated dismissal of an action with prejudice in a federal district court generally constitutes a final judgment on the merits and precludes a party from reasserting the same claims in a subsequent action in the same court.see concha london,cir
