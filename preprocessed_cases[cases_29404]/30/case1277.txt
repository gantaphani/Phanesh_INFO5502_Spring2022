colorado wild,and heartwood,collectively,the conservation groups appeal from a final judgment in favor of,united states forest service forest service and intermountain forest association intermountain.the conservation groups challenge,pursuant to the administrative procedure act apa,a categorical exclusion promulgated by the forest service category that allows the salvage of dead dying trees on up to acres with up to mile of temporary road construction to proceed without preparation of an environmental impact statement eis or an environmental assessment ea under the national environmental policy act nepa.the shaw lake vegetation project shaw lake project was approved pursuant to category.our jurisdiction arises under,and we affirm.
statutory background 
our review of the challenged regulation is set against the backdrop of nepa and the regulations and guidance created by the administrative agency charged with its implementation,the council on environmental quality ceq.we therefore begin with a brief overview thereof.nepa was enacted to regulate government activity that significantly impacts the environment and to help public officials make decisions that are based on an understanding of environmental consequences,and take actions that protect,restore,and enhance the environment.c.the ceq administers nepa and promulgates regulations related to nepa that are binding on federal agencies.see.every federal agency then drafts its own administrative regulations to implement and supplement the ceq regulations.see.
to effectuate the goals of nepa,the ceq created rules requiring agencies to establish implementing procedures that facilitate the evaluation of management decisions and the environmental effects of proposed federal agency actions.under these guidelines,an agency must identify those actions which normally require an eis.see id.a.an eis is required for major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.
in order to determine whether a particular proposed action requires the preparation of an eis,agencies perform an ea.an ea is a public document shorter than an eis that contains information pertaining to the need for the proposed action,other alternatives,the environmental impact of the proposal and its alternatives,and other relevant information.see b.an agency may prepare an ea for one of several reasons to provide evidence and analysis that establish whether or not an eis or a finding of no significant impact fonsi should be prepared to help the agency comply with nepa when no eis is necessary and to facilitate preparation of an eis when one is necessary.see id.a.
when an agency identifies certain actions that do not have any significant effect on the environment,the agency may classify those actions as categorical exclusions ces.under nepa and ceq regulations,if an action falls within a particular ce,the agency need prepare neither an eis nor an ea.the ceq requires federal agencies to design procedures for establishing ces.specifically,a ce is 
a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and which have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a federal agency in implementation of these regulations and for which,therefore,neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.an agency may decide in its procedures or otherwise,to prepare environmental assessments for the reasons stated in even though it is not required to do so.any procedures under this section shall provide for extraordinary circumstances in which a normally excluded action may have a significant environmental effect.
in guidance regarding nepa regulations,july,the ceq expressed concern that some agencies were developing lists of specific activities which qualify as ces.the ceq discouraged this practice,noting that if this approach is applied narrowly it will not provide the agency with sufficient flexibility to make decisions on a basis with full consideration to the issues and impacts that are unique to a specific project.id.the ceq went on to encourage agencies to consider broadly defined criteria which characterize types of actions that,based on the agency experience,do not cause significant environmental effects.id.
in order to establish a ce,the ceq requires that an agency publish the proposed ce in the federal register,provide an opportunity for public comment,and submit the ce to the ceq for review and approval.see a.the ceq reviews proposed ces at the draft stage.after reviewing comments received during the review period and prior to publication in final form,the ceq determines whether the ces are consistent with nepa regulations.id.
factual background 
in,the forest service promulgated and adopted a ce for timber harvests which remove board feet or less of merchantable wood products or salvage which removes board feet or less,the former ce.in,a federal district court in illinois struck down the former ce.heartwood,forest,d.
in,the forest service began developing a new set of ces to cover timber harvests.as a basis for proposing a new set of ces,the forest service looked at two sets of data.the forest service first analyzed all timber harvest projects performed under the former ce for the year,the last year the former ce was available to the forest service.this data was compiled and reviewed to estimate the extent to which the former ce was used and to determine average project size in acres and harvest volume in board feet.
second,in,the forest service selected,on a nationwide basis,timber harvest projects that were either approved under the former ce,approved after an ea or an eis was prepared but fit within the former ce requirements,or were otherwise small in scope.this sample consisted of dead timber salvage projects and green timber harvest projects.none of the projects reviewed predicted significant effects on the environment before the project was implemented.
of the projects reviewed,were approved under the former ce and were documented with decision memos while were documented with eas.in addition to reviewing these documents,teams of interdisciplinary resource specialists from the forest service the interdisciplinary teams conducted,assessments of these projects environmental effects.the interdisciplinary teams monitored and documented whether each project met project standards,forest plan standards or guidelines,state water quality standards,for soil,water,air,vegetation,wildlife,fish,cultural and historic resources,and other pertinent issue related resources.at.
the resulting data indicated that a few of the projects showed minor soil disturbance and compaction,while a few others showed that small numbers of noxious weeds or invasive plants entered the area where the trees had been removed.july.however,based on the information provided by the interdisciplinary teams,the respective forest service line officer responsible for each timber harvest project reviewed made a finding that these impacts were not significant in the nepa context,they did not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment.id.at.thus,the forest service considered prediction and verification of no significance in the nepa context.
based on the projects reviewed,the forest service identified three types of actions that it determined normally do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment.as such,the forest service defined the criteria which characterize these actions and proposed three new categories of ces consistent therewith harvest of live trees not to exceed acres green timber harvests or category,salvage of dead dying trees not to exceed acres salvage timber harvests or category,and commercial and sanitation of trees to control insects or disease not to exceed acres category.see.the forest service also defined all three ces to permit no more than mile of temporary road construction.id.
in addition,each ce contains the limitation that it can not be employed for a given project where there are extraordinary circumstances present that would preclude its usage.extraordinary circumstances include,but are not limited to,potentially significant effects on the following 
federally listed threatened or endangered species or designated critical habitat,species proposed for federal listing or proposed critical habitat,or forest service sensitive species floodplains,wetlands or municipal watersheds congressionally designated areas such as wilderness,wilderness study areas,or national recreation areas inventoried roadless areas research natural areas american indian and alaska native religious or cultural sites archeological sites,or historic properties or areas.
in accordance with ceq regulations,the forest service published a draft of the proposed ces in the federal register on january.see.january.it took public comment for the prescribed days during which approximately comment letters were received from individuals representatives of federal agencies tribes state and local government agencies environmental groups professional organizations and both commodity and groups.the forest service responded to these comments with form letters as well as individual letters.id.thereafter,pursuant to ceq procedures,the ceq reviewed the proposed ces and in a letter dated july,notified the forest service of the following 
based on this review,ceq concludes that the proposed ces conform with nepa and the ceq regulations.the ces will take effect once they are published in final form in the federal register.once established,the agencies will satisfy nepa when using these ces by determining whether a proposed action falls within the description of the activities and by reviewing the proposal to determine whether extraordinary circumstances exist.in the event extraordinary circumstances exist,an ea or an eis would be prepared before proceeding with the proposed action.
at emphasis in original.on july,the forest service published in the federal register a final version of the ces,which are now incorporated in fsh,ch.
on july,the rio grande national forest announced the shaw lake project,which proposed to treat approximately acres on the rio grande national forest to address a severe spruce beetle outbreak under category.the forest service accepted public comment until august.after consideration of public comments,the forest service determined that the project involved less than acres of salvage of dead or dying trees and construction of less than mile of temporary road and did not involve any extraordinary circumstances which would preclude issuance of the project pursuant to category.on september,district ranger tom malecek signed a decision memo authorizing the project.
in late,the conservation groups mounted both a facial challenge to category and a challenge to the forest service use of category with respect to the shaw lake project.at.the conservation groups attacked the forest service promulgation of category arguing that it violates section requirement that a ce only encompass those activities which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment.the conservation groups maintained that the forest service promulgation of category constituted arbitrary and capricious agency action on two grounds.first,they challenged,for several reasons,the methodology used by the forest service in promulgating category.second,they contended that the forest service erred,in multiple ways,in its substantive conclusion that the activities included in category normally will not have significant environmental impacts.intermountain,an organization representing forest product companies and timber purchasing sawmills,intervened unopposed as a defendant.the district court held in favor of the forest service finding that the conservation groups failed to show that the forest service adoption of category was arbitrary,capricious or contrary to law.at.
discussion 
this case is before us on review pursuant to the apa.we review the district court decision de novo.defenders of wildlife environmental protection agency,cir citation omitted.when reviewing agency action,our scope of review is set forth in the apa.we may not overturn the decision of an administrative agency unless we determine that the decision was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a utahns for better transp.of.
the scope of our review under the arbitrary or capricious standard is narrow and we are not to substitute our judgment for that of the agency.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.we confine our review to ascertaining whether the agency examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for its decision,including a rational connection between the facts found and the decision made.olenhouse commodity credit,cir.in reviewing the agency explanation,we must determine whether the agency considered all relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.motor vehicle,at.citation omitted.agency action will be set aside if the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.id.
because the arbitrary and capricious standard focuses on the rationality of an agency decision making process rather than on the rationality of the actual decision,i t is that an agency action must be upheld,if at all,on the basis articulated by the agency itself.motor vehicle,at.thus,the grounds upon which the agency acted must be clearly disclosed in,and sustained by,the record.olenhouse,at.the agency must make plain its course of inquiry,its analysis and its reasoning.id.rationalization by counsel in briefs or argument will not cure noncompliance by the agency with these principles.id.
in addition to requiring a reasoned basis for agency action,the arbitrary or capricious standard requires an agency action to be supported by facts in the record.olenhouse,at.accordingly,agency action will be set aside as arbitrary unless it is supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.id.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.pennaco energy dep t of the interior,cir quotations and citation omitted.this is something more than a mere scintilla but something less than the weight of the evidence.foust lujan,cir discussing substantial evidence standard.evidence is generally substantial under the apa if it is enough to justify,if the trial were to a jury,refusal to direct a verdict on a factual conclusion.hoyl babbitt,cir.it is not our duty,however,to substitute our judgment for that of the agency on matters within its expertise.marsh oregon natural resources council,d.moreover,we typically defer to the reasonable opinions of agency experts in matters implicating conflicting expert opinions.see id.
moreover,because the conservation groups have challenged category on its face and seek to enjoin its usage by the forest service,our review is also governed by the standard applicable to facial challenges.see pub.lands council babbitt,cir.to prevail on a facial challenge,the conservation groups must establish that no set of circumstances exist under which the regulation would be valid.id.quotations omitted alteration in original.with these principles of review in mind,we turn now to the challenges posed by the conservation groups.
on appeal,the conservation groups press the same two challenges to the forest service promulgation of category they raised below.
forest service methodology 
with regards to the methodology employed by the forest service in promulgating category,the conservation groups object to the following the statistical analysis used in establishing the acre limit the sample of projects considered in setting the length of permissible temporary road construction and the forest service reliance on the personal observations of the interdisciplinary teams in concluding that the projects reviewed did not have significant environmental impacts.
acreage limit 
the forest service set the acreage limit for category at acres,slightly below the mean acreage of the salvage projects reviewed.the median acreage of the salvage projects reviewed was acres.some of the difference between the mean and median acreage is attributable to the inclusion of a few large salvage projects in the relevant sample subset,including one salvage project that covered acres and four projects totaling over acres collectively,the largest salvage projects.by removing the largest salvage projects from the sample subset,the mean of the remaining salvage projects drops to acres.the conservation groups maintain that because the inclusion of the largest salvage projects affected the results in this manner,it was arbitrary and capricious for the forest service to not use either a mean analysis which excluded the largest salvage projects,removing them from the sample subset as statistical outliers or a median analysis.
the conservation groups draw heavily on ass of oil pipe lines fed.energy reg.comm n,and american iron steel institute occupational safety and health,in support of their argument.accordingly,as a preliminary matter,we address the import of oil pipe lines and am.iron steel to the case here.
we conclude that neither oil pipe lines nor am.iron steel compels the result urged by the conservation groups.in oil pipe lines,the circuit found that the federal energy regulatory commission failed to adequately explain its decision not to follow its prior method of removing,from the relevant sample set,statistical outliers,which it defined as those data points that are so extreme as to raise a question whether they may be the result of recording or measurement errors or some other anomaly.at.the circuit was concerned that the decision to exclude outliers was outcome avoid increasing the average value to the extent that ferc refused to exclude outliers on the ground that doing so changed the result,it obviously missed the whole point the object of excluding outliers is to prevent extreme and spurious data from biasing an analysis,affecting its result adversely.id.at.
in this case,no one has suggested that forest service inexplicably deviated from past practices or did not conduct an investigation into the largest salvage projects so as to preordain a particular average.in light of the evidence put forth by the forest service,the conservation groups have not carried their burden of establishing that the largest salvage projects are abnormal,will not recur,and ought to be eliminated.all salvage projects in the sample set,from the smallest five to the largest five,were individually reviewed and resulted in a finding of no significant impact.the suggestion by the conservation groups without benefit of citation to the record in its reply brief that the likely anomaly that produced the outliers here was that the largest salvage projects reviewed had a relatively small amount of timber removed relative to their acreages is merely a hunch.aplt.rply.br.at.the solution proposed by the conservation groups,eliminating the largest salvage projects,from the average seems arbitrary and given the process an agency is supposed to engage in when coming up with a ce.
in am.iron steel,the circuit addressed an industry challenge to osha use of a geometric mean in its technological feasibility analysis as unfair because osha does not use the geometric mean in its enforcement.at.the circuit decided to uphold osha preference for using a geometric mean which basically excludes statistical outliers rather than an arithmetic mean which does not exclude outliers because osha reasoned that the geometric mean was the best statistical method to summarize the routine exposure levels and was,therefore,a good indicator of the feasibility of compliance.id.we do not read am.iron steel as holding as the conservation groups suggest that it would have in fact been arbitrary and capricious for the agency to have included the outliers.as the forest service accurately points out,the circuit did not address this issue as it ultimately deferred to osha choice of statistical analysis.id.at.
accordingly,we turn to the remaining question of whether the forest service acted arbitrarily or capriciously in not using a median analysis when setting category acreage limit but we must be mindful that under the arbitrary and capricious standard,our deference to the agency is greatest when reviewing technical matters within its area of expertise,particularly its choice of scientific data and statistical methodology.louisiana ex rel.guste verity,cir noting that we do not review an agency decision as statisticians,but as a reviewing court exercising our narrowly defined duty of holding agencies to certain minimal standards of rationality.
as such,we look to the forest service rationale for using the mean acreage of the salvage projects reviewed when setting category acreage limit.explaining its choice,the forest service stated,
the sample of projects reviewed was limited to projects that were either categorically excluded under the former ce,could have been categorically excluded had the former ce still been available,or that were otherwise small in scope.based on this limitation,it follows that project sizes would be biased toward smaller acreages.consequently,the median project size is acres for salvage harvests.since direct,indirect,and cumulative effects arise from acres of activity and not the number of projects,average acreages were used rather than median project size.
from our admittedly lay perspective and this record,the forest service rejection of the median because of the of small projects and its focus on the acres of activity does not seem irrational.we can not substitute our views on statistics including skewed data and outlier analysis for those of the forest service and insist that one measure or another be used.
road length 
the conservation groups claim that the forest service erred in permitting mile of temporary road construction in the new ces.of the timber harvest projects the forest service reviewed,involved an average of mile of temporary road construction.finding no significant environmental impacts from these projects,the forest service determined to include mile of temporary road construction in the new ces.the conservation groups maintain that g iven that the forest service approach was to base the ces on the typical project amongst those reviewed,the result should have been to eliminate roads from the ces,as the typical timber harvest project had no roads.aplt.br.at.the conservation groups argue alternatively that if the forest service was determined to include temporary road construction in the ces,it should have used the average road length for all projects,giving road lengths of zero to the timber harvest projects it reviewed without roads.
both these arguments are wanting.the forest service purpose for reviewing the timber harvest projects was to determine whether particular activities normally have significant environmental impacts.to determine whether timber harvest projects containing temporary road construction have significant environmental impacts,the forest service logically looked to the data collected from those projects it reviewed which contained road construction,the relevant data.motor vehicle,at.it would have,in fact,been against reason for the forest service to consider timber harvest projects without road construction because they add nothing to the determination of whether this particular activity,temporary road construction,normally has significant environmental impacts.the forest services decision to confine its analysis to those timber harvest projects containing temporary road construction was not,therefore,arbitrary or capricious.
forest service reliance on personal observations 
the conservation groups claim that the forest service impermissibly relied on the personal observations of the interdisciplinary teams conducting the review process as a basis for finding that the reviewed projects did not have significant environmental impacts.the conservation groups draw upon northwest motorcycle ass dep t of,cir,and heartwood,d at,in support of this proposition.
we find northwest motorcycle ass and heartwood distinguishable.in northwest motorcycle ass n,the ninth circuit was not concerned with the agency reliance on the personal observations of its interdisciplinary team to support its substantive conclusions,but rather the court was troubled by the lack,in the administrative record,of any direct statements from the i nterdisciplinary t eam that illustrates the personal experiences of the agency employees.at.likewise,the heartwood court rejection of the forest service rationale for the former ce was similarly predicated on the lack of any evidentiary support in the administrative record,not on the forest service reliance on the personal observations of its own personnel.see heartwood,d at.
here there are no such evidentiary deficiencies.the record fully demonstrates the factors the interdisciplinary teams considered,whether the timber harvest project effects met forest plan standards or guidelines,state water quality standards,the monitoring techniques they employed personal observations,measurements,and the resulting data.based on this field monitoring data,the respective forest service line officer responsible made a determination as to whether the timber harvest project caused a significant impact on the human environment.supported by this record,we are unpersuaded that the forest service acted arbitrarily or capriciously in relying on the personal observations of its interdisciplinary teams.
the conservation groups further contend that because it was in the forest service to find no significance for the projects reviewed,reliance on personal observation s of the forest service personnel is particularly questionable.aplt.br.at.this argument must be rejected as speculative.accordingly,we reject all claims by the conservation groups that the methodology employed by the forest service in promulgating category was arbitrary or capricious.
the forest service substantive conclusions 
in addition to challenging the methodology employed by the forest service in promulgating category,the conservation groups assert,on several grounds,that the record shows the forest service erred substantively in concluding that projects under category will normally not have significant impact on the human environment.
dead timber salvaging green timber harvesting 
relying on heartwood,the conservation groups strenuously press the proposition that dead timber salvaging and green timber harvesting have the same environmental impacts.the conservation groups claim,therefore,that the forest service acted arbitrarily and capriciously in promulgating category because it allows dead timber salvaging on acres while category limits green timber harvesting to acres.
the forest service does not maintain that there is an intrinsic difference between the environmental impacts of green timber harvesting and dead timber salvaging.the forest service argues,however,that heartwood is distinguishable on the basis that,unlike here,in heartwood the forest service failed to provide evidence in the administrative record to support its decision to have differing limitations applicable to green timber harvesting and dead timber salvaging.we agree.
in developing categories and,the forest service reviewed timber harvest projects,of which involved green timber harvesting and of which involved dead timber salvaging.based on data gathered from this review,the forest service found that none of these projects caused significant environmental impacts.the forest service then determined that the mean acreage size of the projects involving dead timber salvaging was acres,while the mean acreage size of the project involving green timber harvesting was acres.as such,the forest service concluded that the evidence supported a acre limit applicable to green timber harvesting,while the evidence available for dead timber salvaging supported a larger applicable acreage limit of acres.there is nothing in heartwood to suggest that this approach is arbitrary or capricious.rather,the forest service decision to set different acreage limitations applicable to categories and was a rational response to the evidence before it.motor vehicle,at.agency action will be set aside if the agency has offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency.
the conservation groups contend that the forest service rationale is a false syllogism,because it only shows that larger salvage projects were chosen for analysis than green timber projects.aplt.br.at.the conservation groups maintain that this result was preordained by the project selection process,whereby the projects reviewed were those that were,or could have been,approved under the former ce.that is,because the former ce allowed green timber harvests of board feet,and dead timber salvages of one million board feet,it is logical that the latter would be almost four times larger than the former.
we are not,however,persuaded that this observation compels a different conclusion.when developing the new ces,pursuant to ceq regulations and guidance,the forest service was to consider types of actions that,based on its experience,do not cause significant environmental impacts.in accordance therewith,the forest service drew upon prior timber harvest projects,which based on its experience did not cause significant environmental impacts.it is true,as it were,that these projects were previously approved under the former ce,which had differing board feet limitations applicable to green timber harvesting and dead timber salvaging,and that the resulting data was thereby affected.however,this fact does not place the forest service rationale in conflict with the proposition that the environmental impacts from these two actions are the same.nor does it prove that dead timber salvaging normally causes significant environmental impacts.rather,it merely demonstrates the forest service lack of experience with,and ability to provide an evidentiary record for,a ce applicable to green timber harvests of a size equal to dead timber salvages.
b.the record showing no significant impact 
the conservation groups next forward a succession of substantive claims,through a series of quotations from public comment letters opposing the then proposed category,regarding the following the reduction of collaboration between the forest service and states and tribes,the use of an acreage limit rather than a timber volume limit,the potential for significant cumulative impacts from the use of multiple ces,and the significance of environmental impacts from temporary road construction.we address each in turn.
first,the conservation groups contend that use of category will severely limit the opportunity for state agencies,indian tribes,and the public to provide meaningful input into the decision making process of the forest service.aplt.br.at.public involvement is an important aspect of preparing an eis.see,requiring an agency preparing an eis to request,and respond to,comments from federal,state,and local agencies,indian tribes,and the public.public involvement,of a lesser magnitude,is also required for preparing an ea.see id.b.ceq regulations do not,however,require public involvement in an agency decision to employ a ce once that ce has been approved.
the conservation groups contention is,of course,grounded in its concern that the forest service will approve dead timber salvages under category without the level of public involvement that it deems necessary to making appropriate environmental decisions.however,the ceq regulations clearly do not contemplate the level of public involvement that the conservation groups seek,nor do the conservation groups attack,in this litigation,the ceq regulations in that regard.as such,while the conservation groups may feel strongly about their contention,we are certain that it has no bearing on whether the forest service acted arbitrarily or capriciously in promulgating category.
second,the conservation groups argue that the forest service erred in limiting category by acreage rather than the total volume of timbe
