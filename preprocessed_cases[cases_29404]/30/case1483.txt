in a coalition of environmental organizations petitioned the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to formally consult under section of the endangered species act with the national marine fisheries service of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa regarding ferc ongoing regulatory authority over hydropower operations affecting threatened and endangered fish in the snake river basin.the petition has gone unanswered for more than six years.now petitioners american rivers and idaho rivers united collectively,petitioners seek a writ of mandamus compelling a response,alleging that ferc delay is unreasonable under the administrative procedure act apa.for the reasons set forth below,we grant the writ and order ferc to respond to the petition within days of the issuance of this opinion.
the endangered species act esa or act,et,is generally regarded as the most comprehensive legislation for the preservation of endangered species ever enacted by any nation.tennessee valley auth.hill,d see also rancho viejo,llc norton,cert.denied,d.finding that various species of fish,wildlife and plants valuable to the health and welfare of the nation have become extinct or face extinction because of economic growth and development untempered by adequate concern and conservation,a,the congress enacted the esa to provide a means for conserving endangered and threatened species as well as the ecosystems they depend on,see id.b rancho viejo,at.
the esa confers on the united states departments of the interior interior and of commerce commerce shared responsibilities for protecting or species of fish,wildlife and plants.see a.the commerce secretary has,in turn,delegated his authority to list threatened or endangered marine and anadromous species to the service.id.a a b see threatened species,endangered species.
section of the esa requires all federal agencies,in consultation with and with the assistance of the commerce or interior secretary,to further the esa purpose by carrying out programs for the conservation of listed species.a.an agency must ensure that its actions,including licensures,are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the secretary to be critical.id.a see rancho viejo,at.upon determining that its activity may affect listed marine or anadromous species or critical habitat,an agency must initiate formal consultation with the by submitting a written request containing,inter alia,descriptions of the contemplated action and listed species or critical habitat that may be affected by it.a,c.formal consultation ordinarily culminates with the service issuance of a biological opinion that makes a jeopardy or no jeopardy conclusion.id.g,h see b.if it determines that the action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat,the opinion suggests reasonable and prudent alternatives,if any,the agency can take to avoid violating section.h see b a.according to the service regulations,formal consultation must usually be concluded within days.see e.
in ferc predecessor,the federal power commission commission,granted a license to the idaho power company ipc to construct,operate and maintain the hells canyon complex,a hydropower project composed of three,low hells canyon and the hells canyon area of the snake river.see idaho power,opinion order,reprinted in petitioners addendum.the commission recognized then that the project would adversely affect the fish and wildlife resources of the area,and particularly the anadromous fish.because the project would block the runs of anadromous fish,the commission concluded that some type of fish facilities would have to be provided for the protection of this resource.accordingly,to minimize the project impact on the anadromous fish,the commission required the ipc to construct and maintain fish ladders,fish traps or other fish handling facilities or fish protective devices and provide fish hatchery facilities for the purpose of conserving the fishery resources.the ipc license also included a clause,providing that the company must comply with such reasonable modifications of the project structures and operation in the interest of fish life as may be prescribed hereafter by the commission upon its own motion or upon the recommendation of the secretary.
it is not disputed that hydropower projects have contributed to declining populations of anadromous,salmon and steelhead trout the snake river and the columbia river basin.see,endangered and threatened species proposed endangered status for snake river sockeye salmon,fed.reg,proposed rule c urrent annual salmon and steelhead production in the columbia river basin is more than million fish below historical levels,with million of this annual loss estimate attributable to hydropower development and operation.so far the service has listed three snake river anadromous fish species as endangered and one as threatened,each time listing hydropower development as a factor contributing to population decline in the service listed the snake river sockeye salmon as endangered.see fed.reg.at.it listed two more species of salmon,the snake river chinook salmon and the snake river fall chinook salmon,as threatened the following and as endangered two years later through an emergency rule see fed.reg.at fed.reg.at.in the service also designated an area including the hells canyon reach of the snake river as critical habitat for these three salmon species.see designated critical habitat snake river sockeye salmon,snake river chinook salmon,and snake river fall chinook salmon,fed.reg,final rule.and in,the service listed the snake river population of west coast steelhead trout as threatened.see fed.reg.at.
reacting to these developments,a coalition of environmental organizations including petitioner american rivers requested ferc in november to initiate formal consultation with the service regarding ferc ongoing regulation of ipc operation of the hells canyon complex see petition to initiate consultation under the endangered species act at,reprinted in hereinafter petition.the petition asked ferc to act within days b ecause time is running out for the endangered salmon.the coalition further recited that it would consider ferc failure to respond within days a constructive denial of the petition and would file immediately for rehearing.
when ferc failed to meet the deadline,the coalition reacted as promised.it notified ferc that it considered the agency inaction a denial of the petition and requested rehearing.see request for rehearing of constructive order denying petition to initiate consultation under the endangered species act at,reprinted in.ferc subsequently denied rehearing,noting b ecause there has been no order from which to seek rehearing,the rehearing request is premature and must be rejected.idaho power,order rejecting request for rehearing,ferc,wl,footnote omitted.the coalition then petitioned the ninth circuit court of appeals for review of ferc denial of the petition effected by its failure to act.see american rivers ferc,cir.it met with no more success there.id.at.the ninth circuit dismissed the petition for want of jurisdiction,explaining that appellate jurisdiction is dependent on the issuance of an order by ferc and the agency m ere inaction can not be transmuted by petitioners into an order rejecting their petition.id.
following the ninth circuit decision,coalition members along with other groups have repeatedly requested ferc to either grant the petition and immediately initiate section consultation or formally deny the petition more than six years later,ferc has yet to respond to the petition.
the petitioners now ask us to grant a writ of mandamus compelling ferc to act formally on the petition.we have jurisdiction to entertain the request in order to safeguard our prospective jurisdiction under the federal power act,b.see telecomms.research action center fcc,because the statutory obligation of a court of appeals to review on the
