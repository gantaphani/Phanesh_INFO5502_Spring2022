petitioners ask us to reverse the federal aviation administration faa and air national guard ang orders approving the colorado airspace initiative initiative and finding adequate the final environmental impact statement on the initiative.they claim the orders approving the initiative and the underlying environmental impact analysis violate the federal aviation act,b,and the national environmental policy act.petitioners further claim implementation of the initiative will violate their property rights under the third and fifth amendments to the united states constitution.
we exercise jurisdiction over the faa final order pursuant to.national parks conservation ass federal aviation,cir supports extending our review to the ang decision and final environmental impact statement as incorporated into the faa final decision.having carefully reviewed the administrative record and for the reasons set forth below,we deny the petition for review.
background 
this dispute was triggered by the colorado airspace special use airspace changes to the national airspace system designed to provide the necessary airspace for the tactical fighter wing of the colorado ang to be able to train with the fighter jet under realistic conditions and respond to changes in commercial aircraft arrival and departure corridors required for operation of denver international airport.
the colorado ang is under the command and control of the governor of colorado and is also a reserve component of the united states air force.ang units have increased as a percentage of the total military force and thus have assumed a more prominent role in our national defense.for example,the air wing has assisted in operation northern watch,enforcing the zone in northern iraq,operation southern watch,enforcing the zone in southern iraq,and in operation coronet night hawk,intercepting drug runners from colombia.the air force provides the fighter and other weapon systems to the ang.those systems must be maintained and utilized pursuant to air force and department of defense regulations,et.the ang need for frequent,realistic training exercises using these systems is obvious.
ang pilots utilize three types of airspace in conducting their training exercises military training routes mtrs military operations areas moas and restricted areas ras as finally approved,the initiative involved a total of fourteen modifications to mtr and moa airspace in colorado.the faa groups these modifications into four actions 
kit carson has been renamed the cheyenne moa.it retains roughly the same dimensions as the kit carson moa,except that the faa directed that the western boundary be shortened approximately nautical miles in order to accommodate new approaches to the denver international airport.the minimum flying altitude was raised from feet to feet above ground level.
pinon canyon moa and two buttes is the most significant change found in the initiative.while the pinon canyon moa was already in existence,the two buttes moa is new.the two buttes moa abuts the eastern edge of the pinon canyon moa to create one large moa.the two buttes moa is large enough to handle fighters engaged in combat training missions.the pinon canyon moa is used primarily for training.
fremont moa was divided into three parts,named the airburst a,b,and c moas.the original moa was enlarged at some points and reduced at others.the modifications allow more realistic training opportunities for aircraft utilizing the existing airburst range.that portion of the airburst moa that leads to the airburst range has a minimum altitude of above ground level the minimum altitude of the rest of airburst moa will remain the same as when it was the fremont moa,above ground level.
mtrs into,out of,and through other airspace modifications within the initiative address how aircraft are to get to and from the moas listed above.the previous mtrs had no minimum altitude restrictions.under the initiative,all mtrs will be raised to either feet or feet above ground level.a number of mtrs were narrowed by the faa as part of its environmental mitigation.
according to the faa,
t he remaining moa,la veta,is unchanged from its previous use,except the faa deleted a small portion for the benefit of the fremont county airport.although some of the initiative airspace is charted down to feet above ground level,that airspace will not be flown lower than feet above ground level expect sic in national emergencies or for special training requirements.
the ang issued its record of decision adopting the changes,identified as the preferred alternative in the final environmental impact statement,in october.in october,the faa issued a final order adopting the final environmental impact statement the ang prepared on the initiative,and directing that the requested special use airspace changes to the national airspace system identified as the preferred alternative in the final environmental impact statement be implemented.petitioners filed their joint petition for review of the ang and faa orders in november.
standard of review 
the administrative procedure act,governs our review of the ang and faa final decisions.see arapahoe county pub.airport auth.federal aviation,cir.we will set aside an agency decision if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a in determining whether an agency decision is arbitrary or capricious,we must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.this inquiry must be searching and careful,but the ultimate standard of review is a narrow one.marsh oregon natural res.council,d quotation marks and citation omitted.
the agencies findings of fact are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.c see also wyoming farm bureau fed babbitt,cir.the standard does not allow us to displace the agencies choice between two fairly conflicting views,even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo.arapahoe county pub.airport,at quoting wyoming farm bureau fed n,at.
we review petitioners constitutional claims de novo.see trimmer united states dep t of labor,cir.
petitioners raise an indiscriminate number of statutory and constitutional challenges to the ang and faa decisions approving the initiative.first,they claim the faa violated the federal aviation act,b a,faa regulations and the administrative procedure act 
by implementing the initiative a without determining whether the initiative is necessary in the interest of national defense b without record evidence to support such a conclusion c in the face of substantial evidence that the initiative is not necessary in the interest of national defense d without accurate information with which it could determine whether the ang has been using the minimum amount of airspace necessary and by unlawfully delegating its authority to set minimum altitudes of flight to the military.
second,petitioners claim the ang and faa violated the national environmental policy act,et,and its implementing regulations,
by adopting an environmental impact statement that a fails to adequately analyze the noise impacts of the initiative b omits analysis of the cumulative impacts of the initiative and other airspace use in the region c omits analysis of the impacts of military overflights on wilderness areas,proposed wilderness,national monuments,and proposed national parks d omits analysis of the nationwide impacts of military airspace proliferation e fails to accurately and adequately analyze socioeconomic and impacts and f fails to consider reasonable alternatives.
finally,petitioners argue the ang and faa violated the fifth amendment of the united states constitution by taking petitioners property interests without due process of law,and violated the third amendment by appropriating petitioners property interests and invading petitioners privacy for military purposes during peacetime without their consent.we address each claim in turn.
federal aviation act claims 
justiciability 
the faa asserts its decision the initiative is necessary in the interest of national defense,made in consultation with the department of defense,is not subject to judicial review,because it is a political question committed by the constitution to the legislative and executive branches of government.whether the political question doctrine restricts our review of this matter is a question of law we determine de novo.see adkins united states.
the political question doctrine employs separation of powers principles to restrict the justiciability of certain issues.see aktepe united states,cir,cert.denied,d.matters closely related to foreign policy and national security,for example,are rarely proper subjects for judicial intervention.haig agee,d.similarly,courts afford the political branches of government a particularly high degree of deference in the area of military affairs,because the constitution expressly confers authority over the military on the executive and legislative branches.aktepe,at citing const.art.i,cls.const.art.ii,clark widnall,cir.we do not hesitate,however,to review military action to determine whether military officials have acted within the scope of their powers,to determine whether military officials violated their own regulations,to evaluate the constitutionality of statutes pertaining to the military,or to evaluate the constitutionality of convictions and selective service induction procedures.clark,at see also mindes seaman,cir.
we recognize the action at issue here technically is not military action.the faa is a civilian agency.by statute,however,the faa is instructed to determine whether airspace is necessary to national defense in consultation with the defense department.b.under these circumstances,we believe the political question doctrine precludes us from or interfering with the faa decision the initiative is necessary to provide airspace for military training.see gilligan morgan,d holding issues of national guard training and weaponry are essentially professional military judgments within the constitutionally vested responsibility of the legislative and executive branches,and outside the courts competence.however,we are free to review whether,in making that decision,the faa acted within the scope of its powers,followed its own regulations,and complied with the constitution.clark,at.we proceed,then,to evaluate petitioners claims to the extent they raise issues within these permissible review parameters 
findings of necessity 
petitioners claim the faa violated the federal aviation act by failing to determine whether the initiative is necessary in the interest of national defense.petitioners are correct that b a directs the faa to establish airspace areas it deems necessary in the interest of national defense.however,they overlook the specific purpose for that determination as set forth in b b if,using available facilities,the administrator can not identify,locate,and control civil aircraft in those areas deemed necessary for national defense,the administrator shall restrict or prohibit civil aircraft flight in those areas by regulation or order.
as the faa points out,by definition,mtrs and moas do not restrict or prohibit civil aircraft access.see supra notes and accompanying text.arguably then,b a does not apply to the faa approval of modifications to mtr and moa airspace in colorado.however,even if b does apply to some portion of the initiative as approved by the faa,nothing in that statute mandates that the faa make an express finding of necessity.in the absence of a specific statutory directive,the law does not always require an agency to make formal findings.see citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d,abrogated on other grounds by califano sanders,d southwestern bell mobile,todd,cir finding no basis in language of telecommunications act to require formal findings of fact and conclusions of law from local zoning board at t wireless pcs,city of virginia beach,cir stating congress knows how to require formal findings when it so desires as evidenced by administrative procedure act and certain provisions of telecommunications act.moreover,the faa approval of the initiative does not constitute an agency rulemaking or adjudicative action for which the administrative procedure act requires formal findings.see a,a.most important,the record here amply demonstrates the faa did,in fact,believe the initiative to be necessary in the interest of national defense,and articulated the reasons why.petitioners arguments to the contrary simply are not supported by applicable law or the record.
limiting military airspace 
consistent with the purpose of the federal aviation act to encourage and allow maximum use of the navigable airspace by civil aircraft,b,the faa is instructed to minimize the amount of airspace designated as special use airspace and to limit military airspace to the area actually needed for training.see,faa order j stating that special use airspace designations shall be limited to the minimum number of areas necessary,and special use area activation shall be limited to the minimum area,altitude,and time required for the.petitioners argue the faa violated its own policy.they further assert the faa appears to have improperly delegated its authority to limit the amount of special use airspace to the military.the record belies these claims.
the record shows the faa reduced the special use airspace the ang initially requested.some reductions were incorporated at the faa request prior to the ang issuing its record of decision.others were incorporated as the faa formally reviewed the ang record of decision and national environmental policy act documents.the faa further restricted the hours military training could take place within the special use areas.this evidence that the faa independently reviewed and modified the initiative consistent with established faa policy to minimize the area,altitude and time allotted to military training defeats petitioners unsubstantial claims the agency violated that policy and improperly delegated its authority 
minimum flight altitudes 
minimum safe altitudes are established by regulation.the general flight rule regulation specifically proscribes the operation of aircraft closer than feet to any person,vessel,vehicle,or structure over open water or sparsely populated areas the operation of aircraft closer than feet above the surface in areas other than congested areas and the operation of aircraft below an altitude of feet above the highest obstacle within a horizontal radius of feet of the aircraft over any congested area of a city,town or settlement,or over any open air assembly of persons.b,c.the final environmental impact statement indicates low altitude airspace within the initiative will be charted to feet above ground level,but not flown lower than feet above ground level except in national emergencies or special training requirements.petitioners cite this statement as evidence the faa violated its own regulations by charting airspace below the minimum altitudes prescribed by.citing faa order j,petitioners further claim the faa has unlawfully delegated its power to define minimum safe altitudes to the military.neither claim withstands scrutiny.
first,as respondents correctly point out,does not set an absolute minimum altitude of feet.indeed,the regulation specifies no minimum altitude for flight over open water or sparsely populated areas so long as the aircraft is no closer than feet to any person,vessel,vehicle,or structure.c.most moas and mtrs are located in sparsely populated areas,thus allowing a military pilot to fly below an altitude of feet in a remote mtr or moa and still be within navigable airspace,under the conditions permitted by the regulation.
second,we agree with respondents this is not the appropriate time or place for petitioners to challenge the legality of faa order j,which addresses all special military operations,and is not specifically related to the faa approval of the initiative.we also agree with respondents that to the extent faa order j permits the military to establish appropriate altitudes,it does so under very narrow circumstances and does not constitute the wholesale abrogation of authority petitioners suggest.contrary to granting blanket permission to the military to disregard minimum safe altitude regulations,order j holds military pilots responsible for adhering to the provisions of when flying instrument rule ir and visual flight rule vfr routes.faa order j,c.only in the event of an aircraft systems failure may the military establish an altitude suitable for flight in instrument meteorological conditions the ifr altitude contrary to.faa order j.in no case will flight operations be conducted at altitudes less than those specified in minimum altitudes for ifr operations.id.these circumstances provide no basis for setting aside the faa decision approving the initiative.
finally,notwithstanding congress general intent that a civilian navigable airspace,see b,congress expressly gave the faa broad authority to grant exemptions from safety regulations,including minimum safe altitudes,when the administrator decides the exemption is in the public interest.b.petitioners have failed to show how the faa has exceeded that authority if indeed it has exempted the ang from the general minimum altitude requirements.
for all these reasons,within the limited permissible scope of appellate review,we conclude the faa has not violated the federal aviation act,faa regulations or the administrative procedure act by approving the initiative.
national environmental policy act claims 
as we have stated on numerous occasions,the national environmental policy act prescribes the necessary process by which agencies must take a hard look at the environmental consequences of proposed actions utilizing public comment and the best available scientific information it does not mandate particular results.colorado envtl.coalition dombeck,cir quotation marks and citations omitted holy cross wilderness fund madigan,cir.in other words,the national environmental policy act prohibits than action.colorado envtl.coalition,at quoting robertson methow valley citizens council,d.
petitioners national environmental policy act claims generally attack the adequacy of the final environmental impact statement,prepared by the ang and adopted by the faa consistent with the intended purpose of the act to prescribe a process by which agencies can make informed decisions,when we review the adequacy of a final environmental impact statement 
we merely examine whether there is a reasonable,good faith,objective presentation of the topics the national environmental policy act requires an environmental impact statement to cover.holy cross,at quotation marks and citation omitted.our objective is not to fly speck the environmental impact statement,but rather,to make a pragmatic judgment whether the environmental impact statement form,content and preparation foster both informed and informed public participation.oregon envtl.council kunzman,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.
colorado envtl.coalition,at.
impact analysis 
an environmental impact statement must analyze not only the direct impacts of a proposed action,but also the indirect and cumulative impacts of past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency federal or or person undertakes such other actions.id.at quoting see also including ecological,aesthetic,historical,cultural,economic,social and health impacts and a,c.petitioners claim the environmental impact statement studying the initiative failed to adequately address noise impacts the cumulative impacts of all military,foreign military and overflights impacts to existing and proposed wilderness areas and national parks the nationwide impacts of military aircraft operations and the socioeconomic impacts of overflights.we examine the merits of each of these claims,combining our discussion of the cumulative and nationwide impacts.
petitioners assert the ang employed a flawed methodology that resulted in severely understated noise impacts.they support this claim,in part,with a collection of comments from united states air force noise analyses unrelated to the initiative,including a environmental noise assessment for aircraft training routes and a december preliminary draft of a generic environmental impact statement for air force low altitude flying operations.
the administrative record establishes that the ang and faa performed a detailed analysis of the initiative potential noise impacts,using the onset rate adjusted monthly average sound level cumulative sound metric that accounts for the sound level,duration,and frequency of noise producing events,and is generally designed to determine the potential of noise to interfere with human activity.morongo band of mission indians federal aviation,cir.the agencies also employed the sound exposure level sel metric to represent the intensity and duration,sound impact of a specific noise event such as a single aircraft overflight.the final environmental impact statement illustrates that these particular methodologies are and widely accepted.
it is true,not all commenters agreed with the ang and faa methodology or conclusion the initiative would result in no significant noise impact.the final environmental impact statement considered these comments and incorporated them into the final analysis.for example,the agencies responded to concerns over using a decibel noise threshold in rural areas by lowering that threshold to decibels in certain areas and by expanding the noise criteria used to evaluate impacts in each affected area.the final environmental impact statement also included a discussion of the concept of natural quiet as a resource,additional information concerning the relative noise impacts in rural settings,and maps displaying noise contours for airspace impacted by the initiative.the conclusions reached in the final environmental impact statement are based on data gathered by,and the reasoned opinions of,recognized experts.as we have stated before,agencies are entitled to rely on their own experts so long as their decisions are not arbitrary and capricious.colorado envtl.coalition,at see also morongo band of mission indians,at city of bridgeton federal aviation,cir recognizing,in upholding faa noise methodology used to analyze impacts of proposed airport expansion,t he agency,not a reviewing court,is entrusted with the responsibility of considering the various modes of scientific evaluation and theory and choosing the one appropriate for the given circumstances quotation marks and citations omitted,cert.denied,d.
as so often is the case in disputes concerning the potential environmental impacts of a project,petitioners claim boils down to a disagreement over scientific opinions and conclusions.while we appreciate petitioners concerns over noise impacts,and do not ignore the fact contradictory evidence and data may well exist,the mere presence of contradictory evidence does not invalidate the a gencies actions or decisions.wyoming farm bureau fed n,at.we can not displace the agencies choice between two conflicting views,even if we would have made a different choice had the matter been before us de novo.arapahoe county pub.airport,at.petitioners technical objections do not demonstrate the ang and faa noise impact analysis was unsupported by substantial evidence in the administrative record,inadequate to foster informed public participation and,or otherwise arbitrary and capricious.nor do the objections support petitioners belated argument that a supplemental environmental impact statement is necessary.this claim therefore provides no basis for setting aside the final environmental impact statement.see city of bridgeton,at citing cases in which courts have upheld the faa discretion to choose its noise impact methodology.
petitioners further challenge the adequacy of the final environmental impact statement insofar as it addresses cumulative impacts.they argue the ang and faa failed to analyze all impacts of both military domestic and foreign and overflights in areas affected by the initiative.in addition,they claim the ang and faa were required to prepare a comprehensive,programmatic environmental impact statement to consider the impact of the nationwide proliferation of military airspace and military aircraft operations.
while we do not find the cumulative impact analysis to be a model of clarity or thoroughness,the final environmental impact statement does list anticipated sorties and time spent at each altitude band by the,and fighter wings,as well as other military aircraft apply the aircraft type and flying altitude data in evaluating the noise impacts and,perhaps most important,explain why the number of sorties are reasonably considered the key component of the cumulative impact analysis.the final environmental impact statement further explains how the noise prediction methodology accounts for both initiative activity and activity in each area likely to be affected by the activities in a particular moa or mtr,and how the agencies derived and applied a analysis based on the maximum number of aircraft operations within each region of influence.commercial and flight activity is neither related to nor dependent on the make no showing such activities,and thus any noise impacts from such activities,are likely to increase as a result of the initiative.as such,those activities need not be analyzed as direct or indirect cumulative impacts caused by the initiative.see allison department of,now,federal aviation,cir.as to the possible impact of more military pilots flying off course,pilot noncompliance or misconduct,it was noted recent compliance had been extremely good,and the agencies identified and implemented a mitigation measure to minimize any such impact.the national environmental policy act requires nothing more.see park county resource council united states dep t of,cir,overruled on other grounds by village of los ranchos de albuquerque marsh,cir.for these reasons,we hold the cumulative impact analysis in the present case is legally sufficient.kleppe sierra club,d determination of the extent and effect of cumulative impacts on range of resources,and particularly identification of the geographic area within which they may occur,is a task assigned to the special competency of the appropriate agencies.
we further hold the initiative is not a connected action,triggering the need for a programmatic or nationwide environmental impact analysis.put simply,projects that have independent utility are not connected actions under a iii.the administrative record makes clear the initiative has independent utility.the initiative was designed specifically to provide the necessary airspace for the tactical fighter wing of the colorado ang to be able to train with the fighter jet under realistic conditions,and to make changes in commercial aircraft arrival and departure corridors required for operation of the new denver international airport.the record gives no indication,and petitioners cite no evidence,of a clear nexus between the initiative and other military airspace proposals across the nation.in the absence of such evidence,it is neither unwise nor irrational to allow the initiative to go forward independent of other special use airspace designations or military flight training programs.see airport neighbors alliance,at holding no cumulative environmental impact statement was required where no inextricable nexus existed between runway upgrade and airport development master plan,and where proposed runway upgrade was independent from other master plan components see also morongo band of mission indians,at,explaining that an or overview environmental impact statement is useful when similar actions,viewed with other reasonably foreseeable or proposed agency actions,share common timing or geography.
wilderness areas,national monuments and national parks 
petitioners contend the ang and faa failed to adequately analyze the initiative impacts on the unique natural quiet,aesthetic,visual and recreational resources associated with certain wilderness areas,wilderness study areas and proposed national parks underlying or immediately adjacent to the initiative they support this claim with comments from the bureau of land management,department of interior and other agencies,expressing concern over potential impacts the initiative might have in these sensitive areas and criticizing the ang and faa for not fully analyzing those impacts.according to petitioners,by approving the initiative,the ang and faa have preemptively destroyed the wilderness qualities in these sensitive areas,and have further preempted the authority of congress and the president to designate additional sensitive areas as wilderness areas in the future.
we begin by noting that the national environmental policy act requires agencies preparing environmental impact statements to consider and respond to the comments of other agencies,not to agree with them.see citizens against burlington,busey.the administrative record demonstrates the ang and faa considered the concerns expressed by the public and other agencies regarding potential impacts on wilderness and other sensitive areas prior to concluding any such impacts would be negligible.it is certainly petitioners prerogative to disagree with that conclusion.however,their emotional assessment of the initiative probable impacts on wilderness areas,national monuments and national parks,the ability to designate and manage additional such areas in the future,does not support a national environmental policy act claim.
the national environmental policy act requires only that the agencies make a reasonable,good faith effort to analyze environmental impacts.the record in this case verifies that the agencies identified possible noise impacts on sensitive areas,including wilderness areas,parks and monuments,and reasonably determined,after considering public and agency comment alike,that any impact on these areas would be insignificant,because military training overflights took place in each of the affected airspaces before the initiative even with implementation of the initiative,none of the affected airspaces would experience cumulative noise levels greater than the db standard considered ideal by the environmental protection agency and the ang adopted specific measures,such as avoiding overflights of wilderness when possible and flying a minimum of feet above ground level,to mitigate any impact on sensitive areas.we therefore uphold the ang and faa environmental impact analysis as it pertains to wilderness areas,national monuments and national parks.
socioeconomic and growth 
petitioners argue the socioeconomic data in the final environmental impact statement is outdated and inaccurate,in violation of b,requiring agencies to insure the professional and scientific integrity of environmental information.they cite census data and eric nickell,the colorado airspace initiative and economic impacts on custer,huerfano and saguache counties,colorado,june,nickell study,as primary support for their contention the initiative socioeconomic impact will be much greater than that identified in the final environmental impact statement.
the final environmental impact statement was published in august.petitioners can hardly criticize that document for failing to utilize census data.they have neither argued nor shown the agencies must prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement based on updated census information.see colorado envtl.coalition,at explaining the national environmental policy act does not require a supplemental environmental impact statement every time new information comes to light.a supplemental environmental impact statement comes into play only if the new information is sufficient to show the proposed action will affect the quality of the human environment in a significant manner or to a significant extent not already considered.quotation marks and citations omitted.moreover,the record reveals that both the ang and the air force reviewed the nickell study,but discounted it as unreliable.the agencies instead relied on the previously described noise impact analysis impacts on residential and recreational land use relevant population,housing,employment and earnings data and comparative residential valuation data and tourism earnings data in each region of influence.the ang and faa are entitled to rely on their own experts so long as their decision was not arbitrary and capricious.wyoming farm bureau fed n,at.to repeat,the mere presence of contradictory evidence does not invalidate the a gencies actions or decisions,and we will not displace the ang and faa choice between conflicting views,arapahoe county pub.airport,at.
we recognize petitioners do not agree with the agencies conclusions concerning the initiative potential socioeconomic impacts.however,the agencies socioeconomic impact analysis is supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record,and was adequate to foster informed public participation and.the socioeconomic impact analysis is neither arbitrary nor capricious.
reasonable alternatives 
petitioners claim the alternatives analysis in the final environmental impact statement fails in two ways.first,they argue the final environmental impact statement does not include a true alternative and second,they argue the final environmental impact statement does not consider other reasonable alternatives.
to comply with the national environmental policy act and its implementing regulations,the ang and faa are required to rigorously explore all reasonable alternatives to the initiative,including a alternative,in comparative form,and give each alternative substantial treatment in the environmental impact statement.see,d c iii e colorado envtl.coalition,at.the national environmental policy act does not,however,require agencies to analyze the environmental consequences of alternatives it has in good faith rejected as too remote,speculative,or impractical or ineffective.what is required is information sufficient to permit a reasoned choice of alternatives as far as environmental aspects are concerned.colorado envtl.coalition,at quotation marks and citations omitted.we employ the rule of reason to ensure the ang final environmental impact statement contains sufficient discussion of the relevant issues and opposing viewpoints to enable both the ang and faa to take a hard look at the environmental impacts of the initiative and its alternatives,and to make a reasoned decision.id.the rule of reason guides both the choice of alternatives as well as the extent to which the environmental impact statement must discuss each alternative.american rivers federal energy reg.comm n,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.
as to the adequacy of the alternative,petitioners claim the ang has been unlawfully and increasingly undertaking major federal action that has never been properly subject to environmental review since it began overflights in colorado decades ago.according to petitioners,the ang and faa inappropriately included this unlawful activity in their assessment of the military current airspace use,and that a true alternative may only reflect the impacts of lawful activity.they further criticize the sortie count data in the alternative,claiming it to be far in excess of any studied or anticipated in any previous environmental analysis.petitioners cite no applicable legal or factual authority for these propositions,and apparently misunderstand the intended scope and purpose of a alternative.
in requiring consideration of a alternative,the council on environmental quality intended that agencies compare the potential impacts of the proposed major federal action to the known impacts of maintaining the status quo.see association of pub.agency customers,bonneville power,cir.at.in other words,the current level of activity is used as a benchmark.at.this is exactly what the ang and faa did.the final environmental impact statement demonstrates the ang and faa compared the impacts of the original proposal and preferred alternative to the impacts of continuing to fly in the existing mtrs and moas.this is all the law requires.the requirement to consider a alternative does not provide petitioners a vehicle in which to pursue allegations that past ang or faa actions received insufficient environmental analysis.the time has passed to challenge past actions 
turning to the adequacy of the range of alternatives considered,petitioners claim unstudied increases in military airspace use over the last two decades preempted consideration of other objectively reasonable alternatives the three alternatives considered were nearly identical,thus rendering the analysis legally inadequate and the faa inappropriately committed resources,and thereby prejudiced the selection of alternatives,before making a final decision.these claims,too,are easily dismissed.
petitioners claim that unstudied and therefore unlawful increases in military airspace use over the last two decades precluded any rigorous analysis of reduced military use alternatives is really another attempt to challenge the legality of past actions.as stated above,the time has passed for such claims.
the final environmental impact statement identifies seven alternatives the agencies considered the original proposal the preferred alternative the alternative the use of other moas and mtrs the elimination of the colorado air national guard the elimination of existing military airspace in colorado and the use of aircraft flight simulators.applying the rule of reason to the question of whether this was a sufficiently range of alternatives for consideration,we look first to the intended purpose of the proposed action.see colorado envtl.coalition,at.the primary purpose of the initiative is to develop adequate training opportunities for colorado ang pilots within the distance limitations specified by the united states air force training standards.the final environmental impact statement specifically discusses the training criteria against which each alternative was evaluated,and then explains,in some detail,that alternatives four through seven were eliminated from further detailed consideration after preparation of the draft environmental impact statement because none allowed military flying units to meet their total training requirements,satisfy the very purpose of the initiative.the three remaining alternatives,which reflect various military airspace configurations and usage within applicable training criteria parameters,are evaluated and compared throughout the final environmental impact statement.
the national environmental policy act requires only that reasonable alternatives be evaluated.c iii and e,a.alternatives that do not accomplish the purpose of an action are not reasonable.colorado envtl.coalition,at see also city of bridgeton,at.petitioners have put forth no record evidence disputing the existence or reasonableness of the united states air force training criteria,including the training distance limitations,as applied to the colorado ang nor have they identified an alternative the ang and faa failed to consider which satisfies these criteria.because the administrative record demonstrates the ang and faa defined the objectives of the initiative,identified alternatives that would accomplish those objectives,and took a hard,comparative look at the environmental impacts associated with each reasonable alternative,petitioners challenge to the adequacy of the alternatives analysis fails.
finally,petitioners claim that the faa implemented the initiative prior to adopting and approving the final environmental impact statement is not supported by the record.the faa documents petitioners cite as evidence the faa implemented the initiative prior to issuing the record of decision,make clear no final action would take place on mtr modifications until any changes dictated by the environmental division environmental review can be addressed as a complete package,and the effective date for the proposed moa modifications would coincide with the final approval of the proposed mtr modifications.
for all these reasons,we conclude the final environmental impact statement prepared by the ang and adopted by the faa satisfies national environmental policy act standards.
constitutional claims 
fifth amendment 
petitioners ask this court to enjoin implementation of the initiative,claiming it results in an unauthorized taking of private property without due process or the prospect of compensation.according to petitioners,the approved use of the airspace above their properties is unauthori
