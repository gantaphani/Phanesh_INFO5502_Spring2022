this dispute presents an issue of apparent first impression regarding the federal comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla.the defendant,a landowner,paid a general contractor for costs associated with the cleanup of a contaminated parcel of land that the defendant owned.the general contractor failed,however,to remit those payments to the plaintiff,a subcontractor who had performed work on the site.the plaintiff then sought payment directly from the defendant landowner.the sole question presented on appeal is whether cercla grants the subcontractor a right of recovery against the landowner in these circumstances,effectively requiring the landowner to pay twice for the same work performed once to the contractor and once to the subcontractor.we conclude that it does not.accordingly,we reverse the district court grant of partial summary judgment to the plaintiff subcontractor and remand the case with instructions to grant summary judgment in favor of the defendant.
background 
the principal facts underlying this lawsuit are undisputed.at all relevant times,the defendant norampac industries,owned a parcel of land in erie county,new york.after norampac discovered that soil at the site contained levels of lead and other contaminants that exceeded maximums set by the new york state department of environmental conservation dec,the company entered into a brownfield cleanup agreement with the.the agreement required norampac to prepare and submit a plan for investigating and remedying the soil contamination.
in october,pursuant to its cleanup obligations under the agreement,norampac contracted with aaa environmental,a contractor located in upstate new york,to perform remedial work,including the excavation and removal of contaminated soil.the contract required that norampac make progress payments to aaa environmental at regular intervals based on the amount of work completed.the agreement between norampac and aaa environmental required the contractor to furnish performance and payment bonds in amounts equal to the total contract price,but these requirements were waived in a contract addendum.
in december,aaa environmental subcontracted with price trucking to transport from the site and dispose of the contaminated soil.throughout the following year,price trucking hauled the soil to licensed disposal facilities.
aaa environmental initially paid price for this service,but on or about october,the payments stopped.once aaa environmental refused to pay outstanding invoices,price trucking stopped working on the project,insisting that norampac first agree to pay price trucking directly for its portion of all subsequent services performed.norampac agreed to this arrangement,and made direct payments to price for the final stages of its work.
as of september,the parties had substantially finished work on the site,and the dec subsequently certified completion.by that time,norampac had paid aaa environmental more than million for services related to the cleanup effort,in addition to the payments that norampac had made directly to price trucking pursuant to the arrangement noted above.but price was unable to recover the balance of the payments due to it from aaa environmental.other subcontractors who worked on the site also complained that they had not been paid in full.the parties agree that price completed its work in compliance with the agreement,the contract between norampac and aaa,the subcontract between aaa and price,and all applicable laws and regulations,and that price received no objections from aaa environmental,norampac,or the dec regarding its work.
on november,price trucking instituted this lawsuit against norampac in the united states district court for the western district of new york,seeking in unpaid bills for its work regarding the site.price sole theory of recovery in this action was premised on cercla liability provision,codified at,the relevant provisions of which are discussed below.
on march,price moved for partial summary judgment against norampac on the issue of liability.norampac for summary judgment and an order dismissing the lawsuit.on june,magistrate judge hugh scott recommended that the district court rule in favor of price trucking on both motions.price trucking norampac,cv,wl,dist.lexis june.district judge richard arcara subsequently adopted the findings and recommendations,found in favor of price on the issue of liability,and scheduled a trial to assess damages.price trucking norampac,cv,wl,dist.lexis.
instead of litigating the issue of damages,the parties stipulated that if there were liability,the damages were equal to the outstanding sum owed to price trucking,plus interest.this amount is less than that stated in the complaint,reflecting,among other things,amounts recovered by price trucking in one of two related state court lawsuits,although the suits were pending at the time this appeal was brought.
in the first such action,price trucking sought to foreclose on a mechanic lien imposed on norampac real property.see second am.verified compl.supplemental summons,price trucking norampac.erie cnty,now consolidated in case.in the same action,price trucking brought claims against aaa environmental and its owner on theories of,inter alia,breach of contract,quantum meruit,unjust enrichment,and breach of trust.id.it appears that price trucking has so far been unable to recover from aaa directly norampac has asserted that aaa is out of business.but price trucking did recover plus interest from norampac on its lienforeclosure claim 
price trucking also brought a action against first niagara bank,one of aaa creditors,on behalf of itself and other similarly situated subcontractors.see price trucking aaa,dep t.the complaint asserted that aaa environmental had maintained a line of credit with niagara,the terms of which allowed the bank automatically to debit aaa operational account on a nightly basis to reduce any amounts owed under the line of credit.id.price trucking and its argued that this arrangement violated new york lien law by effectively diverting assets that should have been held in statutory trust for the subcontractors.id.the trial court found in price favor.but on november,the appellate division ruled for niagara and modified the supreme court order accordingly.id.at,at.
in light of the pendency of the state proceedings,the parties prepared a consent order setting out the amount that would be the subject of this appeal and providing that any additional amounts recovered in state court would further reduce the amount of the federal claim.the district court adopted this order,and,on june,entered final judgment in favor of price trucking.

discussion 
the sole question presented by this appeal is whether cercla creates direct liability between owners and subcontractors with respect to cleanup on a cercla site when the owner has paid a general contractor in full for the subcontractor work.the district court concluded that cercla does impose such liability.for the reasons stated below,we disagree.
we review a district decision grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and drawing all inferences and resolving all ambiguities in its favor.cilp,pricewaterhouse coopers llp,cir internal quotation marks omitted.specifically,where the district disposition presents only a legal issue of statutory interpretation,we review de novo whether the district court correctly interpreted the statute.city of syracuse onondaga,cir internal quotation marks,ellipsis,and brackets omitted accord new york next millenium realty,llc,cir stating that the interpretation of cercla is a question of law that we review de novo.
cercla primary purposes are axiomatic to encourage the timely cleanup of hazardous waste sites and to place the cost of that cleanup on those responsible for creating or maintaining the hazardous condition.grace.zotos,cir internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.in furtherance of these purposes,the statute imposes strict liability on owners and facility operators,on persons who arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous waste at the relevant site,and on persons who transported hazardous waste to the site.see a marsh rosenbloom,cir cercla looks backward in time and imposes liability new york shore realty,cir noting that the statute imposes liability on identified persons regardless of whether they caused the release of hazardous substances.
cercla imposes liability for response costs incurred both by the government and by private parties.a a b marsh,at.with respect to costs incurred by private parties,the statute provides that the responsible parties are liable for any necessary costs of response incurred by any person consistent with the national contingency plan.a b.this liability exists n otwithstanding any other provision or rule of law,id.a,and is subject to only a limited set of statutory defenses,id.b,not relevant here.
to make out a prima facie case for liability under the act,a plaintiff must establish that the defendant is an owner or is otherwise liable under a the site is a facility as defined by there has been a release or threatened release of hazardous substances at the facility the plaintiff incurred costs responding to the release or the threat and the costs and response conform to the national contingency plan.prisco v.a d carting,cir goodrich murtha,cir.for the purposes of a b,which underlies the present claim,the plaintiff must also show that the costs incurred were necessary.grace,at.
the parties have stipulated for the purposes of this litigation that norampac owned the site at issue,that the site was a facility within the meaning of the statute,and that there were releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at the site.we also assume without deciding that price trucking actions were consistent with the national contingency plan finally,norampac does not contest that price trucking incurred certain costs in relation to the cleanup effort,although it denies that these are response costs within the meaning of the act.
there is no serious question as to whether the cost of removing contaminated soil constituted response costs within the meaning of cercla the issue here is when and how liability for such costs is discharged by the owner of the site in question.norampac contends that cercla liability is satisfied when the response is complete and when the landowner has made its payments pursuant to the applicable contracts entered into to effect the cleanup.in price trucking contrary view,liability on the part of the landowner persists until all parties who contributed to a cleanup operation are made whole for all costs of their work.
the parties phrase their arguments in terms of whether the payments demanded by price from norampac constitute necessary costs of response.but,in simple terms,the issue in this case is not whether cercla requires norampac to pay for the cleanup.the sole question is whether under the circumstances presented here cercla also requires norampac to ensure that price is made whole for its work 
ii.analysis 
although cercla defines response to encompass a range of activities,it does not define the term response costs.see gussack realty xerox,cir per curiam.nor does the statute specify how an owner may discharge its liability for such costs.
the statute provides that the term liability shall be construed to be the standard of liability which obtains under section of the federal water pollution control act.but this has been read,correctly we think,to mean no more than that cercla,like the fwpca,is a strict liability statute.town of munster,sherwin williams cir see also shore realty,at noting that courts have construed the statute reference to the clean water act to impose strict liability.and,in any case,determining the standard of liability is of little assistance in deciding the extent of a party liability,which is the relevant question here.united states chem dyne,concluding that cercla was clear as to its standard of liability,but ambiguous with respect to the scope of liability,whether liability is joint and several.
even bearing in mind that response costs are liberally construed under cercla,grace,at,we find nothing on the face of the statute that compels either the conclusion that,in the circumstances presented here,liability has been discharged,as norampac argues,or that it persists,as price trucking contends.
purpose of the liability provision 
congress passes legislation with specific purposes in mind.when the ordinary tools of statutory construction permit us to do so,we must attempt to discover those purposes from the text,structure and history of the acts in question.health hosps.perales,cir,cert.denied,d accord internal revenue serv.worldcom,cir.this court has long understood that congress enacted cercla with the expansive,remedial purpose of ensuring that those responsible for any damage,environmental harm,or injury from chemical poisons bear the costs of their actions.schiavone pearce,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also grace,at a primary purpose of cercla is to place the cost of cleanup on those responsible for creating or maintaining a hazardous environmental condition internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.
cercla accomplishes that purpose in two relevant ways.first,it imposes liability on a range of persons,including not only the property owner who might have been responsible for environmental damage,but other owners,operators,arrangers,or transporters.a goodrich,at see,at noting the need for legislation to address those situations where an owner is unknown or is unable to pay the cleanup costs second,the statute adopts a strict liability regime similar to the common law of activities,without regard to fault or negligence.niagara mohawk power chevron,cir,at see also richard stewart bradley campbell,lessons from parent liability under cercla,nat.resources env t,winter,at,explaining the ways in which this aspect of cercla deviates from tort liability.cercla thus operates to establish liability on the part of a potentially large group of landowners,facility operators,intermediaries,and transporters.
by clearing the path to liability of any obstacles or inconsistences imposed by varying state laws,cercla encourage s private parties to assume the financial responsibility of cleanup by allowing them to seek recovery from others.key tronic united states,d quoting fmc aero,cir accord grace,at see also,at stating that cercla is intended to induce potentially liable persons to voluntarily mitigate damages rather than simply rely on the government to abate hazards.but while cercla obviously is designed to facilitate cost recovery,it does so through the assignment of liability and the clarification of the relevant standards it does not provide for cost recovery in all cases and in all circumstances 
and if the function of cercla will facilitate cost recovery by private parties in most cases,it need not and does not do so in every case.in the typical private action,an injured landowner undertakes a cleanup effort and then brings suit against a responsible facility owner or operator under cercla.by holding the defendant liable in such a case,cercla ensures that defendant owners and operators bear the cost of their actions.schiavone,at internal quotation marks omitted.but the case before us is hardly typical.norampac has undisputedly accepted responsibility for the cleanup,has seen that the operation is completed,and has shouldered the costs of removing contaminated soil through its payments to aaa environmental and direct payments to price trucking.stipulation of facts,at.in other words,norampac has already borne the cost of its actions.in seeking to treat norampac as though it were a surety to its subcontract with aaa environmental,price trucking pushes the terms of cercla beyond their intended assignment of responsibilities.
cercla purposes are served when landowners and others who profit from hazardous activities are made to bear the costs of accidents on their land.see,commander oil barlo equip,cir.noting congress reference in crafting cercla to the underlying fairness of imposing on the beneficiaries of an activity the ultimate costs of that activity,cert.denied,d,at strict liab
