plaintiffs filed suit against john stasko and anthony leger,in their capacities as officials of the united states fish and wildlife service fws.they sought judicial review of fws actions in connection with a proposed land transaction between fws,the city of virginia beach,virginia,and lotus creek associates,a private developer.fws wanted to acquire the lands in order to protect sensitive wetlands and wildlife habitat.
the district court dismissed the case for lack of article iii standing.because none of the plaintiffs have constitutional standing to bring this suit against fws,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the friends for ferrell parkway,llc,randolph zehmer,a resident of sandbridge,virginia,andrea kilmer,a resident of lago mar,virginia,mario rosales,a resident of red mill farm,virginia,and jack davey,a resident of lotus creek,virginia collectively plaintiffs,filed suit against john stasko and anthony leger of fws.stasko is refuge manager of the back bay national wildlife refuge,and leger is refuge chief of the national wildlife system.plaintiffs sought to enjoin a proposed land transaction between fws,the city of virginia beach,virginia the city,and lotus creek associates,a private developer lotus.plaintiffs complaint focused on fws anticipated acquisition of two pieces of property.the first was a right of way owned by the city known as ferrell vii.the right of way was previously designated for construction of ferrell parkway,a road that would bypass certain subdivisions and present straighter access to sandbridge,a resort area on the ocean.the second was a piece of property owned by lotus known as phases ii and iii of lotus creek,located adjacent to the back bay national wildlife refuge refuge and south of ferrell vii.
under the terms of the land transaction,fws agreed to buy phases ii and iii of lotus creek from lotus for inclusion in the refuge in exchange for the city agreeing to sell fws the ferrell vii right of way.the city council deemed preserving both parcels to be a necessary environmental protection measure,and abandoned proposed plans both to construct ferrell parkway and to allow development of lotus creek.in particular,the city council concluded that the protection of both parcels in a natural state was necessary to help mitigate natural and human threats to the black gut natural heritage area and its respective habitats,thereby reducing natural habitat destruction and loss,and to help reduce nonpoint source pollution loadings to the back bay watershed.in addition,the city and fws agreed that the city would acquire fws lands bordering sandbridge road for the purpose of future road improvements by the city.
plaintiffs complaint alleged that fws proposed acquisition of ferrell vii harmed them by not providing the benefits that the construction of ferrell parkway would purportedly generate.these benefits included providing sandbridge residents with an emergency exit,and providing residents of lago mar,red mill farm,and lotus creek with a route for through traffic to and from sandbridge.such a route would allegedly prevent traffic from flowing through their residential streets.
plaintiffs sought judicial review under the administrative procedure act,et.they asserted that fws was acting in violation of a variety of federal statutes and regulations,including the national environmental policy act nepa,et,in seeking to acquire the ferrell vii right of way.plaintiffs sought to enjoin on a preliminary and permanent basis the proposed land acquisition.
plaintiffs amended complaint alleged that the sale of phases ii and iii of lotus creek to fws would injure plaintiff davey because the loss of that portion of lotus creek would make it impossible for the lotus creek condominium community to function as intended.plaintiffs further amended their complaint to allege that phases ii and iii lied outside the acquisition boundaries of the wildlife refuge,and that fws actions in acquiring lotus creek constituted impermissible local land use planning.
on may,the district court dismissed plaintiffs case for want of standing.applying the standing requirements of lujan defenders of wildlife,d,the court found that plaintiffs purported injuries were merely conjectural and hypothetical for many reasons.first,access to sandbridge beach via sandbridge road continued to exist.further,plaintiffs were not prohibited from obtaining better access to sandbridge beach,for the city planned to improve sandbridge road with land gained from the transaction with fws.in addition,roads through a nearby military installation were opened in an emergency to provide access.moreover,plaintiffs had no right under virginia law to have a roadway constructed.see ann.michie supp.and finally,plaintiffs traffic flow concerns were highly speculative because there was no guarantee the city would build ferrell parkway even if it decided not to sell ferrell vii.
the court next turned to plaintiff davey claim that he was injured because his opportunity to see lotus creek developed would be destroyed if the transaction were completed.the court thought it significant that there would then be no future residents of phases ii and iii with whom he could share the costs of providing services to his community.but it held that he could not establish causation or redressability because his injury by deciding to sell the land.thus,no relief granted against fws would guarantee that the property would be developed.plaintiffs appeal.
article iii,section of the constitution restricts the federal courts to deciding actual cases and controversies.among t he several doctrines that have grown up to elaborate that requirement,the one that requires a litigant to have standing to invoke the power of a federal court is perhaps the most important.allen wright,d.the basic purpose of standing doctrine is to ensure that the plaintiff has a sufficient personal stake in the outcome of a dispute to render judicial resolution of it appropriate in a society that takes seriously both the idea of separation of powers and,more fundamentally,the system of democratic that such separation serves.id.at.the doctrine encompasses both prudential,judicially limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction,and a core component derived directly from the constitution.id.at.see also defenders of wildlife,at.
in order to satisfy article iii standing requirements,the plaintiff must show that he has suffered an injury in fact the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d see also defenders of wildlife,at.allen,at.the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing injury,traceability,and redressability because it is the party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction.defenders of wildlife,at,dallas,d.
in addition,an association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when its members would otherwise have standing to sue as individuals the interests at stake are germane to the group purpose and neither the claim made nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the suit.laidlaw,at.hunt.state apple adver.comm n,d.only the first prong of associational standing is in contention here insofar as plaintiff the friends for ferrell parkway is concerned.
as we have previously recognized,the element requires that the plaintiff suffer an invasion of a legally protected interest which is concrete and particularized,as well as actual or imminent.friends of the earth,gaston copper recycling,cir en banc citing defenders of wildlife,at.the alleged injury must not be conjectural or hypothetical.laidlaw,at.defenders of wildlife,at.internal quotations omitted.the traceability requirement ensures that it is likely the plaintiff injury was caused by the challenged conduct of the defendant,and not by the independent actions of third parties not before the court.gaston copper,at citing defenders of wildlife,at.and the redressability prong requires that it be likely,and not merely speculative,that a favorable decision from the court will remedy the plaintiff injury.id.citing defenders of wildlife,at.
although each of these three requirements of standing are analytically distinct and must be treated as such,their proof often overlaps.gaston copper,at.and as we will now show,so too can their absence of proof.
in contending that they meet the requirement,plaintiffs initially describe their alleged injuries as follows in their brief before this court 
fws acquisition of ferrell will commit the plaintiffs to a diminished quality of life,with more noise,traffic,auto noise and fumes.they will have less emergency access,both in and out,and worsened opportunity to visit friends and other parts of virginia beach.local streets will be less safe.even if the friends for ferrell have no property interest of any kind in ferrell,or in the completion of lotus creek as originally envisioned,they have a liberty interest in access to their community,and in continuation of their community,which can not be destroyed without due process.
here,plaintiffs characterize their purported injuries as residing in the deleterious effects they believe fws acquisition of ferrell vii will impart through precluding construction of ferrell parkway.
and yet immediately following this description of their claimed injuries,plaintiffs recharacterize them as follows 
to put it another way,before the transaction the friends for ferrell had the opportunity to lobby for construction of ferrell,a needed roadway with much long time and current support.the friends for ferrell also had the opportunity to see lotus creek developed as planned.before fws actions,lotus creek was planned to be a condominium community with private amenities.fws illegally seeks to eliminate those opportunities and reduce lotus creek to a small number of homes with limited opportunities.
here,plaintiffs do not put it another way.rather,they reconceptualize their stated injuries from the effects of the absence of development to the loss of their opportunity to prevent those effects.this is a significant move,for a central problem in standing doctrine is how to characterize the relevant injury.cass sunstein,standing and the privatization of public law,colum,see also richard fallon et,hart and wechsler the federal courts and the federal system,ed.reformulating the proffered injury as a lost opportunity can have significant consequences for the entire standing inquiry.see sunstein,supra,at discussing the effect on the causation and redressability analyses of recharacterizing the injury as the deprivation of an opportunity fallon et,supra,at,same.in this case,however,it ultimately makes no difference how plaintiffs conceptualize their alleged injuries,as we demonstrate by applying standing doctrine to each characterization in turn.
to begin with,it is not at all clear that what plaintiffs call their liberty interest in access to their community,and in continuation of their community is a legally protected interest.defenders of wildlife,at.as the district court found,the proposed sale of ferrell vii by the city to fws impacts none of plaintiffs rights because under virginia law they have no entitlement to the construction of a roadway.rather,the city has plenary power to determine how its roadways will be planned and constructed.see ann.
but even assuming that a legally cognizable injury is implicated in this case,the effects plaintiffs posit that fws purchase of ferrell vii would have on that interest are wholly speculative.as the district court observed,plaintiffs are not deprived of access to sandbridge beach by the purchase because access via sandbridge road continues to exist.in addition,plaintiffs are not prohibited from obtaining improved access to sandbridge beach.indeed,the city contemplates making improvements to sandbridge road with property it would gain through the proposed land transaction with fws.further,emergency access to and from sandbridge beach is not prevented via sandbridge road,and roadways through the military installation next to sandbridge are opened in an emergency.moreover,plaintiffs may request that the city take action to address traffic concerns in their neighborhoods.
finally,the allegations of increased traffic flow,auto noise and auto fume problems due to the city failure to build the parkway are highly speculative because there is no reason to have any confidence that the city would build ferrell parkway if it decided not to sell ferrell vii to fws.kilmer,the only plaintiff to testify concerning the construction of ferrell parkway,conceded that there had been no funding earmarked for its construction since,and that the city had abandoned plans to construct it.kilmer stated only that she hoped the parkway would be constructed some day while she still lived in a nearby neighborhood.indeed,she was not sure when the preceding phase of the parkway was going to be built.she also agreed with the district court that she lived pretty far away from the neighborhood traffic problems about which plaintiffs complain.she further acknowledged that the major impact on her from future traffic problems in her neighborhood was a proposed new development nearby.moreover,she did not anticipate that those problems would materialize for years,and she admitted that it could take significantly longer.finally,she confessed that the present traffic conditions on the road that she believed would become problematic for her were currently minimal.
under these circumstances,plaintiffs can not satisfy the requirement that the injury in fact be actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.laidlaw,at.defenders of wildlife,at.internal quotations omitted.the purpose of the imminence requirement is to ensure that the alleged injury is not too speculative for article iii purposes.defenders of wildlife,at.it is pure conjecture to believe that,absent the sale of ferrell vii to fws,ferrell parkway would be built anytime in the near future.as the supreme court has held,s uch some day any description of concrete plans,or indeed even any specification of when the some day will not support a finding of the actual or imminent injury required to establish standing.id.at.the prong of the standing inquiry can not be met by citizens hypothesizing about the speculative effects of an absence of development.
plaintiff davey allegation that he would be injured by fws possible acquisition of phases ii and iii of lotus creek presents a closer case.he claims that if the proposed transaction were completed,he would be unable to share the costs of providing services and private amenities to his community with future residents of phases ii and iii.according to davey,lotus had told him at the time he purchased his lot in phase i that he would be able to share these costs with all future residents of phases i,ii,and iii.now that lotus intends to sell phases ii and iii to fws,only the houses in phase i that have been platted and recorded in the deed books can be constructed in lotus creek.thus,davey can share costs with only the current and future residents of those houses.it was in view of these considerations that the district court found him to have an interest in having others share the costs of providing services and amenities to lotus creek.
however,fws points out that lotus creek has never been formally approved for development beyond home sites,and that phases ii and iii are wholly undeveloped land.in addition,davey admitted almost two years after he bought his property that only one additional house had been built to supplement the six that were there when he arrived in.
the district court confirmed that there have been no improvements on any portion of lotus creek except for the lots in phase i,and that only those lots have been legally platted or subdivided.in addition,the court found that,prior to the recordation of a subdivision plat,city and state ordinances require that either the improvements be completed and accepted by the city and state,or an appropriate bond be posted to assure completion of the improvements in accordance with municipal and state standards.the court observed that lotus may never actually construct the utilities and street
