plaintiffs harold cox et filed suit against defendant city of dallas,texas and defendant jeffrey saitas,executive director of the texas natural resource conservation commission,alleging violations of the resource conservation and recovery act,et.the city appeals from the district court judgment granting plaintiffs injunctive relief under a b.plaintiffs appeal from the district court judgment denying injunctive relief against saitas.for the following reasons,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
this case involves two consolidated citizen suits brought pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act rcra,et,concerning two open garbage dumps in dallas,lot located at deepwood street the deepwood dump and an adjacent lot the south loop dump 
zoned for residential use,the deepwood and south loop dumps have been used for sand and gravel mining and illegal dumping for over years.substantial deposits of uncovered solid waste,including household waste,tires,demolition debris,insulation,asphalt shingles,abandoned automobiles,jugs and bottles labeled sulfuric acid and nitric acid,drums,and syringes,are on the properties the dumps adjoin residential neighborhoods and a tributary to the trinity river and are partially in the flood plain of the trinity river.neither dump has been upgraded or closed according to sanitary landfill criteria.see a.residents adjacent to the dumps report the appearance of snakes and rats in their backyards since the beginning of the illegal dumping,and the dumps are easily accessible to children in the neighborhood since at least,the state of texas and the city of dallas,texas the city have been aware of open dumping on both sites.
history of the deepwood dump 
in august,officials from the texas natural resource conservation commission the tnrcc and the city sanitation department visited the deepwood dump and prepared a report that called for continuing surveillance of the site.in,the city conducted soil and water tests at the deepwood dump in response to complaints from nearby residents that illegal dumping was taking place.the city report and test results,which made clear that the deepwood dump was being used for the disposal of solid waste,were sent to the state for analysis.
in,the city filed suit in state court against the owners of the deepwood dump for dumping solid waste without a state permit and joined the tnrcc as a necessary party.in december,the state court entered a final judgment,requiring the deepwood dump owners to submit and implement a plan for closure of the site.an april inspection revealed that the deepwood dump had not been cleaned up or closed,and the city filed a contempt motion.this motion was not heard by the state court,and no further action was taken by the state or the city to enforce the judgment.
during this time,the city contracted with billy nabors and dallas demolition excavating dallas demolition to conduct demolitions of city property.these city contractors disposed of their debris at the deepwood dump.the city contracts with dallas demolition did not specify that waste materials generated by city activities must be properly disposed of in a legal landfill.the city was aware that dallas demolition dumped at the deepwood dump.however,even after the city attorneys had learned of dallas demolition illegal acts,the city continued to use dallas demolition.
also,the city designed and implemented a plan to reclaim the area from the flood plain by depositing fill material in the low spots.the plan objective was to collect more tax revenue from the area by eventually rezoning it for industrial purposes.in,terry van sickle began operating the deepwood dump with land use and fill permits issued by the city.van sickle overtly stated his intention to dump solid waste at the deepwood dump when he submitted his application to the city fill old pits with solid waste means all putrescible and non putrescible discarded materials or unwanted rock,dirt,metal,sand gravel wood sic.the city subsequently issued a permit based on this application.while this certificate stated that the use was to be for the mining of sand and gravel,it did not specifically restrict the types of fill material.furthermore,the city public works department later granted van sickle p ermission to fill the mined areas.this grant also did not restrict the types of fill material,although van sickle had made his intentions clear regarding the solid waste fill he wished to employ in the dump.in its own documents,the city admits that control at the site s has been loose and in a few cases improper material has been used for fill and some approved flood plain areas have had large amounts of decomposable material placed in them.
at a board of adjustment hearing,the city considered the impact of operations at the deepwood dump on the community.although residents adjacent to the dump provided information about the illegal dumping and the hazards at the dump and requested that the board put an end to the use of the dump,the board did not act to terminate the dumping.plaintiffs contend that it was in the city interest to continue the filling of the land because it would further the city plan of elevating the area,thus reclaiming it from the flood plain which would then permit the city to rezone the land for industrial use,making the area more financially profitable for the city.until the district court injunction,the city had never revoked the permit for the deepwood site.
herman nethery,the current owner of the deepwood dump,operated an illegal open dump at the deepwood site from through.the state inspected the deepwood dump several times from to and discovered massive illegal dumping,including asbestos,benzene,and medical waste the state also noted in its own reports that there was an imminent threat of the discharge of municipal solid waste into elam creek,a tributary of the trinity river,because of the concentrated dumping.in addition,the state observed that shingles and construction and demolition debris at the dump may cause contamination of surface and ground water through the leaching of contaminates from the debris by rainwater.for several months during and during,the deepwood dump caught fire and burned,and a significant fire hazard still exists at the site.
despite this history,in august,the city granted nethery a permit allowing mining use of the deepwood dump.the city failed to follow its own procedures of issuing permits no inspection was conducted prior to the issuance of the permit,and no test zone was established around the areas where illegal solid waste had been deposited.
in,the city filed suit against nethery in state court alleging violations of the texas solid waste disposal act the tswda,and the state intervened.the state court entered judgment against nethery for.the judgment does not require that any of the imposed civil penalties be used for cleaning up the dump.in addition to the state civil actions,the state criminally prosecuted nethery and herman lee gibbons,an operator at the deepwood dump.both were convicted of violating texas organized crime laws relating to the financing of the illegal dump,and both were incarcerated in texas on those charges.
the city informed the state and the united states environmental protection agency epa that the deepwood dump poses fire and health hazards for the neighborhood and requested funds to remediate the dump.the state and the epa refused to provide funds to clean up the dump.
history of the south loop dump 
in,the city entered into an agreement to use the south loop site as a sanitary landfill.in,the of the site excluded the city from dumping because the city had not complied with the conditions in the agreement,to cover the refuse that it had dumped with at least eighteen inches of compact soil.in addition,the city never canceled this agreement.in,the city and the state sued the owners of the south loop dump in state court for violating the tswda.the state court entered an agreed final judgment in,ordering the owners to clean up the dump.an april inspection found that no corrective action had been taken,but the city and state did nothing to gain compliance with the judgment as was the case with the deepwood dump,there currently exists a substantial danger of fires from the solid waste present on the site,and the dump is also easily accessible to children the south loop site remains an open dump,and the state has not cleaned,and does not intend to clean up,the site.
procedural history of current litigation 
in february,plaintiffs,homeowners in residential areas adjoining these dumps,brought a citizens suit in federal court against the owners of the deepwood dump the city,and saitas for injunctive relief under the rcra,a.this suit was consolidated with plaintiffs july citizens suit against the city and saitas regarding the south loop dump.plaintiffs alleged,inter alia,that the city violated a b by contributing to illegal open dumping at both sites,that saitas failed to classify the dumps on the epa open dump inventory odi,and that saitas failed to comply with the corresponding rcra obligation of cleaning up the dumps 
on october,the district court certified an injunctive relief class of homeowners near or adjacent to the deepwood dump.as to the south loop dump,plaintiffs are all individually named.on december,the district court bifurcated the injunctive relief and damages portions of the suits.the court then held a bench trial regarding the injunctive relief claims on july.the final judgment,entered on august,granted plaintiffs injunctive relief against the city on both dumps,finding that the city had contributed to illegal open dumping,but denied injunctive relief against saitas the district court injunction required the city,inter alia,to erect a fence around both sites,monitor the sites for methane gas and fire hazards,prevent future open dumping,remove all solid waste from the sites without harming adjoining properties,and restore the sites to conditions.see meghrig kfc western,d stating that a private citizen suing under a b could seek a mandatory injunction,one that orders a responsible party to take action by attending to the cleanup and proper disposal of toxic waste,or a prohibitory injunction,one that restrains a responsible party from further violating the rcra.
the city timely appealed,claiming that the district court erred in holding that the city contributed to dumping at the sites plaintiffs also timely appealed,arguing that the district court erred in holding that saitas could not be held liable for violating the rcra.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and legal issues de novo.however,we may affirm for reasons other than those relied upon by the district court.joslyn koppers,cir citations omitted.a district court ruling is not clearly erroneous unless we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.see united states,cir.in addition,w e review the district court grant of a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion.hopwood texas,cir.
iii.the city appeal 
in the district court,plaintiffs asserted the following four claims against the city contributing to liability under a b at the deepwood dump,contributing to liability under a b at the south loop dump,liability under a at the deepwood dump,and liability under a at the south loop dump.the district court found the city liable under a b for both the deepwood and south loop dumps,but found that plaintiffs had not met their burden as to their a claims.plaintiffs are not appealing the district court decision on the a claims,but the city is appealing the liability findings under a b.
in order to supply a better understanding of the rcra,we provide at the outset a brief description of nuisance at common law.we then lay out the statutory framework of contributing to liability under a b.finally,we assess whether the district court ruling that the city fell within the statutory reach of a b was in error.
nuisance at common law 
nuisance principles form the core doctrinal foundation for modern environmental statutes,including the rcra.the nuisance action originated in the twelfth century.see restatement second of torts cmt.a.courts first recognized private nuisances,see,and by the sixteenth century,began to recognize public nuisances,see id.cmt.a private nuisance is a nontrespassory invasion of another interest in the private use and enjoyment of land.id.a public nuisance,on the other hand,involves an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public.see id.in determining whether conduct amounts to a public nuisance,courts consider,inter alia,whether the conduct involves a significant interference with public health,safety,peace,comfort,or convenience.see id.private and public nuisances are not set apart in rigid,mutually exclusive categories.on the contrary,w hen the nuisance,in addition to interfering with the public right,also interferes with the use and enjoyment of the plaintiff land,it is a private nuisance as well as a public one.id.cmt.see also,ozark poultry,garman,stating that landowners suit against a factory that polluted air and water could be both a public and private nuisance.
these interests,in a public right and in the use and enjoyment of one land may be invaded by any one of the types of conduct that serve in general as bases for all tort liability.restatement second of torts cmt.a.the restatement explains that one is subject to liability for a private nuisance if one conduct is the legal cause of an invasion of another interest and if the invasion is either a intentional and unreasonable or b unintentional and otherwise actionable under the rules controlling liability for negligent or reckless conduct,or for abnormally dangerous conditions or activities.id.the rules of strict liability,liability imposed without regard to the defendant negligence or intent to harm are frequently applied to abnormally dangerous activities,see restatement second of torts,although they are imposed in other nuisance situations as well 
the private nuisance liability framework of restatement is also generally applicable in public nuisance situations.see restatement second of torts cmt.however,public nuisance law tends to impose liability more often on the basis of strict liability.see,new york shore realty,cir applying new york law and stating that liability for public nuisance exists irrespective of negligence or fault concerned citizens of bridesburg city of,at common law,neither individuals nor municipalities have the right to maintain for any period of time activities that constitute a public nuisance,irrespective of lack of fault or due care.wood picillo,stating,in a case in which multiple private plaintiffs sued under public and private nuisance alleging that the defendants chemical dump site was polluting the soil,that generally this court has not required plaintiffs to establish negligence in nuisance actions id.at stating that liability in nuisance is predicated upon unreasonable injury,rather than upon unreasonable conduct branch petroleum,utah unlike most torts,nuisance law is not concerned with the nature of the conduct causing the damage,but with the nature and relative importance of the interests interfered with or invaded.
two basic remedies are available in nuisance and injunctions.see restatement second of torts cmt.i id.stating that to maintain a damage action for a public nuisance,the plaintiff must have suffered damage different in kind from that suffered by the general public and that to maintain an injunctive action for a public nuisance,the plaintiff must have a right to recover damages or the authority to represent a political subdivision in the matter or standing to sue in a citizen action id.revealing that a private or public nuisance action for damages may be maintained only by those who have suffered significant harm id.cmt.d providing that an injunction may be obtained in a proper case against a threatened private nuisance,but an action can not be maintained at law unless harm has already been suffered and referencing for a similar distinction in the realm of public nuisances see also developments in the,harv,explaining that injunctions are usually granted when damages are inadequate,such as with ongoing nuisances in which numerous suits or future damage awards would be required.
the theory of nuisance lends itself naturally to combating the harms created by environmental problems.see reclamation,hamrick,cir stating that the operation of a landfill was recognized as a nuisance even by the early common law.one commentator succinctly described environmental jurisprudence,stating the deepest doctrinal roots of modern environmental law are found in principles of nuisance nuisance actions have involved pollution of all physical,water,a wide variety of means nuisance actions have challenged virtually every major industrial and municipal activity which is today the subject of comprehensive environmental regulation nuisance theory and case law is the common law backbone of modern environmental and energy law.william rodgers,handbook on environmental law,at.
specifically,as regards the rcra,congress indicated that the statute embodied common law concepts of nuisance.see,at,reprinted in,the rcra is essentially a codification of common law public nuisance remedies and,therefore,incorporates the legal theories used for centuries to assess liability for creating a public nuisance including the theories of intentional tort,negligency,and strict liability and to determine appropriate remedies however,s ome terms and concepts are meant to be more liberal than their common law counterparts.solid waste agency army corps of eng,cir noting that the interests protected by the clean water act overlap to a great extent the interests that nuisance law protects.see generally infra part.
having provided a brief summary of the common law negligence principles that underlie the rcra,we next proceed to lay out the regulatory framework of the rcra as it applies to the facts of this case.
section a b 
section a b of the rcra provides in relevant part 
a ny person may commence a civil action on his own any person,including the united states and any other governmental instrumentality or agency,to the extent permitted by the eleventh amendment to the constitution,and including any past or present generator,past or present transporter,or past or present owner or operator of a treatment,storage,or disposal facility,who has contributed or who is contributing to the past or present handling,storage,treatment,transportation,or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste which may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.
a b emphasis added.
parsing the language of a b,we find it contains essentially three elements.to prevail on a contributing to claim,a plaintiff is required under a b to demonstrate that the defendant is a person,including,but not limited to,one who was or is a generator or transporter of solid or hazardous waste or one who was or is an owner or operator of a solid or hazardous waste treatment,storage,or disposal facility that the defendant has contributed to or is contributing to the handling,storage,treatment,transportation,or disposal of solid or hazardous waste and that the solid or hazardous waste may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.see,united states aceto agric.chems,cir zands nelson zands ii.
we turn now to the district court finding that the city falls within the statutory reach of a b for both the deepwood and south loop dumps.
any person 
first,the rcra states that any person may be held liable,including past or present generators,transporters,owners,or operators.see a b,part i,at,reprinted in,stating that anyone who has contributed or is contributing to the creation,existence,or maintenance of an imminent and substantial endangerment is subject to the rcra and that such persons include,but are not limited to,past and present generators,past and present owners and operators,and past and present transporters emphasis added zands ii.at stating that the word including does not limit the definition of the word person cobell norton,it is hornbook law that the use of the word including indicates that the specified list that follows is illustrative,not exclusive.alteration in original internal quotations omitted quoting in parenthetical puerto rico maritime shipping auth.icc,united states grassie,cir regarding the statutory use of the word including as the preface for a representative or illustrative example,and not as a term of restriction or exclusion for anything not expressly specified united states canada,cir stating that the term includes indicates a list.
in addition,it is undisputed that the city has been and is a generator of solid waste municipal activities,such as basic office operations in city buildings,demolition,and construction,generate waste.see meghrig,at.stating that the rcra is a comprehensive environmental statute carbone,town of clarkstown,d,concurring in judgment stating that the rcra is a sweeping statute intended to regulate solid waste from cradle to grave james et,rcra and superfund a practice guide with forms,at ed.the cradle to grave intent of the rcra law is illustrated by the law inclusion of generators,transporters,and disposers within the broad reach of the statute.see also zands nelson,zands i stating that the term generators indicates that the rcra applies to individuals who do no more than create solid waste.specifically,on this record,the city generated solid waste through its demolition activities.
has contributed to or is contributing to 
second,the district court did not err as a matter of law in interpreting the contributing to prong of a b.in addition,its finding that the city satisfied the requirements of the provision was not clear error.in so concluding,we first lay out the basic framework that will guide our analysis and then examine the evidence relating to each dump.
construction of the term contribute 
the rcra does not define the term contribute or any variation thereof.this silence compels us to start with the assumption that the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used.russello united states,d quoting richards united states,d see also green tree fin.randolph,d stating that b ecause the statute does not define a term or otherwise suggest that the ordinary meaning of the term should not apply,the supreme court accords the term its meaning asgrow seed winterboer,d hallstrom tillamook county,d adopting plain language meaning for the rcra notice requirement in b.
webster dictionary defines contribute as to have a share in any act or effect.webster third new international dictionary unabridged see also oxford english dictionary ed to have a part or share in producing an effect the american heritage dictionary of the english language ed to help bring about a result 
our sister circuits have drawn upon the plain meaning of the word contribute and on the legislative history as well to interpret the contributing to phrase under the analogous provision see,aceto,at the relevant legislative history supports a broad,rather than a narrow,construction of the phrase contributed to.united states waste,cir congress intent,then,was to establish a standard of liability by incorporating and expanding upon the common law.the court of appeals for the fourth circuit aptly summarized congressional intent regarding interpretations of phrases such as contributing to 
congress has mandated that the former common law of nuisance,as applied to situations in which a risk of harm from solid or hazardous wastes exists,shall include new terms and concepts which shall be developed in a liberal,not a restrictive,manner.this ensures that problems that congress could not have anticipated when passing the rcra will be dealt with in a way minimizing the risk of harm to the environment and the public.
waste,at.citations omitted therefore,we follow our sister circuits lead and interpret contribute to mean have a part or share in producing an effect.
b.the required level of fault 
as to the fault standard under which such contributions are held actionable,we note that the one circuit that has addressed this specific issue has held that the rcra imposes strict liability,liability imposed without regard to the defendant negligence or intent to harm.united states northeastern pharm.chem,cir stating,in a case arising under see supra note,that congress intended to impose liability without fault or negligence and specifically on past generators and transporters aceto,at citing northeastern and stating that has been interpreted to impose strict liability some other courts have also come to the same conclusion.see,zands ii.at.
we have no reason to consider here whether strict liability may be a basis for liability under the rcra the district court did not hold the city strictly liable for the waste that it generated and that was deposited in the deepwood and south loop dumps.in the case of the south loop dump,the city did not dispute that it used the site as a municipal dump.in the case of the deepwood dump,the district court found,and we agree,that there is a compelling case on the record that the city actions were negligent,that the city failed to exercise due care in selecting or instructing the entity actually conducting the disposal of the city waste 
c.the evidence regarding the deepwood and south loop dumps 
we now examine the evidence regarding each dump and conclude that the district court did not commit clear error in finding that the evidence established a b contributing to liability for the city.
deepwood dump 
the rcra creates,at the very least,a duty on the part of generators not to dispose of their waste in such a manner that it may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.negligent oversight of disposal is actionable under the rcra see supra note and accompanying text.as described supra in part,the city contracted with billy nabors and dallas demolition to conduct demolitions of city property.these city contractors dumped loads of debris at the deepwood dump.the city contracts with dallas demolition did not specify that waste materials generated by the city activities must be properly disposed of in a legal landfill.the city was aware that dallas demolition engaged in illegal dumping and operated its own unauthorized waste site.furthermore,the city attorneys were informed that dallas demolition dumped at the deepwood dump.however,even after the city attorneys had learned that dallas demolition had been dumping illegally in dallas,the city continued to work with dallas demolition the district court did not clearly err in finding that this lax oversight of its contractors and their disposal of city waste is evidence of the city contributing to liability.blue legs bureau of indian affairs,cir finding that federal government agencies contributed to open dumping by generating solid waste,contracting for its disposal and,in some instances,transporting solid waste to dumps operated in violation of federal law emphasis added.
the city argues that there is no evidence in the record that the city waste actually went into the deepwood dump.the city asserts,instead,that the contracts simply demonstrate that it could have used billy nabors or dallas demolition to haul trash,but that there is no evidence that it actually did do so and,even if it did utilize these haulers,that the city particular waste was taken to the deepwood dump.we find little merit in this argument.
first,the district court reasonably inferred that the city waste went into the deepwood dump,and on this record,this inference is not clear error.the city council allocated funds for the demolition actions,and the city council,subsequent to a bidding process,awarded specific contracts to dallas demolition and billy nabors,even after city attorneys knew that they were dumping illegally at the deepwood dump.given that the city specifically hired these contractors to perform certain jobs,a logical conclusion is that the city used them for those jobs.a mere assertion from the city that the jobs might not have been performed is insufficient to alter this conclusion.
the city actions therefore snugly fit the failed to exercise due care in selecting or instructing the entity actually conducting the disposal statement from,at,reprinted in.see supra part.this situation also closely parallels an example considered in a house committee report and a senate report,that a generator of solid waste is subject to liability even when someone else conducted the disposal at the generator request.see,at,reprinted in,comm.print,at.
therefore,the district court did not err in assessing a b liability against the city based on the city negligent actions regarding the disposal of its waste 
ii.south loop dump 
the city does not dispute that it used the south loop site as a municipal landfill from until at least.an owner of south loop fenced the site and hired a guard to stop the city from dumping because the city would not properly cover the refuse it had dumped there the city primary argument is that because its use ended in and because the rcra was not enacted until,it can not be held liable under a b.we do not agree.
section a b is clear that it applies to both past and present acts,as the adjectives past and present are specifically included.we have also previously confirmed that w e understand the language of a b to provide a claim for injunctive relief based on either past or present conduct.tanglewood homeowners,cir emphasis added the activities at issue in the case had also occurred before northeastern,at stating that the analogous provision of,see supra note,specifically applies to past generators and transporters and rejecting the defendant argument that dumping should not be a basis for rcra liability see also infra part explaining that although the endangerment must currently exist,the actions causing the endangerment may have occurred wholly in the past gwaltney of smithfield,chesapeake bay,d noting that congress intentionally used language that explicitly targets wholly past violations when it created a b.
in short,the disposal of wastes as wholly past acts can constitute a continuing violation as long as no proper disposal procedures are put into effect or as long as the waste has not been cleaned up and the environmental effects remain remediable.gache town of harrison,rejecting the defendant city argument that it had not dumped any materials in years and thus should not be held liable united states price,rejecting defendants argument that the rcra could not be applied to its activities,which ceased in,aff,cir.the continued presence of this municipal waste in the south loop dump so long as it presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment,see infra part is actionable under a b.
imminent and substantial endangerment to health or environment 
lastly,the district court did not err in concluding that an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment existed at both dumps.at the outset,we note that the operative word in a b is may.thus,plaintiffs must demonstrate that the waste may present such a danger see dague city of burlington,cir significantly,congress used the word may to preface the standard of liability,rev in part on other grounds,d kara holding getty petroleum,d,emphasizing may in a b greenpeace,waste techs,cir contrasting the difficult standards of b with the far less restrictive rules governing imminent and substantial endangerment under a b.
the supreme court has also pointed out that the phrase may present communicates another idea it quite clearly excludes waste that no longer presents the harm contemplated by a b.see meghrig,at.t his language implies that there must be a threat which is present now,although the impact of the threat may not be felt until later.id.quoting price navy,cir.as such,under an imminent hazard citizen suit,the endangerment must be ongoing,but the conduct that created the endangerment need not be.coastal fishermen ass remington arms,cir see also navy,at stating that the language of the provision does not require actual harm,but threatened or potential harm united states waste,cir stating that the rcra was intended to apply to active human conduct and is a means to respond to disasters precipitated by earlier poor planning emphasis added.
because the rcra does not define imminent,the supreme court,as is its customary practice,see supra part.a discussing meaning of contribute,looked to the plain meaning of the term an endangerment can only be imminent if it threaten s to occur immediately.meghrig,at.alteration in original quoting webster new international dictionary of english language ed see also dague,at a finding of imminency does not require a showing that actual harm will occur immediately so long as the risk of threatened harm is present.united states price,cir kara holding,d at citing meghrig envtl.def.fund epa,an imminent hazard may be declared at any point in a chain of events which may ultimately result in harm to the public.internal quotations and citation omitted.the legislative history supports interpreting imminent in accordance with this plain meaning 
imminence applies to the nature of the threat rather than identification of the time when the endangerment initially arose.the section,therefore,may be used for events which took place at some time in the past but which continue to present a threat to the public health or the environment.
comm.print,at.and finally,an endangerment is substantial if it is serious.see navy,at.
with this framework in place,we now examine the evidence regarding the imminent and substantial endangerment to health and the environment at each dump.
deepwood dump 
the district court did not clearly err in concluding that the deepwood dump may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.see supra part.the evidence includes the following the deepwood dump is adjacent to residences and is partially in the flood plain of the trinity river the dump is easily accessible to children the deepwood dump twice caught fire and burned,with the resulting fumes polluting the neighborhood air a significant fire hazard continues to exist at the dump the state reports reveal that there is an imminent threat of the discharge of municipal solid waste into elam creek,a tributary of the trinity river,because of the massive illegal dumping the state itself has noted that waste at the deepwood dump may cause contamination of surface water and ground water through the leaching of contaminates from the debris by rainwater asbestos,benzo a athracene,and benzene in excess of state limits have been detected at the deepwood dump and the city itself has long maintained that the deepwood dump poses a hazard to the public health.
south loop dump 
on appeal,the city argues that the material it dumped at the south loop dump presents no danger to health or the environment yet,the city points to nothing in the record to support this assertion.the district court concluded that plaintiffs have adequately demonstrated that the city contributions played a role in the creation of the dangers at the south loop dump,and,as will be explained below,the record well supports this conclusion 
the district court did not clearly err in finding that the south loop dump satisfies the endangerment standard of a b.first,as the district court noted,the city itself had previously admitted that the south loop dump was a hazard to the public health in its present condition.furthermore,the city state court judgment against the owners stated that the judgment was necessary for the maintenance of the public health and environment.
in addition,the state documents themselves describe the very danger of old landfills,like the south loop dump,that were established before any of the proper closure requirements were in place as the old waste decomposes,the cover soil can settle,ground and surface water can become contaminated with leachate,and dangerous gases can form and migrate underground this meets the may present an imminent and substantial endangerment standard.moreover,as the city failed to adhere even to the less stringent requirements in effect during the time it was dumping at the south loop dump,the dangers described in the state plan are even more likely to materialize.
therefore,the district court finding that the city was liable under a b for the deepwood and south loop dumps was not clearly erroneous 
iv.plaintiffs appeal 
the district court dismissed saitas from the case,finding that plaintiffs had not met their burden as to any of their claims against saitas.on appeal,plaintiffs contend that they did meet their burden as to their claims that saitas violated specific regulations,requirements,and standards that took effect pursuant to the solid waste disposal provisions of the rcra they argue that these provisions require saitas to inventory all landfills in the state,to classify those that do not meet epa standards for sanitary landfills as open dumps,to achieve either the closing of the dumps such that they are in compliance with epa standards or the upgrading of the dumps to sanitary landfill status,to eliminate the health hazards of the dumps,and to take steps to prevent future health hazards.see a,a,c,d.plaintiffs seek to enforce these obligations via the citizen suit provision in a a.
before we address saitas arguments with respect to the threshold issues of standing and eleventh amendment immunity,and in order to provide context for these arguments,we pause here to lay out the relevant statutory and regulatory background.we then continue with our analysis.
statutory and regulatory framework 
under the rcra,states are able to receive federal financial and other assistance if they comply with various rcra provisions and the corresponding epa regulations.one such requirement is that states must submit solid waste management plans that prohibit the establishment of new open dumps within the state,and ensure that solid waste will be utilized for resources recovery or disposed of in sanitary landfills or otherwise disposed of in an environmentally sound manner.a.further,the plan must provide for the closing or upgrading of all existing open dumps within the state pursuant to the requirements of section.id.a.along these lines,a state is to provide the epa with a list of open dumps in the state,which the epa must publish in the odi.see b pt.the odi was meant t o assist the states in complying with section a.b.section a in turn specifies that the state plan must contain a requirement that all existing disposal facilities or sites for solid waste in the state which are open dumps listed in the odi shall comply with such measures as may be promulgated by the administrator to eliminate health hazards and minimize potential health hazards.id.a.
these regulations,promulgated by the epa,provided guidelines for the development and implementation of state solid waste management plans.guidelines for development and implementation of state solid waste management plans,july.states were required to classify existing solid waste disposal facilities,with the open dumps to be published in the odi.see a.a ny facility which fails to comply with any one element of the criteria for classification of solid waste disposal facilities and practices is an open dump.solid waste disposal inventory of open dumps,explaining that facilities that did not satisfy the sanitary landfill criteria and which were not facilities for the disposal of hazardous waste were to be classified as open dumps.for each facility classified as an open dump the state shall take steps to close or upgrade the facility.c.in addition,while providing for the closure of open dumps the state shall take steps necessary to eliminate health hazards and minimize potential health hazards.id.d.
in accordance with these statutory and regulatory requirements,the state of texas submitted its solid waste management plan the state plan,which was subsequently approved by the epa.see approval of texas solid waste management plan.the district court found that the state adopted a strategy of only listing on the odi those sites that had previously received a permit from the state.the district court further found that because most dumps do not apply for a state permit,this strategy greatly reduced the number of existing open dumps in texas that could potentially find their way onto the odi.the court went on to state in its findings of fact and conclusions of law that the state never informed the epa of its intent to unilaterally narrow the scope of the odi.
standing and eleventh amendment immunity 
on appeal,saitas puts forth various jurisdictional issues and argues that,even if the merits were to be reached,he did not violate the rcra.we examine each of the threshold issues in turn.not finding them to be viable in the instant case,we then examine the merits of plaintiffs claims,concluding that the district court did not err in finding in favor of saitas.
saitas asserts that plaintiffs lack standing and also that he is immune from suit under the eleventh amendment standing is a jurisdictional doctrine that the supreme court has held must be decided before the merits of a case.see steel citizens for a better env t,d rejecting the doctrine of hypothetical jurisdiction see also schlesinger reservists comm.to stop the war,d stating that the concept of justiciability,which expresses the jurisdictional limitations imposed upon federal courts by the case or controversy requirement of art.iii,embodies among other doctrines the standing doctrine.while the eleventh amendment is jurisdictional in the sense that it is a limitation on the federal court judicial power,the supreme court has recognized that it is not coextensive with the limitations on judicial power in article iii.calderon ashmus,d laje thomason,cir stating that eleventh amendment claims are jurisdictional in nature emphasis added.the supreme court has also stated that standing must be examined before the eleventh amendment.see calderon,at.stating that the court must first address whether the action is the sort of article iii case or controversy to which federal courts are limited.
article iii,of the constitution extends the judicial power of the united states only to cases and controversies.steel,at.that a suit may be a class action adds nothing to the question of standing,for even named plaintiffs who represent a class must allege and show that they personally have been injured,not that injury has been suffered by other,unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they purport to represent.lewis casey,d alteration in original internal quotations omitted quoting simon eastern.welfare rights,d.a plaintiff must demonstrate that he or she satisfies the three constitutional requirements of standing injury in fact,causation,and redressability.see bennett spear,d lujan defenders of wildlife,d.
a plaintiff suffers injury in fact when there has been an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan,at.internal quotations and citations omitted.the causation requirement is met when the injury is such that it is fairly trace able to the challenged action of the defendant,and not th e result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.id.at.alterations in original quoting simon eastern.welfare rights,d.as for redressability,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.id.at.internal quotations and citation omitted.
on appeal saitas does not appear to argue that plaintiffs have not suffered an injury in fact or that they fail to demonstrate causation rather,saitas focuses his challenge on the redressability requirement.saitas argues that an injunctive order requiring him to classify the deepwood and south loop sites as open dumps,and to formally submit the names of those sites to the epa for inclusion on the odi,will not remedy the problem posed by the illegal dumps because there is no correlation between classification and enforcement saitas analogizes the instant case to steel.
plaintiffs acknowledge that if they were seeking only to have the dumps classified as open dumps and listed on the odi,then standing could be problematic,as in steel.however,they interpret the rcra not only to require saitas to classify deepwood and south loop as open dumps and submit them for the odi,but also to require saitas either to upgrade or to close the dumps.thus,plaintiffs assert that their requested relief goes beyond merely listing the deepwood and south loop dumps on the odi,noting that they strove to obtain an injunction that would also require saitas to take steps to close the dumps or upgrade them to federal standards and to take the steps necessary to eliminate the existing health hazards and to minimize potential health hazards.we agree with plaintiffs that they have standing.
first,plaintiffs have amply demonstrated an injury in fact.at least cubic yards of waste,approximately deep,are present at the deepwood dump,which is adjacent to plaintiffs residential neighborhoods.residents close to the dumps report the appearance of snakes and rats in their backyards since the beginning of the illegal dumping.asbestos and benzo a athracene have been detected at the deepwood dump,and benzene has been discovered in excess of state limits.the deepwood dump has caught fire and burned several times,and a significant fire hazard still exists at the dump.solid waste continues to be dumped on the south loop site,with the state discovering during a inspection that the area of the waste along the alley behind the homes has been expanding.the city and state themselves have acknowledged that both dumps constitute a hazard to the public health.these facts,among others,demonstrate a concrete,actual injury and thus satisfy the first standing requirement.
next,we find that plaintiffs have demonstrated causation.the district court found that because most dumps do not apply for a state permit,the state strategy of listing only previously permitted sites on the odi greatly reduced the number of existing open dumps in texas that could potentially find their way onto the odi.the court also found that all of the dumps that the state did list on the odi were subsequently upgraded to meet the epa sanitary landfill criteria.from our review of the record,we find that the district court did not err in making these findings.therefore,it can be said that plaintiffs injury is fairly traceable to the actions of saitas as it is likely that conditions at the deepwood and south loop dumps would have been ameliorated if saitas had acted to set the process in motion.had the deepwood and south loop dumps been placed on the odi which,plaintiffs contend,is required by the rcra,saitas would have been obligated to plan for and implement the closing or upgrading of the dumps under.
we also agree with plaintiffs that steel is inapposite to the instant case and find that they have satisfied the redressability requirement as well.in steel,a citizens group sought declaratory judgment that the defendant violated the emergency planning and community right to know act the epcra,a,by failing to file timely annual emergency and hazardous chemical inventory forms.see steel,at.unlike the instant case,the steel defendant filed all of the overdue reports with the relevant agencies after receiving notice from the plaintiff that it was in violation of the epcra even before the civil suit was filed.see id.at.the supreme court itself subsequently noted this very distinction in friends of the earth,laidlaw environmental services toc,d.the court stated 
we specifically noted in steel that there was no allegation in the complaint of any continuing or imminent violation,and that no basis for such an allegation appeared to exist.in short,steel held that private plaintiffs,unlike the federal government,may not sue to assess penalties for wholly past violations,but our decision in that case did not reach the issue of standing to seek penalties for violations that are ongoing at the time of the complaint and that could continue into the future if undeterred.
id.at.internal citations omitted see also charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,at supp many aspects of the ruling in steel rested on the conclusion that the plaintiff could not achieve standing by seeking remedies that would advance the public interest in deterring future violations or punishing past violations.
in this case,saitas did not act to classify properly the deepwood and south loop sites as open dumps and then execute the resulting process after being informed by plaintiffs of alleged violations of federal law as the steel defendant had done.plaintiffs have alleged longstanding and uncorrected violations of saitas obligations to plan for and accomplish the elimination of the hazards caused by the dumps.thus,an injunction requiring saitas to upgrade or close the dumps would redress the hazards created by those dumps see meghrig,at.stating that a private citizen suing under a b could seek a mandatory injunction,one that orders a responsible party to take action by attending to the cleanup and proper disposal of toxic waste,or a prohibitory injunction,one that restrains a responsible party from further violating the rcra sealy,litton,stating that mandatory injunctions are authorized by a b for attending to the cleanup and proper disposal of toxic waste united states price,cir stating that,see supra note,authorizes the cleanup of a site,even a dormant one,if that action is necessary to abate a present threat to the public health or the environment united states valentine,stating that i t is plain that,see supra note,empowers a court to grant the full range of equitable remedies and also all remedies traditionally provided under the common law of nuisance,at least so long as such relief serves to protect the public health and environment.
the eleventh amendment 
saitas argues on appeal that he is protected from suit by the eleventh amendment and that the suit can not be maintained under ex parte young.the eleventh amendment states the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state,or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.const.amend.xi.although by its terms the amendment applies only to suits against a state by citizens of another state,the amendment applicability has been extended to suits by citizens against their own states.bd.of trustees of the of garrett,d.
because plaintiffs have sued a state official in his official capacity,we address whether the doctrine of ex parte young operates in this case.as will be explained below,we find that plaintiffs suit for prospective injunctive relief under the rcra may proceed against the individual state official sued in his official capacity,jeffrey saitas,executive director of the tnrcc 
ex parte young 
ex parte young held that the eleventh amendment does not bar a suit against a state official who is alleged to be acting in violation of federal law.see.see also garrett.at pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d edelman jordan,d communications bellsouth telecomms,cir earles state bd.of certified pub.accountants,cir.the ex parte young doctrine is premised on the concept that a state can not authorize its officials to violate the constitution and laws of the united states.see ex parte young,at.the state has no power to impart to the state officer any immunity from responsibility to the supreme authority of the united states.the supreme court decisions repeatedly have emphasized that the ex parte young doctrine rests on the need to promote the vindication of federal rights.pennhurst,at.
in this case,we find that plaintiffs claims against saitas are within the ambit of ex parte young.first,having sued saitas in his official capacity,plaintiffs are seeking prospective injunctive relief as opposed to retrospective relief.see edelman,at.rejecting an injunction ordering retroactive payment of previously owed monetary benefits.the distinction between that relief permissible under the doctrine of ex parte young and that found barred in edelman was the difference between prospective relief on one hand and retrospective relief on the other.quern jordan,d.
second,plaintiffs are also alleging violations of federal law,specifically the rcra,and not state law.the regulations,requirements,and standards that plaintiffs seek to enforce pursuant to a a are federal statutory and regulatory provisions a,a,c,d.although the state plan provides that the state will comply with these federal provisions,plaintiffs are not seeking to enforce the plan itself and therefore do not run afoul of pennhurst admonition regarding state law claims.see pennhurst,at.concluding that ex parte young and edelman are inapplicable in a suit against state officials on the basis of state law earles,at.
saitas does not appear to contest that plaintiffs are seeking prospective injunctive relief for violations of federal law.rather,saitas argues that state officers can not be sued to enforce federal statutes that contain comprehensive enforcement mechanisms.saitas focuses on seminole tribe of florida florida,d,in which the supreme court held w here congress has prescribed a detailed remedial scheme for the enforcement against a state of a statutorily created right,a court should hesitate before casting aside those limitations and permitting an action against a state officer based upon ex parte young.id.at.
in seminole tribe,the court found that congress intended to limit the availability of an ex parte young suit against state officers for violations of federal statutory law when it enacted the indian gaming regulatory act the igra.see id.at.however,the statute that gives rise to plaintiffs claims in this case is distinguishable from the igra.in seminole tribe itself,the court differentiated between the igra and statutes such as the clean water act the cwa.see at.noting that the igra provision at issue stands in contrast to provisions such as those under the cwa,in which congress is clear that it intends to authorize federal jurisdiction over government entities and focusing on the any person language in the cwa citizen suit provision.we are persuaded that the similarity of the citizen suit provisions of the cwa and the rcra requires like interpretation.see dep t of energy ohio,d.the cwa authorizes citizen suits 
against any person including i the united states,and ii any other governmental instrumentality or agency to the extent permitted by the eleventh amendment to the constitution who is alleged to be in violation of a an effluent standard or limitation under this chapter or b an order issued by the administrator or a state with respect to such a standard or limitation.
a.similarly,plaintiffs are suing pursuant to the rcra provision that authorizes citizens suits 
against any person including a the united states,and b any other governmental instrumentality or agency,to the extent permitted by the eleventh amendment to the constitution who is alleged to be in violation of any permit,standard,regulation,condition,requirement,prohibition,or order.
a a.that the rcra authorizes suits against any person to the extent permitted by the eleventh amendment clearly indicates that congress specifically intended to permit suits against states within the bounds of the amendment.see,prisco new york,civ.rlc,wl,at,determining that seminole tribe did not bar plaintiff rcra claim under ex parte young,at,reprinted in,stating that if the federal,state,and local agencies fail to exercise their enforcement responsibility,the public is provided the right to seek vigorous enforcement action under the citizen suit provisions natural res.def.council cal.dep t of,cir finding that congress implicitly intended to authorize citizens to bring ex parte young suits against state officials with the responsibility to comply with the cwa.
we thus find the rcra,with its explicit reference to the eleventh amendment and its similarity to the cwa,to be precisely the sort of statute envisioned by the seminole tribe court to authorize an ex parte young action.see at.far from demonstrating congress intention to bar access to ex parte young,the rcra embraces the ex parte young doctrine as a feature of its remedial scheme.therefore,plaintiffs rcra claim against saitas is not barred by seminole tribe exception to the doctrine of ex parte young.
plaintiffs claims against saitas 
we now turn to plaintiffs claims against saitas,namely that saitas was obligated to classify the deepwood and south loop sites as open dumps and then to set in motion procedures to upgrade or close those dumps.see supra part.plaintiffs assert that saitas failure to take these actions places saitas in violation of a,a b,and the relevant regulations,particularly.see id.plaintiffs seek to enforce these obligations via the citizen suit provision in a a.
the district court did not err in finding that plaintiffs have not carried their burden on their claims against saitas.plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that saitas actions contravened the statutory provisions and regulations that are the basis of their suit.in essence,plaintiffs seek to add requirements not explicitly dictated by the statute.
as discussed supra in part,the rcra places several conditions on states in order for them to receive federal funding for waste management.see b.a state is required to submit a solid waste management plan,which must be approved by the epa.see id.this approval depends upon the plan satisfying the requirements in the rcra.see id.
the texas state plan,which was approved by the epa,informs the reader that the state has undertaken a program to classify all land disposal facilities in texas.it states further since all disposal sites could not be inventoried immediately,a strategy was developed to determine which facilities would be inventoried first a priority list was then prepared for the first year of the odi and the odi was begun.this meets the requirement in a that the state plan shall provide for the classification of existing solid waste disposal facilities.the plan also explains that once the state classifies a site as an open dump,the state will continue surveillance and enforcement to eliminate the existing open dump by closing or upgrading and includes a procedure chart for upgrading or closure of open dumps.these features of the plan are in line with a requirement that the plan shall provide for the closing or upgrading of all existing open dumps and with d statement that the plan must account for monitoring and contingency plans.plaintiffs would,in essence,have us read another provision into the rcra that compels saitas to act beyond these statutory requirements.we can not adopt their interpretation of the statute.
we find the statutory requirements satisfied.saitas submitted a plan that conformed to the requirements in the rcra.the statutory provisions and relevant regulations obligate a state to provide for certain elements in the state plan,which saitas did.the requirements that a state shall take certain steps appear in the context of a facility already classified as an open dump.see,c d.we do not find any permit,standard,regulation,condition,requirement,prohibition,or order which has become effective pursuant to the rcra,a a,that a state shall take steps to classify waste disposal facilities.rather,we find in the rcra that a state shall provide for such a classification in its plan,which,as we have explained,saitas has done.our conclusion regarding saitas duties in placing the deepwood and south loop dumps on the odi is buttressed by the epa comments in amending and the epa is required to publish an inventory of open dumps,based on the state findings.in doing so,the epa does not pass on the adequacy of the state determinations.likewise the decision to remove a facility from the inventory is a state determination.guidelines for development and implementation of state solid waste management plans and criteria for identification of solid waste disposal facilities and practices.
while plaintiffs valiantly attempt to read a requirement into the rcra that saitas must not only provide for the classification of all waste facilities,but also must take steps to perform the classification,we do not find that congress included such a specification in the statute.therefore,plaintiffs have not demonstrated that saitas violated a permit,standard,regulation,condition,requirement,prohibition,or order,and as such,fail to carry their burden on their a a claims concerning the deepwood and south loop dumps.
conclusion 
for the reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.stay pending appeal vacated.plaintiffs and the city shall each bear of the costs of this appeal.
the deepwood dump is also known by the addresses deepwood street and south jim miller road.
this dump is located directly north of the deepwood dump.
solid waste includes any garbage,refuse,sludge and other discarded material.from the rcra inception,congress made clear that it intended the term solid waste to be viewed with a wide lens in addressing the problem,the committee recognizes that solid waste,the traditional term for trash or refuse,is inappropriate.the words solid waste are laden with false connotations.they are more narrow in meaning than the committee concern.the words discarded materials more accurately reflect the committee interest the term discarded materials is used to identify collectively those substances often referred to as industrial,municipal or waste refuse,trash,garbage and sludge it should be noted that discarded materials are generated from a multitude of sources in every sector of the nation,part i,at,reprinted in.
the city,in partial compliance with the district court injunction in this case,has now constructed a fence around the sites.see infra note and accompanying prior text describing the district court injunction against the city.
defendant jeffrey saitas is the current executive director of the tnrcc,the texas agency charged with the responsibility of overseeing environmental laws relating to dumping.both the name of the relevant state agency and the identity of the director have changed throughout the years.we will refer to the director as saitas and the agency as the tnrcc,without attempting to chronicle those changes,as they are irrelevant to this appeal.we will refer to saitas,the tnrcc,and the state of texas as the state,except where necessary to make a distinction for clarity.
we note that,in their documents,city officials consistently referred to deepwood as a dump,and not as a sand or gravel mine,quarry,or pit.
the deepwood dump had become so large that other waste handlers,such as bfi and waste management,actually noticed a decrease in the volume of solid waste they transported after inquiries,they discovered that the decrease stemmed from the fact that waste was being illegally dumped at the deepwood dump.
a state inspector noted the solid waste which is being dumped is on the area on the east side along the alley behind the homes.this area of waste is getting larger.
but see supra note.
plaintiffs sued nethery and van sickle.
plaintiffs alleged that saitas has the obligation to classify all solid waste facilities in texas either as open dumps or sanitary landfills,to list the open dumps on the odi,and to take the steps necessary to close or upgrade the open dumps in compliance with federal sanitary landfill criteria.plaintiffs arguments distill to the following core complaint saitas deliberately chose not to classify,close,or upgrade the illegal,unauthorized solid waste facilities in texas,the deepwood and south loop dumps according to rcra requirements.plaintiffs asserted various other claims against saitas that are not raised on appeal.
these damages claims which do not arise under the rcra alleged race discrimination against the city as to both the deepwood and south loop dumps,and common law nuisance against nethery as to the deepwood dump.
on august,the district court had filed a detailed court findings of fact and conclusions of law.
plaintiffs also prevailed against nethery and van sickle.nethery filed a notice of appeal with this court,but failed to pay the requisite fee,thus waiving his appeal.
after the final judgment,the city moved for,and was granted,a partial stay of the injunction pending this appeal.
it is probable that the idea see infra note is generally consistent with the concept set forth in.restatement third of torts liability for physical harm basic principles cmt.c tentative draft,tentatively approved at the american law institute annual meeting,may.strict liability is essentially defined as liability imposed without regard to the defendant negligence or intent to harm.s trict liability signifies liability without fault,or at least without any proof of fault.restatement third of torts liability for physical harm basic principles ch.scope note see also prosser and keeton on the law of torts,at page keeton et,ed stating that strict liability means liability that is imposed on an actor apart from either an intent to interfere with a legally protected interest without a legal justification for doing so,or a breach of a duty to exercise reasonable care.however,it is important to observe that there is no single theory for strict liability in tort.restatement third of torts liability for physical harm basic principles ch.scope note.but,at a minimum,doctrines do require that the defendant conduct or activity be a cause of the plaintiff injury.id.emphasis added.
while,which further defines the term unreasonable used in the general rule of,is explained in the language of unreasonableness,that section in essence rests on an idea of strict liability that it is appropriate for the defendant to compensate the plaintiff even though the defendant has in general behaved in a reasonable way.restatement third of torts liability for physical harm basic principles cmt.
however,some courts have applied a more scheme to public nuisance actions brought by private plaintiffs as opposed to actions brought by the sovereign.see,quinnett newman.this distinction between private and public plaintiffs stems from the origin of public nuisances,in which such nuisances were treated as crimes at common law which,of course,were within the purview of the state police power.see restatement second of torts at cmt.a prosser and keeton on torts.although public nuisances are no longer treated only as crimes,they continue to be considered intrusions on the public welfare.see restatement second of torts cmt.b.as such,the degree to which the defendant is at fault is less important than the state interest.see starr comm r of envtl,because a public nuisance implicates the rights of the public and the exercise of the state police power,the legislature could legitimately determine that the plaintiff lack of culpability for the existence of the contaminated condition is outweighed by the state interest in protecting public resources.this rationale for imposing liability without regard to fault does not translate completely when the plaintiff is a private,the above potential basis for differentiation between private and public plaintiffs in public nuisance law does not retain full force when private plaintiffs sue in the context of statutory citizen suit provisions which permit private parties to act essentially in place of the governmental entity when it is unable or unwilling to take action.these citizen suit provisions are common in environmental statutes,such as the rcra.see,a rcra citizen suit provisions a clean water act citizen suit provision.
as an aside,with reference to the discussion of nuisance at common law supra in part,we note that nuisance liability at common law has been based on actions which contribute to the creation of a nuisance.see,king columbian carbon,cir stating,in a case under texas law,that our conclusion is that nuisances may exist without negligence and in such situations it,of course,is not requisite that negligence be alleged,but in all cases where negligence has created,or contributed to the creation of,the nuisance such negligence should be alleged.emphasis added new jersey gloucester envtl.mgmt,stating,in a case under new jersey law,that one who creates or contributes to the creation of the nuisance is generally liable for that nuisance and that i t is enough for a nuisance claim to stand that the municipalities allegedly contributed to the creation of a situation which,it is alleged,unreasonably interfered with a right common to the general public emphasis added attorney baldwin,stating that i t is not necessary to show that the person charged committed the particular act that created the nuisance it is sufficient if he contributed thereto emphasis added wilson key tronic,finding the following jury instruction proper under washington law one who creates contributes to the creation of a nuisance is liable to any person whose property is injuriously affected or whose personal enjoyment is lessened by the nuisance.emphasis added.
in fact,no party raises this issue,proceeding on the implicit assumption that the city is a generator of solid waste.
we note that a b also specifically applies to past contributors,as the phrase past and present modifies generators,transporters,owners,and operators.see a b conf,at,reprinted in,stating that persons who have contributed in the past or are presently contributing to the endangerment of health or the environment,including but not limited to generators,have always been liable under,see infra note.
that the definition indicates a construction of contribute is also supported by the relevant legislative history.see,at,reprinted in,comm.print,at.we note that this legislative history pertains to an analogous provision,which details the requirements that must be met in order for the epa on behalf of the united states to bring suit.it contains language identical to the citizen suit provision of a b.we apply the normal rule of statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.commissioner lundy,d internal quotations and citations omitted singer,sutherland on statutory construction,at ed.where one section of a statute contains a particular provision,omission of the same provision from a similar section is significant to show different legislative intent for the two section sic.in addition to this rule of statutory construction,which is based on likely congressional intent,our conclusion that a b and are to be similarly interpreted is also supported by the evidence we have of congressional intent regarding the rcra.see,part i,at,reprinted in,stating that private parties may sue under the citizen suit provision of a b pursuant to the standards of liability established under.
see supra note.
the congressional statements are in accord with the overriding objective of the rcra the rcra is a multifaceted approach toward solving the problems associated with the billion tons of discarded materials generated each year,and the problems resulting from the anticipated annual increase in the volume of such waste,part i,at,reprinted in.congress believed that by giving citizens themselves the power to enforce rcra provisions by suing violators directly,they could speed compliance with environmental laws,as well as put pressure upon a government that was unable or unwilling to enforce such laws itself.greenpeace,waste techs,cir citing,part i,at,reprinted in,waste indus.at stating that congress expressly intended the rcra to close loopholes in environmental protection.
the city argues at one point that aceto is inapposite because it deals primarily with the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla,than the rcra.as to this rationale,we do not agree.aceto considers both cercla and rcra claims,clearly delineating between the two discussions.see at.the city also asserts that the rcra is not directed to issues regarding liability for hazardous waste as is cercla,apparently to distinguish cercla cases.first,we note that the distinction between the rcra and cercla is not that the former deals with solid waste and the latter with hazardous waste.rather,both statutes deal with both types of waste the variation arises from the fact that the rcra concerns existing dumps and the cercla deals with abandoned dumps.see et,rcra and superfund,at stating that cercla applies to abandoned sites,and rcra deals with today generators.we also do not find the city implied argument,that solid and hazardous waste be treated differently to be persuasive.there is no such indication in a b.to the contrary,the terms solid or hazardous waste in a b indicate that both are to be treated similarly.if congress had wished to treat solid waste differently under this provision,it could have done so,as it has done in other provision
