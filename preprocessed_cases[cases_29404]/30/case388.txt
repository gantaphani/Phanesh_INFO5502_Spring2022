this is an appeal from dismissal of a citizen suit brought under the clean water act.we conclude that the suit can not proceed because louisiana is diligently prosecuting an action under a comparable state law.
the appellants are landowners in and around the village of folsom,louisiana.folsom owns and operates a sewage treatment facility which discharges effluent into a ravine that abuts or traverses the private properties of the landowners.they allege that the effluent is improperly treated,and as a result violates the plant national pollutant discharge elimination permit.
on august,the locketts sent a notice of violations and notice of intent to sue letter to defendants alleging violations of the federal water pollution control act,commonly known as the clean water act cwa none of the intervening plaintiffs sent a notice letter.on november,the louisiana department of environmental quality deq issued a compliance order to the village of folsom for various violations in the operation of its water treatment facility.the order resulted in a penalty assessment issued august.
on december,the locketts sent a second notice letter to the defendants,which iterated the claims of their first letter and referenced ongoing violations.the locketts filed suit on march,under the cwa citizen suit provision the remaining appellants intervened in the suit at various times.in addition,all of the appellants but maria and aaron asevedo have intervened in the deq adjudicatory hearing concerning the penalty assessment.
the district court granted folsom motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,pointing to g,which prohibits a citizen suit when a state is diligently prosecuting an action under comparable state law.the district court also held that the plaintiffs had failed to file suit within days of sending their first notice,and therefore the exceptions found in g b ii to the bar of the citizen suits did not apply.
appellees raise for the first time the locketts standing to challenge the district court holding on the comparability of the louisiana and federal statutes the locketts challenge the district court holding that the statutes are comparable based on their assertion that the louisiana statute does not provide adequate notice and opportunity for citizen participation in enforcement actions brought by the deq.because the locketts received notice of and were allowed to intervene in the enforcement action brought by the deq,the appellees argue that there is no article iii case or controversy.
this argument is without merit and misconstrues the article iii standing inquiry.to satisfy the standing requirement of article iii in a citizen suit under the cwa,a plaintiff must show an actual or threatened injury,fairly traceable to the defendant action,and likely redress if the plaintiff prevails in the lawsuit that there was standing to bring the current suit is not challenged.the locketts now appeal the district court holding that their suit was barred when the deq brought an enforcement action under a comparable state law.the locketts are challenging the district court legal determination that the statute is comparable,not asserting that they were injured by a lack of notice or opportunity to participate in the deq action.the fact that the locketts received notice and have intervened in the deq action is irrelevant to the question of whether they have standing to sue under the citizen suit provision of the cwa and appeal an adverse ruling.clearly,the locketts can satisfy the article iii standing requirements of injury,cause,and redressability.
appellees also raise a question of subject matter jurisdiction for the first time on appeal.the argument is that although the were proper intervenors in the district court because of their state law claims,they are not proper parties to the appeal of the federal claims because they did not file notice of the intent to sue as required by the citizen suit provision,and therefore were never proper parties to the federal claims 
of course subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at anytime however,we have stated that a notice requirement in the context of a citizen suit provision,although mandatory,is not jurisdictional in the strict sense of the term,and hence may not be availed of for the first time on appeal by an appellant seeking reversal of an adverse trial court judgment on that basis.in yeutter,we reasoned that the notice requirement was more procedural than jurisdictional.the statute at issue in yeutter was the endangered species act,which is nearly identical to the notice requirement at issue here while in this case it is the appellee raising the issue for the first time on appeal,our reasoning in yeutter applies here as well.therefore,we do not decide whether the intervening parties are required to give notice of their intention to intervene under b.
the cwa provides in a that citizens may sue any person who is alleged to be in violation of an effluent standard or limitation there are two restrictions.the first is that no action may be commenced if the administrator of the epa or state has commenced and is diligently prosecuting a civil or criminal action in a court of the united states,or a state to require compliance with the standard,limitation,or order.this limitation is not applicable here,as neither the epa nor the deq has brought an action in either state or federal court.
the second limitation is found in g,and in relevant part states that any violation with respect to which a state has commenced and is diligently prosecuting an action under a state law comparable to this subsection,shall not be the subject of a civil penalty action under section of this title.this restriction is in turn subject to two exceptions,only one of which is relevant here.the limitation does not apply to actions under with respect to any violation for which 
notice of the alleged violation has been given in accordance with section b a of this title prior to commencement of an action under this subsection and an action under section a of this title with respect to such alleged violation is filed before the day after the date on which such notice is given 
the referenced notice requirement of b a states that no action under a may be commenced prior to sixty days after the plaintiff has given notice of the alleged violation i to the administrator,ii to the state in which the alleged violation occurs,and iii to any alleged violator of the standard,limitation,or order.
in summary,g states that any violation for which a state has commenced and is diligently prosecuting an action under a comparable state law shall not be the subject of a suit under a unless proper notice was given prior to the action being commenced and the citizen suit was filed within days of the notice.
we begin by determining whether the deq has commenced and is diligently prosecuting an action under a state law comparable to g the district court found that the deq commenced an administrative penalty action on november,when it issued a compliance order to folsom,and that the deq has diligently prosecuted the action appellants do not challenge that holding on appeal,and therefore the only issue before us is whether the action was brought under a comparable state law we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment on the issue of statutory preclusion 
we have never addressed this issue,but find ample guidance from the supreme court and our sister circuits.at the outset,it is important to recall that congress expressly stated that i t is the policy of the congress to recognize,preserve,and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of states to prevent,reduce,and eliminate pollution.thus,the primary function of the provision for citizen suits is to enable private parties to assist in enforcement efforts where federal and state authorities appear unwilling to act.as the supreme court stated,t he bar on citizen suits when governmental enforcement action is under way suggests that the citizen suit is meant to supplement rather than to supplant governmental action.
in light of the primary role the state plays in enforcement,the requirement that a state law be comparable to the federal statute should be read broadly to permit the states flexibility in deciding how to enforce laws.in examining this issue,the eighth circuit stated 
the common thread running through these cases finding state laws comparable is a finding that the overall regulatory scheme affords significant citizen participation,even if the state law does not contain precisely the same public notice and comment provisions as those found in the federal cwa t he comparability requirement may be satisfied so long as the state law contains comparable penalty provisions which the state is authorized to enforce,has the same overall enforcement goals as the federal cwa,provides interested citizens a meaningful opportunity to participate at significant stages of the process,and adequately safeguards their legitimate substantive interests 
appellants have asserted that the louisiana statute is not comparable to the federal statute because it lacks adequate notice and comment provisions.we must therefore determine if the louisiana statute affords significant citizen participation and provides interested citizens a meaningful opportunity to participate at significant stages of the process.
section g a,b,and c of the cwa provides for the rights of interested persons to notice of and comment on proposed civil penalties under this subsection,before issuing an order assessing a civil penalty,the epa shall provide public notice of and reasonable opportunity to comment on the proposed order any person who commented shall be given notice of any hearing on the proposed assessment and a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present evidence.if the assessed party does not elect for a hearing,any person who commented on the proposed assessment may petition for a hearing if the evidence presented in support of the petition is material and was not considered in the issuance of the order,the order shall be set aside and a hearing provided if the petition for a hearing is refused,the epa shall provide to the petitioner,and publish in the federal register,notice of and the reasons for such denial.
this procedure ensures that the public has notice of any proposed assessment,and that any interested person has an opportunity to comment,an opportunity to participate in any hearing,and the right to a hearing if the assessed party opts not to have one when they have material evidence not considered by the epa.
the louisiana statute provides comparable opportunity for interested citizens to participate in the agency action,although the approach differs from the approach of the cwa.under the louisiana revised statute et,the deq does not notify the public of any compliance order or penalty assessment before it is issued however,the secretary of the deq is required to maintain a list of all notices of violations,compliance orders,and penalty assessments issued in the preceding three months which shall be updated monthly on a periodic basis a copy of this list shall be mailed separately or as part of a department publication,to persons who request to be on the mailing list thus,there is public notification of agency enforcement actions,and an opportunity to participate before the action becomes final,as we will explain.
once the deq issues an order,one of three things happens the respondent exercises his right to a hearing the respondent and the deq enter into a settlement or compromise or,the respondent agrees to comply without a hearing.
in the first situation,when the respondent elects to have an adjudicatory hearing,louisiana revised statute.e and.i require that the public be given an opportunity to submit comments.any aggrieved party has the right to intervene as a party in the hearing when the intervention is unlikely to unduly broaden the issues or unduly impede the resolution of the matter.
in the second situation,when a settlement or compromise is proposed,the deq is required to take public comment before signing in addition,notice must be given to a person who has requested notice and the respondent is required to publish notice of the proposed settlement in the official journal of the parish the deq may hold a public hearing if either people have filed a written request for a public hearing,or there is a significant degree of public interest.the public may present evidence,oral statements,opinions,or the like at any public hearing 
in the final situation,when the respondent elects to comply without an adjudicatory hearing,an aggrieved person may request one the secretary of deq may grant the request when equity and justice require it.any request must be filed within thirty days of notice to the respondent of the order the secretary may grant an untimely petition for an adjudicatory hearing when the untimeliness is the result of excusable neglect.if an adjudicatory hearing is granted,public comments may be filed and an aggrieved party may intervene 
in summary,under louisiana law there is periodic notice to persons who request to be on the mailing list of all violations,compliance orders and penalty assessments issued in the preceding three months,and public notice is required in the case of a proposed settlement or compromise.an aggrieved party may intervene in an adjudicatory hearing,or petition for an adjudicatory hearing if none is held.the public may comment on the matter prior to the adjudicatory hearing,but may not participate in the hearing.if a public hearing is held,the public may participate fully.
while the notice and comment provisions of the louisiana statute are not identical to the federal statute,the statute affords significant citizen participation and provides interested citizens a meaningful opportunity to participate at significant stages of the process and is thus comparable to the federal statute.
appellants argue that the deq is given too much discretion by the louisiana statute,particularly in determining whether to allow intervention of aggrieved persons in adjudicatory hearings and in determining whether to grant an aggrieved person request for an adjudicatory hearing when none is scheduled.appellants argue that this makes the louisiana statute similar to the one in jones,which the sixth circuit determined was not comparable to the federal statute because the tennessee statute permits the state to declare citizen or public participation duplicitous or frivolous,so that the plaintiffs and other similarly situated citizens can be frozen out of commencing an original action,or intervening in an ongoing state enforcement action.we do not agree.
while the deq is given discretion in allowing intervention or granting a petition for a hearing,the discretion is reasonably constructed to prevent abuse of the process and is subject to judicial review this discretion is similar to the provision in g of the cwa,which requires the epa to grant a petition for a hearing only if the evidence to be presented is material and was not considered in the issuance of the order.as such,this discretion does not deny citizens an opportunity to participate in the process,and as mentioned above,adequate notice is provided as well.
we therefore conclude that the deq was diligently prosecuting an action under a comparable state law.as a result,appellants citizen suit brought pursuant to is barred under g a unless it falls under one of the exceptions found in g b.
the limitation on citizen suits found in g a is subject to two exceptions.the first applies to civil suits filed prior to the commencement of the action by the state or the epa this exception does not apply here,as the instant suit was filed on march,several months after the deq initiated its action by sending a compliance order to folsom on november.the second exception requires that notice of intent to sue be given prior to the commencement of the state action,and that the citizen suit be filed within days of such notice we find that the appellants suit does not satisfy this exception.
the locketts sent their first notice of their intent to sue on august.this letter was mailed to the required parties,and in an attached appendix a adequately listed the alleged violations.pur
