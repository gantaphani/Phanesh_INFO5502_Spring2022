we address in this proceeding five petitions seeking review of two separate rules promulgated by the environmental protection agency epa the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for industrial,commercial,and institutional boilers and process heaters,as amended on,boilers rule,promulgated pursuant to section of the clean air act caa,and the standards of performance for new stationary sources and emission guidelines for existing sources commercial and industrial solid waste incineration units,ciswi definitions rule,amending standards of performance for new stationary sources and emissions guidelines for existing sources commercial and industrial solid waste incineration units,ciswi rule,promulgated pursuant to caa section.four environmental natural resources defense council,the sierra club,the environmental integrity project and the louisiana environmental action network collectively,environmental petitioners challenge the ciswi definitions rule on the ground that its narrow definition of commercial or industrial waste contradicts the plain language of caa section and therefore impermissibly constricts the class of solid waste incineration unit s that are subject to the emission standards of the ciswi rule.the environmental petitioners also challenge specific emission standards that epa promulgated in the boilers rule and epa methodology for setting them.a second set of american municipal,and six of its members,the cities of dover,hamilton,orrville,painesville,shelby and mary,collectively,municipal petitioners challenges the boilers rule on the grounds that epa failed to comply with the requirements of the regulatory flexibility act,et,and that the standards as applied to small municipal utilities are unlawful.for the reasons set out below,we conclude that epa definition of commercial or industrial waste,as incorporated in the definition of commercial and industrial solid waste incineration unit ciswi unit,is inconsistent with the plain language of section and that the ciswi definitions rule must therefore be vacated.we further conclude that,because the boilers rule must be substantially revised as a consequence of our vacatur and remand of the ciswi definitions rule,the boilers rule as well must be vacated.
we first set out the statutory and regulatory background of the two challenged rules.
a.the boilers rule 
caa section requires epa to set a national emission standard for each category or subcategory of major sources of hazardous air pollutant hap emissions,d,that is,of stationary sources that emit or have potential to emit tons per year or more of any hap or tons per year or more of any combination of haps,id.a section,as in effect until,directed the epa administrator to establish any such standard at the level which in his judgment provides an ample margin of safety to protect the public health from such hazardous air pollutant.b b.in,the congress amended section to require standards in place of the previous standards.clean air act amendments,stat.under the caa amendments,epa sets emission standards based on the maximum achievable control technology or mact in a process.
first,epa identifies a mact floor for each pollutant and source category.for new sources of hap emissions,the mact floor is the emission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source,as determined by the epa administrator for existing sources,the mact floor is the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing percent of the existing sources or,if there are fewer than sources,the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing sources.d.in the second step of the process,epa selects as its standard either the applicable mact floor identified in the first stage or a beyond the floor limitation more stringent than the mact if such a standard is achievable in light of costs and other factors and methods listed in section d.see generally cement kiln recycling coal.epa,per curiam explaining mact process for hazardous waste combustors lime ass epa,explaining mact process for portland cement manufacturing plants.
on september,epa issued the boilers rule,which identified subcategories of boilers emitting four different types of haps.see.at.epa set out to establish the mact floor for each subcategory emitting each hap according to the effectiveness of various technologies.see,proposed rule.applying this methodology,epa set numerical emission standards.for the remaining boiler emissions,epa determined that the appropriate mact floor was no emissions reduction because the sources were not achieving emissions reductions through the use of an emission control system and there were no other appropriate methods by which boilers and process heaters could reduce hap emissions.at.accordingly,epa adopted a no control standard,and,in addition,it set standards,also known as standards,as alternatives to the standards for hydrogen chloride and manganese.id.at.
on november,the municipal petitioners filed a petition for review of the boilers rule,challenging its regulatory flexibility act certification and its treatment of small municipal utilities.the same day,the environmental petitioners filed both a petition for judicial review of the boilers rule and an administrative petition for reconsideration by epa,challenging the no control standard and the alternatives.by notice published june,epa granted reconsideration in part and solicited comments on the compliance alternative for manganese in particular and,in general,the methodology for demonstrating eligibility for and compliance with alternatives.june.on july,the environmental petitioners filed a petition for review of the reconsideration notice insofar as it denied reconsideration in other respects.on december,epa issued a reconsideration decision which modified the alternative methodology.the environmental petitioners then filed another petition for review of the boilers rule on february.
b.the ciswi definitions rule 
in addition to amending section,the caa amendments also added section,which requires epa to establish specific performance standards,including emission limitations,for solid waste incineration units generally,a a,and,in particular,for solid waste incineration units combusting commercial or industrial waste,id.a d.section defines solid waste incineration unit as a distinct operating unit of any facility which combusts any solid waste material from commercial or industrial establishments or the general public including single and multiple residences,hotels,and motels.id.g emphases added.the statute includes four express exceptions to this definition for units requiring a permit under,materials recovery facilities which combust waste for the primary purpose of recovering metals,qualifying small power production facilities and cogeneration facilities which combust homogeneous waste for the production of electric energy or for the production of electric energy and steam or forms of useful energy such as heat which are used for industrial,commercial,heating or cooling purposes and qualifying air curtain incinerators that burn only wood wastes,yard wastes and clean lumber.id.g.
like the section standards,section standards are based on a mact floor,which is substantially the same as under section for new sources,it is the emissions control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar unit for existing units,it is the average emissions limitation achieved by the best performing percent of units in the category.id.a.also,as with section standards,epa is to establish an standard if epa determines it is achievable taking into account costs and other factors.see ne.waste disposal auth.epa,per curiam.although section establishes emission requirements virtually identical to section,lime ass epa,at,the statutes nonetheless differ in two respects of particular significance here.first,as noted above,section mact standards apply only to major sources of hap emissions,while section mact standards apply across the board to all solid waste incineration disposal units in a given category.compare d the epa administrator shall promulgate regulations establishing emission standards for each category or subcategory of major sources and area sources of hazardous air pollutants listed for regulation pursuant to subsection c of this section with id.a a the epa administrator shall establish performance standards and other requirements pursuant to and this section for each category of solid waste incineration units.second,section requires that emission standards be set for certain pollutants that are not classified as section haps at least not in section initial list,see supra note and therefore are not subject to section mact standards,sulphur dioxide,nitrogen oxides and particulate matter.compare id.a with id.b.finally,the congress made section standards and section standards mutually exclusive by directing that no solid waste incineration unit subject to performance standards under this section and shall be subject to standards under section d.id.h.
on december,epa issued the ciswi rule,setting emission standards for commercial and industrial solid waste incinerators pursuant to section.the sierra club filed a petition for review and the louisiana environmental action network and the national wildlife federation filed a petition for reconsideration by epa,objecting that epa had not subjected the rule definitions to comment.epa granted the motion for reconsideration and filed a motion for voluntary remand,which the court granted on september.
on remand,epa solicited comments on the ciswi rule definitions of solid waste,commercial and industrial waste and ciswi unit.standards of performance for new stationary sources and emission guidelines for existing sources commercial or industrial solid waste incineration units.on september,after receiving comments,epa issued the ciswi definitions rule,which,as relevant here,contains definitions that are substantively the same as before reconsideration.the ciswi definitions rule defines a commercial or industrial solid waste incineration unit,in relevant part,as any combustion unit that combusts commercial or industrial waste as defined in this subpart and then defines commercial or industrial waste to include only waste that is combusted at a facility that can not or does not use a process that recovers thermal energy from the combustion for a useful purpose.at codified at the environmental petitioners filed a petition for review of the ciswi definitions rule on november.
ciswi definitions rule 
the environmental petitioners challenge epa definition of ciswi unit insofar as it incorporates epa definition of commercial or industrial waste,asserting that it is inconsistent with the plain language of section.we review the environmental petitioners challenge to epa interpretation of section under the framework established in chevron natural resources defense council,d.see ne.waste disposal,at chevron governs our review of industry petitioners claim that the rule conflicts with a.under chevron 
we first ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,in which case we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,however,we move to the second step and defer to the agency interpretation as long as it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.
bluewater network epa,quoting chevron,at.we agree with the environmental petitioners that epa definition of commercial or industrial waste,as incorporated in the definition of ciswi units,stumbles on chevron first step because it conflicts with the plain language of section.
section on its face applies to solid waste incineration units generally,a a,and specifically to solid waste incineration units combusting commercial or industrial waste,id.a d.the statute further expressly defines t he term solid waste incineration unit plainly and broadly to include a distinct operating unit of any facility which combusts any solid waste material from commercial or industrial establishments or the general public including single and multiple residences,hotels,and motels.id.g emphases added.the word any is usually understood to be all inclusive.fin.planning ass sec,see new york epa,in a series of cases,the supreme court has drawn upon the word any to give the word it modifies an expansive meaning when there is no reason to contravene the clause obvious meaning.quoting norfolk rwy.kirby,d citing hud rucker,d united states gonzales,d.applying the usual meaning here,we interpret section under chevron step to unambiguously include among the incineration units subject to its standards any facility that combusts any commercial or industrial solid waste material at to the four statutory exceptions identified above.see supra.the definition epa promulgated in the ciswi definitions rule,however,constricts the scope of this plain,broad language.
the ciswi definitions rule defines the term ciswi unit to include any combustion unit that combusts commercial or industrial waste as defined in this subpart.at emphasis added.the same subpart,however,defines commercial or industrial waste narrowly to include only solid waste that is combusted at any commercial or industrial facility using controlled flame combustion in an enclosed,distinct operating unit whose design does not provide for energy recovery as defined in this subpart or operated without energy recovery as defined in this subpart.at codified at.epa defines the term energy recovery,in turn,as the process of recovering thermal energy from combustion for useful purposes such as steam generation or process heating.id.codified at.the effect of these definitions is to substantially reduce the number of commercial or industrial waste combustors subject to section standards by exempting from coverage any commercial or industrial incinerator combusting solid waste if the combustion unit design permits thermal recovery or the combustion process in fact recovers thermal such a unit plainly fits the statutory definition of solid waste incineration unit as any facility which combusts any solid waste material from commercial or industrial establishments,g emphases added.in the rulemaking,epa asserted its definition simply resolves an ambiguity created by the congress failure to provide a statutory definition of commercial or industrial waste.see ciswi definitions rule.at caa section is ambiguous because it does not contain definitions of certain terms s ection does not define commercial or industrial waste.inherent in epa implementation of this statutory provision is the discretion to reasonably define what constitutes this undefined type of solid waste.we have previously rejected just such an argument,stating unequivocally there is no such rule of law.goldstein sec.as we there explained,t he lack of a statutory definition of a word does not necessarily render the meaning of a word ambiguous,just as the presence of a definition does not necessarily make the meaning clear.id.here,the statutory definition of solid waste incineration unit is clear and unambiguous as epa acknowledges as much when it objects to a literal reading of the definition language.see epa br.at asserting that a literal interpretation of the definition of solid waste incineration unit in section g,g,would require epa to treat as an incinerator any facility that combusts any amount of solid waste from a commercial or industrial source.epa offers three other arguments to support its definition of commercial and industrial waste,none of them any more persuasive.
first,epa asserts the legislative history of section supports its position that any,as used in the statutory definition of ciswi to modify solid waste,was intended to bear a narrower meaning in context than it has in common usage,epa br.at,thereby allowing thermal energy recovery facilities to be exempted from the definition of solid waste incineration unit.bell atl.fcc,stating supreme court has specifically held that in context the word any may be construed in a fashion citing united states,d.in particular,epa points to remarks made by three senators during debate which acknowledged a solid waste disposal crisis and supported recycling and recovering resources in the solid waste disposal notably,the remarks of one senator in support of the express statutory exemptions for secondary materials recovery facilities from these requirements because their specific purpose is to recover valuable materials and for facilities regulated under the public utilities regulatory policy act.see epa brief at citing a legislative history of the clean air act amendments of comm.print id.id.at id.at.it is true that we may examine the statute legislative history in order to shed new light on congressional intent,notwithstanding statutory language that appears superficially clear.consumer elecs.ass fcc,quoting rifle ass reno,quoting natural res.def.council,browner.but the bar is high,id.quoting williams ferc,and only rarely have we relied on legislative history to constrict the otherwise broad application of a statute indicated by its text,id.here,epa can not clear the high bar relying solely on the isolated remarks of a few senators.davis county solid waste mgmt.epa,finding contradictory comments of individual senators during section debates too meager a record to rely on given the clear statutory language to the contrary quoting engine mfrs.ass epa.in any event,the remarks that epa cites,when viewed in the context of the express and unambiguous provisions in the statute,show only that when the congress wanted to exempt a particular kind of solid waste combustor from section on the desirability of resource recovery or any other knew how to accomplish this through an express statutory exception and in fact did so for four specific classes of combustion units.see g.had the congress intended to exempt all units that combust waste for the purpose of recovering thermal energy,it could likewise have expressly provided for their exemption in the statute.see sierra club epa,if statute details the conditions in which epa may extend the attainment deadline,w e can not but infer from the presence of these specific exemptions that the absence of any other exemption for the transport of ozone was deliberate,and that the agency attempt to grant such a dispensation is contrary to the intent of the congress trw andrews,d where congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition,additional exceptions are not to be implied,in the absence of evidence of a contrary legislative intent.quoting andrus glover constr,d.but the congress did epa may not,consistent with chevron,create an additional exception on its own.in sum,i n this context,there is no reason the usual tools of statutory construction should not apply and hence no reason why any should not mean any.new york epa.in new york epa,the court rejected epa narrow construction of the statutory definition of modification,contained in caa section,as any physical change in,or change in the method of operation of,a stationary source which increases the amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source or which results in the emission of any air pollutant not previously emitted,a emphasis added.the court accorded an expansive meaning to the term any,at,thereby expanding the class of new sources subject to new source emission standards.see a defining new source as any stationary source,the construction or modification of which is commenced after the publication of regulations prescribing a standard of performance under this section which will be applicable to such source emphasis added id.b requiring epa to establish emission standards for new sources.the court explained that the context of the clean air act warrants no departure from the word customary effect.new york epa,at.we likewise give an expansive reading to any to increase the number of ciswi units subject to section emission standards,reading sections and in pari materia.bluewater network,at reading caa a in pari materia with caa l as.
second,epa contends that b y specifying that the classification of a source turns on its primary function,the ciswi definitions rule reasonably distinguishes between incinerators,which are designed to discard materials by burning them at high temperatures and leaving as little residue as possible,and boilers,which are designed to recover the maximum amount of heat from a material combustion.epa br.at quoting summary of public comments and responses,at ja.the distinction epa draws may well be reasonable but it is not the line drawn by the congress in section to separate a ciswi unit from a boiler when it unambiguously defined the former term as any facility which combusts any solid waste material,g emphasis added.this plain statutory language halts our review at chevron step.
finally,epa asserts that section h,which makes section and section standards mutually exclusive by directing that no solid waste incineration unit subject to performance standards under section and shall be subject to standards under section d,implicitly gave epa the discretion to implement the requirements of section in a way that avoids results inconsistent with the statutory purpose.epa br.at.epa reasons that section exclusivity language directs epa to make the mact standards mutually exclusive but does not tell epa how to accomplish this task,instead leaving the details to epa considered judgment.id.we perceive no such gap in the statute,which simply directs epa in plain terms to subject a solid waste combustion facility exclusively to section standards,and not to section,if the facility fits section clear definition of solid waste incineration unit.the provision gives epa a straightforward directive to draw the distinction based solely on the applicability vel non of section definition.it confers no discretion in this respect,either express or implied.
boilers rule 
having determined that epa definition of solid waste incineration unit conflicts with the plain meaning of section and must therefore be vacated,we next address the environmental petitioners and the municipal petitioners challenges to the boilers rule and conclude they are premature as the boilers rule can not survive as currently promulgated.
as the environmental petitioners noted at oral argument,if the court requires epa to revise the ciswi definitions rule,as we do in this opinion,the boilers rule will need to be revised as well because the universe of boilers subject to its standards will be far smaller and more homogenous after all ciswi units,as the statute unambiguously defines them,are removed from its coverage.see natural res.def.council epa,nos et,oral argument tr.at.given the likelihood if not certainty that the boilers rule will change substantially as a result of our vacatur of the challenged solid waste definition,we believe the boilers rule should be vacated in its entirety and remanded for epa to repromulgate after revising the ciswi definitions rule.friends of the earth,epa,remanding to district court with instruction to vacate daily load limits on effluent discharges as inconsistent with statutory language it is therefore premature to consider the environmental petitioners or the municipal petitioners challenges to the current rule.power epa,vacating rule and declining to resolve issue rendered moot thereby.
in choosing to vacate rather than simply remand the ciswi definitions rule and the boilers rule,we disagree with our dissenting colleague who would not vacate either of the rules because the court has traditionally not vacated the rule if doing so would have adverse implications for public health and the environment.dissent at citing sierra club epa,lime ass epa,at.we find the cited cases distinguishable from the situation here.
as a result of our decision today,neither of the two rules survives remand in anything approaching recognizable form.as the environmental petitioners point out,our rejection of epa definition of commercial or industrial waste,as incorporated in the definition of ciswi,will shift thousands of units that are currently regulated under the section boilers rule into the ciswi category,subject to regulation under section and a s a result,the populations of units subject to epa boilers and ciswi rules will change substantially,requiring that epa recalculate the stringency of the emissions standards for the newly expanded ciswi category and the newly shrunk boilers category.envtl.pet rs br.at.by contrast,in declining to vacate the standard successfully challenged in sierra club,the court expressly noted it was possible that epa may be able to explain it on remand,at.in national lime association,we remanded because epa failed to consider quality health and environmental impacts of potential standards for hap metals,and because it relied on a factually incorrect assertion in rejecting such standards.at.in neither case did our decision foreclose epa from promulgating the same standards on remand.
moreover,we find this case much like cement kiln recycling coal.epa,per curiam,in which we vacated the challenged emission standards,notwithstanding the environmental petitioners request to leave them intact,because we had chosen not to reach the bulk of industry petitioners claims,and leaving the regulations in place during remand would ignore petitioners potentially meritorious challenges.at.similarly here,we elect not to address potentially meritorious challenges to the boilers rule raised by the municipal epa violated the caa by failing to create a separate subcategory for small municipal utilities.
in light of the need for wholesale revision on remand of both the ciswi definitions rule and the boilers rule and the effect that leaving the boilers rule in place would have on the municipal petitioners,we believe the appropriate course is to vacate the rules in their entirety.to remedy the resulting lack of standards,any party may file a motion to delay issuance of the mandate to request either that the current standards remain in place or that epa be allowed reasonable time to develop interim standards.cement kiln,at citing columbia falls aluminum epa.
for the foregoing reasons,we grant the environmental petitioners petitions for review of the ciswi definitions rule and consequently vacate and remand both the ciswi definitions rule and the boilers rule.we further dismiss as moot both the environmental petitioners and the municipal petitioners petitions for review of the vacated boilers rule,and.
so ordered.
i write separately to address the question whether a court,after finding agency action unlawful,should remand the case to the agency without vacating the illegal rule or order.in cases governed by the administrative procedure act,i have long believed that the law requires us to vacate the unlawful agency rule.see.i also believe that in cases such as this,in which apa does not apply,vacating and remanding should be the preferred course.
contrary to the apparent view of judge rogers,our precedents on this question fall into no particular pattern.often we vacate and remand.sometimes we simply remand.rarely do we explain why we favored one disposition over the other.and sometimes it is not even clear what disposition we intended our court remedial judgment varies even in seemingly identical cases involving the same agency.this inconsistent treatment of cases has not gone unnoticed.see kristina daugirdas,note,evaluating remand without vacatur a new judicial remedy for defective agency rulemakings.
in the past,when we have vacated rules or orders and remanded to the agency,we have indicated that we would entertain a motion for a stay of the mandate while the agency took corrective action there are several reasons why we should prefer this course in cases like this one in which the court has some remedial discretion.vacating an order or rule and then considering a stay motion has several distinct advantages over just remanding.in the first place,it preserves the adversarial process decisions are almost always reached without input from the parties.the briefs scarcely ever deal with the remedial question.that is perfectly understandable.it may be impossible for petitioners,agencies,or intervenors to anticipate exactly how the court decision will come out.there may be challenges to many rules or many aspects of one rule.the court may uphold some and reject others.different consequences can result from different combinations.besides,agencies,in their presentations to the court,do not relish anticipating a loss.no litigant does.to require the parties to address the subject in each case would waste their time and the court in all cases in which the agency prevails.
the upshot is that decisions are being made without sufficient information,which is one of the main reasons the cases are so difficult to reconcile.in contrast,stay motions enable us to decide with our eyes open.the court will have the benefit of hearing from all sides.in deciding whether to allow unlawful agency action to remain in place during the remand by way of a stay,the court will have the evidence needed to assess the consequences.and that decision can be made in accordance with this court principles governing harm,probability of success,public interest,and so forth.see.petroleum jobbers fpc,per curiam.metro.area transit comm holiday tours.gas ferc,per curiam cuomo nuclear regulatory comm n,per curiam.
the existence of a stay with time limits,rather than an remand without vacating,will give the agency an incentive to act in a reasonable time,given the other constraints on its resources.when we simply remand the agency has no such incentive.a disposition is,in effect,an indefinite stay of the effectiveness of the court decision and agencies naturally treat it as such.see daugirdas,supra,at.
notice too the distortion of the proper allocation of burdens among the parties.when the case is simply remanded,and the agency drags its feet,the winning party only recourse is to bring a mandamus petition and clear all the hurdles such actions entail.on the other hand,in proceedings on motions for stays the burden is where it should the losing agency,which will have to convince the court that private parties should be required to comply with an illegal order or rule while the agency responds to the ruling against it.if an extension of time is needed,the burden will remain on the losing agency.
one final thought.a disposition may unfairly deprive parties of the opportunity to obtain supreme court review of our decision on the merits.if a district court merely remands a case to an agency,we hold that there is no final judgment to appeal.see in re charles preservation investors,per curiam observing rule that a district court order remanding a case to an agency for significant further proceedings is not final see also pueblo of sandia babbitt,holding that appellate court lacked jurisdiction to review district court order remanding to agency for further proceedings.it is entirely possible that the supreme court would take the same view of our dispositions and hold that there is no final order suitable for its review.
i join the court in holding that the final rule on the standards of performance for new stationary sources and emissions guidelines for existing source commercial and industrial solid waste incineration units definitions rule,is contrary to the plain text of the clean air act.i also agree that,as a result,the related rule,the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for industrial,commercial,and institutional boilers and process heaters boilers rule,must be substantially revised.where i differ is on the appropriate remedy.
the reality in this case is that the question of whether to vacate or remand the rules has been fully addressed by the parties.the initial discussion in the parties briefs was supplemented by a series of motions and responses by the parties.thus,the adversarial process has been observed.the question,then,is whether the parties have persuaded the court of the appropriate remedy.the court has no reason to postpone a decision on the question in this case.the fact that over the years the court remedies in different cases fail to reveal a consistent pattern,see concurring opinion of randolph,does not pose an obstacle to proceeding now nor necessarily mean that the remedial responses in particular cases were inappropriate.the particular circumstances in the cases that come before the court involving a variety of regulatory schemes may well mean tha
