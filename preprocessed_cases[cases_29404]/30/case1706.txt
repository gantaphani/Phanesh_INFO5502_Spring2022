james bonzi,executor of the estate of rudy bonzi,filed a petition for an order confirming the sale of real property that was part of the estate,which has been in probate since rudy bonzi death in.the people of the state of california ex rel.california regional water quality control board,central valley region rwb,and ex rel.california department of resources recycling and recovery calrecycle collectively respondents,filed an objection to that petition.respondents contended the net proceeds of the sale of the property were subject to a stipulated court order that required real property jointly owned by rudy and mary bonzi be sold to satisfy the bonzis statutory obligation to remediate and close a solid waste landfill they owned and operated.the trial court agreed with respondents and found the sale proceeds subject to payment under that court order.
james bonzi,as executor for the estate of rudy bonzi,and thad bettencourt,as executor of the estate of mary bonzi and trustee of the mary bonzi novation general trust collectively appellants,appeal,contending respondents did not have standing to enforce the stipulated court order,respondents are barred from enforcing the order because they failed to file a creditor claim as required by probate code section and there is insufficient evidence to support the trial court finding of estoppel.finding no merit in appellants assertions of error,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
rudy and mary bonzi were married in beginning in,they jointly owned and operated a acre licensed solid waste disposal facility,the bonzi sanitation landfill,in modesto the bonzi landfill.the bonzi landfill was operated by bonzi sanitation landfill,a general partnership bonzi sanitation,on property owned by ma ru holding company,a california corporation ma ru.rudy and mary were the sole shareholders of ma ru and the sole partners of bonzi sanitation.
the bonzi landfill is subject to regulation by the rwb,a state agency that is authorized and responsible for ensuring the prevention and abatement of water pollution and nuisance within the central valley region,including stanislaus county,and authorized to issue orders and request the filing of civil actions to carry out this responsibility,et,et as early as,groundwater pollution was discovered at the bonzi landfill the rwb began issuing a series of administrative orders which required the evaluation and remediation of the contamination,including cease and desist order,cleanup and abatement order,and waste discharge requirements order.the bonzi landfill was also subject to regulation by calrecycle and its predecessor,the california integrated waste management board ciwmb.calrecycle is a state agency that administers programs formerly managed by ciwmb,including regulatory oversight of solid waste landfills.pub.resources code,et.
all landfills in california,including the bonzi landfill,are under state mandate to create and fund plans for their ultimate closure and maintenance.pub.resources code,subd.a.to ensure funds will be available to perform these activities and pay for corrective actions,a landfill owner or operator is required to establish a trust fund,or an equivalent financial arrangement acceptable to calrecycle,commonly referred to as financial assurances.pub.resources code,subd.a b,tit,subd.a.the legislature imposed the financial assurances requirement to achieve the protection of air,water,and land from pollution due to the disposal of solid waste.pub.resources code.in accordance with the statutory financial assurance requirements,rudy and mary established and began funding a landfill trust account for the bonzi landfill the landfill trust.as of,the landfill trust was being held by union safe deposit bank,stockton,california,as trustee.

the dissolution action 
in,mary filed a petition to dissolve her marriage to rudy in stanislaus county superior court,case number,which was later renumbered to the dissolution action.a major concern of both parties in the dissolution action was their joint obligation to fund the cleanup and closure of the bonzi landfill.to address this issue,rudy proposed selling their jointly owned real property to fund the landfill trust.at that time,estimated closure and costs that needed to be funded totaled approximately million the landfill trust reserve,however,was only.mary opposed this plan,asserting that the law did not require the total amount of the closure and costs be deposited in full,and the funding of these costs should be treated as any other community obligation.
in november,an order was filed in the dissolution action entitled final tentative decision the order.the order incorporated stipulations between the bonzis that had been entered into the clerk minutes during the dissolution trial.among other things,the bonzis stipulated that they would each have a percent ownership interest in the bonzi businesses,including the bonzi landfill,and an exhibit attached to the order would state how the parties would be required to assure there would be funds available to satisfy the remediation and closure costs.the bonzis acknowledged in the order that g overnmental regulations have placed husband and wife in the position of having to fund approximately in the ensuing years to remediate ground water contamination and to close the dump.as conceded by both parties,this as a practical matter requires them to continue with joint ownership of those businesses,long past their matrimonial separation.this has further led both parties to further stipulate that they will remain joint owners of the remainder of their businesses.
the exhibit attached to the order,labeled exhibit a,is entitled proposed order re groundwater remediation,closure,post closure of the bonzi san i tation landfill the proposed remediation order.the proposed remediation order provides that the bonzis,including their agents and representatives,shall comply with any of the appropriate county,state,and federal governmental agencies pertaining to the groundwater remediation,closure,and of the bonzi landfill obligations relating to groundwater remediation,closure and are community in nature the bonzis are to fund these obligations first from revenues from their waste disposal business and,if those funds are insufficient,they are to take the steps necessary to encumber or sell real property they own together as tenants in common to ensure there are sufficient assets to fund these obligations,the bonzis may not sell or transfer any of their interests in jointly owned real property or the waste disposal business without court approval the court retained jurisdiction over the subject matter to ensure compliance or make additional orders and the bonzis shall record the proposed remediation order with the county recorders in san joaquin,stanislaus,merced and tuolumne counties,in order to lien their jointly owned real property interests.
when the order was entered,the jointly owned real property subject to the order included property at morgan road,ceres,california morgan property and farrar avenue,modesto,california farrar property.
the administration of rudy estate 
rudy died on december,one month after marrying lynda clark bonzi.the following day,a petition to administer rudy will was filed in stanislaus county superior court letters of administration were issued on december.in,the court appointed rudy son,james bonzi,as a of rudy estate james was appointed the sole executor in december.rudy estate remains under the administration of the probate division of the stanislaus county superior court in case number the probate case 
rudy estate continued to fund the landfill trust.for example,in february,the of rudy estate stated in a letter to the financial assurance section of the ciwmb that he was sending additional money for the landfill trust and that the court had cleared the way for funding the needed expenses for the landfill closure account.
the remediation order 
in august,james and his filed their attorney declaration in the dissolution action.the attorney,kenneth mello,stated he did not believe the order had been entered as a judgment,and the proposed remediation order attached to the order was not recorded in the counties listed therein.mello asked the court to sign the proposed remediation order so it could be recorded.
in response,on august,the court issued an order re groundwater remediation,closure,and post closure of the bonzi sanitation landfill the remediation order,which contains the exact same provisions as the proposed remediation order.the court entered the remediation order nunc pro tunc as of november.the remediation order was recorded with the stanislaus county recorder that month 
after this,mello acknowledged in a letter to an escrow officer that both mary and rudy estate were obligated to fund the financial assurance requirements under the remediation order,and half of the proceeds from the recent sale of property was subject to the remediation order and should be paid to the bonzi landfill business for funding the landfill trust.
the disputes regarding funding of the landfill trust 
in,a dispute arose over the funding of the landfill trust.in a january letter,mary attorney asked mary sons,james and steve bonzi,for an accounting of property that mary jointly owned with rudy estate,which had been sold,the proceeds of which she understood had been deposited into the landfill trust.mary attorney stated that mary was requesting exact dollar amounts of her share of these properties and mary intended to cooperate with any sale of assets in order to fund the landfill cleanup recovery.
in february,james filed a petition in the probate case,in which he asked that proceeds from the sale of properties owned by mary and rudy estate be paid into the landfill trust to offset the deficiency in that account and to comply with ciwmb requirements.james also asked the court to order the parties to comply with the remediation order.in addition,james filed an amendment to a petition for an order confirming the sale of real property,in which he requested that the sellers abide by the terms of the remediation order,thereby ensuring that the proceeds of the sale due to the sellers herein be made payable to the bonzi sanitation landfill closure account.
in june,james stated in his supporting declaration that he believed it was clear from the remediation order that the court intended both parties to provide funds and security for the landfill cleanup,in conformity with that order,the court previously had ordered the proceeds from the sales of the interest of rudy estate in jointly held properties be held in a blocked account pending determination of whether the proceeds should be applied to the,and because mary property interests were subject to the same order,he asked for an order directing mary to deposit the proceeds of the sale of two properties,and of any future sales of jointly held properties,into a blocked account.in a june,minute order,the court in the probate case ordered the estate interest in sale proceeds be placed in a blocked account,and set a hearing on james requests.
in a july response to the petition,mary attorney stated that mary would not oppose the sale if of her portion of the sales proceeds was deposited into her checking account,with the remainder deposited into the landfill trust.
mary attorney explained in a declaration filed in september that the dispute came before the court due to rudy estate alleged need to sell jointly owned real property in order to adequately fund the landfill trust pursuant to the remediation order,mary and rudy were to fund the obligations of the landfill trust first from revenues of the waste disposal business and then from the sale or encumbrance of real property james and steve bonzi had asserted the revenues from the bonzi businesses were insufficient to fund the landfill trust and the issue for trial was whether the business revenues were sufficient and whether mary had been credited properly for her contributions to the landfill trust.the attorney further stated that while mary agreed it was necessary for the parties to take immediate action to assure that the ciwmb did not cancel the bonzi landfill permit because of the failure to resolve financial assurance issues,she disagreed that the only way to accomplish that was to hold all funds in the blocked account and place the funds from future real property sales into that account.instead,mary was willing to immediately fund her percent share of the current deficiency in the landfill trust if rudy estate was willing to do the same,there would be no risk that the ciwmb would cancel the permit.mary was willing to fund her half of the deficiency from her share of the proceeds from the sale of jointly owned properties.
in an october order filed in the dissolution action,the court stated it found mary agreed to pay her share of the proceeds for the sale of one property to the landfill trust,except for.consequently,the court ordered that mary be paid and the balance of her share of the sales proceeds be paid to the landfill trust in partial satisfaction of her share of the obligation to ciwmb for the landfill closure.
the transfer of funds from a blocked account to the landfill trust 
in january,james petitioned in the probate case to transfer funds from the blocked account to the landfill trust.james asserted that the time for filing claims had expired and all claims filed against rudy estate had been paid,and that both mary and rudy estate were obligated to the ciwmb pertaining to the closure and of the bonzi landfill,which had a deficiency of nearly.james requested that funds in the blocked account from the sale of jointly owned real properties be released in order to bring current rudy estate share of the landfill trust,and mary be ordered to pay half of the remaining deficiency.
mary joined in this petition she agreed to contribute her half of the deficiency after money from the blocked account was transferred to pay rudy estate share of the deficiency.mary noted that the closure account is mandated by the california integrated waste management board.while the account is not a payment to the board,and in fact the board does not have an interest in or claim to this money,it must be maintained in the account.should the deficiencies in the account not be rectified,the board can,and likely will,begin proceedings against the bonzi sanitation landfill.
on march,the court approved the distribution to the landfill trust of mary interest in funds received from the sale of property she had owned with rudy,which was being held in a blocked account,to be credited toward mary share of the obligation to the ciwmb for the landfill closure.
the rwb order 
in april,the rwb issued cease and desist order no,which found ma ru and bonzi sanitation had discharged waste at the bonzi landfill contrary to requirements.the order required ma ru and bonzi sanitation to address operational issues that contributed to the discharge,as well as to update the financial assurances.ma ru and bonzi sanitation were ordered to submit an annual review of the financial assurance for closure and maintenance each year on april,and ensure that the financial assurance provide that the funds for closure and maintenance name the rwb as beneficiary and be available to the rwb upon the issuance of any order under california water code,division,chapter.
the dispute over the estate obligation to fund the landfill trust 
in,a dispute arose in the probate case regarding the estate obligation to fund the landfill trust.as explained in a may motion in limine mary filed in that case,lynda was challenging the validity and enforceability of the remediation order.lynda claimed the remediation order was invalid in part because rudy estate was not formally substituted in place of rudy as a party to the dissolution action.mary asked the court to decide the purely legal question of whether the remediation order is a valid,enforceable order of the court,binding on the parties.mary asserted that lynda was attempting to have rudy estate declared free of the obligation to fund the landfill trust.mary objected to this since,if lynda succeeded,mary would likely have to fund the entire landfill trust herself.mary contended the remediation order was enforceable against rudy estate,even though the estate was not a named party to it,as for many years the parties,including the court,acted as though the estate had been made a party,and the parties to the dissolution action,as well as the court,all treated the representative of rudy estate as a party in place of rudy for years after his death.mary also admitted that she and rudy had agreed to continue joint ownership of the bonzi businesses and properties long after the dissolution of the marriage i n light of the large obligation to fund the landfill trust.
in her may trial brief,mary also argued that rudy estate was not relieved of its obligation to fund the landfill trust due to ciwmb failure to file a creditor claim.mary asserted a creditor claim was not required to be filed as the requirement to fund the landfill trust was not a claim against the estate,and neither the state nor the ciwmb was a creditor.mary alternatively argued that even if the obligation to fund the landfill trust were a claim,lynda was estopped from complaining that a claim had not been filed by failing to object earlier.
mary subsequently filed a motion in the probate case to compel distribution of funds from the blocked account.in a declaration filed in support of that motion,a member of ciwmb financial assurances section,who was monitoring the bonzi landfill,declared that the bonzi landfill had chosen to provide two trust accounts,both of which were monitored to determine compliance with the financial assurance demonstration requirements mandated by california statute for closure and maintenance cost demonstrations the balance in the two landfill closure trust accounts was greater than the required minimum balance and no additional funds needed to be deposited into the account before the next installment was due on the following anniversary,may.
in september,the probate court approved a settlement agreement between lynda,james as executor of rudy estate,mary,and other bonzi relatives,that authorized the distribution of money from a blocked account to various heirs and beneficiaries,and the transfer of real property to lynda.the court order authorized the immediate reimbursement of money to mary that had been held in the blocked account,as the money was no longer required to satisfy a deficiency in the landfill trust.the payment to mary was intended to equalize payments mary previously made to the landfill trust.
the enforcement action 
in,the people of the state of california filed suit against ma ru and bonzi sanitation in stanislaus county superior court case number,to enforce compliance with the rwb orders.the parties subsequently entered into a stipulated judgment,which was filed on december.pursuant to the stipulated judgment,ma ru and bonzi sanitation were required to provide a mechanism and funding source,or prove that they already existed,for the cost of corrective action,and closure and maintenance of the bonzi landfill.
the administrative order and property sale 
by april,ma ru and the bonzi sanitation were working cooperatively with the rwb.in august,however,the rwb issued cleanup and abatement order no,after finding continued groundwater pollution at the bonzi landfill.ma ru and bonzi sanitation were ordered to investigate the discharges of waste and clean up,and abate the effects of the waste.they were also ordered to have all financial assurance funds fully funded and accepted by ciwmb by october.
in november,james petitioned in the probate case for an order confirming the sale of two jointly owned properties.the properties were being sold,in part,to put additional money into the landfill trust before the close of,as the state was requiring million be paid into the trust.the terms of the sales specifically cited the remediation order as authority for the sales.
the mary bonzi trust 
in january,the attorney for ma ru and bonzi sanitation,karna harrigfeld,provided mary attorney with a breakdown of funds required to satisfy the bonzi landfill outstanding obligations from,the outstanding financial assurances and fines obligations for,and the environmental compliance expenses.harrigfeld stated she understood ma ru and bonzi sanitation assets purportedly had been transferred to the mary bonzi revocable trust.harrigfeld warned that the transfers were not valid,citing the requirement in the remediation order of court approval before the sale or transfer of any interest in jointly owned properties.
in,mary created a revocable living trust which was later renamed the mary bonzi novation general trust mary bonzi trust.on august,mary transferred her interest in the farrar property and numerous other properties she jointly owned with rudy estate,to the trustee of the mary bonzi trust,her daughter,mi liza bonzi.
the administrative order 
in october,the rwb issued waste discharge requirements order no.it was noted in the order that according to a preliminary closure and maintenance plan for the bonzi landfill submitted by ma ru and bonzi sanitation,the estimated lump sum cost of carrying out all actions related to the closure was maintenance was and corrective action for all known or reasonably foreseeable releases was.the order required ma ru and bonzi sanitation to maintain financial assurance with the ciwmb in at least the amount of the cost estimate.
the order further stated that ma ru and bonzi sanitation must immediately obtain and maintain assurances of financial responsibility for initiating and completing corrective action,and for closure and maintenance costs,in the amount of the approved cost estimates,and submit a proposed financial assurance mechanism to the financial assurances section of the ciwmb and update the preliminary closure and maintenance plan pcpcmp any time there is a change that will increase the amount of the estimate,and submit the updated pcpcmp to the rwb and ciwmb.monitoring and reporting program no,issued in conjunction with the waste discharge requirements order,listed the monitoring reports required by the order.
mary probate case and continued funding of the landfill trust 
mary died on june.a petition to administer her estate was filed on september,in stanislaus county superior court case number mary probate case,and mi liza was appointed the executor.mi liza died in september her son,thad bettencourt,became the successor executor of the estate and successor trustee of the mary bonzi trust.
in a november verified report of the status of the administration of rudy estate,james stated the estate was not in a condition to be closed because he was charged with the responsibility of the of the bonzi landfill regarding the environmental program required by the rwb,which includes an evaluation of the water quality in nearby domestic wells,a cleanup of the polluted groundwater and to prevent the groundwater from inundating landfill waste.
in october,the estates of rudy and mary sold one of their companies,a recycling business,to generate sufficient cash to pay the bonzi landfill consultants and fund the ongoing environmental compliance requirements of the rwb.in a november,letter from harrigfeld to an attorney with the office of enforcement of the state water resources control board,harrigfeld thanked the attorney and the rwb staff for meeting with representatives of the bonzi landfill and mary estate regarding environmental compliance issues.harrigfeld acknowledged the bonzi landfill obligation to comply with ciwmb regulatory requirements that necessitate funding the closure fund and corrective action fund that the total estimated financial assurance obligation exceeded million and that the landfill trust balance was a little over million,which left an outstanding obligation of approximately million.harrigfeld proposed the sale of the morgan property and another jointly owned property to make up the shortfall.
in february,thad bettencourt,as trustee of mary trust,sold mary interest in the morgan property to the purchaser of the recycling business.by may,the bonzi landfill had ceased accepting waste and no longer was generating revenues.
the enforcement action 
in july,at the request of the rwb,the people of the state of california filed suit against ma ru,bonzi sanitation,and the estates of rudy and mary,to enforce the terms of the administrative clean up and abatement orders,and the stipulated judgment,in stanislaus county superior court case number enforcement action.the enforcement action is assigned to the honorable william mayhew for all purposes.the enforcement action seeks to compel the defendants to fund their financial assurances,supply missing reports and evaluations,clean up and abate their pollution,and comply with the terms of the stipulated judgment.
in april,calrecycle intervened in the enforcement action to enforce its statutory interest in seeing that defendants fully fund the required financial assurances and implement the closure and maintenance of the bonzi landfill.in its complaint in intervention,calrecycle alleged that it had a direct interest in assuring the adequacy of the financial assurances because it is the named beneficiary on the trust fund instrument and thus has access to the fund to address solid waste issues within its regulatory purview.
the sale of the farrar property 
in september,the probate court approved the petition of the trustee of the mary bonzi trust to transfer legal title from mary estate interest in the farrar property to the mary bonzi trust.in november,rudy estate and the mary bonzi trust agreed to sell the farrar property to stephen endsley james petitioned the court in the probate case for approval of the sale.respondents filed an objection to the petition,by which they sought to enforce compliance with the order and remediation order,and requested an order that the net proceeds of the sale of the farrar property be dedicated to the satisfaction of rudy and mary estates obligation for groundwater remediation,closure and of the bonzi landfill.alternatively,respondents asked the court to order the sale proceeds be placed in the blocked account pending resolution of the enforcement action.the court approved the sale subject to an order blocking distribution of the sale proceeds.
that sale did not go through,but in january,rudy estate entered into another contract to sell its interest in the farrar property to endsley.james again petitioned the court in the probate case for approval of the sale,and respondents again objected.the court confirmed the sale of rudy estate interest in the farrar property,but required the net proceeds of the sale of all interests in the property be deposited into a blocked account pending determination of respondents objection.trial on that determination commenced on june,but the court vacated the order confirming the sale because the sale again fell through.
respondents,rudy estate,the mary bonzi trust,and endsley eventually entered into a settlement agreement that allowed the sale to be completed.the agreement provided that the net sales proceeds of the mary bonzi trust interest in the farrar property would be divided into three equal shares and placed into the mary bonzi trust,the landfill trust,and a blocked account,while the entire net sales proceeds of rudy estate undivided interest in the farrar property would be placed into the blocked account.the agreement also stated that a hearing would be held to adjudicate the issues raised by respondents objection,including disposition of the net sales proceeds in the blocked account.respondents waived all claims against the farrar property or that portion of the net sales proceeds to be distributed to the mary bonzi trust.the parties reserved their rights to pursue their respective claims and defenses in the hearing on the respondents objection and in the enforcement action.
the hearing on the respondents objection took place on april.in their trial brief,respondents argued,inter alia,that the remediation order requires any proceeds from the sale of the farrar property be deposited in the landfill trust,rudy estate,mary and mary estate repeatedly conceded their obligation to fund the landfill trust,respondents had standing to enforce the remediation order as third party beneficiaries to that order,and even if they did not have standing,the court had inherent authority to enforce the remediation order,and the financial assurances requirement is not a claim in probate and the bonzis have conceded that no claim was required.at the hearing,the trial court asked counsel for appellants and respondents questions concerning their positions and heard argument,after which it took the matter under submission.
on may,the trial court issued the minute order from which this appeal is taken,finding that the farrar property sale proceeds are subject to the remediation order,as well as previous orders of the courts of stanislaus county.the court took judicial notice of the orders and judgments,including the order and remediation order in the dissolution action the rwb orders from the stipulated judgment and orders made by retired judges,the honorable john whiteside and david vanderwall.the court found the evidence showed the decedents were the sole shareholders of ma ru and bonzi sanitation.the court further found that family law,probate and civil filings,including declarations and letters by counsel or executors for bonzi,admitted the estates of rudy and mary,mary trust,and businesses they owned or controlled,were responsible to fund the landfill cleanup.the court overruled appellants hearsay objections to these admissions,finding they constituted admissions or judicial admissions,and therefore the statements were exempt from the hearsay rule.
the court rejected appellants argument that respondents did not have standing or,if standing existed,recovery was barred by the probate claims procedure requirements and statutes of limitation.the court found that respondents were not required to file a claim pursuant to section et,as they were not creditors and were not making a demand for payment of a debt.instead,they were seeking to enforce standing orders and judgments of the stanislaus county courts and the rwb,which the bonzi parties were obligated to perform,and the fact that funds may be required to be disbursed from real property holdings or other assets of the decedents did not require compliance with the probate code claim procedure.moreover,since the probate court acts as a court of equity,it found the bonzi parties were estopped due to the many years of litigation wherein the bonzi parties acknowledged their obligations.the court found respondents had standing because the judgments and orders of the stanislaus county courts and the rwb are contractual in nature,and respondents had authority to enforce such obligations as third party beneficiaries.
in addition to finding that the proceeds of the farrar property sale were subject to payment under the remediation order and other court orders,the trial court ordered the executors and trustees of rudy estate,mary estate,and mary trust,to provide additional information regarding the transfer of the farrar property to the mary bonzi trust,an accounting of the sales proceeds for mary share of the sale,and inventories,which information the court needed before it would determine whether any of the proceeds from the farrar property sale would be distributed to the landfill trust.
discussion 
appellants contend the trial court erred in finding the proceeds of the farrar property sale were subject to payment under the remediation order and other court orders.specifically,appellants assert respondents failed to show they had standing to object to the distribution of the sale proceeds as they did not establish they were intended beneficiaries under the order and the remediation order,or that appellants were bound by the stipulated judgment or the administrative orders.appellants further assert that the remedy respondents seek is,as respondents are asserting a claim against rudy estate and therefore were required to file a timely creditor claim,and respondents objection is barred by the statute of limitations of code of civil procedure section.finally,appellants contend they are not estopped to assert the statute of limitations or claim filing statute.
it is well settled that a judgment or order of the lower court is presumed correct.denham superior court cal d,denham,italics omitted.an appellant must affirmatively demonstrate error occurred and,when the appellate record is silent on a matter,the reviewing court must indulge all intendments and presumptions that support the order or judgment.ibid.the trial court findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.citation.the trial court conclusions of law are subject to independent review on appeal.madera oversight coalition,county of madera th.
we begin with the issue of standing.the trial court found respondents had standing to object to the property sale because they were third party beneficiaries of the judgments and orders of the stanislaus county court and the rwb.while appellants contend the trial court erred in so finding,we need not decide the merits of their contention because,as respondents asserted below and argue on appeal,the trial court had inherent authority to enforce the remediation order regardless of whether respondents had standing to compel its enforcement.
the remediation order expressly required the bonzis to comply with any of state governmental agencies such as respondents pertaining to the groundwater remediation,closure,and of the bonzi landfill.it also required the bonzis to encumber or sell their jointly owned real property to fund their joint obligation relating to groundwater remediation,closure and if revenues from the bonzi landfill were insufficient for that purpose.among the mandates to which the remediation order applied was the requirement that owners and operators of landfills post financial assurances to ensure adequate resources for closure and postclosure maintenance.pub.resources code,subd.a b c,tit,subd.a.
the bonzi landfill has ceased accepting waste.therefore,the bonzis are obligated to fully fund the financial assurances,tit,subd.a the fund must be fully funded by the time the last shipment of waste has been received at the disposal facility.as stated in an august cleanup and abatement order,ma ru and bonzi sanitation were ordered to have all financial assurance funds fully funded and accepted by calrecycle by october.accordingly,the bonzis have an immediate obligation to fund the shortfall in the landfill trust of more than million.
it is undisputed that the revenue of the bonzi landfill is insufficient to fund the remediation and closure costs.therefore,the remediation order requires that the real property subject to the order be sold to fund those costs.the bonzis jointly owned the farrar property when the remediation order issued.the farrar property therefore was subject to the lien placed on it by virtue of the recording of the remediation order that lien remained on the property when mary transferred her interest in it to mi liza as trustee of the mary bonzi trust.court approval,as required by the remediation order,was not obtained for that transfer.therefore,the lien followed the property into the mary bonzi trust and encumbers the sale proceeds.see.since the farrar property was jointly owned property subject to the remediation order,the proceeds from its sale were required to be deposited into the landfill trust to fund the remediation and closure of the bonzi landfill.
since the remediation order remains in effect and has not been overturned or set aside,the trial court could not ignore it.as respondents point out,e very court has power to compel obedience to its judgments and orders citation,and a court of equity retains inherent jurisdiction to oversee and enforce execution of its decrees.city of los angeles silver d,code of civ,subd.a.a judgment rendered in one department of the superior court is binding on that matter upon all other departments until such time as the judgment is overturned.ford superior court d.
appellants do not contend that the remediation order does not require the proceeds of the farrar property sale to be placed into the landfill trust.instead,appellants assert the trial court did not have the inherent power to enforce the remediation order because respondents failed to file a creditor claim in the probate case as required by the probate code.section states that a creditor must file a claim in a probate proceeding either within four months after the court appoints a personal representative or within days after notice.the time restriction is intended to ensure the estate representative is notified of all claims within a reasonable period so that the estate can be expeditiously settled and distributed to the legatees or heirs.varney superior court th.failure to comply with these time requirements bars the claim,subd.b.
here,the trial court found that respondents were not required to file a creditor claim because they were not creditors,and they were not making a demand for payment of a debt.instead,the trial court found respondents were seeking to enforce standing orders and judgments of the stanislaus county courts and rwb,which appellants were obligated to perform,and the disbursal of funds pursuant to those orders did not require compliance with the probate code claim procedures.
as pertinent here,a claim is defined as a demand for payment for any of the following,whether due,not due,accrued or not accrued,or contingent,and whether liquidated or unliquidated liability of the decedent,whether arising in contract,tort,or otherwise,subd.a.a creditor,who must file a claim,means a person who may have a claim against estate property,subd.c.a creditor claim is nothing more than a mere judicial determination of the estate indebtedness in a specified sum to a particular person.when a given claim is allowed it thus becomes judicially determined as a debt due the creditor magraw mcglynn cal.
rudy and mary,as the owners of the entities that operated the bonzi landfill,had a statutory obligation to create and fund the landfill trust to ensure compliance with their duties to remediate,close and maintain the bonzi landfill.respondents do not own the money in the trust,nor will they be paid any of the deposited funds instead,the landfill trust is established and managed solely to assure payment of the costs of closing the bonzi landfill.the remediation order creates the method for funding the landfill trust first with revenues from the landfill business and,if a deficiency remains,from the sale of jointly owned real property.by their objection regarding the farrar property sale proceeds,respondents are demanding appellants,as executors of rudy and mary estates,fund the landfill trust pursuant to the remediation order.respondents are not demanding payment of money to themselves or any other creditor for work already performed.instead,they are seeking to enforce rudy and mary own agreement,which is a court order,that proceeds from the sale of jointly owned property be used to fund the landfill trust if there is a deficiency.for this reason,they are not making a creditor claim within the meaning of section instead,they are enforcing an order of the court.
appellants do not cite any case supporting their assertion that enforcement of a court order,such as the one at issue here,constitutes a claim under the probate code.in wood brown d,the court of appeal held that the plaintiff right to recover against the defendant,who the plaintiff had sued to recover sums of money on various theories,was contingent on his having pre
