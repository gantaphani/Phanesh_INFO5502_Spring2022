wisconsin valley improvement company wvic or the company petitions for review of federal energy regulatory commission ferc orders imposing conditions on its license to operate a hydropower project.in addition to charging wvic an annual fee for use of submerged federal lands,the licensing order requires petitioner to implement a wild rice enhancement plan.ferc imposed the latter condition at the instance of intervenors united states forest service and department of the interior the agencies,which hold federal lands overflowed by wvic reservoir.petitioner argues,inter alia,that the conditions imposed exceed the scope of ferc authority under the federal power act fpa,et,as they govern areas that are not part of any reservations of the united states.petitioner further argues that the enhancement plan is arbitrary and capricious as the required reduction in the reservoir water level would not result in wild rice growth,and challenges the requirement that it pay fees for its use of the submerged agency land.we conclude that ferc lawfully could require the wild rice implementation plan under the fpa and further,since it is impossible to confine reductions in the water level to federally controlled land,that ferc was entitled to impose conditions on the entire project.we further hold that the agencies decisions concerning the wild rice plan were not arbitrary and capricious,but that ferc decision to charge annual fees was.
background 
subchapter i of the fpa,confers on ferc the authority to award licenses for the operation of hydropower projects on the navigable waters of the united states.in particular,fpa e requires ferc to include in licenses for projects that operate within a reservation of the united states,any such conditions as the secretary of the department under whose supervision such reservation falls shall deem necessary for the adequate protection and utilization of such reservation.id.e.that is,if a project is located within an reservation,that agency may require ferc to impose conditions on the manner in which the licensee may operate it.the fpa further defines reservation to include national forests,tribal lands embraced within indian reservations,military reservations,and other lands and interests in lands owned by the united states,and withdrawn,reserved,or withheld from private appropriation and disposal under the public land laws also lands and interests in lands acquired and held for any public purposes but shall not include national monuments or national parks.id.emphases added.
for the better part of a century,wvic has operated a as the wisconsin river headwaters of dams and reservoirs on the wisconsin and tomahawk rivers.wvic was chartered by wisconsin legislature in.in the same year,the company acquired the lac vieux desert reservoir,a natural drainage lake on the border that had been dammed for logging operations in.since,wvic has operated the reservoir and dam with the principal intent of producing hydroelectric power,as well as providing flood control.the company in replaced lac vieux desert logging dam with a concrete reservoir dam.and in,wvic acquired from ferc predecessor agency,the federal power commission,a license for its project the project was licensed in,but its license was retroactive to.at the time,the company was not charged fees for using,enjoying,or occupying the nearby federally owned lands that its reservoir overflowed.
wvic sought to renew its license in.during the relicensing proceedings,the agencies submitted to ferc,pursuant to fpa e,a number of conditions that would restrict the manner in which wvic could operate its project.those conditions were appropriate,the agencies explained,because wvic reservoir overflows acres of the nicolet and ottawa national forests,under the forest service jurisdiction,and acre of the lac vieux desert indian reservation,administered by the interior department.see wisconsin valley improvement,ferc.after administrative hearings over a period,ferc on july,issued an order that granted wvic license application and included the agencies proposed conditions,three of which the company now challenges.see wisconsin valley improvement,ferc.
first,and most important,is article,which requires wvic to implement at lac vieux desert what ferc styles a wild rice enhancement plan.the company is obliged to reduce the reservoir maximum water level by about nine inches,and to contribute toward the planting and monitoring of wild rice.see id.at.the agencies asserted that their wild rice enhancement plan was necessary to reverse the depletion of wild rice at the reservoir.although rice had once been abundant at lac vieux desert,they explained,it had almost completely disappeared by the.the agencies attributed that decline to the high water that resulted when wvic rebuilt the reservoir dam in,and correspondingly concluded that decreasing the reservoir water level would create conditions favorable to the growth of wild rice.see final environmental impact statement at,to,app.j june.wvic estimates that,in addition to the rice expenditure,it will suffer in lost hydropower revenues over the period.see petitioner brief at wvic response to draft environmental impact statement at to april.
in addition,ferc included in wvic new license two and require the company to pay annual fees to the united states for its use of submerged land.see wisconsin valley improvement,ferc at.such payments are required,ferc submits,by fpa e,which obliges a licensee to pay to the united states reasonable annual charges in an amount to be fixed by the commission for recompensing it for the use,occupancy,and enjoyment of its lands or other property.e.
wvic sought an administrative rehearing and petitioned for review in this court.although ferc subsequently issued several orders that modified its initial ruling,see wisconsin valley improvement,ferc wisconsin valley improvement,ferc wisconsin valley improvement,ferc,it left intact the portions challenged here.wvic first petition for review,case number,was consolidated with its present petition by a january,order of this court.
ii.discussion 
this court reviews ferc conditions prescribed by agencies pursuant to fpa e under the administrative procedure act apa,et,which obliges us to reverse any agency action that is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.id.a see power partners ferc.as pertinent here,the apa prohibition on arbitrary and capricious agency action requires us to decide whether ferc correctly concluded that the lands flooded by wvic reservoir are part of a reservation of the united states within the meaning of the fpa.
existence of e authority 
wvic argues that ferc can not impose the conditions submitted by the agencies under e as the facts of the present licensing procedure do not come within the rationale of that section.as petitioner views it,the mandatory conditioning authority under that section,giving as it does carte blanche authority to impose conditions on projects located within federal reservations,see escondido mut.water la jolla band of mission indians,d,could not have been intended to provide that sort of authority to otherwise uninvolved agencies over the regulation of license projects no more connected to reservation land than wvic is to the lands under consideration.wvic argues that its project can not be within the relevant reservations because t he agencies have no protectable property interests that conflict with wvic prescriptive water rights,and its operation of the reservoir does not depend on the use or occupancy of any federal property right.petitioner brief at.that is a non sequitur.
the question whether wvic owns flowage easements over the lands is irrelevant to whether the lands themselves are part of a federal reservation.as we stated above,the fpa defines the term reservation to include national forest,tribal lands embraced within indian reservations,military reservations,and other lands and interests in lands owned by the united states,and withdrawn,reserved,or withheld from private appropriation and disposal under the public land laws also lands and interests in lands acquired and held for any public purposes not includ ing national monuments or national parks.emphases added.by the terms of the statute,the united states need not even hold land in fee simple absolute for it to operate a reservation.it is enough that the government own an interest in the land.see escondido,at.there is no doubt that reservations include interests in lands owned by the united states.and on the record before us,there can be no dispute that the united states owns at least an interest in the lands flooded by wvic reservoir,perhaps even the fee simple,whether or not subject to a prescriptive easement by wvic.
indeed,ferc consistently has affirmed its jurisdiction over land that the federal government owns subject to a citizen easement.in south carolina gas,ferc,ferc reasoned that even if we assume that holds the easements it describes,that fact does not make the land in question any less a reservation for purposes of section e of the fpa,since the term reservation is not limited to fee title.and in town of estes park,ferc,the commission concluded that if the federal government holds fee title to certain lands,the lands qualify as lands owned by the united states for fpa purposes,even if someone else has a continuing right to use them pursuant to an easement.
but while the question of whether wvic holds flowage easements is immaterial to the lands status as federal reservations,it remains quite relevant to the possibility that ferc licensing order has taken the company property in violation of the fifth amendment.see const.amend.v n or shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.if wvic does indeed own easements to flow the agencies lands,and if ferc order has prevented it from using its property rights,the government may well have affected an unconstitutional taking.see national wildlife federation icc,recognizing that property rights in easements do implicate the takings clause nollan california coastal comm n,d 
had california simply required the nollans to make an easement across their beachfront available to the public on a permanent basis in order to increase public access to the beach we have no doubt there would have been a taking.to say that the appropriation of a public easement across a landowner premises does not constitute the taking of a property interest but rather a mere restriction on its use,is to use words in a manner that deprives them of all their ordinary meaning.

both ferc and the agencies deny that wvic has any cognizable property interest in the flooded lands,and repeatedly insist that the company has not demonstrated that it owns any recorded easements.quite the contrary,they point out,for the government has introduced evidence that only of the total quantified national forest system land within the project is burdened with recorded flowage rights.intervenors brief at emphasis added see also respondent brief at.
of course,formal recordation is only one,crucially,the exclusive which a party in wisconsin or michigan may establish a flowage easement.rather,both jurisdictions recognize that one may obtain an easement to flow water over another land through prescription.see,chippewa flambeau improvement comm n,cook grand river hydroelectric power.wvic inability to point to recorded flowage easements is hardly the fatal flaw ferc takes it to be.respondent brief at.
but while wvic may be able to advance a colorable claim,it is not within our jurisdiction to adjudicate it.it is fixed law that,i f there is a taking,and a claim for just compensation,then that is a tucker act matter to be pursued in the court of federal claims,and not before us.transmission access policy study group ferc.so far as the underlying questions of which property interests are owned by which parties,neither ferc nor this court have jurisdiction to try title.either the state courts or the united states district court of appropriate jurisdiction acting pursuant to the quiet title act,could adjudicate the factual questions such as whether wvic operations have been sufficient to give rise to prescriptive easements,and apply the appropriate law.if wvic proves successful in its title actions,it could potentially pursue a takings claim in the court of federal claims,which has exclusive jurisdiction over such actions.none of this,however,prevents either ferc or this court on review from applying the conditions sought by the affected agencies.we therefore can not grant a petition for review on that basis.
scope of e authority 
slightly more complicated than whether ferc has authority under e to impose license conditions,is the extent of that authority.the parties dispute whether the which ferc must attach license conditions to projects located within any reservation of the united states,e emphasis added permits ferc to prescribe conditions with respect to the entire lac vieux desert project,or only as to those portions of the project that actually occupy reservation lands.the agencies propose that the government section e conditioning authority applies to the license,and therefore to all of the project works covered by that license,so long as part of the licensed project is within the reservation.intervenors brief at emphasis added.wvic responds with what it supposes is a reductio ad absurdum,and points out that the agencies interpretation would permit ferc to impose license conditions if any portion of the project touches a reservation even if the overlap is the size of a postage stamp.reply brief at.
we need not,however,decide the precise scope of the government power to prescribe conditions for projects located within reservations.rather,we resolve this issue on the narrow ground that on the facts of this case it would be impossible to attach a condition as to the reservation lands without simultaneously imposing it with respect to the entire project.as ferc points out,there simply is no way to require wvic to reduce the water level of lac vieux desert only over federal lands.a lake can have only one level.see respondent brief at as the condition imposes maximum water levels on the entire project reservoir,it is unclear how wvic could be required to limit the maximum water level on only those portions of the project reservoir occupying the reservations,without affecting the water level throughout the project reservoir.wvic does not dispute that ferc could not reduce the level of the water that overflows the reservation lands without lowering the entire reservoir,and we therefore find that its order requiring wvic to do so was not arbitrary and capricious.
besides requiring wvic to reduce the water level at lac vieux desert,ferc wild rice enhancement plan further calls for the company to fund the agencies efforts to plant wild rice.unlike changes in water level,it is possible to confine to the federally owned reservations.hence the rationale that permits the reduction of the reservoir water level over the government can not lower the water over reservation lands without doing so as to the entire not justify a requirement that rice be planted on lands.but it appears that the agencies have imposed no such condition.ferc order calls for rice to be planted,not throughout the lac vieux desert reservoir,but only on reservation example at misery bay and the rice bay,both of which are on forest service or indian reservation land.see final environmental impact statement at to june.in any event,ferc explains,it is clear that the planned wild rice seeding is to occur on both the indian and forest service reservations,and ferc has given no indication that it will require the planting of rice on lands.wisconsin valley improvement,ferc.
conclusion 
in sum,ferc has the authority to attach conditions to wvic license to operate a project at lac vieux desert,because the agencies own at least an interest in the lands flowed by the reservoir.the lands therefore are part of a reservation within the meaning of fpa e.ferc e authority extends to areas outside the reservation geographic boundaries,because it is impossible to lower the water level over the federal lands without reducing the entire reservoir.
