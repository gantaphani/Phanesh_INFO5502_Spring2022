natural resources defense council,east yard communities for environmental justice,and coalition for a safe environment collectively nrdc appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the department of transportation and other federal and state defendants collectively defendants.nrdc argues that defendants violated the federal clean air act caa and the national environmental policy act nepa by failing to properly evaluate and disclose the potential environmental impact of a planned expressway connecting the ports of los angeles and long beach to the i freeway.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants.
the port of los angeles is our nation busiest container port considered together with the adjacent port of long beach,this port complex is among the ten busiest in the world,and it accounts for roughly forty percent of all waterborne cargo that enters the united states.bill sharpsteen,the docks.the port cargo volume is projected to continue rising for decades 
although the ports are an economic boon for the los angeles region,they also affect air quality in the surrounding area,especially in the adjacent communities of san pedro and wilmington.these impacts are projected to worsen with the rise in container volume at the ports.the state route expressway project project is one of several infrastructure projects designed to ease traffic congestion and mitigate air pollution.if built,the project will connect the ports to the i freeway via an elevated,expressway.the project sponsors,which are now the defendants in this litigation,assert that the project will better integrate the ports with the freeway system,thereby reducing the need for travel by trucks carrying shipping containers,and the pollution generated while they run idle at traffic signals and railroad crossings.
in the course of the project approval process,defendants conducted an air quality conformity determination and an environmental impact statement eis.as one component of the conformity determination study,defendants performed a qualitative analysis that measured existing concentrations of pm,a type of fine particulate matter,and estimated the project likely impact on pm levels.because there was no pm receptor located within the immediate vicinity of the project,defendants based their qualitative analysis on data from a receptor five miles away from the project area.defendants released a draft conformity determination in november.following a round of comments and revisions,the final conformity determination was issued in may.
meanwhile,defendants prepared an eis as required by nepa.the eis process began in,and defendants released a draft eis in august.the draft eis prompted numerous comments,including comments from nrdc,to which defendants responded at length.the comments also spurred defendants to conduct additional studies,such as a traffic sensitivity analysis and a health risk assessment that detailed the project likely health impacts,including an increased risk of cancer in the areas immediately adjacent to the project.defendants released the final version of the eis in may,and signed the record of decision in august.
in november,nrdc filed a complaint in the central district of california alleging that defendants approval of the project violated caa,nepa,and the administrative procedure act.at the district court request,the parties briefed and argued for summary judgment.on june,the district court issued an order granting summary judgment in defendants favor.this appeal follows.
a district court decision on for summary judgment is reviewed de novo.am.civil liberties union of city of las vegas,cir.we view the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party and decide whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law.ftc.stefanchik,cir.
under the administrative procedure act,we must hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is narrow,and we do not substitute our judgment for that of the agency.barnes dep t of,cir.

the caa mandates joint efforts between the federal government and the states to combat air pollution.under the caa statutory framework,the federal environmental protection agency epa begins by establishing national ambient air quality standards naaqs for certain types of pollutants.then,the epa designates areas throughout the united states as attainment,nonattainment,or maintenance for each type of pollutant depending on whether these national standards have been met.see defining these terms.for,the pollutant at issue here,the epa has designated the south coast air basin which encompasses the ports as well as most of the greater los angeles area as nonattainment.the details of naaqs enforcement are left to the states,each of which must adopt a state implementation plan that provides for the implementation and maintenance of national air quality standards.a.
the caa also contains a conformity provision that prohibits federal participation in any project that fails to conform to an approved state implementation plan.c.the statute defines conformity to mean,in relevant part,that 
such activities will not 
i cause or contribute to any new violation of any standard in any area 
ii increase the frequency or severity of any existing violation of any standard in any area or 
iii delay timely attainment of any standard or any required interim emission reductions or other milestones in any area.
id.c b.the caa does not define the term any area.instead,it delegates to the epa and the department of transportation dot the duty to promulgate,and periodically update,criteria and procedures for demonstrating and assuring conformity in the case of transportation plans,programs,and projects.id.c b.
acting pursuant to that authority,the epa has promulgated regulations that mandate a analysis for several air pollutants,including pm.analysis is described as 
an estimation of likely future localized pm pollutant concentrations and a comparison of those concentrations to the national ambient air quality standards.hotspot analysis assesses impacts on a scale smaller than the entire nonattainment or maintenance area and uses an air quality dispersion model to determine the effects of emissions on air quality.
project sponsors must carry out this hotspot analysis to ensure that the project does not cause or contribute to any new localized pm violations,increase the frequency or severity of such violations,or delay timely attainment of air quality goals.id.a.when a project sponsors conduct a analysis,concentrations must be estimated and analyzed at appropriate receptor locations in the area substantially affected by the project.id.c.
analyses may be either qualitative or quantitative.where quantitative analysis methods are not available,as was true of pm during the period at issue here,the demonstration required by a must be based on a qualitative consideration of local factors.id.b.the parties agree that defendants were required to conduct a qualitative analysis rather than a quantitative analysis.
in march,the epa and dot jointly published the transportation conformity guidance for qualitative analyses in pm and pm nonattainment and maintenance areas conformity guidance.according to the epa,all qualitative pm analyses should be completed according to the conformity guidance.the conformity guidance does not define any area,nor does it refer to appropriate receptor locations.it does,however,provide a detailed methodology for how project sponsors should conduct qualitative analyses,and it features several examples of permissible analyses.
nrdc caa claim turns on whether the statute use of the phrase any area means that defendants were required to estimate pm increases within the area immediately adjacent to the proposed expressway.if defendants were required to do so,then it follows that their approval of the project was contrary to law and must be set aside.if not,then their conformity determination complied with the caa.
nrdc argues that the plain meaning of c b compels the conclusion that any area means all or every part of the area affected by project emissions,and thus that defendants were required to measure concentrations within the immediate vicinity of the project.we agree that read naturally,the word any has an expansive meaning.ali fed.bureau of prisons,alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.however,nrdc plain meaning argument ignores a critical,obvious ambiguity in the phrase any area the word area.
on its own,the word area does not tell us whether defendants were required to measure pm concentrations within the area immediately adjacent to the proposed expressway or in any other area.the plain meaning of area encompasses a wide variety of sizes.area is defined as a region or part of a town,a country,or the world,a space allocated for a specific purpose,or the extent or measurement of a surface or piece of land.new oxford american dictionary ed.additionally,the statutory context does not allow us to pinpoint the meaning of area.a different provision of the caa requires that states send the epa a list of all areas or portions thereof in the state,d a,but this usage of area appears to refer to entire air quality regions,which often include multiple counties.likewise,the statutory section concerning state implementation plans repeatedly uses the term areas to describe air quality regions,id.a i.thus,we are convinced that the statutory phrase any area is ambiguous.
because congress has not directly spoken to the precise question at issue,chevron,at,we look to the relevant agencies interpretations of the ambiguous phrase any area during the period at issue in this appeal.nrdc asserts that the epa has adopted a regulatory interpretation that supports its understanding of any area,and it argues that epa and dot interpretations to the contrary are not entitled to judicial deference.
nrdc argument begins with an epa rule interpreting the key statutory phrase increase the frequency or severity of any existing violation of any standard in any area.c b ii.according to the epa regulatory definition,
i ncrease the frequency or severity means to cause a location or region to exceed a standard more often or to cause a violation at a greater concentration than previously existed 
emphasis added.nrdc argues the term a location refers to an area smaller than the project area,such as the area immediately adjacent to the expressway.in march,nearly a year after the defendants issued their conformity determination,the epa issued an amended rule which specifically clarifies that the term any area in caa section c b applies to any portion of a nonattainment or maintenance area,including the local area affected by a transportation project.nrdc argues that the epa amendment to confirms that the term a location referred to an area smaller than the project area.
nrdc also points to the regulatory requirement that hotspot analyses estimate pollutant concentrations at appropriate receptor locations in the area substantially affected by the project.c.c.in nrdc view,this provision use of the plural locations,and its reference to the area significantly affected by the project,impliedly interprets the caa any area requirement to mandate collection and analysis of data drawn from the project immediate vicinity.finally,nrdc cites the epa response to a public comment on proposed rules.in this response,the epa noted that some commenters had proposed that a project should be allowed to make a violation worse in a place not frequented by the public if it improves air quality and eliminates violations where public exposure is more likely.the epa,however,rejected this view,explaining that 
clean air act section c b states that transportation projects must not cause or contribute to any new violation of any standard in any area,or increase the frequency or severity of any existing violation of any standard in any area.it is not public exposure to a violation of a standard that the clean air act language prohibits it prohibits any violation of any standard in any area.the conformity rule can not override the clean air act to make exceptions that create new or worsen existing violations.
nrdc arguments,while not without merit,fail to persuade us that during the period at issue in this appeal the epa interpreted any area in the manner nrdc proposes.first,that refers to a location or region does not persuade us that the area referenced is the area immediately adjacent to the expressway as opposed to the broader project area.although the epa clarified the term any area in its amendments to mean any portion of a nonattainment or maintenance area,including the local area affected by the transportation project,the epa did not clearly indicate that this interpretation should apply retroactively.at kankamalage ins,cir observing that a regulation may not apply retroactively unless it unambiguously directs retroactive application.
nor do we find the language of c particularly relevant.to begin with,it is not clear from the language or structure of this provision whether its appropriate receptor locations requirement applies to all analyses or only the more rigorous quantitative analyses.section c is listed as one of several general requirements,but b explicitly carves out an exception for qualitative analyses,which must be based on a qualitative consideration of local factors.the epa own statements and publications also indicate that the appropriate receptor locations provision is inapplicable to qualitative analyses.the qualitative conformity guidance says nothing about receptors or appropriate receptor locations.in a response to public comments,the epa noted that it intends to describe appropriate receptor locations in its forthcoming quantitative pm guidance,emphasis added.the epa recent quantitative conformity guidance made good on this promise.see epa,transportation conformity guidance for quantitative hotspot analyses defining and explaining appropriate receptor locations.
finally,the epa response does not settle the matter.the response does not discuss analysis,much less the proper application of qualitative pm analysis.in addition,the response simply reiterates that transportation projects must not cause or contribute to any new violation of any standard in any area,or increase the frequency or severity of any existing violation of any standard in any area.at.it does not interpret the term any area or state that the term refers to an area immediately adjacent to a transportation project.thus,the response does not establish the meaning of the term any area at the time the defendants issued their conformity determination.
therefore,the governing regulations do not decisively answer whether the caa required qualitative analysis within the immediate vicinity of the project area during the time period at issue.
the epa and dot conformity guidance implicitly,but authoritatively,fills this void by interpreting these ambiguous regulations to permit the type of analysis defendants performed here.although the conformity guidance does not explicitly interpret terms such as any area,a location,or appropriate receptor locations,the methodological examples it sets forth make clear that a qualitative pm hotspot analysis may be performed by analyzing data from an existing air quality monitor in
