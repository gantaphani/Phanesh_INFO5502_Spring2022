the national association of home builders,the southern arizona home builders association,and the home builders association of central arizona collectively,home builders appeal the district court decision upholding the designation of a population of cactus ferruginous in arizona as a distinct population segment dps pursuant to the fish and wildlife service fws policy regarding the recognition of distinct vertebrate population segments under the endangered species act,dps policy.home builders argue that this dps designation violated the dps policy because the arizona population is neither discrete nor significant.we hold that,although the fws did not arbitrarily find the arizona population to be discrete,the fws arbitrarily found the discrete population to be significant.we therefore reverse the district court decision and remand the listing rule to the district court.

the cactus ferruginous glaucidium brasilianum cactorum is a small bird,about inches in length,that can be or gray.determination of endangered status for the cactus ferruginous pygmy owl in arizona,codified at h listing rule.it is one of four subspecies of the ferruginous.id.the range of the cactus ferruginous extends from lowland central arizona south through western mexico,to the states of colima and michoacan,and from southern texas south through the mexican states of tamaulipas and nuevo leon.id.the in arizona represent the northernmost edge of the subspecies range.id.at.

in the listing rule,the fws designated the arizona as a dps.at.the esa permits the fws to designate a population of a species as a dps and to list it as an endangered species.see,a.to designate a dps under the dps policy,the fws must find that a population is discrete in relation to the remainder of the species to which it belongs and significant to the species to which it belongs.at.in making this designation in the listing rule,the fws first found that the populations in the east southeast texas south through northeastern mexico and west central arizona south through northwestern mexico are discrete based on geographic isolation,distribution and status of habitat,and potential morphological and genetic distinctness,and significant because the loss of either population would create a significant gap in the range of the subspecies.at.
next,the fws further subdivided the western dps into an arizona population and a northwestern mexico population id.according to the listing rule,the arizona are discrete from the northwestern mexico because they are delimited by international boundaries and the status of the species in arizona is different from that in sonora mexico,with records currently indicating a higher number of individuals in sonora.id.at.the fws also found that the discrete population of arizona is significant to its taxon because 
s hould the loss of either the arizona or texas populations occur,the remaining population would not fill the resulting gap as the remaining population would not be genetically or morphologically identical,and would require different habitat parameters.the loss of either population also would decrease the genetic variability of the taxon and would result in a significant gap in the range.
home builders sued to vacate the listing rule and the designation of critical habitat.the district court granted summary judgment to the fws.home builders,wl,at.the district court held that the fws decision to divide the western population,at the international border between arizona and mexico in order to protect the population segment facing extinction within the united states was permissible and consistent with esa policy.id.at.the district court also granted the fws motion for partial voluntary remand of critical habitat designation and vacated the designation because of insufficient economic impact analysis.id.at.

discussion 
preliminarily,it is helpful to note what is not at issue in this case.first,home builders do not challenge the dps policy itself they agree that the policy is valid and entitled to chevron deference the challenge here is only to the fws application of the dps policy.second,home builders do not challenge the fws determination that,once severed from the rest of the western population,the arizona could be considered endangered.home builders only challenge their designation as a dps.third,home builders do not contest the designation of the eastern and western as dpss,only the subdivision of the western into the arizona dps and the northwestern mexico population thus,the question we must decide is whether the fws violated its dps policy by finding that the arizona are a discrete and significant population.
the fws acted arbitrarily and capriciously in designating the arizona pygmy owls as a dps 
the esa definition of species includes any subspecies of fish or wildlife or plants,and any distinct population segment of any species of vertebrate fish or wildlife which interbreeds when mature.emphasis added.thus,under the esa,the fws can designate a particular population of a species as a dps and then consider that dps as a species for listing purposes,a.
the ability to designate and list dpss allows the fws to provide different levels of protection to different populations of the same species.see dps policy.at see also,at.the fws does not have to list an entire species as endangered when only one of its populations faces extinction.
since the esa does not define the term distinct population segment,the fws and the national marine fisheries service jointly promulgated the dps policy to ensure consistency in their respective dps designations.under the dps policy,a dps must be discrete in relation to the remainder of the species to which it belongs and significant to the species to which it belongs.at.a dps must be both discrete and significant,because t he interests of conserving genetic diversity would not be well served by efforts directed at either but insignificant units or entities believed to be significant but around which boundaries can not be recognized.id.at.
a.the fws did not arbitrarily and capriciously find that the arizona population is discrete 
the purpose of the discreteness standard is to ensure that a dps is adequately defined and described,allowing for the effective administration of the esa.dps policy.at.this standard distinguishes a population from other members of its species,but does not require absolute separation.id.a population is discrete if i t is markedly separated from other populations of the same taxon as a consequence of physical,physiological,ecological,or behavioral factors or i t is delimited by international governmental boundaries within which differences in control of exploitation,management of habitat,conservation status,or regulatory mechanisms exist that are significant in light of section a d of the act.id.at.although the use of international borders may introduce an artificial and element into the discreteness standard,it appears to be reasonable for national legislation to recognize units delimited by international boundaries when these coincide with differences in the management,status,or exploitation of a species.id.at.
in the listing rule,the fws found that the arizona are discrete from the northwestern mexico because the international border divides the two populations and significant differences in conservation status exist between those populations.see.at t he service believes the status of the species in arizona is different from that in sonora,mexico,with records currently indicating a higher number of individuals in sonora.home builders contend that the fws failed to demonstrate any differences in the conservation status of in arizona and northwestern mexico.the issue here,therefore,is whether the fws acted arbitrarily in determining that significant differences in conservation status exist across the international boundary.
the dps policy does not define the term conservation status.see.at.the fws argues that the term conservation status means the number of individuals left in the population.as a consequence,differences in conservation status mean differences in the number of owls on either side of the border.a court must defer to an agency interpretation of its own regulations unless it is plainly erroneous.stinson united states,d.home builders do not challenge the fws interpretation of conservation status,and it does not seem to be plainly erroneous.this interpretation is not a post hoc rationalization in the fws litigating position,because the fws has used the term similarly in other listing rules.see,endangered status for the peninsular ranges population segment of the desert bighorn sheep in,finding significant differences between the united states and mexico in regard to the species conservation status where the population in baja california is not likely to be in danger of extirpation within the foreseeable future because there are significantly more animals there than occur in the united states.this interpretation also does not reduce the surrounding of exploitation,management of habitat,regulatory redundancy or surplusage.see babbitt sweet home chapter of cmtys.for a great,d.we conclude that conservation status,as used in the discreteness test,is a term of art that lends itself to interpretation by the fws.
comparing the conservation status of across the border,the fws found that were abundant in parts of northwestern mexico but were rare and declining in arizona listing rule.home builders challenge the fws assertion that were once common in arizona but have been declining in number since the mid due to habitat modification and destruction.home builders contend that the were never numerous in arizona,because their numbers have always fluctuated as a peripheral population at the edge of the subspecies range.home builders also attack the fws use of data from early naturalists as unreliable.to support its claims,home builders cite to a study they commissioned and to comments from several arizona agencies.
this issue is a classic example of a factual dispute the resolution of which implicates substantial agency expertise.graham red squirrel espy,cir quoting marsh or.natural res.council,d.courts defer to agencies w hen specialists express conflicting views,because an agency must have discretion to rely on the reasonable opinions of its own qualified experts even if,as an original matter,a court might find contrary views more persuasive.id.quoting marsh,at.see also.cattle growers ass n,at.
this case presents exactly the type of informed agency discretion to which we must defer.see marsh,at.after examining all the evidence,including the comments and studies cited by home builders,the fws found that the declining numbers of arizona were due to habitat destruction and modification,not fluctuations in a peripheral population.listing rule.at.additionally,if the reports of early naturalists were the best available scientific suggested by the reliance of home builders experts on the fws did not abuse its discretion by relying on them.see greenpeace action franklin,cir stating that when agencies rely on their experts and employ the best available scientific evidence,the fact that the evidence is weak,and thus not dispositive,does not render the agency determination arbitrary and capricious quoting stop ass dole,cir.the fws finding that were extremely limited in distribution in arizona but existed in greater numbers in northwestern mexico,listing rule.at,was an adequate exercise of agency expertise.thus,we hold that the fws did not arbitrarily find that the differences in the conservation status of across the border satisfied the discreteness element of the dps policy.
b.the fws has not demonstrated a rational basis in the listing rule for its finding that the arizona pygmy owl population is significant to its taxon 
if a population is discrete,the fws then considers the biological and ecological significance of the population to the taxon to which it belongs.dps policy.at.the purpose of the significance element is to carry out the expressed congressional intent that this authority to list dpss be exercised sparingly as well as to concentrate conservation efforts undertaken under the act on avoiding important losses of genetic diversity.id.at see also,at t he committee is aware of the great potential for abuse of this authority to list dpss and expects the fws to use the ability to list populations sparingly and only when the biological evidence indicates that such action is warranted.the fws determines the significance of a discrete population by considering the following factors 
persistence of the discrete population segment in an ecological setting unusual or unique for the taxon,
evidence that loss of the discrete population segment would result in a significant gap in the range of a taxon,
evidence that the discrete population segment represents the only surviving natural occurrence of a taxon that may be more abundant elsewhere as an introduced population outside its historic range,or 
evidence that the discrete population segment differs markedly from other populations of the species in its genetic characteristics.
dps policy.at.
in the listing rule,the fws found that the discrete population of arizona is significant because 
s hould the loss of either the arizona or texas populations occur,the remaining population would not fill the resulting gap as the remaining population would not be genetically or morphologically identical,and would require different habitat parameters.the loss of either population also would decrease the genetic variability of the taxon and would result in a significant gap in the range.
at.the fws argues that it found the arizona population to be significant to its taxon in the listing rule based on the second and fourth significance factors.
the second significance factor 
in the listing rule,the fws concluded that the loss of the arizona would result in a significant gap in the range of their taxon.at.the question,then,is whether the fws arbitrarily determined that the loss of the discrete arizona population would cause a gap in the range of its taxon and that such a gap would be significant.see dps policy.at.
whether the loss of the arizona pygmy owl population would cause a gap in the range of the taxon 
the fws noted in the listing rule that the arizona represent the northernmost portion of the range.at.the parties disagree over whether the loss of a peripheral population,a population at the edge of a species range could create a gap in the range of a taxon.the parties analogize to a gap in a fence to support their respective definitions of a gap in the range of a taxon.home builders argue that a gap,by definition,occurs in the middle of the fence,not at its end,so that only the loss of a population that severs a taxon into isolated parts would create a gap.the fws argues that the gap in a fence is just as great if it occurs at the end as in the middle,so that the loss of a peripheral population would create a gap in a taxon range.
the dps policy does not define what constitutes a gap for the purposes of the second significance factor.see.at.the ordinary dictionary definition of gap is a hole or opening,as in a wall or fence,made by breaking or parting,which does not by itself resolve the ambiguity of this issue.webster new world dictionary of american english at ed.since the definition of gap is ambiguous,the fws is entitled to deference in interpreting its own regulations,unless that interpretation is plainly erroneous.stinson,at.the fws has previously found a gap in the middle of the fence.see.at the loss of peninsular bighorn sheep in the united states would isolate bighorn sheep populations in mexico from all other bighorn sheep.in other listing rules,however,the fws has interpreted the term gap to include the loss of peripheral populations.see determination of endangered status for the.distinct vertebrate population segment of the mountain frog,july,finding that the loss of the southern california frogs on the periphery of the species range would create a gap in the range of the taxon final rule to list the santa barbara county distinct population of the.tiger salamander as endangered,finding that the loss of the southernmost population of the species would create a gap in the range of the taxon determination of threatened status for the northern population of the copperbelly water snake,concluding that t he loss of the peripheral,isolated,northern population would create a gap in the range of the taxon finding for a petition to list the.population of the western sage grouse,proposed may,finding that the loss of the extreme northwestern extent of greater sage grouse range would create a gap in the range of the taxon.
we defer to the fws interpretation of a gap at the end of the fence because it is not plainly erroneous.even the loss of a peripheral population,however small,would create an empty geographic space in the range of the taxon.regardless of the size of such a gap,a gap would exist.to satisfy the second significance factor,however,the gap must be significant,to which question we now turn.
whether the gap would be significant 
since the loss of the arizona would create a gap in the range of the taxon,we now consider whether that gap is significant.the dps policy intended the term significant to have its commonly understood meaning,which is important.at webster new world dictionary at.the plain language of the second significance factor does not limit how a gap could be important,see dps policy.at,and,as discussed infra,the fws has given different reasons for the importance of gaps in various listing rules.
in the listing rule,the fws did not clearly explain why the gap that would be caused by the extirpation of the arizona is significant.agencies must articulate a satisfactory explanation for their action to permit effective judicial review.ctr.clarke,cir quoting northwest motorcycle ass united states dep t of agriculture,cir see also dps policy.at,pledging fully to explain any dps designation in detail.we can,however,uphold agency decisions of less than ideal clarity if the agency path may reasonably be discerned,so long as we do not supply a reasoned basis for the agency action that the agency itself has not given or attempt to make up for deficiencies in the agency decision,at quoting northwest motorcycle ass n,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
the fws argues that it found the gap to be significant in the listing rule because the loss of the arizona would decrease the genetic variability of the taxon reduce the current range of the taxon reduce the historic range of the taxon and extirpate the western from the united states.we therefore must examine whether the fws had a rational basis in its listing rule to base a significance finding on any of these grounds or whether the fws arguments here are only post hoc rationalizations.
decrease the genetic variability of the taxon 
in the listing rule,the fws found that the loss of the arizona population would decrease the genetic variability of the taxon.at.on appeal,the fws contends that peripheral populations like the arizona may have more genetic divergence than central populations,making them more important to the survival of the species,particularly in response to adaption to environmental change.thus,since the peripheral arizona population might be genetically distinct from the central population of in northwestern mexico,the loss of the arizona population could impair the survival of the northwestern mexico population in a crisis.at finding that the loss of the peripheral mountain frog population could have significant conservation implications because it may be genetically and morphologically divergent from central populations.
the listing rule discusses genetic differences among in two places.first,in a discussion of whether the eastern and western were separate dpss,the fws found that the eastern and western populations were discrete from each other based in part on their potential morphological and genetic distinctness.at.second,in the listing rule discussion of whether the arizona should be listed as an endangered species,which was separate from the discussion on whether the arizona constituted a dps,the fws addressed the genetic vulnerability to random extinction.id.at.in that section,the fws cited the only genetic study completed on in the united states,which found very little genetic difference between in texas and northeastern mexico.id.at.the low levels of genetic variation in the were noteworthy because p opulations without genetic variation are often considered imperiled due to either the effect of low population numbers,increased chance of inbreeding,or both.id.
nowhere in the listing rule,however,does the fws mention the existence of any genetic differences between the in arizona and northwestern mexico,nor does the record provide any evidence to that effect.see generally.neither the fws finding of potential genetic differences among western and eastern,nor the genetic study that discovered very little genetic difference between the texas and southeastern mexico,is evidence of genetic differences between arizona and northwestern mexico.we can not defer to the fws argument on appeal that the arizona are genetically distinct from and important to the central population of northwestern mexico because the fws did not make such a finding in the listing rule.since the listing rule does not contain evidence of genetic variability between the arizona and northwestern mexico,the argument that the loss of the arizona population is significant because it would decrease the genetic variability of the taxon,id.at,appears to be a post hoc rationalization.while the fws can draw conclusions based on less than conclusive scientific evidence,southwest ctr.for biological diversity babbitt,it can not base its conclusions on no evidence.see bennett spear,d the obvious purpose of the requirement that each agency use the best scientific and commercial evidence available is to ensure that the esa not be implemented haphazardly,on the basis of speculation or surmise.
reduce the current range of the taxon 
the fws argues that the gap would be significant because the loss of the arizona would reduce the current range of its taxon.in other listing rules,the fws has found two ways in which the loss of a discrete population could reduce the current range of its taxon.
first,the loss of a discrete population could reduce the geographic size of the taxon range.see final rule to list the northern population of the bog turtle as threatened and the southern population as threatened due to similarity of appearance,the northern population of the bog turtle meets the significance criterion because loss of this dps,which occurs in seven states and represents over percent of the species range,would result in a significant void in the range and distribution of the species.finding for a petition to list the cuckoo in the western continental united states,july,finding a gap to be significant in part because the loss of the western cuckoos would reduce the species current range by more than percent see also.at finding the loss of the salamander population to be significant in part because it would result in the curtailment of the range of the species as a whole.these listing rules suggest that finding a gap significant based on the curtailment of a taxon current range requires the loss of a geographic area that amounts to a substantial reduction of a taxon range.see.at.the fws found in the listing rule,however,that the arizona represented only a small percentage of the total range of the western.at.it did not find that the loss of this small percentage of the western current range would substantially curtail that range.
second,the loss of a discrete population that is numerous and constitutes a large percentage of the total number of taxon members could be considered a significant curtailment of a taxon current range.see proposed endangered status for a distinct population segment of smalltooth sawfish in the united states,proposed,finding that a gap caused by the loss of the sawfish population in the united states would be significant because that population was very large and other populations of smalltooth sawfish in the world were small and declining.here,the fws found that the arizona number between and individuals.see home builders,wl,at.the fws did not find,however,that the loss of these to individuals would significantly curtail the western current range,which consists mostly of the northwestern mexico population.see listing rule.at.
reduce the historic range of the taxon 
the fws argues that the gap would be significant because the loss of the arizona would reduce the historical range of its taxon.other listing rules have found a gap to be significant on these grounds.see.at l oss of the population segment of western sage grouse that remains within the columbia basin would represent a significant gap in the historic range of the taxon.at finding a gap to be significant in part because the loss of the western cuckoos would mean a loss of the species from about percent of its historic range in the continental united states.
the issue here is whether the fws provided a rational basis in the listing rule for its conclusion that the loss of the arizona population would significantly reduce the historical range of its taxon.we confronted a similar issue in defenders of wildlife.the esa defines an endangered species as any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.emphasis added.from that definition,it was unclear what constituted a significant portion of a species range.we held that a species could be extinct throughout a significant portion of its range if there are major geographical areas in which it is no longer viable but once was.at.although the significant gap in the range analysis required for a dps is not the same as the significant portion of the range analysis required for a listing decision for the entire species.at,the two analyses are similar and defenders of wildlife provides useful guidance here.by analogy,the historical range of a taxon would be reduced if there are major geographical areas in which it is no longer viable but once was.defenders of wildlife,at.
while the loss of in arizona would mean that western were no longer viable where they once were,the question arises as to whether arizona is a major geographic area in the historical range of the western.we emphasized in defenders of wildlife that the flexibility of the major geographical area analysis gave the fws a wide degree of discretion to determine what constituted a major geographic area of a species range.see id.in the listing rule,however,the fws concluded only that the arizona population was at the periphery of the western historical range and that this peripheral population was always a stable portion of that range.see.at.that,by itself,does not make arizona a major geographical area in the western historic range and the listing rule is devoid of further discussion relevant to this issue.the proposed listing rule contains a map of the western historic range.at,but we can not be compelled to guess at whether the map shows that arizona constitutes a major geographic area of that historic range.see sec chenery.it will not do for a court to be compelled to guess at the theor
