introduction 
defendant,the city of manhattan beach the city,appeals from a judgment issuing a peremptory writ of mandate.the city had issued a negative declaration under the california environmental quality act in connection with an ordinance.pub.resources code et the ordinance prohibited certain retailers,including grocery stores,from providing plastic bags to customers at the point of sale.the trial court vacated the ordinance and disallowed reenactment pending an environmental impact report.the trial court found substantial evidence supported a fair argument the ordinance may cause increased use of paper bags,which may have a significant negative impact on the environment,therefore an environmental impact report was required.we agree.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.we do not resolve the question of the ultimate merits of whether the plastic bag distribution ban should be implemented.all we are saying is that an environmental impact report must be prepared given that it can be fairly argued based on substantial evidence in the record that the ordinance may have a significant environmental impact.we emphasize that the fair argument test sets a low threshold for preparation of an environmental impact report and reflects a preference for resolving doubts in favor of environmental review.
ii.background 
a.the ordinance 
on july,the city adopted ordinance,which prohibits the use of plastic bags in specified circumstances.as set forth in section of the ordinance,the city council found a.as a coastal city manhattan beach has a strong interest in protecting the marine environment an element which contributes to the unique quality of life in the city.plastic and paper bags each have negative impacts on the environment.it is well known that paper bags require more energy to manufacture and recycle and generate effluent during these processes.it is also known that paper bags are bulkier and heavier than plastic bags.c.however a primary and significant problem with plastic bags is that they do not biodegrade and are extremely light and easily caught in the wind.in a coastal city like manhattan beach even plastic bags which are properly discarded can find their way into the marine environment where they do not break down and essentially remain indefinitely.d.the pacific ocean contains a huge accumulation of debris known as the great pacific garbage patch which consists mostly of plastic debris.some scientists estimate the density of plastic in this garbage patch as one million pieces of plastic per square mile.while plastic does not it does breaking down into smaller pieces which can make their way into the food chain via such animals as jellyfish.e.while the exact numbers are unknown there are many reported instances of marine animals being injured or dying from ingesting or choking on plastic debris in the ocean.it is reasonable to conclude from such information that the presence of plastic debris in the ocean provides a hazard for marine life.because there is a strong possibility that plastic bags discarded in manhattan beach can end up in the ocean where they will last indefinitely and create an aesthetic blight and potential hazard to marine life and paper bags will not do so because they biodegrade and are less likely to be blown out to sea it is in the best interests of the public health,safety and welfare to adopt the proposed ban on distribution of plastic bags at point of sale within the boundaries of the city of manhattan beach.g.the city council of the city of manhattan beach conducted a noticed public hearing regarding the project at their regular scheduled meeting of july.the public hearing was advertised pursuant to applicable law and testimony was invited and received.h.an initial environmental study was prepared in compliance with the provisions of the california environmental quality act.based upon this study it was determined that the project is not an action involving any significant impacts upon the environment,and a negative declaration was prepared and is hereby adopted.i.the proposed amendments will have no negative impact on fish and game resources pursuant to section b of the public resources code.the ordinance added chapter,environment regulations,section to the manhattan beach municipal code providing in part no affected retail establishment,restaurant,vendor or vendor shall provide plastic bags to customers at the point of sale.reusable bags and recyclable paper bags are allowed alternatives.recyclable paper bag was defined as,a paper bag that meets all of the following requirements contains no old growth fiber is percent recyclable overall and contains a minimum of percent recycled content and displays the words reusable and recyclable in a highly visible manner on the outside of the bag.
b.the initial study 
the city goal,as reflected in the ordinance,is to protect the marine environment and marine life.that concern is discussed in the initial study as follows the project consists of the adoption of an ordinance which would ban plastic shopping bags,thereby decreasing the prevalence of plastic bag litter in the marine environment in and near the city plastic debris is a major pollutant of coastal waters.in the pacific ocean there exists a huge accumulation of debris know n as the great pacific garbage patch or plastic soup.this is an accumulation of mostly plastic debris drawn by currents to accumulate in the area of the northern pacific ocean known as the north pacific gyre.some scientists estimate the density of the plastic in this region at one million pieces of plastic per square mile.plastic does not biodegrade so over the past two decades this mass has been growing.some studies show that plastic breaking into smaller pieces and making its way into the food chain via animals such as jellyfish.while it may be difficult to ascertain the exact numbers of marine life which perish every year due to ingestion of or choking on plastic debris there are numerous anecdotal accounts of marine life being discovered with plastic debris in their stomachs or clogging their breathing apparatus.reducing the use of plastic bags in the city will have only a modest positive impact on the migration of plastic refuse into the ocean.however,as a coastal city the imposition of the ban is likely to have some modest impact on improving water quality and removing a potential biohazard from the marine environment.
on the basis of its initial study,the city found the plastic bag distribution ban could not have a significant effect on the environment.the city acknowledged the ordinance may result in greater paper bag use,which could have negative environmental effects including increased power plant,paper mill and recycling plant emissions traffic involved in shipping paper bags to retail establishments and emissions from trucks carrying heavier,bulkier paper bags.the initial study also found reducing the use of plastic bags in the city would have only a modest positive impact on the migration of plastic refuse into the ocean.the initial study concluded,however,that there would be no environmental impact as to aesthetics,agriculture,biological and cultural resources,geology and soils,hazards and hazardous materials,hydrology and water quality,land use and planning,mineral resources,noise,population and housing,fire and police protection,schools and parks,recreation,and utilities and service systems other than landfills.the initial study further found less than significant environmental impact with respect to air quality,traffic and landfill capacity because the increased use of paper bags would be relatively small with minimal or no increase in pollutants generated from production and recycling and increase in truck traffic plastic bag bans imposed by political subdivisions in california are not widespread all paper bags used at point of sale in the city would be composed of at least percent recyclable material the city population is only the ordinance does not ban all use of plastic bags,only their distribution at point of sale only percent of the city is zoned for commercial use there are only licensed retail establishments in the city that might use plastic bags there are only two supermarkets,three drug stores,and one target store in the city known to be high volume users of plastic bags many restaurants and most fast food outlets use paper bags for orders plastic bags would not be replaced by paper bags on a ratio a larger portion of paper bags is recycled than plastic the city represents a small proportion of regional landfill users and in light of anticipated education efforts,increased publicity and growing public concern for the environment,it was expected that at least some percentage of plastic bags will be replaced by reusable bags rather than paper bags.
c.the writ petition 
on august,shortly after the ordinance was adopted,plaintiff,save the plastic bag coalition,filed its verified mandate petition and a declaratory relief request.plaintiff alleged it is an unincorporated association of plastic bag manufacturers,distributors,and others.plaintiff further alleged it was formed to counter myths,misinformation and exaggerations about plastic bags by various groups purporting to promote environmental quality and to require governmental agencies to comply with the california environmental quality act before banning plastic bags.plaintiff averred there was no evidence plastic bags were a continuing significant problem for marine animals the ordinance will inevitably result in increased use of paper bags,which have greater significant negative environmental effects than plastic bags the use of paper bags increases consumption of nonrenewable primary energy and water greater paper bag use increases emission of climate changing greenhouse gases,acid rain,negative air quality,water body eutrophication and solid waste production and paper bags degrade in landfills while plastic bags do not,but decomposing paper produces methane,a potent greenhouse gas.plaintiff concluded that if the city were required to prepare an environmental impact report,the city council and the public would know the true facts about the ways in which and the extent to which paper bags are worse for the environment and that banning plastic bags would not have any material effect on the environment.
d.the cited reports 
the parties cited to and relied on several reports in the administrative record discussing the environmental impacts of plastic and paper bag use.we summarize those reports below.
the scottish government report 
in,a report entitled,proposed plastic bag impact assessment report was produced for and published by the scottish government.the report was commissioned in response to a bill in the scottish parliament to impose an environmental levy on lightweight plastic carrier bags as provided by shops and retail outlets.the bill was intended to cover all bags made partially or completely of plastic except for those used for directly packing fresh meat,fish,fruit and other foods.the preparers of the report summarized the arguments pro and con advocates of a levy on plastic bags cite the main benefits as being reduced littering including marine litter,reduced use of resources and energy,lower pollutant emissions and increased public awareness of environmental issues.opponents argue that lightweight plastic carrier bags are hygienic,convenient and durable,that they are often reused for other purposes,that they form only a small part of the litter stream and that they have a lower overall environmental impact than paper bags.they also claim that a levy would impact unfairly on poorer households and would lead to job losses in scotland from reduced plastic bag manufacturing and importing.the study considered a range of scenarios,including a levy on both plastic and paper bags.the study took into account an irish plastic bag levy and voluntary schemes in the united kingdom along with results from life cycle analysis studies performed in france and australia.
the scottish report considered eight indicators of environmental impact nonrenewable energy consumption water consumption greenhouse gas emissions acid rain air quality eutrophication of water bodies solid waste production and risk of litter.as compared to a lightweight plastic carrier bag at a constant of,a paper bag was found to cause times more nonrenewable energy consumption times the consumption of water times the emission of greenhouse gases times more acid rain times ground level ozone formation times the eutrophication of water bodies and times the solid waste production.only with respect to risk of litter did the paper bag fare better than the plastic bag.the preparers concluded a plastic bag tax was likely to increase the use of paper bags as well as reusable bags due to their physical properties and the impact of their manufacture and transportation,and relative to plastic bag use,use of paper bags had a greater impact on the environment in each of the eight categories except risk of litter a plastic bag tax would have a negative effect on the environment in terms of water consumption and eutrophication but because of the between negative environmental impacts from increased paper bag use and the positive environmental impacts from reduced plastic bag use,the overall environmental effect of a plastic bag levy would remain very similar to no levy at all and only if a tax were also placed on paper bags would the negative effects on the environment as measured by the eight indicators be significantly reduced.
the preparers summarized their main conclusions the analysis shows that there would be an environmental benefit for some of the indicators depending on what consumers choose to use were a levy to be introduced.t he biggest environmental improvement is seen where paper bags are included in the levy.these occur for all environmental indicators.in scenarios where paper bags are excluded from the levy,the environmental benefits of reduced plastic bag usage are negated for some indicators by the impacts of increased paper bag usage.this is because a paper bag has a more adverse impact than a plastic bag for most of the environmental issues considered.areas where paper bags score particularly badly include water consumption,atmospheric acidification which can have effects on human health,sensitive ecosystems,forest decline and acidification of lakes and eutrophication of water bodies which can lead to growth of algae and depletion of oxygen.paper bags are anywhere between six and ten times heavier than lightweight plastic carrier bags and,as such,require more transport and its associated costs.they would also take up more room in a landfill if they were not recycled.the analysis demonstrates that paper bags should be included to maximize the potential environmental benefit of the levy.
the boustead report 
in,an entity called the progressive bag alliance contracted with boustead consulting associates boustead to conduct life cycle manufacture,distribution,disposal assessments with respect to three types of grocery bags plastic compostable plastic and paper made of percent recycled fibers.the plastic bag was a traditional polyethylene grocery bag.the study found in part the results show that single use plastic bags made from polyethylene have many advantages over both compostable plastic bags made from ecoflex and paper bags made with a minimum of percent recycled fiber.

when compared to percent recycled fiber paper bags,polyethylene grocery bags use less energy in terms of fuels for manufacturing,less oil,and less potable water.in addition,polyethylene plastic grocery bags emit fewer global warming gases,less acid rain emissions,and less solid wastes.the same trend exists when comparing the typical polyethylene grocery bag to grocery bags made with compostable plastic plastic grocery bags use less energy in terms of fuels for manufacturing,less oil,and less potable water,and emit fewer global warming gases,less acid rain emissions,and less solid waste.the findings of this study were peer reviewed by an independent third party with significant experience in life cycle assessments to ensure that the results are reliable and repeatable.the results support the conclusion that any decision to ban traditional polyethylene plastic grocery bags in favor of bags made from alternative materials compostable plastic or recycled paper will result in a significant increase in environmental impacts across a number of categories from global warming effects to the use of precious potable water resources.as a result,consumers and legislators should banning traditional plastic grocery bags,as the unintended consequences can be significant and.the boustead report concluded increased recycling,secondary usage,and keeping plastic bags out of the litter stream would appear to be more productive than a ban in reducing the overall environmental impact of plastic bag use.
the uls report 
in april,the city of san francisco imposed a ban on supermarket and pharmacy distribution of plastic carry out bags at the point of sale.san francisco environment code,chapter,
statename california december.in response,the editors of the uls use less stuff report examined four studies by others and developed their own conclusions,which they set forth in a march,report.the uls report found paper bags do not degrade or break down at a substantially faster rate than plastic bags plastic bags generate less greenhouse gas emissions in production than uncomposted or composted paper bags the production of plastic bags consumes less water than that needed to produce paper bags a plastic bag production and lifecycle consumes less nonrenewable energy than a paper bag paper bags generate more solid waste than plastic bags and a fter four or more uses,reusable plastic bags are superior to all types of disposable,polyethylene and compostable all significant environmental indicators.the uls report concluded while paper and certain plastics may be biodegradable or compostable in specially designed industrial facilities,evidence indicates that this feature may be of little value in the effort to reduce waste t he evidence does not support conventional wisdom that paper bags are a more environmentally sustainable alternative than plastic bags and w hile the data appear to indicate that paper and compostable plastic bags may account for less litter,data also indicates that this finding is offset by the increased environmental impacts these bags produce versus traditional plastic bags.with respect to legislation banning plastic bags,the uls report summarized legislation designed to reduce environmental impacts and litter by outlawing grocery bags based on the material from which they are produced will not deliver the intended results.while some litter reduction might take place,it would be outweighed by the disadvantages that would subsequently occur increased solid waste and greenhouse gas emissions w hen it comes to reducing the environmental and litter impacts of grocery and merchandise bags,the solution lies in minimizing the materials used to produce all types of bags,regardless of their composition,and building public awareness and motivation to reduce,reuse and recycle these that order.
the franklin report 
franklin associates,prepared a june report entitled,resource and environmental profile analysis of polyethylene and unbleached paper grocery sacks for the council for solid waste solutions.the report states it was prompted by concerns about decreasing landfill capacity and the solid packaging that accounted for roughly of the weight of the municipal solid waste being landfilled.the study stated purpose was to determine the energy and environmental impacts of polyethylene and paper grocery sacks.a methodology was employed to determine energy and environmental impacts of plastic versus paper bags this methodology measures energy consumption and environmental emissions at each stage of a product life cycle,beginning at the point of raw materials extraction from the earth and proceeding through processing,manufacturing,use,and final disposal,recycle,or reuse.the ratio of polyethylene sacks to paper sacks used was considered crucial to the results.based on data collected from supermarket chains and other industry sources,the preparers settled on ratios of and polyethylene to paper,and the results were presented using those ratios.the report concluded energy the energy requirements for the polyethylene grocery sacks are between and percent less than for paper sacks at zero percent recycling of both sacks.as recycling increases for both bag types at the polyethylene paper sack ratio,the energy requirements become equivalent at approximately a percent recycling rate.at the polyethylene paper sack ratio,the polyethylene sack continues to required percent less energy than paper even at percent recycling.environmental.polyethylene sacks contribute between and percent less solid waste than paper sacks at zero percent recycling.polyethylene sacks continue to contribute less solid waste than paper sacks at all recycling rates.atmospheric emissions for the polyethylene sack are between and percent less than for the paper sack at zero percent recycling.these lower impacts for the polyethylene sack continue throughout all recycling rates.at zero percent recycling rate,the polyethylene sack contributes over percent less waterborne wastes than the paper sack.this percent difference actually increases as the recycling rate for both grocery sacks increases.recyclability both bag types are recyclable.manufacturing scrap and trim from the fabrication of the sacks are typically recycled.postconsumer recycling for both of these sacks has not been significant.in the case of paper sacks,they are most typically recycled during the collection of old newspapers.for polyethylene sacks,efforts are usually concentrated on industrial scrap film.however,efforts have recently begun to collect both polyethylene and paper grocery sacks at the postconsumer level.incineration impacts on a per pound basis,polyethylene releases times more energy upon incineration than unbleached paper.however,on an equal use basis,paper grocery sacks weigh to times more than polyethylene grocery sacks.therefore,on an equivalent use basis,the paper sack has a greater potential for energy released from incineration than the polyethylene sack.the ash content per pound of unbleached paper is greater than that of polyethylene.thus,even on an equivalent use basis,the paper sack has a greater potential for more ash from incineration than the polyethylene sack.landfill impacts volume.the landfill volume occupied by the polyethylene sacks is to percent less than the volume occupied by paper sacks based on uses degradability.while some degradation occurs in landfills,little data exist regarding what materials degrade and the rate of decomposition.therefore,the degradability of both paper and polyethylene grocery sacks can not be predicted.as a consequence,no estimates can be made regarding the potential for impact on landfill leachate or methane gas production.
the los angeles county report 
in april,the los angeles county board of supervisors instructed county officials to investigate polyethylene plastic and paper bag consumption and the likely impact of an ordinance of the type proposed in san francisco.the report preparers reviewed and analyzed published studies from around the world in order to assess the ecological,environmental,and financial impacts of carry out bags.the preparers also surveyed grocery and retail stores,solid waste facilities and others and consulted public and environmental interest groups.the comprehensive report focused on the litter problem associated with plastic bags.the key findings were plastic carryout bags have been found to significantly contribute to litter and have other negative impacts on marine wildlife and the environment.biodegradable carryout bags are not a practical solution to this issue in los angeles county because there are no local commercial composting facilities able to process the biodegradable carryout bags at this time.reusable bags contribute towards environmental sustainability over plastic and paper carryout bags.and accelerating the widespread use of reusable bags will diminish plastic bag litter and redirect environmental preservation efforts and resources towards greener practices.
iii.discussion 
the city argues plaintiff has no standing to bring this mandate proceeding because it lacks the required beneficial interest it is an association of plastic bag manufacturers who will be economically damaged by a ban on the dissemination of plastic bags.plaintiff counters that it exists to respond to the misinformation,myths,and exaggerations that have been disseminated about the environmental impacts of plastic bag use.the public interest plaintiff asserts in this action is the need for an environmental impact report which addresses pollution,greenhouse gas emissions and the other negative impacts resulting from paper bag use.the trial court concluded plaintiff has standing.we agree.the relevant facts being undisputed,standing is a question of law subject to our independent review.martin bridgeport community,th,in re estate of bowles th,bilafer bilafer th,but see burrtec waste industries,city of colton th,substantial evidence standard of review applies berclain america latina baan th,same.standing requirements are liberally construed in cases under the california environmental quality act.bozung local agency formation com.cal d,bakersfield citizens for local control city of bakersfield th.

preliminarily,we address whether the ordinance at issue may not be a project within the meaning of the california environmental quality act.the parties have not raised this issue.in fact,manhattan beach city attorney robert wadden,commendably agrees this is a project.at oral argument,wadden stated clearly the california environmental quality act applies we never argued that it was a project.i think it clearly is a project in any event,a project is defined in section project means an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment,or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment,which is any of the following a an activity directly undertaken by any public agency.our supreme court has held whether an activity constitutes a project subject to the california environmental quality act is a categorical question respecting whether the activity is of a general kind with which the act is concerned,without regard to whether the activity will actually have environmental impact whether an activity is a project is an issue of law that can be decided on undisputed data in the record on appeal.fullerton joint union high school dist.state bd.of education cal d,questioned on another point in board of supervisors local agency formation com.cal th.muzzy ranch solano county airport land use com.cal th.here,a public undertook an an,as discussed below,may cause a direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment.and our supreme court has applied the california environmental quality act when,as here,a public agency enacts an ordinance.friends of sierra madre city of sierra madre,supra,cal th at historic preservation ordinance no oil,city of los angeles cal d,ordinances permitting oil company to sink test wells.

plaintiff asserts there is substantial evidence in the record to support a fair argument the ordinance may result in an increased use of paper bags,which may have a significant effect on the environment.as noted above,the city acknowledged the ordinance might lead to increased paper bag use.further,the city acknowledged such increased use could have negative environmental effects including increased power plant,paper mill and recycling plant emissions traffic involved in shipping paper bags to retail establishments and emissions from trucks carrying heavier,bulkier paper bags.but the city concluded such increased paper bag use and any corresponding environmental effect would be minimal or nonexistent because plastic bag bans are not widespread the city population is only people plastic bag use by residents generally would not be their distribution at point of sale paper bags distributed at point of sale would be minimally composed of percent recyclable material only percent of the city was zoned for commercial use the city has only retail establishments that might use plastic bags there were only two supermarkets,three drug stores,and one target store known to be high volume users of plastic bags many restaurants and fast food outlets use paper bags for orders paper bags have a higher capacity,so plastic bags would not be replaced by paper bags on a ratio a larger portion of paper bags is recycled than plastic the city represents a small proportion of regional landfill users and as a result of education efforts and increased publicity together with public concern for the environment,it was expected some percentage of plastic bags to be replaced by reusable bags.
we conclude it can be fairly argued based on substantial evidence in light of the whole record that the plastic bag distribution ban may have a significant effect on the environment.the four reports cited by the parties and summarized scottish,boustead,uls and franklin the conclusions a plastic bag ban is likely to lead to increased use of paper as well as reusable bags paper bags have greater negative environmental effects as compared to plastic bags and the negative environmental effects include greater nonrenewable energy and water consumption,greenhouse gas emissions,solid waste production,and acid rain.it may be that the city population and the number of its retail establishments using plastic bags is so small and public concern for the environment is so high that there will be little or no increased use of paper bags as a result of the ordinance and little or no impact on the environment affected by the ordinance.but the initial study contains no information about the city actual,by way of example only the number of plastic and paper bags consumed recycling rates the quantity of plastic bags disposed of in city trash how the city disposes of its trash whether plastic bags are a significant portion of litter found how,when and in what quantities paper and plastic bags are delivered into the city whether the city has a landfill that would be impacted by any increased paper bag use whether there are recycling facilities or programs in the city or the surrounding area and what the likely impact will be of a campaign urging recycling and reusable bag use.there is no statutory exemption from compliance with the california environmental quality act based on a city geographical or population size.nor have we found any decisional authority to the effect that a small city should not be required to expend its resources to comply with the california environmental quality act when it believes its actions will have a positive effect on the environment.nor can the california environmental quality act requirements be ignored when,as is often the case,the party seeking compliance has some personally beneficial motive in doing so.we conclude the city should have prepared an environmental impact report because the california environmental quality act requires informed decisionmaking with respect to the environmental effects of a proposed project in re programmatic environmental impact report coordinated proceedings,supra,cal th at citizens of goleta valley board of supervisors,supra,cal d at preparation of an environmental impact report is the key to environmental protection no oil,city of los angeles,supra,cal d at citizens for responsible equitable environmental development city of san diego redevelopment agency,supra,th at the fair argument test creates a low threshold for preparation of an environmental impact report sierra club county of sonoma,supra,th at oro fino gold mining county of el dorado,supra,d at and substantial evidence in light of the whole record supports a fair argument the plastic bag distribution ban may have a significant environmental effect.

requiring the small city of manhattan beach city,containing a little over people,to expend public resources to prepare an environmental impact report eir for enacting what the city believes is an environmentally friendly ordinance phasing out the retail distribution not use of plastic carryout bags within the city and promoting the use of reusable bags not paper bags stretches the california environmental quality act pub.resources code,et ceqa and the requirements for an eir to an absurdity.virtually every act taken by government has some effect on the environment.most acts are of some public interest or arouse controversy.the trial court emphasis on public interest or controversy is misplaced because those factors do not mean the measure is environmentally significant so as to require an eir.
this action to require an eir was generated by the plastic bag industry for its economic interest even though it is the plastic bag that has caused environmental concerns.the legislature has declared that o n a global level,the production of plastic bags has significant environmental impacts each year stats,ch.the legislature attributed to plastic bags the death of thousands of marine animals,litter,contamination of soil and waterways,entrance of contamination into the food chain,and use of millions of barrels of oil ibid.in public resources code section,the legislature provided,the manufacturer of a plastic carryout bag shall develop educational materials to encourage the reducing,reusing,and recycling plastic bags and shall make those materials available to stores required to comply with this chapter.that this ordinance to protect the environment specifically within the city is invalidated under an environmental statute is especially ironic in view of the state legislation promoting the use of reusable bags and recycling of clean carryout plastic bags.pub.resources code,et.
notwithstanding that the city prepared a negative declaration,i have doubts that this ordinance even qualifies as a project under public resources code section a project is defined in that section as an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment,or a reasonably forseeable indirect physical change in the environment an activity that is not a project as defined in the public resources code see and the ceqa guidelines see is not subject to ceqa ceqa guidelines,subd.c.muzzy ranch solano county airport land use com.cal th.i realize that the term project is supposed to be given a broad interpretation tuolumne county citizens for responsible growth,city of sonora th,but to consider this ordinance a project requires that virtually all actions taken by a public agency be deemed projects.it is difficult to conceive of a public agency action that would not cause some theoretical reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment.do the kind and amount of supplies ordered by a public agency constitute a project as with plastic or paper bags,the manufacture and distribution of such supplies inevitably will have some foreseeable environmental impact,as will disposing of the waste those supplies eventually will become.will government publication of books and periodicals using paper,or the decision by a government agency not to go paperless,or policies to shift from cloth towels or hand blowers in restrooms to paper,or other measures that increase the use of paper constitute a project these impacts,as the ones in issue here,should not be deemed substantial enough for an eir.
with regard to any assertion as to an admission by the city,is it important to read in full what the city actually said in several sections that i have combined in its initial study about the proposed ordinance there is a potential that the banning of plastic bags in the city of manhattan beach may result in an increase in paper bag usage.the proposed ordinance does require that all paper bags used in the city at point of sale be at least composed of recyclable material.however,it is well documented that the manufacture and recycling of paper can consume more energy than plastic bags generate more wastewater than plastic bags.this increased use of energy could have an impact on the environment by increasing emissions from paper mills and recycling plants and possibly from trucks carrying the heavier,bulkier paper bags.however,the banning of plastic bags by political subdivisions is not widespread.in california only san francisco,oakland and malibu have enacted such bans and oakland was invalidated by a court.san francisco ban does not include biodegradable plastic bags and so will not displace all plastic bag usage.malibu is a city of only with an extremely small retail component within its boundaries.the population of manhattan beach is only according to the census.however,per capita bag usage would provide an inflated measurement of any net increase in paper bag use since the proposed ordinance does not ban the use of plastic bags by residents but their distribution at point of sale.only of the city is zoned commercial and there are only licensed retail establishments within the city which might use plastic bags.there are only two supermarkets,three and two future drug stores,and one target store known to be high volume users of plastic shopping bags in the city which would be affected by the ban.the remaining businesses tend to be smaller and lower volume and many restaurants and most fast food outlets already use paper bags for take out orders.plastic bags would not be replaced by paper bags on a one to one ratio since paper bags have a higher capacity.one study commissioned by the plastic bag industry estimates that for every plastic bags it would take paper bags to replace them.other studies find that paper bags may hold up to four times the volume of plastic bags.in light of anticipated education efforts,increased publicity partially resulting from the subject ordinance,and the public increased concern for pollution and water quality,at least some percentage of plastic bags are expected to be replaced by reusable bags rather than paper bags.based on the foregoing it appears that any increases in the total use of paper bags resulting from the proposed can on plastic bags in manhattan beach and even considering it as a cumulative increase from the bans in malibu and san francisco would be relatively small with a minimal or nonexistent increase in energy consumption pollutants generated from production and recycling.this is counterbalanced by a modest reduction in plastic refuse being generated in a coastal region.no further investigation is required.
even if the ordinance is a project,w here it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the environment,the activity is not subject to ceqa,tit,b,italics added.moreover,the ceqa guidelines provide for an exemption from ceqa when,as here,the project,is one undertaken to assure the maintenance restoration,enhancement,or protections of the environment,tit,see also.also,a project that qualifies for neither a statutory nor a categorical exemption may nonetheless be found exempt under what is sometimes called the commonsense exemption,which applies w here it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the environment.ceqa guidelines,subd.b.citation.muz
