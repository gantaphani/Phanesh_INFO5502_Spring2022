the history 
the issues in this appeal involve a vesting tentative subdivision map in.earlier events set the issues in context.
in may of,the san luis obispo county county approved pratt tentative subdivision map designated as tract,units i and ii.unit i was a parcel which could be divided into residential lots.unit ii was an parcel which could be divided into residential lots.
the county approval was in concept only.it was subject to a number of conditions,such as approval of a grading plan and erosion control plan.over the course of five years,the county gave pratt extensions of time to meet the conditions.
eventually,pratt filed a claim with the south central coast regional commission regional commission seeking a determination that it had a vested right to subdivide unit i into lots and to complete offsite improvements.pratt did not make a claim of a vested right for unit ii.the regional commission denied pratt claim to a vested right for a final map for unit i.but the regional commission found pratt did have a vested right to complete offsite improvements because of the substantial investment pratt had made for those improvements.
pratt petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandate to vacate the regional commission denial of the final map for unit i.the superior court granted pratt relief,and the regional commission appealed.the court of appeal held that approval of the tentative map did not give pratt a vested right because pratt had not satisfied the conditions necessary to fulfill the requirements of the map.south central coast regional com.charles pratt construction d.nevertheless,the court held that because pratt was allowed to complete the offsite improvements,the commission must grant a permit to complete the subdivision so long as the subdivision comports with the land density requirements of the coastal act.id.at.again,the court considered only the acres of unit id.at.
in,pratt submitted a new vesting tentative map to the county as tract.the new map contemplated subdivision of the acres of unit i into lots with a remainder parcel of acres,unit ii.a remainder parcel is one that is not proposed for development and is not counted as part of the subdivision.the county and the commission approved the application.a final map was recorded in.
the project 
in february of,for the first time,pratt applied for a new vesting tentative map,tract,that encompassed the acres of unit ii,plus an additional acres for open space.the new map proposed residential lots.the county approved tract on september.
a number of parties,including governmental agencies,appealed the county approval to the commission.the commission found the appeal presented substantial issues and set the matter for a de novo hearing,subd.b.
at the hearing,pratt claimed that unit ii was exempt from the coastal act.pratt claim of exemption was based on the theory that he had a vested right to complete the project or at least a vested right to complete the offsite improvements.in june of,the commission rejected pratt vested rights claim,and denied his application for a coastal development permit.
pratt filed the instant action for mandamus to require the commission to vacate its decision denying the development permit and for damages.pratt alleged,among other matters,that the vesting tentative map vested his rights subject only to laws and policies in existence at the time,and that the commission decision was based on policies.pratt also alleged that the commission has taken his property without compensation in that it deprived him of substantially all economically viable use of his property,has defeated his reasonable expectations,and has unreasonably delayed his right to make beneficial use of his property.
the trial court denied pratt petition for writ of mandate because it found pratt had no vested rights and that the commission decision denying the development permit is based on substantial evidence.the trial court granted judgment on the pleadings on pratt taking causes of action on the ground that the actions are not ripe for adjudication.
discussion 
pratt contends the commission lacked jurisdiction to consider the appeal.
pratt points out that the commission appellate jurisdiction is limited to determining whether the permit issued by the county is consistent with the local coastal plan lcp and whether the permit violates coastal access policies,subd.b.here,because no issues were raised concerning coastal access,jurisdiction is limited to determining whether the county permit is consistent with the lcp.
pratt argues that his filing of the vesting tentative map in gave him the right to develop his property subject only to laws and policies existing at the time.pratt claims,and the commission does not dispute,that the commission denial of his coastal development permit is based on policies enacted after he filed his vesting tentative map.
pratt vested rights argument relies on government code section,subdivision b.subdivision b provides in part when a local agency approves or conditionally approves a vesting tentative map,that approval shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances,policies,and standards described in section.subject to exceptions not relevant here,government code section,subdivision a requires a local agency to apply only those ordinances,policies and standards in effect on the date the local agency has determined the tentative map application is complete.
the flaw in pratt argument is government code section,subdivision b.that subdivision provides the rights conferred by this chapter shall relate only to the imposition by local agencies of conditions or requirements created and imposed by local ordinances.nothing in this chapter removes,diminishes,or affects the obligation of any subdivider to comply with the conditions and requirements of any state or federal laws,regulations,or policies and does not grant local agencies the option to disregard any state or federal laws,regulations,or policies.
in an attempt to avoid government code section,pratt claims that once the lcp is certified by the commission,it becomes a matter of local law.thus,pratt argues,the vesting provisions of government code section,subdivision b apply.
under the coastal act legislative scheme,however,the lcp and the development permits issued by local agencies pursuant to the coastal act are not solely a matter of local law,but embody state policy.the commission primary responsibility is the implementation of the coastal act.it is designated the state coastal zone planning and management agency for any and all purposes.local government prepares the lcp,subd.a.but the lcp must be submitted for the commission approval,subd.a.the commission may certify the lcp only if it meets the requirements of and is in conformity with the policies of the coastal act,subd.c.zoning and other actions to implement the lcp must also be submitted to the commission for approval.once the commission certifies the lcp and all implementing actions become effective,the commission authority over coastal development permits is delegated to the local government,subd.a.finally,the commission has appellate jurisdiction to determine whether the development permit issued by the local government is consistent with the lcp and coastal access policies,subd.b.
although local governments have the authority to issue coastal development permits,that authority is delegated by the commission.the commission has the ultimate authority to ensure that coastal development conforms to the policies embodied in the state coastal act.in fact,a fundamental purpose of the coastal act is to ensure that state policies prevail over the concerns of local government.see city of chula vista superior court d.commission exercises independent judgment in approving lcp because it is assumed statewide interests are not always well represented at the local level.the commission applies state law and policies to determine whether the development permit complies with the lcp.under government code section,subdivision b,such state laws and policies are not subject to the vesting provisions of government code section,subdivision b.the filing of pratt vesting tentative map did not deprive the commission of jurisdiction.
pratt reliance on yost thomas cal d,is misplaced.there,after the commission certified the lcp,the city approved a general plan amendment,a specific plan and rezoning affecting property in the coastal zone.opponents of the city acts sought to rescind them by referendum.the property owner claimed the city acts were not subject to referendum because they were administrative,and only legislative acts are subject to referendum.although the acts are ordinarily legislative,the owner argued that the requirement that the city comply with the lcp makes the city an agent of the state in enacting land use policies in the coastal zone.id.at.our supreme court rejected the argument,stating the coastal act leaves wide discretion to a local government not only to determine the contents of its land use plans,but to choose how to implement those plans.under such circumstances a city is acting legislatively and its actions are subject to the normal referendum procedure.id.at.
yost stands for nothing more than that a city actions in implementing the lcp retain their legislative nature for the purposes of referendum.that does not mean that once the lcp is certified,it becomes a matter of local law.the city actions in implementing the lcp,as well as any coastal development permit issued by the city,are still subject to commission review.yost did not involve the question at issue here.a case is not authority for issues it does not consider.contra costa water dist.properties th,d.
pratt contends the commission actions were arbitrary and capricious.we must uphold the commission findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence.dunn county of santa barbara th,d.we reverse if no reasonable person would have reached the same conclusion.id.at,d.
pratt argues the commission erred in treating the vast bulk of his property as an environmentally sensitive habitat area esha.it claims the lcp designates that portion of its property as a sensitive resource area sra.pratt claims that an esha is only one type of sra.it points out that there are other types of sra,but the esha is the most extreme in its impact on development.
the map on which pratt relies shows a large portion of its land designated as an sra.but the map also shows the area designated as a terrestrial habitat.a legend on the map lists terrestrial habitats as among sensitive resource areas that are also environmentally sensitive habitats.thus substantial evidence supports the commission treatment of a large portion of pratt parcel as an esha.
pratt reliance on security national guaranty,california coastal com.th,d,is misplaced.there the court determined that the commission has no jurisdiction on an appeal of a coastal development permit to designate a new esha that contradicted the terms of a certified lcp.here the commission did not seek to create a new esha designation on pratt land.it simply determined correctly that the lcp had designated much of pratt land to be an esha.
pratt argues the commission used the county generic provision for view protection rather than the lcp.pratt does not specify in what way the commission relied on the county generic rules instead of the lcp in assessing visual impacts.instead,pratt cites a number of ways in which it believes it has complied with the lcp.
pratt points out that the lcp requires clustering of homes in a way that leaves percent of the property undeveloped.but that does not mean that the proposed development on the remaining percent complies with all other policies of the lcp.
pratt points out that the lcp encourages placing development in slope created pockets to minimize visual impacts.pratt argues the county found its project satisfies that standard.but if the commission were bound by the county finding that the project complies with the lcp,there would be no reason to allow an appeal to the commission.it is simply no argument to say that the county found the project meets the lcp view preservation requirements.the commission recommended that development be limited to below the contour,as in an alternative project approved by the county planning commission.that would be the same elevation as homes in an existing adjacent site.
pratt claims its project will satisfy the requirement that building materials use native materials and textures.assuming that is true,it does not mean other visual impacts meet the requirements of the lcp.
pratt challenges the commission findings on the availability of water.pratt points out that it obtained a can and will serve letter from the southern california water company.pratt claims the commission simply ignored the letter.
but it is undisputed that pratt project lies outside the urban services line usl.the lcp allows development outside the usl only if it can be serviced by adequate private water and waste disposal systems.thus a commitment by a community offsite water company,such as southern california water company,is insufficient.
pratt points out that southern california water company plans to supply a private onsite reservoir.the county found this sufficient to satisfy the lcp private water requirement.but the legislature made the commission,not the county,the final word on the interpretation of the lcp.see,subd.b.indeed,under the county interpretation of the lcp,community offsite water service becomes private onsite water service simply because the water is temporarily stored in a reservoir.under the county interpretation,the lcp intent to give priority for services to land within the usl is easily defeated.the most reasonable interpretation of the lcp private water requirement is that it is limited to water developed from naturally occurring sources on the project site.pratt project does not meet that requirement.
pratt argues that the commission suffers from legal myopia in its determination that no development can occur on the pratt property until after all the infill lots within the usl have been built out.
the commission concluded the project is inconsistent with lcp provisions that prohibit subdivisions unless there are adequate public services to accommodate the new lots,after priority uses such as agriculture and infill of existing lots within the urban area have been accommodated.because there are significant unresolved issues with respect to the availability of such services,particularly water and sewage treatment,the project can not be found to be consistent with these lcp requirements and therefore must be denied.
pratt does not dispute the commission conclusion that the lcp mandates infill lots within the usl have priority on public services.instead,pratt asserts,without citation to the record,that the infill lots are under an indefinite,if not permanent,moratorium imposed by the regional water quality control board.assuming the infill lots are under a moratorium,pratt cites no authority that the moratorium frees the commission from enforcing the policy
