the plaintiff,appolo fuels,appeals the district court judgment upholding the decision of the interior board of land appeals that appolo violated federal regulations requiring the elimination of highwalls described in the record as rock walls at its surface site in kentucky.appolo maintains that it had initially backfilled the site properly and that the subsequent of highwalls does not violate the surface mining control and reclamation act.although the board and the federal courts have consistently held that such does violate the act,appolo claims that these cases misinterpret the act,fail to consider modern engineering data,and should be overturned.second,appolo claims that the federal action was barred by res judicata because the commonwealth of kentucky had already decided not to hold appolo responsible for any alleged violation.recognizing that the interior board of land appeals has consistently ruled that the principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel do not apply to the office of surface mining,appolo again urges this court to overturn a line of precedent.finally,appolo maintains that the office of surface mining lacked jurisdiction to order the reclamation action.however,as the district court found,the federal statute and regulations,case law,and legislative history indicate that although kentucky has primary responsibility to enforce mining regulations,the federal agency maintains oversight jurisdiction to enforce those regulations if the state fails to do so.for the reasons set out below,we find no error in the district court decision sustaining the ruling of the board,and we therefore affirm.
procedural and factual background 
in september,appolo fuels,received kentucky surface mining permit for a large contour surface mining operation of multiple seams of coal.under this permit,appolo was required to meet applicable performance standards of the surface mining control and reclamation act of.see a.among other things,the act provides that after surface mining,the operator must backfill,compact where advisable to insure stability or to prevent leaching of toxic materials,and grade in order to restore the approximate original contour of the land with all highwalls,spoil piles,and depressions eliminated b see also.ann.michie.a highwall is a face of exposed overburden material that overlies a coal deposit and coal in an open cut of a surface mining activity or for entry to underground mining activities.as the department of interior brief describes it,
a surface coal mining operator in a steep,mountainous area removes the part of the mountain lying above the coal seam known as overburden before he mines it.the process of removing the overburden to expose the coal creates a highwall,which is a clifflike area similar to the rock walls seen along interstate highways extending from the coal seam up.to eliminate the highwall after removing the coal,the operator backfills against the highwall until it is completely eliminated,returning the mined area to its approximate original contour.
appolo mining site under permit was,with two major highwalls of approximately feet each,for a total vertical height of feet.appolo conducted its mining and reclamation from august through september.the permit was divided into eight separately bonded increments,which were completed at different times throughout the mining period increment was completely backfilled,graded,and seeded by november,increments through by november,increment by june,and increments and by september.on march,the kentucky department for surface and mine reclamation and enforcement issued a phase i partial bond release on all eight increments,indicating that reclamation is complete except for revegetation.
eugene boston,chief engineer for appolo,testified that by the time of phase i bond release,all highwalls at the permit site had been eliminated.on march,however,inspector bruce cowan of the kentucky department for surface and mine reclamation and enforcement issued a notice to appolo.among other violations,backfilled areas of increments through had settled,exposing highwall up to eight feet high.the notice contained an order to appolo to eliminate all highwall.appolo contested the highwall violation,and on august,a kentucky administrative law judge noted appolo original compliance and recommended that no penalty be imposed,nor any remedial action ordered to eliminate the highwall,based on the following reasoning 
the parties do not dispute the constructions to be given the cited regulations except as applied to highwall created by settling.in reviewing kar backfilling and grading,it is clear that aoc approximate original contour must be established during reclamation.however,the regulation does not refer to maintaining aoc after it is established.furthermore,no regulation addresses compaction of backfilled material to prevent settling after aoc is initially established.from a fairness perspective,it would seem logical that the regulation would address commonly occurring settling if it was intended that aoc be established and maintained until a final release is obtained.
on september,the kentucky natural resources and environmental protection cabinet followed this recommendation,declining to assess a penalty or to order remedial action against appolo for the exposed highwall.
in the meantime,during an oversight inspection on august,earl dudley shumante,a reclamation specialist for the federal office of surface mining,noted the exposed highwall.shumante did not issue a violation against appolo at the time,however,because the state was still proceeding with the alleged violation.but after a subsequent bond release inspection on august,shumante issued kentucky a notice that the highwalls at appolo site had not been eliminated.on august,the state responded that although this violation had been noted by state inspector cowen in,appolo had successfully contested the violation on the grounds that the wall was eliminated as required which was documented by the phase i bond release and that the regulation does not require you to maintain aoc nor do they sic address settlement.the federal agency responded that the state failure to enforce the statutory or regulatory requirements was arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion,and that the state had not shown good cause for failing to take appropriate action.kentucky chose not to contest this finding.
after a inspection,shumante found exposed highwall ranging from to feet in height.on september,he issued a notice of violation to appolo for failure to achieve approximate original contour and eliminate highwalls,as required by kar and.subsequently,an administrative law judge found that appolo was in violation of its permit due to the continued existence of the highwalls and upheld the notice of violation.appolo appealed this decision to the interior board of land appeals,arguing that it had complied with the regulations by reclaiming the site free of highwalls in time for the phase i partial bond release and that nothing in the regulations required compaction such that the highwalls would remain eliminated indefinitely.the board rejected appolo contention,holding that 
nothing in the state or federal regulations supports this argument both authorities require complete elimination of highwalls.see.these rules govern backfilling and grading and require complete elimination of all highwalls by those means.in so doing,they implement surface mining control and reclamation act section b,b,which requires elimination of all highwalls.the highwalls at issue were discovered after reclamation of the site during inspections conducted before the sites were finally released from performance bonds insuring completion of required reclamation.contrary to the suggestion made by appolo,no loophole exists in the law that will allow an operator to escape compliance with the requirement imposed by state and federal regulations that highwalls be permanently eliminated.
