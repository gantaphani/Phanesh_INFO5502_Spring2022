factual and procedural background 
in,silverwood won a million judgment against alisal when the monterey superior court determined that alisal had intentionally breached an agreement to provide water service to a residential real estate development owned by silverwood 
in january,the united states filed suit against alisal in district court for violating the sdwa.a bench trial followed,and the district court granted summary judgment for the united states against alisal on nine separate causes of action encompassing hundreds of individual violations of the sdwa.the united states requested injunctive relief and civil penalties against alisal.
on april,while still considering the united states request for penalties against alisal,the district court appointed a receiver to manage alisal drinking water systems and oversee their possible sale.the court order barred enforcement of any action or lien against the receiver,or any property subject to the receivership,without first obtaining the court approval.the order,however,permitted alisal to retain control of alco water service,its largest subsidiary.
on june,silverwood filed a motion to intervene as of right in the litigation,contending its interests would be harmed in the event of a judicially ordered sale of alisal property.finding that silverwood intervention in the litigation would raise the specter of a complicated battle royal among rival creditors over alisal assets,the district court denied the motion.on appeal,silverwood maintains that its interest in collecting its judgment against alisal will be substantially impaired if it is not allowed to intervene.

legal standard 
to intervene as of right under.a,the applicant must claim an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and that the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant ability to protect that interest,unless the applicant interest is adequately represented by existing parties.
in particular,we require an applicant for intervention as of right to demonstrate that it has a significant protectable interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action the disposition of the action may,as a practical matter,impair or impede the applicant ability to protect its interest the application is timely and the existing parties may not adequately represent the applicant interest.united states city of los angeles,cir quoting donnelly,at internal quotation marks omitted.the party seeking to intervene bears the burden of showing that all the requirements for intervention have been met.id.
in determining whether intervention is appropriate,courts are guided primarily by practical and equitable considerations,and the requirements for intervention are broadly interpreted in favor of intervention.id.
significantly protectable interest relating to the subject of the action 
the district court held that silverwood did not assert a significantly protectable interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action.an applicant for intervention has a significantly protectable interest if the interest is protected by law and there is a relationship between the legally protected interest and the plaintiff claims.cal.edison lynch,modified on other grounds,cir quoting donnelly,at.
the interest test is not a rule.id.an applicant seeking to intervene need not show that the interest he asserts is one that is protected by statute under which litigation is brought.sierra club epa,cir.it is enough that the interest is protectable under any statute.id.
silverwood contends that it has a legally protected interest in alisal property,and that the decision of the district court to award damages to the united states for alisal violations of the sdwa may impair this interest.we have held that a,economic interest may be sufficient to support a right of intervention.arakaki cayetano,cir stating that native hawaiians had a sufficiently related interest to intervene in a lawsuit by taxpayers challenging the provision of benefits by the state of hawaii and its subdivisions to hawaiians.
to trigger a right to intervene,however,an economic interest must be concrete and related to the underlying subject matter of the action.see id.at cal.edison,at greene united states,cir.
silverwood asserts that although it lacks an interest relating to the environmental issues that are the subject of the liability phase of the action,the award of penalties in the remedies phase will affect its interests as a creditor.donnelly,at holding that an applicant may lack an interest in the liability phase of an action,but may still be entitled to intervene in the remedies phase.
however,regardless of the phase of litigation at which an interest arises,that interest must be related to the underlying subject matter of the litigation.california tahoe reg l planning agency,cir denying intervention as of right by an applicant with solely environmental interests in an action by a local water district against the united states concerning contracts between the parties respecting the delivery of the water 
here,the district court determined that silverwood sole interest in the present action is in the prospective collectability of a debt.this interest is several degrees removed from the overriding public health and environmental policies that are the backbone of this litigation.in venture capital rothbard,cir,we held that the impaired ability to collect judgments that may arise from future claims does not give rise to a right of intervention.the underlying reasoning in supports the conclusion that an allegedly impaired ability to collect judgments arising from past claims does not,on its own,support a right to intervention.to hold otherwise would create an open invitation for virtually any creditor of a defendant to intervene in a lawsuit where damages might be awarded.see public serv.comp.of new hampshire patch,cir holding that i t is settled beyond peradventure that an undifferentiated,generalized interest in the outcome of an ongoing action is too porous a foundation on which to premise intervention as of right glyn roy al boat mgmt,were this court to agree that efimov could intervene it would transform every civil suit before this court into a kind of exaggerated interpleader action where all potential creditors of all parties could assert their rights.
we,therefore,hold that silverwood was not entitled to intervene in this case because its interest in the prospective collectability of the debt secured by alisal property is not sufficiently related to the environmental enforcement action brought by the united states.
practical impairment 
the united states contends that even if silverwood met the other criteria for intervention,silverwood interests will not be practically impaired if its motion to intervene is not granted.in particular,the united states emphasizes that alco,alisal largest subsidiary,is not subject to the receivership,and the district court has set up a process for addressing claims that is adequate to protect silverwood interests.
it is true that the district court order does not preclude silverwood from seeking enforcement of its judgment lien and only requires that silverwood see
