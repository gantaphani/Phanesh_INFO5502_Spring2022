this is a cercla dispute about whether the federal government can make a company that discharged pollutants into the soil at the government direction and under its control during world war ii,in a war production plant,pay part of the cost of cleaning them up.
in,the japanese had conquered almost all of the world major natural areas in southeast asia.the germans had perfected a synthetic rubber substitute,which they were manufacturing as quickly as possible at several plants,including the farben plant in auschwitz that used jewish slaves american manufacture had been retarded by the depression,which reduced demand for rubber,and by a cooperative research agreement standard oil had made with farben in,during the weimar period as a result of the rubber shortage,tires had to be strictly rationed in the united states to preserve rubber for such myriad military uses as truck and aircraft tires and tubes,tank treads,equipment hoses and belts,footwear,medical supplies,life rafts,flotation equipment,barrage balloons,waterproof equipment,landing boats,gas masks and wire insulation.
the war was not going well in,until the battle of midway in june.germany had conquered continental europe,and japan had conquered much of the pacific.japan invaded and occupied part of the united states,the attu and kiska islands in alaska,from june of until the terrible battle of attu in may of,which took a commitment of men and cost casualties just in the landing force 
truman chaired hearings on why our country was unprepared to meet its critical need for rubber.president roosevelt established a committee of three,bernard baruch as chairman,along with the presidents of harvard and,to investigate and recommend such action as will produce the rubber necessary for our total war effort.the baruch committee reported that of our prewar sources of natural rubber had been lost to japan,and we had no substantial synthetic rubber industry of all critical and strategic materials,rubber is the one which presents the greatest threat to the safety of our nation and the success of the allied cause i f we fail to secure quickly a large new rubber supply our war effort and our domestic economy both will collapse.baruch told industry representatives that the rubber program would be their job,and that the bottleneck of the whole program would certainly be butadiene.
pursuant to this need for synthetic rubber,the government took steps to create,overnight,an industry to produce it.acting through a series of agencies referred to here as the rubber reserve,the government entered into agreements to finance and retain ownership of manufacturing facilities,which private companies would lease from the government and operate in exchange for management fees and royalties.the rubber reserve would pay all operating expenses.the companies would provide knowledge,management and use of their patents.the planning emphasized production of synthetic rubber.was made by attaching or polymerizing molecules of butadiene made from grain alcohol or petroleum and styrene made from ethylene and benzene.dow chemical was especially important to the war effort,as it was the only commercial producer of styrene,and therefore the only company able to provide practical experience with styrene production.
this case arises out of a facility in torrance,california,one of the most important synthetic rubber facilities at the time.constructed in,the facility contained two rubber copolymerization plants operated by goodyear and the rubber now uniroyal,the rubber companies,a butadiene plant operated by shell oil,and a styrene plant operated by dow chemical.
in the terminology then used,the torrance styrene plant was an agent plant not a contract plant.this meant that dow agreed to operate the styrene plant as the agent of the united states and at the expense and risk of the united states.dow built the facility,but the rubber reserve coordinated all phases of construction and made,approved,or ratified all significant operating decisions.the government owned the land the government owned the plant the government owned the raw materials the government owned the byproducts and wastes and the government owned the rubber.all activities at the site were subject to unrestricted control by the rubber reserve.dow,as the company with the most expertise managing the facility,was required by its contract with the government to carry out the orders,instructions,and specifications of rubber reserve.the government required monthly reports from dow that included the volume of residues dumped.under its contract with the government,dow was entitled to reimbursement for the expense of waste disposal,so it had no financial incentive to use a cheap but dirty method rather than a clean but expensive method.
the production of rubber created toxic waste.dow built evaporation ponds for aqueous wastes,such as aluminum chloride sludge,and dug pits for other wastes,such as sulfur and aluminum chloride tars.the government and dow knew they were polluting the soil and,on account of runoff,the water,but the government made a policy decision not to divert scarce resources from the war effort to stop the pollution.as one government consultant reported 
during this period,it was recognized that some raw and partially processed materials were lost into waste waters leaving the plants,and that some of these substances were causing a stream pollution problem.however,personnel could not be diverted from more pressing objectives to study the complex problems related to waste prevention or could construction materials be secured for such purposes.
dow subsequently developed better ways to dispose of the waste and closed the disposal pits in.
as part of the operating agreement entered into in,the government signed a broad hold harmless agreement,protecting dow chemical from any liability to anyone for any damages to property 
it is understood that in the performance of these contract s,dow shall in no event be liable for,but shall be held harmless by the united states against,any damage to or loss or destruction of property whether owned by the united states or others or any injury to or death of persons,in any manner,arising out of or in connection with the work hereunder 
after the war,in,the operating agreement,with this broad hold harmless clause,was renewed.the rubber reserve interpreted this hold harmless agreement in its manual to indemnify dow for any losses for which the united states would not reimburse dow for the cost of insurance coverage.during the war,the rubber reserve paid a claim for deaths and illnesses of numerous cows from pollution from the plant,based on its interpretation of its obligation to pay pollution damages under its contract with dow.the government participated in the decision about how to dispose of the sulfur tars,the byproduct of production,and,with unrestricted control over what was done,decided that disposal in pits was the best way to do it.government inspectors and consultants studied dow sulfur sludge pits at the torrance plant and approved them.
dow operated the facility until,when the rubber reserve sold the torrance facility to shell oil.shell made synthetic rubber there until,when it sold the site.eventually ownership passed to a developer,cadillac fairview california.most of the plants were demolished,and the site is currently occupied by commercial and industrial facilities.
in,years after the war ended and eight years after rubber production ended,congress enacted the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla under cercla,the environmental protection agency epa has broad authority to provide for remediation of sites contaminated by hazardous waste by conducting the cleanup itself or requiring liable parties to do so.regardless of who performs the cleanup,financial liability lies with the parties responsible for the contamination.cercla allows any responsible party to seek contribution from other responsible parties and allows the district court to equitably apportion cleanup costs among liable parties 
in,cadillac,the developer that bought the site at issue here,sued dow chemical,the united states,shell oil,and several rubber companies for damages to cover the expenses of investigating the soil pollution,and for an injunction and declaratory judgment.the united states crossclaimed against dow and the other companies.dow counterclaimed for indemnity and contribution under cercla.the united states settled with the mesne owners after it sold the property and before cadillac fairview bought it.
this complex litigation has come before us twice before.we held,in,that cadillac fairview did indeed state a claim upon which damages and injunctive relief could be granted,against an argument from the defendants that government action had to precede a private action,though we rejected the owner claim to injunctive relief 
in,the litigation came before us again.dow chemical crossclaimed for contribution against the rubber companies that made the rubber at the site and pumped contaminated styrene to dow for distilling to separate out the reusable chemicals from the waste that dow dumped into the pits.the rubber companies had won summary judgment on the ground that they could not be liable for having arranged for treatment under cercla because they neither owned nor controlled the contaminated government did.we held that the statute provided for arranger liability independently of ownership and that we had upheld liability against an arranger that did not control the process leading to the pollution,so a trier of fact could conclude that the rubber companies were arrangers,and remanded 
on remand,the district court granted partial summary judgment against dow on the theory that it was an operator that could be liable for contribution under cercla.it then tried the issue of whether the united states,as well as the rubber companies,was also liable under cercla and how remedial costs should be allocated under section f of cercla among dow,the rubber companies,and the united states.the trial resulted in findings of fact and conclusions of law,and a judgment that the united states should bear of the remediation expense.
the district court found that t he united states was informed and approved of dumping the toxic tars into the pits and that its engineers reviewed and approved the dumping of the aqueous wastes into the sludge ponds,having been fully informed during plant operations.the court found that because of the emergency conditions imposed by the war,the rubber reserve made,approved or ratified all significant operating decisions.it obtained monthly reports on residues dumped,directed and coordinated the operations of the plants,and set policy on questions of trade waste disposal.production and consequent waste was in quantities directed by the rubber reserve.the rubber reserve in some respects although not with regard to waste disposal ordered changes in production techniques over dow recommendations to the contrary.the executive vice president of the rubber reserve had visited the torrance plant and recommended disposing of wastes by getting them under the ground.the united states was the ultimate authority over plant operations and was aware of,and acquiesced or actively participated in,the decisions concerning waste systems,including operation of the pits and ponds.rubber reserve officials had full and extensive knowledge of the waste pits and ponds,because they repeatedly inspected them and hired technical experts to advise the government on them.the waste disposal methods were consistent with the state of knowledge and accepted industry practices of the time,and the only alternative at the time,burning the waste,was both impractical and more polluting.during and immediately after the war,when the pits were used for disposal,the government contract with dow prohibited dow even from withdrawing from its arrangement with the government.
the district court held that the united states was liable for contribution as an owner,operator and arranger,and the rubber companies,uniroyal and goodyear,as arrangers.although it did not enforce the government hold harmless agreement as such,out of concern that under the tucker act only the claims court had jurisdiction to do so,it took the contract into account as an equitable factor under the cercla requirement that it allocate response costs using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate.the court took into account that dow and the rubber companies acted pursuant to agreements that made them agents of the united states acting at the risk and account of the rubber reserve.their handling of the wastes as agents whose acts were subject to the control of and were ratified by the united states would,as a matter of agency law,also entitle them to indemnity.
the district court rejected the government argument that it should consider the benefits to the rubber companies of their participation,because the evidence was weak and such benefits as they might have obtained were overwhelmed by the benefits to the united states.and it rejected the government proposed conclusion suggesting an equal division of responsibility with dow.the district court concluded that equity requires that of the recoverable remedial costs incurred or to be incurred with respect to the del amo pit site by the united states,dow and the rubber companies should be paid by the united states.
the united states appeals this allocation.
under section of cercla,the district court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate.thus,cercla gives district courts discretion to decide what factors ought to be considered,as well as the duty to allocate costs according to those factors.we reverse only for an abuse of the discretion to select factors,or for clear error in the allocation according to those factors.in this case,after close scrutiny of the record,we conclude that there was no such abuse of discretion or clear error,and we affirm.
direct responsibility.
the government first argument is that because dow actually dug the pits after deciding where to dig them,transported the waste to the pits,deposited the waste in the pits,and maintained security at the pits,all without any direct federal orders or supervision telling dow to do so,it should have been held liable for at least some portion of the cleanup costs.
of course the government is correct that dow actually disposed of the waste and exercised some discretion in how it did so.its management expertise was the reason why the government used dow to operate the plant instead of operating it itself.but,as the district court found,the government owned the site,the pits,the plant,and all materials including the wastes,knew just what dow was doing,had unfettered control over it,approved of it,had an agency relationship with dow that would ordinarily require it to indemnify dow for what it did,and had made an express written promise to hold dow harmless for whatever it did.on these facts and allocation cases generally turn on their facts,there was no inequity in allocating of the costs to the government.indeed,where the government promises to hold a firm harmless for what it did,and then seeks to impose harm on the firm,highly unusual facts would be required to justify what would ordinarily be a gross inequity.in another war pollution case,united states shell oil we affirmed a allocation upon the united states for cleanup costs of wastes where private firms actually created the wastes and deposited them in the ground.to the extent that the case at bar is factually distinguishable,the distinctions make it an even more compelling one for such a allocation.
benefits to dow.
the government next argues that the district court abused its discretion by deciding to give no weight to the benefits to dow from its operation of the plant.the benefits to which the government points are reimbursement of expenses,management fees,and acquisition of knowledge and experience useful in subsequent endeavors,particularly dow expansion into the plastics industry.dow correctly points out that the evidence showed it shared its patents for amounts well below market rates,accepted a far below market management fee,and los
