the dispute in this case arises out of an alleged subsurface trespass resulting from the migration of waste water produced from oil production activities on land owned by aera energy,llc aera,and adjacent to land owned by starrh and starrh cotton growers starrh.the waste water,called produced water,is naturally occurring water which is pumped out of the deep ground in conjunction with the extracted oil.it is naturally high in salts and other minerals.the water is disposed of by discharge into unlined percolation ponds.the produced water percolates down and moves into the underlying aquifers.over time,the produced water has migrated into the aquifer underlying starrh property,reducing the quality of the subsurface water.
the appeal raises a number of unique legal issues.we hold that the trespass here is continuing in nature.in addition,we conclude that the evidence does not support the damage award,and that the jury was not adequately instructed on how to calculate restoration damages.at a minimum,the jury needs to be instructed that if it determines damages should be awarded it must decide how much it will cost to restore the groundwater under starrh property to its original state whether the restoration costs are reasonable in light of all the competing interests of which examples should be provided that it can deny damages if it concludes the restoration costs are unreasonable and that diminution in value may be a legitimate measure of damages where restoration costs are unreasonable.we also hold that profits can be benefits obtained within the meaning of civil code section,subdivision b,when linked to the trespass and conclude that starrh is entitled to attorney fees under code of civil procedure section.
procedural history 
starrh initiated this action in october,alleging causes of action for intentional and negligent trespass.aera answered and filed a for declaratory relief on a contract and irrevocable license,and for specific performance of the contract,all arising out of an alleged agreement between aera and starrh concerning a right to buy or use the pore space underlying starrh property.the was resolved against aera.there are no issues regarding the in this appeal.starrh complaint was tried to a jury in november.at the close of evidence,the court denied aera motion for nonsuit and granted starrh motion for a partial directed verdict,finding that the alleged trespass was a continuing trespass and not.the court also ruled that no evidence of aera profits would be presented to the jury.
the jury returned with its verdict in favor of starrh,awarding starrh in avoided cost damages those damages avoided as a result of the disposal of produced water.with respect to restoration cost damages those designed to return the property to its native condition initially,the jury verdict indicated that it was awarding zero dollars,but when the court polled the jury,this verdict lacked the required nine votes.the jury was asked to resume deliberations on the issue and ultimately returned with an award of.
starrh brought a motion for new trial challenging the jury award of restoration costs,which was denied.the court also denied starrh request for attorney fees pursuant to code of civil procedure section because it found the trespass was not to lands under cultivation.
aera appeals,claiming that the trespass is permanent as a matter of law and,as a result,is.starrh also appeals,claiming it was error to exclude evidence concerning aera profits.starrh also argues that the jury award of restoration costs is not supported by the evidence and that it was error to deny its request for attorney fees.
factual history 
starrh farms approximately acres next to the belridge oil field,located in western kern county and owned by aera.aera is an limited liability company headquartered in bakersfield and owned by exxonmobil and shell oil companies.in the process of producing oil,for every one barrel of oil extracted from the oil field,six to nine barrels of waste water is extracted.produced water is high in chlorides,boron,and other dissolved solids,and comes from far below the three natural aquifers,i,and ii,which lay beneath the surface lands.aera,like other oil producers,struggles with how to dispose of the large amount of produced water associated with extracting oil from the ground.not surprisingly,disposal is a critical component of the production process.aera practice is to pump the wastewater into two unlined ponds,lost hills and south,where a small percentage of the water is lost through evaporation and the remainder percolates into the underlying subsurface pore space.the water,once it reaches the subsurface pore space,collects or mounds,until natural hydrological and gravitational forces move it beyond the mound.approximately to billion barrels of produced water has been disposed of in the lost hills and south ponding basins adjacent to starrh property.although alternative methods for disposal are available,none are as economically advantageous to aera.
over the years as more and more produced water has moved into and out of the mound underlying the lost hills and south ponding basins,produced water has migrated into the pore space underlying starrh property.once there,the produced water mixes with the native groundwater.as more water is put into the mound,more water will move toward starrh property.aera continues to put water into the ponding basins on a daily basis.
although the native groundwater in these aquifers is naturally salty and of questionable usability,there is no real dispute that the water under starrh property has been further degraded as a result of the migrating produced water,raising the native levels of salt,boron,and total dissolved solids in the water.as more water from the mound migrates into the aquifers,its impact on the native groundwater increases.
the parties agree that the native groundwater is not useable for drinking or other municipal purposes and that it is too salty to use for irrigation of most agricultural crops.the parties dispute,however,whether the native water is usable for some crops and whether it has any economic value.the area is a prime agriculture area and,in california,water is an extremely precious commodity.historically,irrigation in the area has been by use of water imported from the california aqueduct project or other sources.
starrh has been farming in the area since,growing cotton,almonds,pistachios,and alfalfa.before the lawsuit was initiated,starrh had not used the underground aquifers as a source of irrigation water,but used aqueduct water or other purchased water.when starrh property was appraised in,the appraiser reported that the groundwater under starrh property was unsuitable for irrigation because of a high level of salts and boron.the appraiser conclusion was not surprising to starrh because it was consistent with starrh understanding and experience the water was too salty for irrigation.
starrh agricultural expert confirmed that the native groundwater has historically not been considered usable for irrigation.alfalfa and almonds are crops,and the native water is not suitable to grow them.pistachios and cotton are more salt tolerant.
after the lawsuit was filed,starrh began an experiment.it drilled several wells on the property and used a blend of aqueduct water and well water extracted from aquifer to irrigate approximately acres of cotton.starrh is the only area farmer attempting to use groundwater for irrigation.using the salty native groundwater for irrigation requires careful farming practices,including leaching and substantial drainage in order to prevent accumulation of the native salts and boron in the plant root zone.aera agricultural expert testified that only with careful farming practices could the native water be used,and,in any event,only for cotton.he opined that none of the wells on starrh property could be used for irrigation over the long term because of the accumulation of salts in the soil.aera expert also testified that blending was not economically viable.
starrh expert valued the underlying groundwater at million if usable for the irrigation of cotton,almonds,and pistachios.he admitted the water had no dollar value if not usable for irrigation,but believed starrh experiment to be successful.aera expert valued the water at to,if usable for irrigation,but said it was worth nothing if not usable for this purpose.
starrh presented evidence of a restoration plan for returning the underlying groundwater to its native condition.according to starrh expert,the plan consists of pumping groundwater out of the subsurface aquifers by using a number of extraction wells to.it would then be pumped into a series of lined evaporative ponds.the ponds would cover approximately acres each and,together,acres of starrh acres of land.the restoration effort,while projected to last years,could require up to years to complete.all farming on the land would be suspended during this period of time.when done,there would be very little water left in aquifers i and,although fisher said this was a temporary condition and that with time water would reappear.there would still be dissolved solids in the water at native values,rendering the water unusable for all but the most crops.the proposal was to pump most of it into lined ponding basins covering a total of acres.the project would cost and last for decades.according to the expert,the quality of the water would ultimately return to its native condition and no better.
discussion 
permanent versus continuing trespass 
we begin with certain basic principles.causing subsurface migration of oil field wastewater into a mineral estate groundwater pore space of another without that landowner consent is a trespass under california law.cassinos union oil th,d.further,a trespass may be continuing or permanent.beck development southern pacific transportation th,d beck.a permanent trespass is an intrusion on property under circumstances that indicate an intention that the trespass shall be permanent.in these cases,the law considers the wrong to be completed at the time of entry and allows recovery of damages for past,present,and future harm in a single action,generally the diminution in the property value.the cause of action accrues and the statute of limitations begins to run at the time of entry.kafka bozio cal.the statute of limitations for trespass to property is three years.code civ.
in contrast,a continuing trespass is an intrusion under circumstances that indicate the trespass may be discontinued or abated.in these circumstances,damages are assessed for present and past damages only prospective damages are not awarded because the trespass may be discontinued or abated at some time,ending the harm.beck,supra,th at,d.pursuant to civil code section,damages allowed for continuing trespass include the value of the use of the property,reasonable cost of repair or restoration to the property original condition,and the costs of recovering possession.continuing trespasses are essentially a series of successive injuries,and the statute of limitations begins anew with each injury.in order to recover for all harm inflicted by a continuing trespass,the plaintiff is required to bring periodic successive actions.baker airport authority cal d,baker.as aptly stated in beck 
these distinctions can create particular problems for the parties.for example,if the defendant is willing and able to abate the trespass it may be unfair to award prospective damages on the presumption that the trespass will continue.on the other hand,if it appears improbable that the trespass can or will be abated,or the plaintiff is willing that the trespass continue provided compensation is paid for past and prospective injuries,then it may be unreasonable to leave the plaintiff to the troublesome remedy of successive actions.and a too rigid distinction between permanent and continuing trespass may constitute a trap for the unwary plaintiff who guesses wrong.for these reasons it is held that in doubtful cases the plaintiff has an election to treat a trespass as permanent or continuing.citations.beck,supra,th at,d.
the distinction between continuing and permanent trespass comes up when considering two key questions in these types of cases what is the correct measure of damages,and is the action 
the parties have staked out predictable positions.starrh elected to treat the trespass here as a continuing trespass.aera claims the trespass was permanent and barred by the statute of limitations.there is no dispute that the produced water began migrating to the aquifers under starrh property more than three years from the initiation of the lawsuit.the trial court granted starrh motion for directed verdict,finding that the trespass was a continuing trespass as a matter of law,defeating aera defense.in making its ruling,the court said 
i think this is a question of law for the court w hen we weigh all this,i think this is a continuing trespass.i think it continuing because when we weigh all the evidence,you ca get away from the fact that aera continues to put produced water into the ponds and that water continues to go onto starrh property.
the jury was instructed to consider whether a trespass occurred and was directed to calculate any damages within the period using the measure provided in civil code section for continuing wrongful occupation of land.the jury instruction read as follows 
if you find that the defendant has committed a trespass on the plaintiffs property,the plaintiffs damages include one,the reasonable value of the expenses that the defendants saved or avoided by reason of that wrongful occupation from october,through the date of the verdict and two,the reasonable costs of restoration of the property to its condition as of october.
in doing so,the court characterized the trespass as continuing for both the defense and the calculation of damages.
over the years a number of tests have developed to determine the true nature of a trespass.a good review of the relevant case law and tests that have developed is presented in beck and mangini cal th,d,mangini.these two cases,and the authorities they rely on,establish that the key question is whether the trespass or nuisance can be discontinued or abated and there are a number of tests used to answer this question.a respected legal treatise summarizes the various tests as follows 
w hether the offense activity is currently continuing,which indicates that the nuisance is continuing,the impact of the condition will vary over time,indicating a continuing nuisance,or the nuisance can be abated at any time,in a reasonable manner and for reasonable cost,and is feasible by comparison of the benefits and detriments to be gained by abatement.miller starr,cal.real estate ed.
as beck observes,in pollution cases,particularly where the issue is whether the claim is,there are peculiar problems in applying the dichotomy because the harmful effects of the pollution may continue beyond the termination of the activity that gave rise to the harm.beck,supra,th at,d.
the problem here arises in how to apply these principles.aera argues that this case is controlled by the decision in mangini.although mangini is a nuisance case,generally the principles governing the permanent or continuing nature of a trespass or nuisance are the same and the cases discuss the two causes of action without distinction.beck,supra,th at,d,and authorities cited therein.
mangini involved the dumping of toxic materials onto land by a prior owner.the prior owner attempted to defend the action by asserting that the statute of limitations barred the action because it was brought more than three years after the dumping had stopped.the current owner plaintiff sought to avoid the defense by arguing that,because the toxic materials continued to migrate onto the plaintiff land causing continuous damage,the nuisance was continuing.in deciding the issue,the court said the key to whether a trespass is permanent and,at least in mangini,or continuing is whether the trespass can be discontinued or abated at a reasonable cost.mangini,supra,cal th at,d.the court said there must be evidence that the trespass is reasonably abatable even if the harm caused by the trespass continues to interfere with the possessory interest of the property owner.id.at,d.technical feasibility does not necessarily prove abatability.it must be possible to clean up the toxic materials without unreasonable hardship or expense.id.at,d.in mangini,since no evidence was presented concerning the cost of cleaning up the toxic materials that were dumped on the plaintiff property,the court concluded that the plaintiff had failed to prove a continuing nuisance or trespass and the action was.ibid.
mangini stated that its decision was limited to cases where a property owner seeks to maintain a nuisance action after the statute of limitation has expired on the theory that the nuisance is continuing in nature.it addressed the narrow question of whether the property owner may pursue a nuisance action without presenting evidence that the injury is one capable of reasonably being abated.mangini,supra,cal th at,d.significantly,in mangini,the harmful activity had stopped long ago and there was no evidence the impact of the toxic materials would vary over time.therefore,only the last of the available tests for characterizing the nuisance as continuing was available to defeat the defense.since the plaintiff failed to offer any evidence on the reasonableness of possible abatement,it could not avoid the statute of limitations by recharacterizing the nuisance as continuing on the ground that it could be abated at any time.id.at,d.
aera contends that the decision in mangini controls because it is the latest pronouncement by the california supreme court.in doing so,aera overlooks the fact that,unlike in mangini,the first two tests identified in miller offensive activity continues and the impact of the subsurface migration will worsen as time available here.miller starr,supra.applying these two tests points toward a conclusion that aera ponding practices establish a continuing trespass onto starrh property.ibid.
our conclusion is consistent with mangini,which did not change existing law.instead,mangini applied principles to a somewhat unique factual situation and concluded that the only available not been proven.
in spar pacific bell d,d,the offensive action was completed long before the lawsuit was initiated telephone lines,buried years prior to the lawsuit.the plaintiff claimed these items were a continuing trespass because they remained on the property and sought to defeat the claim raised by the defense.we do not have the same situation here.see also demann d.both spar and involve permanent structures such as pipelines,buildings,walls and fences,long considered permanent nuisances for purposes of the statute of limitations.demann,supra,at.aera attempts to characterize the ponds as permanent structures claiming they are massive,bermed basins that were built in the and and cover hundreds of acres.aera comparison misses the is not the pond structure that constitutes a trespass.instead,it is the produced water that permeates through the pond that is a trespass.
this case is more closely aligned with baker,supra,cal d at page,cited with approval in mangini.the situation in baker involved complaints regarding noise and vibration from a nearby airport.as is the case here,the nuisance began long before the lawsuit was filed and well after the statute of limitations had run on the original nuisance.the defendant sought to have the nuisance classified as permanent in order to assert the statute of limitations as a complete bar to the action,even though it was undisputed that the flights continued on a daily basis.the defendant argued that,because the plaintiff could not interfere with federally controlled air traffic routes,the nuisance was not reasonably abatable and had to be classified as permanent.the court determined there were other possibilities for abatement and stated that w here some means of abatement exists,there is little or no incentive to make remedial efforts once the nuisance is classified as permanent.such a result is at odds with tort law philosophy of encouraging innovation and repair to decrease future harm.baker,supra,at,italics added.although the airport could not reasonably be shut down,it was possible to abate in some manner the noise and vibration caused by the flights over the plaintiff home and,under baker,those options had to be explored.baker remains good law and it controls here.
in this case,the question turns on whether aera will continue to allow produced water to enter the underlying aquifers.as long as this practice is used,the water table below starrh property will continue to be degraded as more and more produced water mixes with the native groundwater.starrh expert testified that dumping more produced water into the unlined ponds will have an impact on the native groundwater under starrh property.this harm can be abated by some means.for example,the ponding practice can be reduced or discontinued altogether,resulting in a lessening of the impact on the underlying aquifers.see beatty washington metropolitan area transit authority,nuisance is abatable if it can be diminished.
we reject aera contention that wilshire westwood associates atlantic richfield th,d governs this case.in wilshire,liability arose from a leaking gasoline tank under a gas station.although the gas station remained,there was nothing to suggest that the leakage continued.id.at,d.we are also not persuaded by aera contention that,even if it stopped its ponding practice,the water would continue to migrate,relegating the trespass to permanent status because the migration can not be stopped.although stopping the ponding practice may not eliminate the migration,failing to stop the practice most assuredly compounds the problem.see also baugh garl th,d where trespass is continuing,but not necessarily permanent,statute does not bar action until three years after last act of trespass.
in our view,this case presents a classic continuing trespass situation.our conclusion is consistent with mangini,which warned that courts should be cautious not to enlarge the category of permanent nuisance beyond those structures or conditions that truly are permanent.it stressed that,where some means of abatement exist,classifying the trespass or nuisance as permanent will discourage remedial efforts.mangini,supra,cal th at,d.this is especially important as courts attempt to balance the evolving tension between economic interests and environmental protection.classifying this case as a permanent trespass for purposes of the statute of limitations would bar this action completely.it would give aera the ability to continue environmentally questionable practices with no economic incentive to employ more environmentally protective practices.
it is also important to recall that this is an appeal from a judgment based upon a partially directed verdict.generally,whether a trespass is continuing or permanent is a question of fact properly submitted to the jury.shamsian atlantic richfield th,d.a trial court may remove the issue of fact from the jury by directed verdict only if there is no evidence tending to prove the case of the party opposing the motion.estate of fossa d.since the impact,if any,of the procedural status of this case was not addressed at trial,we issued supplemental briefing orders asking aera to provide any evidentiary support for a finding that its ponding of produced water could not be discontinued.
aera provided us with no record citations to support a factual conclusion different from that reached by the trial court,that the trespassing was continuing.instead,it repeated its argument that the trespass was permanent because abatement was not reasonably possible.ironically,in its response to our briefing letter,aera acknowledged it was pursuing a plan to create ponding basins in another ponds.the bottom line is that aera cites no trial evidence to support a finding that it was unable to discontinue its ponding practice.to the contrary,aera officials testified they would continue the ponding practices for economic reasons as long as they were allowed to do so,but admitted other methods of disposal were available at a higher cost.in a nutshell,the ponding practices continue because aera has chosen to keep using them.the trial court properly granted the motion for directed verdict,eliminating aera claim.
measure of damages 
aera contends that,even if we conclude the trespass is continuing for purposes of the period,mangini allows for a different characterization to be attached to the trespass for purposes of measuring damages,and that in this case the trespass is permanent for this purpose.in doing so,aera argues that starrh damages should be limited to only the diminution of value caused by aera trespass.aera asserts this is the proper measure of damages because mangini holds that,in order to recover using a measure of damages,a plaintiff must show that the trespass is reasonably abatable.mangini left open the question of whether a trespass may be continuing for purposes of evaluating a defense but permanent when determining the correct measure of damages.mangini,supra,cal th at,d.
as we have already indicated,the characterization of a trespass as either permanent or continuing is based on whether the trespass will actually continue into the future or is likely to be discontinued at some later date.this is a question of fact subject to proof at trial.mangini d.if the trespass will definitely continue into the future,because it can not be abated,then damages can be fully ascertained and full recovery is available to the plaintiff for all harm suffered.if it can not be determined whether the harm will continue,because it is possible to terminate the trespass,the law will not presume that the trespass actually will be discontinued.baker,supra,cal d at.under these circumstances,future damages can not be determined and will not be awarded.kafka bozio,supra,cal.at.in fact,the very nature of this characterization is related to the damages suffered.nestle city of santa monica cal d,whether trespass is continuing or permanent depends on type of harm suffered.although useful for purposes of determining the proper statute of limitations,the question of whether a trespass is continuing or permanent is ultimately a damages question.the nature of a trespass does not change simply to accommodate a legal theory.
the trial court found aera trespass to be continuing because aera persists in disposing of produced water into its unlined ponding basins.as a result,produced water continues to migrate onto starrh property and degrade the quality of its underlying aquifers.the evidence shows that it is unknown how long the trespass will continue because,as we have explained,aera may stop or alter its disposal practices at any time.for this reason,it is impossible to ascertain the full extent of future damages to starrh underlying aquifers.as a result,in this case,a permanent measure of damages,which includes future harm,is not an appropriate choice.see baker,supra,cal d at,prospective damages not permitted in continuing trespass cases miller starr,supra.
in any trespass case,the proper measure of damages is the one that will fully compensate the plaintiff for damages that have occurred or can with certainty be expected to occur.see basin oil tool d,there are many ways to measure damages for wrongful occupation of property and courts must be flexible and choose measure allowing full recovery as appropriate to circumstances cassinos union oil,supra,th at,d each case must be determined on its facts applying rule best suited to determine amount of loss.further,damages may cover the loss or injury sustained and no more.estate of de laveaga cal d.t he general rule is that if the cost of repairing the injury and restoring the premises to their original condition amounts to less than the diminution in value of the property,such cost is the proper measure of damages and if the cost of restoration will exceed such diminution in value,then the diminution in value of the property is the proper measure.citations.mozzetti city of brisbane d,italics omitted see also harrisonville dickey clay.
in california,when the trespass involves a wrongful occupation of land,civil code section,subdivision a,sets out the proper measure of damages for a subsurface trespass.see cassinos union oil,supra,th at,d.the statute reads 
a the detriment caused by the wrongful occupation of real property is deemed to include the value of the use of the property for the time of that wrongful occupation,the reasonable cost of repair or restoration of the property to its original condition,and the costs,if any,of recovering the possession.italics added.
in this context,abatement is simply another word for restoration.in order to abate or restore the subsurface trespass,the contamination must be cleaned up.starrh may recover the costs of restoration as a statutory measure of damages only if cleaning up the contamination is possible or economically practical.miller starr,supra.we conclude that when the cost of abatement is not reasonable,these costs can not be recovered under either civil code section or the requirement expressed in mangini.as a result,the trial court correctly determined that the trespass was in calculating the statute of limitations and determining the measure of damages.however,our analysis does not end here.
sufficiency of the instructions 
in its,starrh contends that the jury award of million for restoration costs is not supported by the verdict.it argues there is no evidence to support a finding that this amount would restore starrh property to its original condition.we agree that there is no record evidence to support the jury million award for restoration costs.during oral argument,aera counsel suggested that the jury reached this number by rejecting some of the underlying assumptions upon which the capital value of the water assigned by the experts rested.however,this is not the appropriate measure of damages the jury was asked to determine the reasonable cost of restoration,not the value of the land.in any event,counsel was unable to cite any particular assumption that if rejected by the jury would result in the million figure.unlike general damages,restoration cost is a statutorily authorized economic damage which must rest on specific evidence or be reached by a mathematical manipulation of the evidence presented.see,b economic damages are those that are objectively verifiable monetary losses,including loss of use of property and costs of repair or replacement,b noneconomic damages subjective,nonmonetary losses including,but not limited to,pain,suffering,inconvenience,see also beeman burling d.general damages are those necessarily resulting from act complained of and are implied by law to have accrued to plaintiff special damages are damages which depend on circumstances peculiar to infliction of each respective injury and can be documented.aera could not identify any evidence to support the award,and we have found none in our review of the record.since there is no evidentiary support for the verdict,this case must be remanded for a new trial on the issue of damages.
although neither party directly contests the sufficiency of the instructions,we conclude the instructions given were inadequate and,in the interest of judicial economy,we provide some guidance to the trial court and the parties in the event of a retrial.the trial court must instruct the jury on how to determine whether the statutory requirement that any restoration costs be reasonable was met.it must also advise the jury what to do if the jury concludes the evidence shows the proposed restoration project to be unreasonable.as we have already stated in our discussion of the proper measure of damages,there are many ways to measure damages and the ultimate goal is to restore the plaintiff to its former position.basin oil tool,supra,d at,cassinos union oil,supra,th at,d.
we repeat,civil code section requires that restoration costs be reasonable.in addition,general principles of damages in trespass cases require that the damages bear a reasonable relationship to the harm caused by the trespass.mangini explains that whether abatement costs are reasonable requires an evaluation of a number of fundamental considerations,including the expense and time required to perform the abatement,along with other legitimate competing interests.mangini,supra,cal th at,d,see also beck,supra,th at,d reasonableness includes consideration of monetary expense,burden on public,and costs of remediation versus value of land.
in order to balance these competing interests,a jury must be told that once it resolves the factual issue of how much it might cost to restore the groundwater under starrh property to its original state resolving the evidence presented by the experts,it must then determine whether the restoration costs are reasonable in light of all the competing interests.without proper instruction,a jury will have a very difficult time knowing how to go about its evaluation of damages.this is particularly true in light of the fact that the proposed restoration project arguably bears little relationship to the current use and value of the land,coupled with the historic understanding of the availability of the water for irrigation and other uses.
the evidence of unreasonableness in this case is sufficiently strong that we are tempted to conclude that the project is unreasonable as a matter of law.fisher explained that his restoration plan was designed to contain the migration of the produced water and to restore the groundwater to useful status,although he admitted that he meant the project would return the groundwater to its native condition.fisher estimated that the cost of this ambitious project would cost more than billion in today dollars and would be the largest restoration project in the world to date.in contrast,the evidence of the groundwater value ranged from a capital value of million starrh expert to a capital value of to aera expert.there was evidence that the native groundwater could not be used for drinking or irrigation of agricultural crops,with the exception of cotton and other plants.there was also evidence that starrh plan to use a blend of native groundwater and aqueduct water for irrigation was not cost effective.further,aera expert testified that if starrh stopped growing cotton,the groundwater had no economic value.
we resist the temptation to decide the proposed project is unreasonable as a matter of law,acknowledging that reasonableness is a question of fact to be decided by a properly instructed determination that has not yet been done.a properly instructed jury is in the best position to decide the question of reasonableness and will be able to do so assuming it is told to apply the appropriate legal principles.for example,the jury needs to be advised that it can deny damages if it concludes the restoration costs are unreasonable.it should be instructed that diminution in value may be a legitimate measure of damages where restoration costs are unreasonable.see mozzetti city of brisbane,supra,d at.the failure to provide these instructions resulted in predictable confusion as evidenced by the jury attempt to reach a verdict on restoration costs.eight members initially found zero damages.having failed to reach the required nine votes,the jury was directed to continue deliberations and only then returned with an award of amount which is not supported by any logical interpretation of the evidence.in sum,on remand,the jury needs to know how to determine whether the restoration plan is reasonable and what to do if it determines the plan is unreasonable.
ii.other contentions of error 
since we are reversing the damages award,we will address other issues likely to arise on remand.these include the trial court conclusion that the benefits obtained measure of damages pursuant to civil code section is restricted to costs saved or avoided by the wrongful trespass.we will also consider whether starrh is entitled to attorney fees pursuant to code of civil procedure section.
definition of benefits obtained 
the trial court ruled that benefits obtained as used in civil code section are costs equal to those avoided by the more.it rejected starrh position that the phrase benefits obtained should be read to also include aera profits.as a result of this decision,evidence of aera profits was excluded and the jury was told that the measure of damages for the trespass included the reasonable value of the expenses that the defendants saved or avoided by reason of the wrongful occupation.
generally,we review for an abuse of discretion a trial court decisions admitting or excluding evidence.city of ripon sweetin th,d.however,when the trial court decision is based on a conclusion of law,we apply the de novo standard of review.lockheed litigation cases th,d penner county of santa barbara th,d.the trial court decision in this case rests on its interpretation of civil code section,subdivision b.questions concerning interpretations of statutes are questions of law which we review de novo.day collingwood th,d.

it was amended in to address a specific problem addressing how damages were awarded for the wrongful occupation of land.before the amendment,damages were limited in wrongful occupation cases to the value of the use of the the fair rental value.as a result,some polluters would dump their waste on unoccupied land of little value,desert land in order to avoid expensive toxic waste disposal fees.if the owner of the property sought redress,the polluter faced relatively low potential damage awards because the land was essentially worthless.com.on judiciary,com.on assem.bill reg.sess.for,hearing rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july.

only one case has interpreted civil code section,subdivision b,as amended.in watson land shell oil th,d watson the issue was whether the phrase benefits obtained included the avoidance of restoration costs.the court answered no and commented that restoration costs are included in another provision of the statute,subd.a.by doing so,watson determined that including avoided restoration costs in code of civil procedure,section,subdivision b would render superfluous the reasonable cost of repair or restoration language in subdivision a.watson,supra,at,d.watson held that the avoidance of restoration costs is not a benefit recoverable under the statute.its analysis,however,acknowledges that a direct financial or business advantage is a benefit under the statutory language.watson observed that the history of the statute demonstrates that the legislature intended to eliminate financial incentives for trespass by eradicating the benefit associated with the wrongful use of another land.id.at,d.we agree and conclude that the phrase benefits obtained has a wider scope than that given to it by the trial court there is a direct link between the financial benefit and the trespass.
