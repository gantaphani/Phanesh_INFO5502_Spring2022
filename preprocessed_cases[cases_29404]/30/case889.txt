wildwest institute wildwest challenges the united states forest service approval of nine timber sale and restoration projects in montana kootenai national forest knf,claiming violations of the national forest management act nfma,the national environmental policy act nepa,and forest service regulations.wildwest sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent environmental injury.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the forest service.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
facts and prior proceedings 
the knf covers over million acres in northwest montana.the forest service adopted the kootenai national forest plan forest plan pursuant to nfma in.it is intended to guide all natural resource management activities and establishes management standards for the forest.the forest plan establishes management areas ma within the knf,including one related to old growth timber ma.
to implement the forest plan,the forest service adopts plans and projects for specific areas of the knf.over the course of and,the forest service adopted the nine projects that are challenged here the bristow area restoration project,fortine project,west troy project,pipestone timber sale and restoration project,lower big creek project,south mcswede timber sale and restoration project,alder creek project,cow creek project,and mcsutten project.for each project,the forest service conducted an extensive environmental analysis,including a draft and final environmental impact statement deis and feis or an environmental assessment.
wildwest filed this action challenging the nine projects on numerous grounds.the district court denied wildwest motion for a preliminary injunction.the parties filed for summary judgment,and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the forest service.wildwest inst.castaneda,d.the district court noted that,on many of its claims,wildwest had failed to establish a connection between the challenged management practices and the lawfulness of the logging projects.id.at.regarding those claims properly raised,the district court concluded the forest service had complied with the relevant procedural and substantive legal requirements.id.at.wildwest timely appealed.

iii.background 
governing provisions 
the national forest management act,et,provides both procedural and substantive requirements.procedurally,it requires the forest service to develop and maintain forest resource management plans.id.a.after a forest plan is developed,all subsequent agency action,including plans like the nine projects challenged here,must comply with nfma and the governing forest plan.id.i see lands council ii,at.
substantively,nfma requires that forest plans provide for diversity of plant and animal communities based on the suitability and capability of the specific land area.g b.forest plans must also ensure that timber will be harvested only where soil,slope or other watershed conditions will not be irreversibly damaged,and provide protection for streams from detrimental deposits of sediment where harvests are likely to seriously and adversely affect water conditions or fish habitat.id.g e.
the national environmental policy act,et,contains additional procedural requirements.its purposes are to ensure the will have detailed information on environmental impacts and to provide that information to the public.inland empire pub.lands council forest,cir.the forest service must prepare an eis,which identifies environmental effects and alternative courses of action,when undertaking any management project.c.in contrast to nfma,nepa exists to ensure a process,not to mandate particular results.neighbors of cuddy mountain alexander,cir.the agency must only take a hard look at its proposed action.id.at.
two forest service regulations also apply here.the rule requires the forest service to identify and monitor management indicator species mis and directs that fish and wildlife habitat shall be managed to maintain viable populations of existing native and desired vertebrate species.the knf forest plan incorporated this and several other provisions of the rule.
the rule was partially superceded in the rule.the rule substantive provisions did not apply to decisions made between and.the transition portions of the rule,which did apply during this time,required the responsible officials to consider the best available science when implementing existing land and resource management plans.a.the requirements of the superceded rule apply only to the extent they were incorporated into the forest plan see generally citizens for better forestry dep t of,cir discussing in detail the provisions of the and rules.
b.the forest plan 
the forest plan establishes goals,including provid ing a sustained yield of timber volume responsive to national and regional needs and construct ing the minimum number of roads necessary to permit the efficient removal of timber and mineral resources.with respect to management,the goals also include maintain ing diverse age classes of vegetation for viable populations of all existing native,vertebrate,wildlife species,and manag ing for sufficient snags and snag replacement trees to maintain viable populations of species.with respect to fisheries and aquatic habitat,the forest plan goals include maintain ing or enhanc ing fisheries habitat.the forest plan also designates eight mis that are monitored as a barometer of change for a particular habitat.the pileated woodpecker is the mis for dependent species.
under the forest plan,the knf is managed for two kinds of old growth undesignated and designated.undesignated old growth consists of stands in nondevelopmental areas such as wilderness and primitive recreation areas.designated old growth,on the other hand,consists of existing old growth and some mature stands in areas that the forest service actively manages.each category of old and into effective old growth and replacement old growth.effective old growth presently meets the needs of species replacement old growth does not presently meet those needs,but may do so in the future as trees grow and the habitat ages.
old growth areas that have been designated are assigned for management purposes to ma,which describes substantive and procedural guidelines for the care of old growth.the forest plan requires that a minimum of percent of the forest acreage below feet elevation will provide habitat at any given time in a combination of undesignated and designated old growth in well distributed and sufficiently large stands.the ma guidelines reiterate this ten percent goal.
connection to projects 
as a preliminary matter,we note that we are precluded from reviewing a number of wildwest allegations because,as the district court properly found,they are not tied to challenges.management practices and monitoring efforts,or lack thereof,are generally not amenable to suit under the apa because they do not constitute final agency actions.neighbors of cuddy mountain,at citing lujan wildlife fed n,d ecology,at see.challenges to management practices or claims that the forest plan does not comply with nfma must be made in the context of actions.ohio forestry ass n,sierra club,d.the plaintiff must allege a specific connection between the challenged action and the general practice.id.
the district court noted that t o the extent wildwest attempts to challenge management practices on the coattails of the nine challenged logging projects,its suit is generally permitted.wildwest,d at.however,the court concluded the suit failed to establish connections between the general management practices and the lawfulness of the logging projects.many of wildwest myriad arguments and allegations on appeal suffer the same defect.we address only those claims that wildwest has plausibly connected to a action.
iv.nfma claims 
best available science 
wildwest first claim relates to the rule best available science requirement.this claim argues the best available science undermines the assumption that ten percent forest levels are sufficient to ensure species viability.wildwest claims that a study the lesica study demonstrated that historic levels of old growth in the knf were magnitudes of order higher than the ten percent level established under the forest plan.wildwest claims that study estimate that of low and forests were in condition prior to european settlement represents the best available science and must be reflected in the forest plan.wildwest also claims the forest service own experts acknowledge historical conditions probably provided a higher level of habitat,though no such statement appears on the cited page of the record.wildwest ties this general complaint only to the lower big creek project.
we grant considerable discretion to agencies on matters requir ing a high level of technical expertise.marsh or.natural res.council,d.though a party may cite studies that support a conclusion different from the one the forest service reached,it is not our role to weigh competing scientific analyses.lands council ii,at noting that we do not act as a panel of scientists that instructs the forest service how to validate its hypotheses regarding wildlife viability,chooses among scientific studies in determining whether the forest service has complied with the underlying forest plan,and orders the agency to explain every possible scientific uncertainty greenpeace action franklin,cir to set aside the service determination in this case would require us to decide that the views of greenpeace experts have more merit than those of the service experts,a position we are unqualified to take.
the rule,as incorporated into the forest plan,requires only that the forest service maintain habitat capable of supporting viable populations of dependent species.relying on the best available science,as required by the rule,the forest service determined that maintaining levels of ten percent below feet was sufficient to support such species.the forest service analysis of the scientific basis and reasoning for the ten percent standard are set forth in the old growth habitat characteristics and management guidelines the old growth guidelines and the forest plan feis.these documents discuss various characteristics of dependent species and their habitat,citing numerous scientific studies,along with competing interests and practical concerns.the old growth guidelines conclude that a review of applicable literature on wildlife species and their habitat needs indicated that a minimum of percent of available wildlife habitat should provide old growth conditions.we hold the forest service met the best available science requirement when it initially established the ten percent old growth standard.
moreover,wildwest has not cited any scientific studies that indicate the forest service analysis is outdated or flawed.see oregon trollers ass gutierrez,cir rejecting best science claim where t here was no evidence in the record the agency and studies were outdated or flawed citations omitted.wildwest cites repeatedly to the lesica study,which was published after the forest service adopted the forest plan.however,lesica conclusion does not bear directly on the viable population standard.the fact that levels of forest were significantly higher prior to european settlement in no way disproves the conclusion that ten percent is enough to support viable populations.
the forest service reviewed its management situation in,proposing several changes based on new scientific data from the intervening years.that review acknowledges that recent research had shown certain forest cover types are not as well represented as they were historically,a conclusion similar to the one reached in the lesica study.the forest service review suggested several changes to the management strategy.however,alteration of the ten percent standard was not one of them.the forest service has carefully considered the relevant scientific studies released since the forest plan was adopted.we will not second guess the forest service scientific analysis.see lands council ii,at.
in short,the forest service established the ten percent standard based on reasoned analysis of the best available science.the forest service has also considered new relevant scientific data since the forest plan was adopted in.wildwest has failed to indicate any scientific information directly undermining the conclusion that ten percent levels are insufficient to support viable populations of dependent species.accordingly,we conclude that the best available science supports the ten percent standard,and that the standard is therefore not arbitrary or capricious.
designation of old growth stand size 
wildwest next challenges the designation of tree stands smaller than fifty acres as habitat.wildwest argues that the forest plan requires stands of no less than fifty acres and encourages blocks of one hundred acres or more.it claims roughly of the blocks of old growth currently designated in pipestone,bristow,and south mcswede are smaller than fifty acres.
wildwest draws the requirement from the old growth guidelines,which appear as appendix to the forest plan.ordinarily,such a document would not have the force and effect of binding law.see western radio servs,espy,cir chrysler brown,d holding a forest service manual and handbook were not binding on the agency because they did not constitute substantive law and were not issued pursuant to the procedural requirements of the apa.
however,where an otherwise advisory document has been clearly incorporated into a forest plan or other binding document,its requirements become mandatory.see swan view,barbouletos,cir noting interagency grizzly bear guidelines were incorporated into the flathead forest plan and treating such guidelines as binding,robertson,cir finding a violation of interagency grizzly bear guidelines because project approval was explicitly conditioned on compliance with the guidelines.in this case,it appears that the guidelines were incorporated into the binding forest plan.the forest plan states specific forest guidelines exist and will be applied for old growth habitat and dependent species appendix.
however,even though the old growth guidelines were incorporated into the forest plan,the language at issue here does not create a mandatory standard.we have repeatedly noted that the presence of a few,isolated provisions cast in mandatory language does not transform an otherwise suggestive set of guidelines into binding agency regulations.terbush united states,cir quoting sabow united states,cir see chamberlin isen,cir reviewing manual of patent examining procedures and concluding that while i t is true that the mpep contains some mandatory language,for the most part,the mpep only suggests or authorizes procedures for patent examiners to follow.
the old growth guidelines state 
u nits of acres are the smallest acceptable size while units of a minimum of acres may be acceptable in some circumstances,acres should be the exception rather than the rule.efforts should be made to provide old growth habitat in blocks of acres or larger.if,due to past fires or management activities,the only remaining old growth blocks are less than acres,they may still be useful habitat provided that several small blocks are clustered together or are surrounded by mature habitat.
we can not conclude that this language creates a mandatory rule that strictly limits designation of old growth to blocks larger than acres.the section is cast in suggestive,should and may rather than mandatory,must or only terms.see sabow,at.it suggests how old growth should be managed,not how it must be designated.as the district court correctly concluded,the forest plan does not mandate stands of fifty acres or more rather,such a practice is merely recommended when possible.wildwest,d at.
our review is confined to the question of whether the forest service violated nfma.if the guideline language underlying the plaintiff claim is merely advisory or aspirational,the answer must be no.see or.natural res.council lowe,cir holding forest service did not violate nfma in attaining only the minimum levels of protection required by law,though the forest service itself recommends that forest planning alternatives should adopt management guidelines above the minimums.the language of appendix is not mandatory.moreover,appendix plainly contemplates that blocks of less than fifty acres will be treated as relevant to forest management decisions.therefore,regardless of whether the forest service has or has not designated stands smaller than fifty acres,it has not acted arbitrarily or capriciously.
designation of old growth effective replacement 
wildwest next challenges the forest service inclusion of some replacement old growth in its analyses,arguing that habitat which does not presently meet the needs of species should not count toward the ten percent minimum.wildwest does not refer to any specific project in this section of its brief,but does in various other sections refer to the levels of old growth habitat in each project area.we treat the claim as properly raised with respect to all nine projects.
the general requirements of the forest plan state only that of the kootenai national forest land base below feet in elevation will be in an timber condition.the forest plan does not address whether replacement old growth may be included in the forest service calculation to attain the ten percent level.therefore,the forest service is not clearly precluded from designating effective old growth or including effective old growth in its analyses.
assuming the forest plan leaves some ambiguity as to whether replacement old growth should be included,we defer to the forest service reasonable interpretation of the forest plan requirements.lands council powell lands council i,cir idaho sporting cong.thomas,cir deferring to the forest service expertise in interpreting its land management plan,overruled on other grounds by lands council ii,at.
the forest service interpretation of the ten percent standard is reasonable for two reasons.first,the forest plan feis provides management,as opposed to existing,natural,includes recognition of existing old growth,but also includes designation of future old growth emphasis added.this language plainly indicates that the forest service may include replacement old growth in its analyses.
second,as the district court highlighted in a prior related case,the knf did not meet the ten percent standard based on existing old growth alone at the time the forest plan was adopted.ecology,castaneda,no.cv,wl,at.june.designation of areas not yet possessing all the characteristics of old growth was necessary to meet the ten percent standard,and to ensure careful preservation of these areas for the future.it is therefore reasonable to interpret the forest plan as permitting designation of replacement old growth to meet the ten percent standard.accordingly,the forest service did not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner by including replacement old growth in its statistics or analyses for purposes of meeting the ten percent standard.
failure to meet ten percent standard 
the forest plan requires that at least ten percent of land below feet in elevation be in condition.additionally,old growth must be spread evenly through most major drainages,and will represent the major forest types in each drainage.wildwest claims the knf as a whole,and the challenged project areas individually,fall below the ten percent minimum.it also claims the forest service failed to disclose the relevant data.wildwest has properly raised this argument with respect to all nine projects.
the latest available data,which appears in the monitoring and evaluation report for fiscal years,indicates that of total knf lands below feet are designated effective.this alone would be sufficient to meet the standard set forth in the forest plan.when replacement old growth is included in the analysis,it reveals that of the forest is in condition.the number would be higher still if undesignated old growth were included in this analysis the monitoring and evaluation report concludes the forest is meeting its forest plan requirement for designating old growth habitat well distributed across knf lands below feet elevation.
this conclusion is also true for the nine challenged projects.counting only designated old growth,the record reveals that five of the nine,south mcswede,west troy,mcsutten,and lower big the ten percent standard based on effective old growth alone.the other,fortine,alder creek,and cow the ten percent standard when both effective and replacement old growth are included.again,the numbers are higher still when undesignated old growth areas are considered.because we conclude that designation of replacement old growth is proper under the forest plan,then all nine projects were in compliance with the ten percent standard as of the date of the project studies.
the projects authorize no commercial harvesting of designated effective old growth,and only limited amounts of harvesting in undesignated areas.completion of these projects would therefore have no impact on whether the knf as a whole meets the ten percent standard.therefore,approval of these projects was lawful under the forest plan.
population viability 
wildwest next argues the knf has insufficient habitat to support a viable population of pileated woodpeckers,the mis for old growth habitat.the forest plan requires the forest service to measure p opulation levels of dependent species in order to m aintain viable population s of dependent species.a viable population is defined as a one that is at least forty percent of the potential population for any given species in the knf.
wildwest first claims the minimum viable population for the pileated woodpecker in the knf is breeding pairs,which represents forty percent of the pairs the knf was historically able to support.however,as wildwest notes in its brief,the knf was historically able to support a range of to pairs.wildwest does not explain why the standard must be forty percent of the range upper limit.if the viability threshold is calculated as a range,which the forest service does,there should be between and breeding pairs.the knf is currently home to breeding pairs of woodpeckers,well within the permissible range.indeed,over the course of implementing the forest plan,the minimum standard of old growth coverage was raised from eight to ten percent specifically so that the knf could support more than the minimum viable population.therefore,as a general matter,the forest service decisions would not be arbitrary or capricious so long as the knf supports at least breeding pairs.
wildwest also claims seven of the nine challenged,fortine,west troy,lower big creek,bristow,alder creek,and cow adversely affect the knf ability to support a viable number of pileated woodpeckers.its main argument is that any alteration to the old growth habitat resulting from the approved projects will impair the viability of the pileated woodpecker.we have already rejected this general proposition.as we noted in lands council ii,a habitat disturbance does not necessarily mean that a species viability will be threatened.at.
though they may have adverse effects on the woodpecker,there is no indication the nine challenged projects would force the woodpecker population below thresholds of viability.the facts in this case are similar to those in lands council ii.there,the record included studies describing the quality and quantity of habitat necessary to sustain the viability of the mis.id.the forest service had analyzed the suitability of the habitat for the mis before and after the proposed project.id.we concluded,t hat a proposed project involves some disturbance to the forest does not prohibit the forest service from assuming that maintaining a sufficient amount of suitable habitat will maintain a species viability.id.
the result is the same here.the forest service has carefully described both the quantity and quality of habitat that is necessary to sustain a viable population of the pileated woodpecker and has explained its methodology for measuring habitat.see native ecosystems council forest,cir.it conducted extensive analysis for each project area,considering the effects on indicator species,such as impact on nesting and feeding habitat.it concluded that although the nine projects may affect species,they do not threaten species viability.for eight of the nine projects,the eis explicitly addresses the likely effects on the pileated woodpecker and concludes the project will not impair the bird viability.the only project for which the eis does not specifically address the effects on the pileated woodpecker is the pipestone project.however,the forest service did engage in extensive analysis of the effects on three other dependent birds,and concluded there would be no loss of viability.it also found the project design criteria would insure management for sufficient snags and snag replacement trees to maintain viable population of snag dependent species.snags are one of the pileated woodpecker listed habitats.this is the sort of scientific prediction to which we give great deference to the agency.see lands council ii,at citations omitted.
based on this extensive analysis,the forest service concluded that the challenged projects would leave sufficient old growth to support a viable population of pileated woodpeckers.therefore,the decision to approve the challenged projects was not arbitrary or capricious.
use of habitat proxies 
wildwest next raises several challenges to the forest service use of habitat proxies.once again,wildwest fails to cite to the record for any specific project in this section of its brief.however,because it has elsewhere challenged measurement of and compliance with the standards for old growth,we treat this claim as properly raised with respect to all nine projects.
where data on the mis is incomplete or difficult to collect,the forest service monitors the habitat of the mis,which is mature and old growth forest in the case of the pileated woodpecker.by studying the result of a timber sale on the habitat of the pileated woodpecker,the forest service attempts to estimate its effects on all old growth species.see idaho sporting cong.rittenhouse,cir describing this approach.
wildwest apparently claims that both parts of the measurement have,both the population target and the designation of habitat for the pileated woodpecker are improper.as discussed above,neither of these claims has merit.to the extent that wildwest challenges the approach generally,the argument is foreclosed by our case law.we have repeatedly approved the forest service use of the amount of suitable habitat for a particular species as a proxy for the viability of that species.lands council ii,at finding eminently reasonable the conclusion that the challenged project would maintain a viable mis population because it would not decrease mis habitat in the and would promote the longterm viability of mis habitat id.at noting w e have also allowed the forest service to use habitat as a proxy to measure a species population,and then to use that species population as a proxy for the population of other species approach inland empire,at approving forest service habitat as a proxy approach.
wildwest relies heavily on three cases in which management decisions based on the approach were invalidated.see earth island inst.forest,cir,cert.denied,d lands council i,at idaho sporting cong.rittenhouse,at.such reliance is misplaced.in each of those cases,the forest service failed to accurately identify and measure the relevant habitat.see lands council ii,at w hen the forest service decides,in its expertise,that habitat is a reliable proxy for species viability in a particular case,the forest service nevertheless must both describe the quantity and quality of habitat that is necessary to sustain the viability of the species in question and explain its methodology for measuring this habitat.we held that reliance on habitat proxies was invalid because the essential data underlying the decision was flawed.for instance,in lands council i,the forest service database,its main tool for old growth calculation,contained data that was fifteen years old,inaccurate,and insufficient on many variables.at.
no such defect exists here.wildwest does not challenge the forest service identification of old growth as the woodpecker habitat or its measurement of habitat for purposes of the proxy.as discussed above,the forest service designations of old growth were proper,and it engaged in extremely thorough analysis of habitat impact before approving the projects.the record contains detailed data on the location,condition,and amount of old growth habitat in the affected areas.therefore,the forest service use of the approach was not arbitrary or capricious.
use of best management practices 
wildwest makes several allegations related to the forest service management of watersheds and aquatic habitat in the knf though not listed in the issues on appeal,wildwest opening brief complains at length of the forest service use of best management practices bmps to protect fisheries.it claims bmps have clearly failed to adequately protect and maintain riparian areas in acceptable condition in watersheds impacted by all nine of the challenged projects.we understand wildwest argument to be that because bmps have proved inadequate to protect watersheds thus far,it is arbitrary and capricious to use bmps to evaluate and approve the new projects.
we have not specifically addressed whether use of bmps is a reasonable management strategy.rather,we review bmps according to the same standard by which we review all agency choices with respect to models,methodologies,and weighing scientific evidence their choices must be supported by reasoned analysis.for instance,we noted in environmental protection information center united states forest service,cir,that references to detailed bmps supported the conclusion the forest service had taken the requisite hard look at a project environmental consequences.id.at see also res,robertson,cir noting use of bmps to ensure maintenance of water quality in action challenging general planning strategies.additionally,we reviewed the substance of bmps in blue mountains biodiversity project blackwood,cir.there,we found that disclosure of mitigation measures was inadequate because the forest service relied on bmps developed for significantly different circumstances from those existing in the disputed project areas.id.at.
here,the forest service reasonably used and relied on bmps.the record reveals the bmps used in the knf are carefully considered and tailored to the projects for which they are used.for instance,the pipestone eis,which contains an extensive appendix of bmps to be applied,recommends specific practices and the results to be obtained by those practices.unlike in blue mountains,the bmps here were developed for the precise circumstances at hand.so long as bmps are supported by reasonable scientific assumptions,reasonably appropriate for the circumstances at hand,the forest service is not acting in an arbitrary and capricious fashion in relying on them.
moreover,the forest service points to specific evidence indicating implementation of bmps has been quite successful in improving some watersheds.wildwest has not proven that the poor conditions of which they complain are a direct result of the bmps used in the project analyses.nor have they proven the poor conditions can be attributed to bmps generally,as opposed to historical practice
