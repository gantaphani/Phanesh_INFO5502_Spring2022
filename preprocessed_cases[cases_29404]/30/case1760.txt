alameda county 
the california department of water resources dwr,a state agency,operates a pumping system that results in the taking of three endangered or threatened species of fish.watershed enforcers watershed,a nonprofit corporation,filed a petition for writ of mandate to compel dwr to stop taking the fish species without permit authority under the california endangered species act cesa fish game code,et appellants,three local water agencies,intervened in the mandate proceedings and argued cesa did not apply to dwr because it was not a person within the meaning of section.the trial court rejected this argument,and went on to consider and reject dwr separate arguments against mandamus relief.
the trial court granted the writ petition.dwr appealed,but then complied with the trial court writ of mandate and dismissed its appeal.the intervenors pursue their appeal,pressing their contention that a state agency is not a person for purposes of section.despite the appeal mootness,we reach the merits because the issue is one of general public interest which is likely to recur.
we hold that a state agency is a person within the meaning of section,which prohibits any person from taking an endangered or threatened species without appropriate permit authority from the california department of fish and game department,as we explain below.
statutory framework 
the legislature enacted cesa in.stats,ch,see california forestry california fish game commission th,california forestry.
in section,the legislature found and declared that 
a certain species of fish,wildlife,and plants have been rendered extinct as a consequence of man activities,untempered by adequate concern and conservation.
b other species of fish,wildlife,and plants are in danger of,or threatened with,extinction because their habitats are threatened with destruction,adverse modification,or severe curtailment,or because of overexploitation,disease,predation,or other factors.
c these species of fish,wildlife,and plants are of ecological,educational,historical,recreational,esthetic,economic,and scientific value to the people of this state,and the conservation,protection,and enhancement of these species and their habitat is of statewide concern.
in section,the legislature further found and declared that it is the policy of the state to conserve,protect,restore,and enhance any endangered species or any threatened species and its habitat and that it is the intent of the legislature,consistent with conserving the species,to acquire lands for habitat for these species.
and in section,the legislature found and declared that it is the policy of this state that all state agencies,boards,and commissions shall seek to conserve endangered species and threatened species and shall utilize their authority in furtherance of the purposes of cesa.italics added.
article of cesa governs the taking,importation,and sale of endangered and threatened species.its key provision is section 
no person shall import into this state,export out of this state,or take,possess,purchase,or sell within this state,any species,or any part or product thereof,that the fish and game commission determines to be an endangered species or a threatened species,or attempt any of those acts,except as otherwise provided in cesa,the native plant protection act or the california desert native plants act 
central to cesa is section prohibition on the taking of an endangered or threatened species.citation.to take in this context means to catch,capture or kill.citation.nonetheless,cesa allows the department to authorize a take that is incidental to an otherwise lawful activity if certain conditions are met.citation.environmental protection information center california of forestry fire protection cal th,environmental protection information.
accordingly,section permits the department to authorize acts that are otherwise prohibited pursuant to section.section,subdivision a provides 
through permits or memorandums of understanding,the d epartment may authorize individuals,public agencies,universities,zoological gardens,and scientific or educational institutions,to import,export,take,or possess any endangered species or threatened species for scientific,educational,or management purposes.italics added.
but a section,subdivision a taking is subject to stringent conditions,as set forth in subdivision b,paragraphs and 
the d epartment may authorize,by permit,the take of endangered species or threatened species if all of the following conditions are met 
the take is incidental to an otherwise lawful activity.
the impacts of the authorized take shall be minimized and fully mitigated.the measures required to meet this obligation shall be roughly proportional in extent to the impact of the authorized taking on the species.where various measures are available to meet this obligation,the measures required shall maintain the applicant objectives to the greatest extent possible.all required measures shall be capable of successful implementation.for purposes of this section only,impacts of taking include all impacts on the species that result from any act that would cause the proposed taking.
in referring to section,subdivision b,our supreme court declared at the heart of cesa is the obligation to mitigate authorized takes.environmental protection information,supra,cal th at.
subdivision c of section provides,in part,that no permit may be issued pursuant to subdivision b if issuance of the permit would jeopardize the continued existence of the species.
at issue in this case is whether the above statutory framework applies to dwr,whether a state agency is a person within the meaning of section.in the general definitions chapter of the fish and game code div,ch,et,the legislature defines person in section person means any natural person or any partnership,corporation,limited liability company,trust,or other type of association.but the legislature also declared a proviso unless the provisions or the context otherwise requires,the definitions in this chapter govern the construction of this code,italics added.
ii.facts and procedural background 
the facts are undisputed.we take the facts from the trial court statement of decision.
dwr operates the state water project harvey banks pumping plant banks pumping plant and related facilities.the integrated operation of the banks pumping plant and its facilities constitutes a lawful activity and is vitally important to significant numbers of people and businesses.the banks pumping plant operation diverts massive amounts of california water from its natural flow to the ocean to inland points south of the pumping plant.the banks pumping plant operation is the core of the state water project and the state water project can not continue without it.
the banks pumping plant operation causes the unfortunate entrainment and loss of life of significant numbers of fish,including three species that are the subject of this litigation chinook salmon chinook salmon and delta smelt.the department has listed chinook salmon as an endangered species since.the department has listed chinook salmon and delta smelt as threatened species since and,respectively.
watershed is a nonprofit corporation with members who assert an interest in the enforcement of cesa.watershed filed a petition for writ of mandate naming dwr and five of its employees as respondents.watershed sought a writ to command dwr to cease the banks pumping plant operation because dwr did not have the requisite permit or alternative authorization for the taking of the endangered and threatened fish species under cesa.appellants kern county water agency kern,san luis delta mendota water authority,and westlands water district intervened in the mandate proceedings 
not that dwr was not a person within the meaning of section.the trial court rejected this argument,reasoning as follows 
section a provides an exception to the requirements of section and includes in the exception the specific authorization to the department to issue permits to public agencies.this evidences an apparent intention on the part of the legislature that public agencies fall within the provisions of cesa.it would be nonsense to create an exception to section by passage of section a if section did not apply to public agencies 
the trial court also cited three cases in which the court of appeal has applied cesa to a state agency department of fish game irrigation dist.th san bernardino valley audubon society city of moreno valley th moreno valley and san bernardino valley audubon society metropolitan water dist.th metropolitan the court noted that the parties have not cited the court to any case holding that the provisions of cesa may not be applied to a public entity on account of its status as a public agency.
the trial court went on to consider,in some detail,dwr substantive argument that it had satisfied cesa by complying with section,a provision which grandfathered in certain agreements entered into with the department prior to january,authorizing the incidental take of endangered species.the court rejected dwr argument.the trial court granted the mandate petition and ordered dwr to cease operation of the banks pumping plant operation until and unless dwr obtained from the department authorization in compliance with cesa for the incidental taking of the three fish species.
dwr and the three intervenors appealed.during the pendency of its appeal,dwr complied with the trial court writ by obtaining proper authorization from the department in compliance with cesa for the incidental taking of the three fish species.accordingly,dwr requested dismissal of its appeal.we granted the request and dismissed dwr appeal.we therefore need not,and do not,discuss the trial court reasoning for finding dwr in noncompliance with cesa.
what remains before us,in these two consolidated appeals,is the intervenors argument that dwr is not a person within the meaning of section.this is solely a question of statutory interpretation.
iii.discussion 
watershed has moved to dismiss the intervenors appeals on the ground that this case is moot.watershed notes,correctly,that dwr has complied with the trial court writ.thus,this case is moot.nevertheless,we will decide the issue of statutory interpretation on its merits because of the importance of the issue.we have the inherent discretion to consider a moot issue if it raises a matter of general public interest that is likely to recur.californians for alternatives to toxics department of pesticide regulation th,schraer berkeley property owners d.the interpretation or scope of application of a statute would typically be a matter of general public interest.see,rawls zamora th.
the statute at issue is the core of cesa provisions regarding the taking of endangered or threatened species.whether that statute applies to public activities are,it would seem,likely to result in more expansive takings than those of individual hunters and clearly an issue of general public interest.the interpretation of section will affect a broad swath of public agency activities.furthermore,the applicability of section to state agencies is undoubtedly an issue likely to recur the application of the statute to dwr is of paramount interest to significant issues affecting california water allocation,the state water project,and the california water plan.
the issue has been fully briefed and involves only an exercise of interpretation on undisputed facts.we will determine the issue on its merits.watershed motion to dismiss the appeals is denied.
b.the merits 
the interpretation of a statute,especially on undisputed facts,is a question of law we review de novo.see california forestry,supra,th at.
the fundamental rule of statutory construction is that a court should ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.irvine th.to determine the intent of legislation,we first consult the words themselves,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.citations.dafonte,cal th.other courts refer to the plain and commonsense meaning of statutory language.people cole cal th,cole see people murphy cal th.
we do not,however,consider the statutory language in isolation rather,we look to the entire substance of the statutes in order to determine their scope and purposes.citation.that is,we construe the words in question in context,keeping in mind the statutes nature and obvious purposes.citation.we must harmonize the various parts of the enactments by considering them in the context of the statutory frame work as a whole.citation.if the statutory language is unambiguous,then its plain meaning controls.if,however,the language supports more than one reasonable construction,then we may look to extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.citation.cole,supra,cal th at.
furthermore,statutes must be given a reasonable and common sense construction in accordance with the apparent purpose and intention of the that is practical rather than technical and that will lead to a wise policy rather than to mischief or absurdity citation.people hinojosa d.we must construe a statute to comport with apparent legislative intent and with a view to furthering,not defeating,the general statutory purpose.california forestry,supra,th at.and where statutory meaning is uncertain,we may also consider the consequences of a particular interpretation,including the impact on public policy.citations.wells learning foundation cal th,wells.
we also note the general rule that l aws providing for the conservation of natural resources such as cesa are of great remedial and public importance and thus should be construed liberally.citation.california forestry,supra,th at,quoting moreno valley,supra,th at.
with these guiding principles of legal semantics in mind,we now turn to the question of whether a state agency is a person within the meaning of section,one of first impression.
intervenors correctly note that the term person,standing alone,is notoriously ambiguous.diamond view limited herz d.for this reason,person is often defined,in varying ways,in the preliminary provisions of the different codes.ibid.as we have noted,the legislature defined person in section as follows person means any natural person or any partnership,corporation,limited liability company,trust,or other type of association.
we agree with intervenors that the literal textual meaning of this definition would seem to exclude state agencies.obviously,a state agency is not a natural person or any of the types of business organizations listed in section.and we can not overlook the legislature ability to expressly define person to include a public entity.for instance,at least one provision of the fish and game code unrelated to cesa defines person to expressly include government agencies,subd.b.evidence code section defines person as a natural person,firm,association,organization,partnership,business trust,corporation,limited liability company,or public entity.as our supreme court has pointed out,there are numerous statutory examples showing that legislators know how to include public entities directly when they intend to do so.wells,supra,cal th at see id.at fn.
but section is subject to the proviso of section,which allows an alteration,and a legally permissible expansion of the specific statutory definition if the provisions or the context otherwise requires.this proviso,along with our duty to construe section to effect the legislature intent and to promote the purposes and policies of the cesa statutory scheme,poses a serious question whether the definition of person is limited to the exact language of section 
other statutory language emphasizes cesa application to public agencies.section declares it is the policy of this state that state agencies should not approve projects as proposed which would jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species if there are reasonable and prudent alternatives available consistent with conserving the species or its habitat which would prevent jeopardy section declares it is the policy of this state that all state agencies shall seek to conserve endangered species and threatened species and shall utilize their authority in furtherance of the purposes of cesa.
moreover,the language of section,on which the trial court based its ruling,also supports an interpretation of person to include state agencies.section exempts several entities,including public agencies,from the section prohibition.it is illogical to expressly exempt an entity from a prohibition that did not apply to it in the first place.therefore,section must apply to public entities or the exemption for public agencies in section is rendered result we must generally avoid see cooley superior court cal th.
the language of cesa contains specific provisions for the protection of endangered and threatened species and was enacted in,long after the enactment of the fish and game code general definition of person.the statutory language,taken as a whole,and including sections,and,strongly supports a conclusion that the legislature intended state agencies to be persons under section.
we note,however,that the three decisions relied upon by the trial court do not directly support this conclusion.
involved the application of section to a public agency,the irrigation district,whose operation of a pump diversion facility resulted in the killing of endangered chinook salmon,supra,th at.the issue of whether the district was a person under the statute was not raised,but assumed the question posed by the case was whether the taking proscribed by the statute was limited to hunting and fishing or encompassed lawful irrigation activity.id.at.
the court ruled the statutory definition of take was broad and included killing by any means the definition contained no limitation to hunting and activities,supra,th at.the court held such a limited interpretation would lead to absurd results in light of the clear policy statement of legislative purpose.citation.id.at.the court relied on the legislative policy in sections and.th at.thus,cesa makes clear that its intent is to protect fish,not punish fishermen.it is inconceivable that a statutory scheme,the purpose of which is to protect natural resources,should be construed to allow the wholesale killing of endangered species simply because the mode of death does not involve hunting or fishing.id.at.thus,section prohibits the killing of endangered species in the course of lawful activity.th at.
moreno valley involved an agency agreement between the department and several public entities.the agreement was considered a permit under section,and allowed for the taking of an endangered species incidental to private development.moreno valley,supra,th at.again,whether the public entities were persons was not at issue.at issue was whether cesa prohibited the taking of endangered species incidental to private development.id.at.the court suggested that cesa prohibited a taking for such a purpose.id.at.but the court did not decide the issue,resolving the case on the issue of laches.id.at.
metropolitan also involved an incidental taking for expected private development.metropolitan,supra,th at.again,the question of whether a public entity was a person was not decided.it was tacitly assumed that the public entity in that case,the metropolitan water district,was a person under section.th at.
cases are not authority for propositions they do not consider.miklosy regents of university of california cal th,fn.but in the context of preservation of endangered and threatened species,would it be logical for the legislature to exempt government agencies from the cesa taking prohibition,when those agencies operate large enterprises dams,pumping stations,irrigation systems,while covering individual hunters and fishermen and business associations,which would generally take species in fewer numbers and in narrower scope from a logical policy perspective,we think not.this perhaps helps explain why three published decisions have assumed section applies to public agencies,why the agencies did not challenge the application in those cases,why dwr did not challenge it in the present case,and why cesa existed for over two decades before anyone raised this issue.
this brings us to the issue of the interpretation of cesa by its implementing agency,the department.while we exercise our independent judgment in interpreting a statute,we will give deference to an agency interpretation if warranted under the circumstances of the agency actions.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,state water resources control bd.cases th.the department,as amicus curiae in the present proceedings,asks us to defer to its administrative regulations implementing the incidental take permitting process.
section,subdivision d gives the department the authority to adopt these regulations,which are codified at california code of regulations,title,section et and are intended to implement section and section,tit.
the department regulations contemplate that the incidental take permitting process applies to state agencies.code section essentially restates the language of section,that no person may take an endangered or threatened species except as provided by several listed laws or as authorized under the regulations in an incidental take permit,tit,subd.a.
code section,which governs permit applications,requires additional information in the application if the applicant is a corporation,firm,partnership,association,institution,or public or private agency,tit,subd.a.code section,which governs transfers of permits,exempts the transfer of a permit from department approval when there is a sale,merger,annexation,consolidation or other acquisition of an institutional,corporate,or public entity permit holder by another entity,tit,subd.a a.and,in a special order governing the incidental take of a salmon species being considered for threatened or endangered status,the regulations specifically permit the t ake of sacramento river chinook salmon incidental to operation of the state water project facilities,tit,subd.a.
thus,the department considers a state agency to be a person subject to the incidental take permitting process.
we thus conclude that,given the context and policies of cesa,including the policy of species preservation made expressly applicable to state agencies,as well as the statutory language expressly referring to state agencies,that a state agency is a person within the meaning of section.additionally,interpreting section to exclude state agencies would lead to the unreasonable result that major actors,whose operations result in the taking of endangered and threatened species,would be exempt from the general take prohibition.
intervenors present no applicable or persuasive authority to support their proposed interpretation of section.
intervenors rely on a attorney general opinion,which concluded that section did not apply to state or local government agencies because such agencies were not an other type of association within the meaning of the statute.but this conclusion was made within the context of potential criminal liability for violations of sections and,that prevent diversion of stream flow without notice to the department.the attorney general opinion is based on the general inapplicability of the penal code to bodies politic,state and local government agencies,as opposed to natural persons and corporations,supra,at,fn see.since criminal liability is not at issue in this case,the attorney general opinion is distinguishable 
intervenors also rely on an august,memorandum of a deputy attorney general,written to advise the delta vision blue ribbon task force regarding the legal tools available under the california fish and game code to protect threatened,endangered and other imperiled species,which may have the effect of reducing reallocating water use for ecosystem protection purposes.we have taken judicial notice of the memorandum.while expressing an opinion that state and local government agencies are not persons under section,the memorandum acknowledges the trial court ruling in the present case and does not disagree with it.we do not find the memorandum to be persuasive authority for intervenors position.
in addition,intervenors rely on wells,in which our supreme court concluded that a public school district was not a person which could be sued under the california false claims act cfca,et.wells,supra,cal th at.cfca defines person in essentially the same manner as section,subd.b see wells,supra,at.the court noted that the statutory list of persons contains no words or phrases most commonly used to signify public school districts,or,for that matter,any other public entities or governmental agencies.wells,supra,at.
but wells is distinguishable.first,the cfca definition of person originally included governmental agencies,but was amended to delete government agencies prior to the adoption of cfca.this was a significant indicator of a legislative intent that government agencies were not persons under cfca.wells,supra,cal th at.
second,wells was decided in a different context from the present case.the linchpin of the wells ruling was the financial protection of public school districts from the draconian liabilities of the cfca which include double and treble damages.wells,supra,cal th at see id.at.the court reasoned the legislature could not have intended to subject budgetarily restrained and financially strapped school districts to such liabilities,given their responsibility to provide free public education.id.at.
here,we are not dealing with a statute that imposes financial liabilities.we are dealing with a statute intended to preserve precious natural resources.the rationale for the wells holding simply does not apply here 
intervenors fashion an argument based on the federal endangered species act fesa et and moreno valley.cesa was in large part modelled upon fesa,which was enacted in.moreno valley,supra,th at see id.at.at the time cesa was enacted in,a fesa provision permitted an incidental taking for private development under certain circumstances.id.at.when the legislature enacted cesa it did not include this fesa provision.id.at.the moreno valley court concluded that the absence of the fesa provision showed that the legislature deliberately chose not to adopt that provision into the state statute.id.at.
intervenors observe that at the time cesa was enacted,fesa expressly defined person to include state agencies,subd,stat.intervenors argue the failure to include state agencies in the cesa definition of person shows an intent that state agencies not be considered persons.the flaw in this argument is that person was defined by the fish and game code in,before the enactments of both fesa and cesa.we can not read significant meaning into the legislature failure to revisit a statute almost three decades old when it enacted cesa.we certainly do not see the type of express rejection of a fesa provision at issue in moreno valley.
intervenors also fashion an argument based on former article of cesa,sections through.former article was enacted in,but was sunsetted on january.stats,ch,as amended by stats,ch.the article was entitled state agency consultation and,as described by the department in its amicus brief,provided an alternative means for state agencies to obtain authorization to take an endangered or threatened species.
section provided that state agencies designated as lead agencies of projects subject to the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et must consult with the department to ensure that any action authorized,funded,or carried out by the state lead agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species,subd.a.
section provided that i f jeopardy is found,the d epartment shall determine and specify to the state lead agency reasonable and prudent alternatives consistent with conserving the species which would prevent jeopardy to the continued existence of the species or the destruction or adverse modification of the habitat essential to the continued existence of the species if a taking incidental to the project is found,the d epartment shall determine and specify to the state lead agency reasonable and prudent measures that are necessary and appropriate to minimize the adverse impacts of the incidental taking.any taking that is in compliance with the alternatives or measures specified under this subdivision is not prohibited by cesa.
section,subdivision a provided that if consultation with the department pursuant to section lead to a finding of jeopardy,the state lead agency shall require reasonable and prudent alternatives consistent with conserving the species which would prevent jeopardy,subd.a.subdivision b provided that i f specific economic,social,or other conditions make infeasible the alternatives prescribed in subdivision a,except as provided in subdivision c,the state lead agency may approve a project when jeopardy is found as long as certain conditions are reasonable mitigation measures as are necessary and appropriate to minimize the adverse impacts of the project upon the endangered species or threatened species,subd.b.subdivision c provided that a state lead agency shall not approve a project which would likely result in the extinction of any endangered species or threatened species,subd.c.
intervenors claim that these provisions of former article show a legislative intent to treat state agencies differently from the persons defined in section,and to exempt state agencies from the take prohibition of section.we see no such intent.former article provided an alternate means for a state agency to obtain authorization for an otherwise prohibited take,through consultation with the department and implementing alternatives or mitigation measures to minimize the incidental taking of an endangered or threatened species.by stating in section that a taking in compliance with former article was not prohibited by cesa,the legislature acknowledged that a taking not in compliance with former article was prohibited by cesa.that is,the section take prohibition did apply to state agencies and former article merely provided an alternative means for a state agency to obtain proper take authorization 
intervenors also base an argument on sections and,additional findings and declarations made by the legislature in enacting cesa.
in section,the legislature finds and declares that it is the policy of the state that state agencies should not approve projects as proposed which would jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species if there are reasonable and prudent alternatives available consistent with conserving the species or its habitat which would prevent jeopardy.r easonable and prudent alternatives shall be developed by the d epartment,together with the project proponent and the state lead agency,consistent with conserving the species,while at the same time maintaining the project purpose to the greatest extent possible.italics added.
in section,the legislature provided that in the event specific economic,social,or other conditions make infeasible such alternatives,individual projects may be approved if appropriate mitigation and enhancement measures are provided.
intervenors argue that these two sections demonstrate a carefully considered approach to state agencies,and that interpreting section to apply to state agencies would conflict with section.intervenors posit a case where a project would cause a take,would jeopardize a species,and there are no feasible alternatives.intervenors claim that in such a case section would allow the take,but section would not,because section,subdivision c prohibits the department from issuing a permit where to do so would jeopardize the existence of the species.
this argument is flawed for two reasons.first,sections and were linked to the consultation provisions of former article.as the august,attorney general memorandum observes,the sections were keyed to the consultation provisions and b ecause the state agency consultation process sunset from cesa on january,the status and continued applicability of these legislative intent provisions is unclear.
second,the posited conflict is a false one.section does not say a state lead agency may approve a project that jeopardizes a threatened or endangered species.indeed,section,subdivision c pre
