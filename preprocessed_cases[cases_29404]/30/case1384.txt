petitioner,the legal environmental assistance foundation leaf,seeks review of the united states environmental protection agency epa approval of alabama revised underground injection control uic program for the underground injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids to enhance the recovery of methane gas from coal beds.for the reasons discussed below,we deny in part and grant in part the petition and remand for further proceedings.
background 
regulation of underground injection under the safe drinking water act 
part c of the safe drinking water act sdwa is designed to protect underground drinking water sources from contamination caused by underground injection of fluids.see to.this program requires epa to promulgate regulations that set forth minimum requirements for state uic programs.see id.a state must submit to epa a proposed uic program that satisfies these minimum requirements,and must meet epa approval in order to obtain primary regulatory and enforcement responsibility for underground injection activities within that state.see id.the state retains primary responsibility until epa determines,by rule,that the state uic program no longer meets the minimum requirements established under the sdwa.see id.b.
procedural history of alabama uic program 
alabama uic program for class ii was initially approved by epa in see fed.reg.the uic program approved in did not regulate hydraulic fracturing associated with methane production in,leaf petitioned epa to withdraw approval of the alabama uic program.see legal envt l assist,united states envt l protection agency,cir leaf i.leaf alleged that the alabama program was deficient because it did not regulate hydraulic fracturing activities associated with methane gas production as required under part c of the sdwa.see id.epa denied leaf petition because it determined that hydraulic fracturing did not fall within the regulatory definition of underground injection.see id.epa decided that methane gas production wells,which are also used for hydraulic fracturing,need not be regulated under uic programs because the principal function of these wells is methane gas production and not the underground emplacement of fluids.see id.leaf subsequently petitioned this court for review,contending that epa interpretation of the regulations rendered the regulations inconsistent with the statute.see id.at.we concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities constitute underground injection under part c of the sdwa.see id.at.since epa contrary interpretation could not be squared with the plain language of the statute,we granted leaf petition for review and remanded for further proceedings.see id.
thereafter,leaf sought,and this court issued,a writ of mandamus to enforce the court mandate in leaf see in re legal envtl.assist,cir,unpublished.epa subsequently initiated proceedings to withdraw approval of alabama class ii uic program.see fed.reg.proposed rule.before the withdrawal proceedings were completed,however,alabama submitted a revised uic program to the epa,see fed.reg.proposed rule,seeking approval of its revised uic program under the alternative demonstration provision in of the sdwa,a.epa proposed to approve alabama revised uic program,see fed.reg,and conducted a public hearing and received written comments thereon.leaf objected,arguing that approval under a was improper because hydraulic fracturing did not fall within the scope of activities identified in,and approval under that section was therefore improper.see leaf comments,at.epa rejected leaf argument,and,on january,promulgated a final rule approving alabama revised uic program under.see fed.reg.thereafter,leaf timely filed this petition for review.
in this appeal,leaf argues that epa approval of alabama uic program should be set aside for three reasons.first,leaf argues that the underground injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids to enhance the recovery of methane gas from coal beds is not underground injection for the secondary or tertiary recovery of natural gas under and,therefore,epa approval of alabama revised uic program under that section is not in accordance with the law.second,leaf contends that wells used for the injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids to enhance the recovery of methane gas from coal beds are class ii wells as defined in b.according to leaf,it follows that epa approval of alabama revised uic program,which regulates such hydraulic fracturing as a class underground injection activity is not in accordance with law.third,leaf argues that even if alabama revised uic program is covered by the alternative approval procedure pursuant to,epa approval of the revised program is arbitrary and capricious.we address each argument in turn.
ii.discussion 
epa approval of alabama uic program under section.statutory framework 
the sdwa provides two statutory methods for approval of a state uic program.see sdwa b codified at b sdwa codified at a.approval under b requires a state to show that its uic program satisfies applicable federal regulations promulgated by epa under and set forth in part.approval under requires a state to demonstrate that its uic program meets the requirements of sdwa b a d,and represents an effective program to prevent underground injection which endangers drinking water sources.significantly,the practical difference between the two statutory methods for approval is that the requirements for those programs covered under are more flexible than the requirements for those programs covered under b.section,however,only applies to specific types of uic programs.
section provides 
for purposes of the administrator approval or disapproval under section of this title of that portion of any state underground injection control program which relates to 
the underground injection of brine or other fluids which are brought to the surface in connection with oil or natural gas production or natural gas storage operations,or 
any underground injection for the secondary or tertiary recovery of oil or natural gas,
in lieu of the showing required under subparagraph a of section b of this title the state may demonstrate that such portion of the state program meets the requirements of subparagraphs a through d of section b of this title and represents an effective program including adequate recordkeeping and reporting to prevent underground injection which endangers drinking water sources.
sdwa codified at a.
in approving alabama revised uic program regulating the hydraulic fracturing of coal beds under this section,epa recognized that the language of does not specifically mention hydraulic fracturing.see fed.reg.at.epa perceived the absence of hydraulic fracturing from as a gap in the statutory scheme.see id.seeking to fill this perceived gap in the statute,epa construed as applying not only to specific processes used during secondary or tertiary recovery of natural gas,but also generally to techniques and as hydraulic related to secondary or tertiary recovery.see id.on this basis,epa concluded that the process of hydraulic fracturing,while not technically identical to secondary or tertiary recovery of natural gas,is an analogous process,and therefore covered by the alternate approval method set forth in.see id.at.
standard of review 
leaf challenges epa construction of as contrary to the statute plain meaning and therefore not in accordance with the law.the standard against which we evaluate leaf argument is set forth in chevron,natural resources defense council,d.the chevron test has two steps.first,always,is the question whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.at.if,however,the court determines congress has not directly addressed precise question at issue,the court proceeds to step two.id.at.at.there,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.at.if the agency interpretation is reasonable,a reviewing court may not substitute its own construction of the statutory provision for that of the agency.see id.at.at.an agency reasonable statutory interpretation must therefore stand even in the face of other permissible interpretations,including that which the court may have chosen had the question initially arisen in a judicial proceeding.see id.at.at.deference is not owed to an agency interpretation,however,if it construes a statute in a way that is contrary to clear congressional intent.see id.at.
chevron analysis 
chevron step one 
in this case,the question at issue is whether a state program for underground injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids to enhance the recovery of methane gas from coal beds may be approved under the alternative demonstration provisions of.in determining whether congress has spoken directly to this issue,we look to the particular statutory language at issue,as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.k mart cartier,d.our inquiry begins,as always,with the text of the statute.see fmc holliday,d we begin with the language employed by congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.quoting park fly,dollar park and fly,d internal quotation marks omitted.additionally,it is an elementary principle of statutory construction that,in construing a statute,we must give meaning to all the words in the statute.see bailey united states,d noting that each word in a statute is intended to have particular,nonsuperfluous meaning.
the key words in to which we must give meaning are relates to.these two words are central to this case because applies not simply to any underground injection for the secondary or tertiary recovery of oil or natural gas,but rather to that portion of any state underground injection control program which relates to any underground injection for the secondary or tertiary recovery of oil or natural gas a emphasis added.the parties set forth different interpretations of.while the difference between the two constructions is subtle,the effect is significant.not surprisingly,the difference between the two interpretations of turns largely on the meaning given to the phrase relates to.epa argues that the phrase relates to evinces congress intention to permit a portion of a state uic program to fall under,provided that the activity controlled by that portion relates to the underground injection of brine or other fluids which are brought to the surface in connection with oil or natural gas production or natural gas storage operations,or any underground injection for the secondary or tertiary recovery of oil or natural gas.fed.reg.at quoting a characterizing as an alternative demonstration for secondary or tertiary recovery related injection.epa concludes that the process of hydraulic fracturing,while not technically identical to secondary or tertiary recovery of natural gas,is analogous to,and therefore relates to,secondary and tertiary recovery of gas.accordingly,epa asserts that hydraulic fracturing is covered by the alternate approval method set forth in sdwa.
leaf,on the other hand,argues that the phrase relates to evinces congress intent to permit a portion of a state uic program to fall under only if there is a direct relationship between that portion of a state program and one of two specific activities the underground injection of brine or other fluids which are brought to the surface in connection with oil or natural gas production or natural gas storage operations,and underground injection for the secondary or tertiary recovery of oil or natural gas.id.leaf asserts that where congress has been so specific in identifying the activities for which an alternate uic program can be approved,it is inappropriate for epa to assume that any other activities are included.therefore,leaf asserts that because the injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids to enhance the recovery of methane gas from coal beds is not one of the two specifically identified activities,it can not qualify for approval under,united states anderson,cir sentencing guideline provision which expressly applies to specified offenses should be construed to exclude application to other offenses.
of the two interpretations of offered by the parties,we find epa interpretation more compelling.by focusing only on whether hydraulic fracturing is the same as secondary or tertiary recovery of oil or natural gas,leaf construction of fails to give full weight to the phrase relates to.since relates to injects ambiguity and interpretative breadth into this statutory provision,we can not accept leaf construction.we conclude,therefore,as a threshold matter that the statutory provision at issue,read in its entirety,that portion of any state underground injection control program which relates to any underground injection for the secondary or tertiary recovery of oil or natural gas,does not directly and unambiguously speak to whether a state program regulating hydraulic fracturing may be approved under.
chevron step two 
according requisite deference to the epa interpretation of,we review epa conclusion that the process of hydraulic fracturing,while not technically identical to secondary or tertiary recovery of natural gas,is analogous to secondary and tertiary recovery and therefore covered by the alternate approval method set forth in sdwa.under the second step of the chevron analysis,the question we must answer is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.at.we have little trouble concluding that epa decision to subject hydraulic fracturing to approval under rests upon a permissible construction of the statute.
epa bases its interpretation of primarily on two grounds first,epa asserts that hydraulic fracturing is a gas production enhancement process that is technically analogous to secondary and tertiary recovery techniques,and therefore covered by the alternate approval method set forth in epa determined that both procedures generally enhance oil or gas production through the underground injection of fluids gas or liquid through an injection well to increase reservoir pressure and to drive oil or gas to a production well.see fed.reg.at.epa further notes that one of leaf own exhibits confirms that hydraulic fracturing has traditionally been used to aid in secondary recovery operations.see information on processes,envt l protection agency draft,appearing at leaf comments,exh.c.second,epa determined that a finding that hydraulic fracturing is not related to a state uic program governing methods to enhance oil and gas production would require states to seek approval for similar parts of their oil and uic program under both section and.fed.reg.at emphasis added.such a result,epa concluded,would be both inefficient and inconsistent with congress expressed admonition that epa not prescribe unnecessary requirements related to oil and injection.id.citing b we conclude these reasons are sufficient to support epa construction of the sdwa,and therefore hold that epa decision to subject hydraulic fracturing to approval is based on a permissible construction of the statute 
epa classification of hydraulic fracturing of coal beds to produce methane gas as a class underground injection activity 
regulatory framework 
the original promulgation of uic regulations in established a classification system for underground injection wells.under this classification system,all underground injection wells subject to the sdwa fit within the five well classes in epa scheme.see see also leaf i,at classes differ from each other according to the purpose and function of the well and the substance to be injected into it.we summarized the five categories in leaf i 
class i wells are wells used to dispose of hazardous,industrial,or municipal wastes beneath underground sources of drinking water.a.class ii wells are w ells which inject fluids w hich are brought to the surface in connection with conventional oil or natural gas production f or enhanced recovery of oil or natural gas and f or storage of hydrocarbons.id.b.class iii wells are wells which inject for extraction of minerals.class iv wells are wells used to dispose of hazardous or radioactive wastes into or above underground sources of drinking water.id.c and d.class v wells are i njection wells not included in classes i,ii,iii,or iv.id.e.
after this court determined that epa must regulate hydraulic fracturing of coal bed seams as underground injection under the sdwa,epa reviewed its well classification definitions to determine how to incorporate hydraulic fracturing into its existing regulations.see fed.reg.at.epa noted,at the outset,that of the five well classes,hydraulic fracturing of coal beds to produce methane appeared most closely related to class ii,especially that part of the class ii definition covering wells which inject fluids for enhanced recovery of oil or natural gas.id.at citation omitted.epa further noted that i t is certainly possible to view the emplacement of fracturing fluids through these methane production wells as designed to enhance the recovery of natural gas by creating fractures through which the methane might flow to the well and up to the surface.id.ultimately,however,epa decided against classifying these wells as class ii wells.epa explained 
s ince the injection of fracture fluids through these wells is often a exercise of extremely limited duration fracture injections generally last no more than two hours ancillary to the well principal function of producing methane,it did not seem entirely appropriate to ascribe class ii status to such wells,for all regulatory purposes,merely due to the fact that,prior to commencing production,they had been fractured.
id.instead,epa concluded that it is reasonable to view hydraulic fracturing of these production wells as a class underground activity which,by itself,does not turn these methane production wells into class ii injection wells for purposes of complying with all of the class ii regulatory requirements in parts and.id.doing so,explained epa,was consistent with the court mandate that it treat hydraulic fracturing of coal beds for methane production as underground injection,while at the same time allowing alabama the flexibility to fashion an approvable regulatory program addressing hydraulic fracturing which need not mirror all existing requirements in parts and for class ii wells.id.
standard of review 
leaf argues that epa classification of hydraulic fracturing of coal beds as a class underground injection activity is plainly erroneous and inconsistent with the language of.according to leaf,wells used for hydraulic fracturing are class ii wells and should be regulated as such.in construing administrative regulations,we must give controlling weight to the agency interpretation unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.bowles seminole rock sand.see also wright director,fed.emergency mgmt.agency,cir.thus,we will give effect to the agency interpretation so long as it is reasonable,ehlert united states,d,that is,so long as the interpretation sensibly conforms to the purpose and wording of the regulations.indiana pub.serv.porter county chapter of izaak walton league of,d.we will afford the agency interpretation such deference even if this interpretation is not the best or most natural one by grammatical or other standards.pauley bethenergy mines,d citation omitted.
classifying hydraulic fracturing of coal beds 
an injection well is defined as a well into which fluids are being injected.as we noted in leaf i,t here is no dispute that methane gas production wells,which are initially used for hydraulic fracturing,are wells within the meaning of the statute and regulations.similarly,there is no dispute that the materials used in hydraulic fracturing are fluids within the meaning of the statute and regulations.leaf i,at.it follows that wells used for the injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids must fall into one of the five classes set forth in.see leaf i,at the state also must classify injection wells in conformance with the classification system promulgated by epa in.
in addition,leaf argues that the plain language of the regulations demands that wells used for the injection hydraulic fracturing fluids be classified as class ii wells.leaf notes that classifies as class ii injection wells wells which inject fluids for enhanced recovery of oil and natural gas,and epa acknowledges that h ydraulic fracturing of coal beds is a temporary and intermittent process in which fluids are injected underground at high pressures to create fractures in the coals seam that enhance the recovery of methane gas by creating pathways for the gas to flow to the surface.fed.reg.at emphasis added.leaf thus concludes that these wells can not be classified as anything but class ii wells.
in considering leaf argument,we do not take lightly our obligation to defer to an agency reasonable interpretation of its own regulations,particularly when,as here,the statute has produced a complex and highly technical regulatory program.pauley,at.at.in this case,however,we can not avoid the conclusion that epa construction of its classification scheme runs afoul of the plain language of the regulations and is therefore contrary to law.where the classification system sets forth five classes,one of which serves as a for any well not covered by the first four,epa must classify hydraulic fracturing into one of those categories.moreover,as leaf correctly notes,wells used for the injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids fit squarely within the definition of class ii wells.accordingly,they must be regulated as such 
epa arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.first,epa focus on the duration of the underground injection is misplaced.the fact that hydraulic fracturing is of limited duration and ancillary to the principal function of the well does not exempt it from the well well classification system nor is the duration of the underground injection a factor addressed by the definition of class ii wells in.second,epa argument that leaf has failed to provide any evidence,either in the text or legislative history of the sdwa,that congress intended to apply its well classification scheme rigidly turns traditional notions of statutory construction on their head.where,as here,the plain language of the regulation does not permit the construction imposed on it by epa,epa can not justify its interpretation by pointing to the absence of a statutory command to enforce the regulations rigidly.nor can epa salvage such an inconsistent interpretation by references to legislative history 
in sum,we conclude that epa decision to classify hydraulic fracturing of coal beds to produce methane as a class underground injection activity is inconsistent with the plain language of.therefore,epa classification must be set aside.see mullins coal,of virginia director,d marshall,dissenting d eference has its bounds.it is not a license for an agency effectively to rewrite a regulation through interpretation.an agency must abide by its regulations as written until it rescinds or amends them.accordingly,we remand to epa to determine whether alabama revised uic program complies with the requirements for class ii wells.
alabama revised uic program and the sdwa requirements 
under the alternative method for program approval set forth in,a state must show that its uic program meets the requirements of sdwa b a d and represents an effective program including adequate recordkeeping and reporting to prevent underground injection which endangers drinking water sources.a.accordingly,in order to receive approval for its class ii program under the optional demonstration,a state must make a successful showing that its program meets the following five conditions the program prohibits any underground injection in such state which is not authorized by permit or rule,see sdwa b a codified at b a the program requires that i the applicant for a permit must satisfy the state that the underground injection will not endanger drinking water sources,and ii no rule may be promulgated which authorizes any underground injection which endangers drinking water sources,id.b b codified at b b the program include s inspection,monitoring,recordkeeping,and reporting requirements,id.b c codified at b c the program applies to i underground
