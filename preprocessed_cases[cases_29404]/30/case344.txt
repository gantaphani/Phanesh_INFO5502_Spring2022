after purchasing a parcel of land in anne arundel county,maryland,crofton ventures limited partnership crofton discovered that a portion of the parcel had been used as a hazardous waste dump.after reporting its discovery to the maryland department of the environment and cleaning up the site,it brought this action under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla,et,against former owners and operators of the land to recover its response costs.in addition to its cercla claim,crofton asserted common law claims for fraudulent misrepresentation and breach of contract.following a bench trial,the district court entered judgment for the defendants on all counts.because we conclude,however,that the district court erroneously construed the requirements of cercla,we vacate its ruling on that claim and remand.we affirm the court remaining rulings.
on april,crofton entered into a contract with g h partnership,of which harry and dahlia ratrie were partners,collectively hereinafter,ratrie,to purchase a parcel of land to be carved from ratrie tract located on patuxent river road in anne arundel county,maryland.crofton intended to develop the site for operation of a vehicle salvage business involving the storing and selling of motor vehicles that had been declared a total loss.as part of the contract of sale,which the parties amended from time to time,ratrie represented 
to the best of seller knowledge and while the property was in seller possession,the property has not been used for hazardous waste disposal,and no party has transported,caused to be transported,stored or caused to be stored on the property,in any buildings,containers,on the surface or underground,any solid,liquid,or gaseous materials that would constitute hazardous wastes hazardous substances oil,petroleum products,and their byproducts or any substance the presence of which on the property is prohibited or regulated by any law similar to those set forth in this section and that the property has not been contaminated by any of the aforementioned hazardous or toxic wastes or substances.
in,before closing,ratrie subdivided the tract and,at closing,conveyed a parcel to crofton pursuant to the april contract.when crofton began to develop the site in,it discovered a waste dump on the site that contained a total of fully or partially buried drums,truck tires,household appliances,and other similar refuse.upon testing five of the drums,crofton found that four contained a mixture of asphalt and trichloroethylene tce,a common solvent known to be carcinogenic and constituting a hazardous substance under federal and state environmental laws.crofton reported its finding to the maryland department of the environment and,thereafter,under the department supervision,cleaned up the site.
in the process of cleaning up the site,crofton found a few corrugated drums of world war ii vintage.the remainder of the drums,however,were of a type manufactured during the period in the late through the and to today.they were discovered in a broad array of disrepair,described variously as rusted,crushed,split open,leaking,and broken.two hundred of these drums contained observable asphalt,and most smelled of tce.two sets of drums containing asphalt were sampled and tested to determine whether they contained hazardous substances,and the tests from each of the two composite samples indicated high concentrations of tce.high levels of tce were also found in the soil and groundwater at the site.
after cleaning up the site,crofton commenced this action under cercla to recover all or part of its cleanup costs.it also alleged state common law counts for fraudulent misrepresentation and breach of warranty.
the evidence at trial established that the tract had been used from the to by its owner alan barton and various tenants for the production of asphalt,concrete,and sand and gravel.after barton death,the tract was conveyed to stewart mitchell,mitchell,a maryland corporation,which owned it until.mitchell operated an asphalt plant on the tract during the early part of that thereafter sold the business to ratrie,leasing to him the property with an option to purchase.in,ratrie exercised the option and bought the tract from mitchell.ratrie subsequently leased it to an operator who continued to produce asphalt on the tract.both mitchell and ratrie concede that,as defined by cercla,they were owners during the relevant periods,and,respectively,and that mitchell was an operator from.
the evidence in the record indicates that tce was used at the site beginning in,when mitchell began using tce in testing asphalt as required by the state of maryland.in,when mitchell ceased operating the plant and leased the property to ratrie,ratrie continued to produce asphalt at the site and test it in the same manner.from until the late,waste material from asphalt testing on the of a mixture of liquid asphalt,aggregates,and placed in drums of the type found at the site by crofton.no evidence could be uncovered,however,as to how mitchell or ratrie,or indeed the state of maryland,disposed of those drums.mitchell retained no records of the drums disposition,and no witness recalled how the drums were disposed of.
upon crofton purchase of the site in,no further operations were conducted there,and it remained unused until crofton began its development of the property in,at which time crofton discovered the hazardous waste.
following a bench trial,the district court made findings of fact,upon which it entered judgment dismissing all of the claims with prejudice,concluding generally that crofton had failed to meet its burden of proof on each of the three counts.on crofton cercla claim,the district court found that hazardous wastes had been released on the site,causing crofton to incur response costs.it concluded,however,that the evidence failed to establish that either mitchell or ratrie placed any tce on the site.the court observed that if crofton could so prove,mitchell would be a responsible person from to and ratrie would be a responsible person starting in.the district court acknowledged that prior to,when crofton discovered the partially buried drums,one or more persons placed tce on the site.but the court stated that the dispositive question was whether crofton has proven that some,if not all,of the drums containing tce were placed on the site by the defendants from on.and it repeated that statement of the issue in its discussion the question before this court is whether the court can find,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the defendants dumped their tce waste on the site.the court then summarized its findings,concluding that crofton has presented no direct evidence of dumping by the defendants,the alleged perpetrators.emphasis added.acknowledging that crofton could also satisfy its burden through circumstantial evidence,the court concluded that the circumstantial evidence was likewise insufficient 
crofton has,at most,presented evidence to raise a mere suspicion that the defendants or one of them might be responsible for placing some drums containing tce at some improper location.crofton has not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendants placed any tce on the site.
on the fraud claim,the court found that crofton failed to prove that ratrie knew that hazardous waste was buried on the property when he represented in the contract of sale that it was not.and on the breach of contract claim based on ratrie express warranty that to the best of his knowledge,the site had not been used for waste disposal,the court likewise found that ratrie did not have knowledge of any hazardous waste disposal and therefore did not breach that express warranty.
crofton filed this appeal,which challenges the legal and factual bases for the court findings on the cercla claim and the factual bases for its findings on the state common law claims.
crofton brought its cercla claim for contribution under f,which authorizes a suit in contribution against any other person who is liable or potentially liable under section a for response costs.it asserts that mitchell and ratrie are liable under a for response costs because they were owners or operators of a site during the time when hazardous waste was disposed of at the site.they argue that under cercla,the term disposed of is a term of art that results in liability for defendants if they owned or operated the property at a time that the tce was actually placed on the site or when tce leaked into the soil at the site.crofton contends that the district court erred in requiring it to prove that the defendants dumped their tce waste on the site during the period that they were owners or operators.it also contends that the district court clearly erred in making factual findings about the size and location of the area in which the drums were found,the date when the drums were buried,and the source of the drums containing the tce waste.
we address crofton argument by first looking at the nature of its claim under cercla and the elements that crofton must prove.cercla was enacted to address the increasing environmental and health problems associated with inactive hazardous waste sites.the statute encourages private cleanup of such hazards by providing a cause of action for recovery of costs incurred in responding to a release of hazardous substances at any facility.nurad,william hooper sons,cir.the act imposes broad and strict liability for the costs of cleaning up hazardous waste sites without regard to whether the persons assigned liability under the act placed the waste material on the site or had knowledge of the waste materials presence.see united states monsanto,cir new york shore realty,cir.
section a,which defines the scope of liability,provides that in connection with a facility from which there is a release,or threatened release which causes the incurrence of response costs,of a hazardous substance,four classes of persons are liable for the response costs,two of which are relevant here 
the owner and operator of a vessel or a facility,and 
any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of.
a,subsection a thus imposes liability on current owners and operators of a facility,such as crofton,and subsection a imposes liability on any previous owners or operators of the facility if they were owners or operators at the time of disposal.disposal is defined broadly to include the discharge,leaking,or placing of any solid waste or hazardous waste into or on any land or water so that such solid waste or hazardous waste or any constituent thereof may enter the environment.incorporating definition from.thus,under subsection a,any owner or operator is liable if he was an owner or operator at the time when hazardous waste was either placed on the site or leaked into the environment from a source on the site,whether or not such owner or operator was the cause of the disposal or,indeed,even had knowledge of it.see monsanto,at holding that under a,ownership of a facility at the time when hazardous substances were deposited is sufficient to trigger liability regardless of the owners degree of participation in the disposal shore realty,at prior owners and operators are liable only if they owned or operated the facility at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance.
in sum,to recover contribution under cercla for response costs,as authorized by f,a plaintiff must establish that it incurred costs as a person liable under a in the response to a release or threatened release that the response was consistent with the national contingency plan that the defendant was a person liable for response costs under a that the defendant,if asserted to be a person covered by subsection a,as crofton asserts in this case,was an owner or operator of a facility or site at the time that the hazardous waste was dumped at the site or when it leaked into the environment there and that the costs incurred by the plaintiff were necessary to the response.necessary costs are defined to include interest.once a plaintiff proves these elements,the defendant may avoid liability only by proving an affirmative defense provided in b.
in this case,the district court found that crofton incurred costs in response to a release as a person liable under a.it did not,however,decide whether the response was consistent with the national contingency plan because it concluded that crofton failed to prove that the defendants were persons liable for the response costs under a.accordingly,we must determine whether,when the correct legal standard is applied,crofton could recover under cercla.reduced to the context of the evidence presented,we must determine whether,during the period when mitchell or ratrie owned or operated the site in question,evidence was sufficient to show that tce was dumped at the site or that tce leaked from the drums at the site into the environment.we believe there is ample evidence to establish both bases of liability in this case and that the district court overlooked this evidence because it misconstrued the requirements for establishing liability under cercla 
the uncontroverted evidence shows that tce was routinely used at the site beginning in.indeed,there is no evidence that it had been used at the site prior to that date.tce was used to test asphalt at the site by mitchell,by ratrie,or by the state of maryland,but,for purposes of establishing liability,it is immaterial who conducted the testing or used the tce at the site.the uncontroverted evidence also established that a waste mixture of asphalt and tce was,during the period from through the late,placed in drums at the site.despite efforts to discover the fate of these drums,however,none of the owners or operators can account for what happened to the drums,and all records relating to this issue have somehow become unavailable.but the drums found at the site,filled with a mixture of asphalt and tce,were of a type that were manufactured in the late and,and not before.when the drums were found in,they were in a state of gross disrepair,evidencing a long period during which their contents were leaking into the environment at the site.finally,the evidence was uncontroverted that tce was found in the soil and in the groundwater at the site.
we believe that these facts,which are relevant to the appropriate legal standard for liability under the act,would easily permit a to conclude either that tce was placed on the site after or that during the period after,whether the drums were placed on the site before or after,the drums contents,including tce,began to leak into the environment at the site and continuously leaked into the environment until cleaned up.either conclusion would support liability of an owner or operator of the site from until.it is irrelevant under the act that crofton could not prove who actually dumped the tce at the site or whether any owner or operator had knowledge of the dumping or leaking during the relevant period.as we have pointed out,liability under the act is strict and does not require that either of these elements be shown.see nurad,at.
the district court appears to have assumed otherwise,erroneously adding elements for establishing liability under the act by requiring crofton to show that the defendants themselves actively dumped the tce at the site or otherwise were involved in the dumping.and relatedly,the court erroneously construed the term disposal,as used in the act,too narrowly.the court repeatedly used language in its opinion suggesting that it limited disposal to active conduct of the defendants.thus,the district court said that t o establish the cercla claims,plaintiff must prove that the defendants placed tce on the site.emphasis added.after discussing crofton claim,the court stated that the case turns on whether the plaintiff can prove if,and when,the operators of the asphalt plant on the site dumped tce on the site.emphasis added.the court again stated,after concluding that someone placed tce on the site prior to,that the question before the court is whether the plaintiff has proven that some of the drums containing tce were placed on the site by the defendants from on.emphasis added.in concluding that crofton did not make the showing demanded by the court,the court stated that crofton has not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendants placed any tce on the site.the court then repeated the issue as it understood it the question before this court is whether the court can find,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the defendants dumped their tce wastes on the site.emphasis added.the district court did not appear to countenance the possibility that the drums were buried on the site at the behest of some unknown third party,although there is evidence in the record supporting precisely such a possibility.of course,given the court apparent belief that a conclusion that a third party was responsible for dumping of tce would have been insufficient to impose liability upon the defendants,it is understandable that the court failed to take this possibility into account when it analyzed the evidence.
the district court thus made two legal errors.first,it believed that liability could not attach under a unless crofton showed that the defendants placed or dumped tce on the site.second,the district court apparently believed that the defendants could not be liable for crofton response costs absent evidence linking the tce used by the defendants and the tce that was buried in the drums at the site.these legal assumptions overlooked the strict liability imposed by the act for any owner or operator of land at which hazardous waste is in fact leaking into the environment.while disposal includes activities such as dumping,it also encompasses spilling and leaking of any hazardous waste into or on any land or water so that such hazardous waste may enter the environment.incorporating the definition from.given the breadth of the statutory definition of disposal,the district court must be able to conclude that the buried drums did not leak between and,regardless of when they were buried,to make a finding that the owners and operators during that period were not liable under a.
because the district court did not reach other elements of liability and did not address the defendants affirmative defenses asserted under b,we vacate the court ruling on the cercla count and remand for further proceedings.
crofton challenge to the district court factual findings on its common law claims are based on the district court findings of fact that the defendants did not have knowledge of the existence of the hazardous waste at the site.we have reviewed the record carefully and do not find the district court factual findings in this regard clearly erroneous.accordingly,we affirm the district court rulings with respect to crofton claims for fraudulent misrepresentation and breach of contract.
affirmed in part,vacated in part,and remanded for further proceedings.
in a trial that was fair to both sides,the defendants successfully defended the case crofton asserted against them,which included a cercla claim that they dumped drums contaminated with tce on a parcel of land in anne arundel county,maryland.the majority nevertheless concludes that a remand of the cercla claim is necessary because the district judge did not understand the bases of liability under the act and therefore failed to assess the evidence properly in making his factual findings.i respectfully disagree.while the evidence was being presented at trial,crofton theory was that the defendants dumped the drums on the site during the time they owned or operated it.during closing arguments,however,crofton attempted to raise a new theory of liability based on passive disposal,that is,the leaking of tce.i agree with the district judge refusal to indulge this belated change in theory because of the prejudice to the defendants,who had defended a different case.in focusing on the case that was actually tried,the judge concluded that crofton failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that contaminated drums were placed on the site during the time the defendants were responsible.this finding was not clearly erroneous.i would therefore affirm the judgment in favor of the defendants.
the remand ordered by the majority gives crofton the chance to have its case reconsidered under a new and perhaps less burdensome theory,that tce leaked from the drums during the time that the defendants owned or operated the site.this is fundamentally unfair because crofton waived the passive disposal theory of liability by failing to raise it until closing argument in a trial.
in an extended closing argument session,crofton lawyers spent most of their time trying to convince the district judge that the defendants were responsible for dumping the drums found at the site.then,at the very end,one of crofton lawyers said,i want to take a step back and kind of drop a bomb shell on this court.he explained that he wanted to include the passive disposal or leaking theory of liability in his argument.the defendants lawyer objected to the introduction of this theory,saying that crofton had not based its case on passive disposal.the defense pointed out,for example,that there had been n o discovery about passive disposal if there had been,we would have had lots of testimony on it.the district judge,who was immediately concerned because the defendants had no notice of the passive disposal theory,said 
it is a little bit strange here,this passive disposal concept for the first time in final argument.why did we go through four days of testimony without hearing about it i do understand why did you mention this before it would be nice if they defendants knew what they were they really knew they were going to try that issue.
the judge nevertheless allowed crofton lawyer to attempt to identify evidence of leaking.in the end,however,the judge returned to the notice problem 
i can not believe in final argument you are going to be able to change this case from what everybody tried it to something that nobody tried i am sorry.it is absolutely not the slightest notice that this passive disposal was going to be tried it is not an additional argument.it is a totally different case than what they defendants thought they were trying.you look at the pretrial order.you do see the slightest reference to this i got to tell you i did have to listen to all that stuff i heard for the last three years.it is a totally different case.secondly,it was even raised in argument with regard to liability so let proceed.i can not allow you to amend the pleadings and do this at this time.this is unconsci o nable unconsci o nable.unconsci o nable.i ca do it.
it was thus clear to the trial judge that leaking was never an issue in the case.the record supports the judge understanding.the passive disposal theory did not surface in discovery or in any other pretrial proceeding.and most important,at trial crofton did not indicate during opening argument or at any other time before the close of evidence that it intended to base liability on leaking.
i agree with the majority that a number of events or acts can constitute disposal for purposes of cercla liability.this,however,does not excuse a plaintiff from giving a defendant notice of the particular theory or theories of disposal being pressed in a given case cercla provides that any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of is liable for cleanup costs and other damages.a.the term disposal means 
the discharge,deposit,injection,dumping,spilling,leaking,or placing of any solid waste or hazardous waste into or on any land or water so that such solid waste or hazardous waste or any constituent thereof may enter the environment or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters,including ground waters.
different cases present different grounds for disposal liability.not every case involves facts suggesting both active disposal for example,dumping or placing and passive disposal for example,leaking or spilling.see,kaiser aluminum chem.catellus dev,cir declining to consider the question of passive migration because plaintiff alleged active disposal,specifically,that defendant excavated contaminated soil and spread it over a clean part of the property nurad,william hooper sons,cir holding individual defendant liable because hazardous substances were leaking from tanks during the time that he owned the property,even though he did not handle the tanks.crofton chose to frame and try its case as one involving active disposal only.the defendants responded accordingly.they did not pursue discovery on the issue of leaking,nor did they present evidence at trial to rebut a theory of leaking.this was not an oversight by the defendants,who legitimately believed that they were only facing a charge of active disposal.crofton should not be permitted to argue now that this is a passive disposal case requiring only a showing that the tce leaked into the environment during the time of the defendants ownership or operation.indeed,it is unprecedented to allow crofton to make such a prejudicial change in its its own words,to drop a bomb shell at this late stage.see,savarin bank of,cir.the district judge was correct to conclude that crofton waived the passive disposal theory of liability.
moreover,the district judge was correct in his observation during closing argument that there was insufficient evidence to establish that tce leaked from the drums during the time the defendants would have been responsible.crofton points to the drum log and groundwater test results for evidence of leaking.see br.of appellant at reply br.of appellant at.the drum log describes drums in various states of damage or deterioration,including crushed,split,or leaking.the log,however,revealed only what was seen.the log was not based on any scientific analysis.furthermore,because the log was prepared at the time of the cleanup in,it does not address whether any leakage occurred earlier when the defendants owned or operated the site.the groundwater test results do show tce contamination,but the testing was conducted after the drums had been removed.tr.the expert reports indicate that crofton had not done any soil or groundwater sampling before the cleanup.see expert report of bruce monteith,pl.ex,at expert report of joseph lewandowski,def.g h ex,at.in addition,the groundwater test results are irrelevant to the issue of leaking.that evidence was introduced for the sole purpose of proving that the drum removal complied with the national contingency plan ncp,an issue that the district judge never reached.before crofton expert testified as to the groundwater test results,the judge ruled that the evidence could only be used to prove compliance with the ncp.tr.all of this reveals that even if the issue of leaking is considered,the evidence,as the district judge recognized,is not sufficient to establish that the defendants are liable for passive disposal.
it is beside the point to say,as the majority does,that the facts presented by crofton easily permit a factfinder to conclude that tce was placed on the site when defendants owned or operated it.ante at.the record reveals that the district judge understood the bases of liability under cercla and that he made factual findings that were keyed to the case presented and the liability standards spelled out in the act.we review factual findings for clear error.see.a findings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous,and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.the district court factual findings are not clearly erroneous.
the majority contends that the district judge erred because he required crofton to show that the defendants themselves actively dumped the tce at the site or otherwise were involved in the dumping.ante at.although the district judge focused on whether crofton proved that the defendants dumped the tce on the site,this does not mean that the judge misunderstood the law.the judge was merely analyzing the case according to crofton theory,specifically,that the defendants had produced the tce and then illegally dumped it on another part of their property after.see vol.at closing argument by crofton lawyer we believe the drums all came from the asphalt plant that was constructed by mitchell in based on the case that crofton presented,the judge framed the central question as whether plaintiff has proved the alleged dumping in the post period.see also a s discussed herein,the court concludes that plaintiff has failed to prove that there was any tce dumping on the site after.the judge rejected some of the evidence because it did not shed light on when the dumping occurred.see i t would be more likely that drum dumping took place prior to,while the dump site area was denuded from strip mining,rather than later,close to,after the vegetation had regrown.the presence of the fully corrugated drums indicates that the dumping at least of these drums took place a long,long time ago.i t would have been simple,yet potentially significant,to have preserved evidence of the vintage of the tires.
in a opinion the district judge explained in detail why he concluded that crofton did not prove its active disposal case by a preponderance of the evidence.the first problem was the absence of reliable proof of the location and size of the dump site.one of crofton assertions was that before heavy vegetation surrounding the dump site prevented trucks from driving to the site and unloading the drums,but that by the area was cleared and easily accessible.this,according to crofton,allowed the inference that the drum dumping took place after.but there was confusion in crofton case about the location of the site.crofton expert on aerial photographs placed the dump site at a location on the aerial photograph that was different from the location he identified on the and photographs.see vol,ex.because of this confusion,the judge concluded that crofton argument that the dumping took place after based upon the alleged progressive changes in the dump site from heavily vegetated to cleared totally lacked an evidentiary foundation.the second problem was that much of the evidence that would have established the timing of the dumping either was not fully analyzed or was lost during the cleanup process.crofton failed to present an expert analysis on the degradation of the drums and failed to specify how many drums were fully corrugated in use in the and and how many were in use later.crofton likewise did not preserve evidence removed from the dump site that would have shed light on when the dump site was in use.this evidence included tires,mud flaps,road signs,and junked household appliances.the final problem was that crofton evidence regarding the defendants involvement in the dumping was too speculative.the deposition of a former employee of the defendants supported crofton case,but the judge considered the employee testimony unreliable because the defendants had fired him after he was caught stealing.the judge concluded that the remaining evidence created no more than a suspicion that the defendants dumped their tce waste at the site.crofton has not pointed to any record evidence that would fill the gaps in proof that the district judge identified.
not once in part ii does the majority mention the clearly erroneous standard of review,nor does it apply that standard.it is not enough to say,as the majority does,that a factfinder could conclude that tce was placed on the site while the defendants owned or operated it.this is not the standard that governs our review.the district judge,who heard four days of testimony and studied almost one hundred exhibits,found that crofton did not prove a case of active disposal.after reviewing the evidence and giving due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses,i am firmly convinced that the district judge did not commit clear error in finding that crofton did not prove its case.a.see also anderson city of bessemer city,d.
this appeal at the core is not about cercla.it is about whether the defendants won according to rules governing the trial of a lawsuit and any appeal from the judgment.these rules are that a defendant is entitled to fair notice of the plaintiff theory of liability at trial and that findings of fact are reviewed on appeal for clear error.because the defendants won
