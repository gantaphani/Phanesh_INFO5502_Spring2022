a chapter debtor,filed this adversary proceeding against the south carolina department of health and environmental control dhec in an effort to prevent the agency from closing pinewood facility,a commercial hazardous waste landfill.appeals the district court order denying the company a preliminary injunction to enjoin dhec from closing the pinewood facility.dhec,in turn,the district court determinations that the doctrine does not bar action and that the automatic stay blocks dhec attempt to require to comply with state financial assurance regulations.dhec also attempts to take an interlocutory appeal from the district court order denying its motion to dismiss complaint.finally,the official committee of unsecured creditors of official committee appeals the denial of its motion to intervene.we hold that does not bar action the district court did not err in denying motion for a preliminary injunction the automatic stay does not apply to dhec efforts to enforce the financial assurance requirements dhec may not appeal the denial of its motion to dismiss and the official committee motion to intervene should have been allowed.as a result,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and dismiss in part.
operates the pinewood facility,one of only twenty commercial hazardous waste landfills in the country.pinewood is located in sumter county,south carolina,and is within feet of lake marion,a popular recreation spot and a source of drinking water for several thousand people.pinewood began accepting hazardous waste in and operated under a permit issued by dhec.dhec issued the original permit without providing public notice or a hearing.after congress passed the resource conservation and recovery act rcra,stat.codified as amended at,was required to apply for a new hazardous waste permit from dhec.under rcra pinewood qualified for interim status,which allowed pinewood to remain open pending dhec determination of whether to award a final permit.
dhec scheduled a public hearing and solicited comments on whether and under what conditions was entitled to a final permit to operate pinewood.in july dhec staff,in consultation with the epa,issued a final permit to to operate pinewood.the permit provided that pinewood had a capacity limit of of waste,but it did not specify whether nonhazardous waste counted toward the capacity limit.objected to some of the permit conditions and requested a hearing with a dhec hearing officer several environmental groups also requested a hearing to challenge the issuance of a final permit.before the hearing and dhec agreed to resolve their differences over the permit terms by entering into a stipulated agreement.the agreement contained two important provisions.first,pinewood could store up to of nonhazardous waste in addition to of hazardous waste.second,agreed not to apply for additional landfill space until pinewood was within three years of reaching its capacity.the agreement,however,was not binding on either the hearing officer or the dhec board.
the dhec hearing officer recommended approval of the agency decision to issue the final permit as modified by the stipulated agreement.the environmental groups asked the dhec board to review the hearing officer recommendation.the board upheld the issuance of the final permit but rejected the stipulated agreement separate allowance for nonhazardous waste.in other words,the board concluded that pinewood capacity should be limited to a total of of total waste,whether hazardous or nonhazardous.the board decision,however,was prospective only.therefore,any waste stored in pinewood prior to the board decision would not be counted against the cap.while was not pleased with the board decision to reject the separate cap for nonhazardous waste,estimated that pinewood would have between four and to six years of unused space left under the permit.
both and the environmental groups petitioned the sumter county court of common pleas for judicial review of the board decision.sought reversal of the board decision to reject the separate cap for nonhazardous waste,and the environmental groups challenged the issuance of the permit for pinewood.the court of common pleas denied each of the petitions for review,and both sides then appealed to the south carolina court of appeals.the court of appeals upheld the board decision,but with one significant change.see leventis dhec,app.the court concluded that the rejection of the separate cap for nonhazardous waste would operate retrospectively as well as prospectively.see id.at.in other words,any nonhazardous waste stored in pinewood before the board decision would count against the total cap.see id.as a result of this decision,pinewood became immediately full under the permit.specifically,the combination of the existing nonhazardous and hazardous waste stored at pinewood exceeded the cap.the court of appeals decision had dramatic consequences for.the instant before the decision,pinewood had a substantial amount of unfilled space,and was barred by the stipulated agreement from seeking additional space.the instant after the decision,pinewood suddenly had no more permitted space.promptly petitioned for a writ of certiorari to the south carolina supreme court.
while the petition for certiorari was pending,encountered another serious problem,this one relating to the bonds posted by the company to secure certain obligations.on june,the treasury removed frontier insurance company from its list of approved sureties.frontier was the issuer of the bonds posted by to secure the costs associated with pinewood closure and maintenance.permit and state law require that the surety company issuing the required bonds be among those listed as acceptable by the treasury.on june dhec ordered to acquire substitute bonds within days or cease accepting waste the bond order.safety kleen did not have the financial ability to comply with dhec order,and later that day the company filed for chapter bankruptcy in the district of delaware.
four days later,on june,the south carolina supreme court denied safety kleen petition for a writ of certiorari to review the court of appeals decision.the next day dhec ordered pinewood to cease accepting waste within days because pinewood had exhausted all of its permitted space under its existing permit the closure order.responded by seeking additional capacity on both a temporary and a permanent basis.dhec denied the request for temporary authorization to store additional waste.request for permanent authorization is currently pending with dhec.
on july,filed this adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court in the district of delaware,challenging dhec actions and seeking injunctive relief.the district court granted motion for withdrawal of reference and transferred the case to the district of south carolina,where the official committee moved to intervene.the district court in south carolina denied the committee motion,but permitted it to participate as amicus curiae.
in its complaint asserts that it has a due process right to additional capacity.it also asserts that dhec attempt to close pinewood violates the equal protection clause,the first amendment,the dormant commerce clause,and rcra.as soon as the case was transferred to south carolina,pressed its motion for a preliminary injunction.dhec,on the other hand,moved to dismiss complaint on the merits and on the ground that the doctrine bars the action.dhec also sought a determination that the automatic stay did not bar enforcement of the bond order.the district court ruled as follows it held that did not bar the suit it denied safety kleen motion for a preliminary injunction it concluded that the bond order was subject to the automatic stay it denied dhec motion to dismiss the suit on the merits,but certified the dismissal question for interlocutory review under b and it granted a injunction pending this appeal.
the parties and the official committee filed notices of appeal.dhec,however,failed to file with this court a timely application for permission to appeal the denial of the motion to dismiss.the district court recertified the question for review,and dhec then filed an application for permission to appeal,which is still pending.after the expiration of the injunction,we denied an injunction pending appeal.
dhec argues that the doctrine bars suit because the suit would require federal court review of the south carolina court of appeals decision.the doctrine holds that lower federal courts generally do not have jurisdiction to review decisions.plyler moore,cir.see also of app.feldman,d rooker fidelity trust.the doctrine precludes review of adjudications of the state highest court and also the decisions of its lower courts.jordahl democratic party,cir.the bar extends not only to issues actually decided by a state court but also to those that are inextricably intertwined with questions ruled upon by a state court.plyler,at cir internal quotation marks omitted.a federal claim is inextricably intertwined with a state court decision if success on the federal claim depends upon a determination that the state court wrongly decided the issues before it.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the district court held that does not bar safety kleen suit,and our review of that ruling is de novo.see guess bd.of med.exam rs,cir.
again,dhec argues that can not succeed on its federal claims unless we reexamine issues decided by the south carolina court of appeals.we disagree.the issue before the south carolina court of appeals was whether and under what conditions was entitled to a final permit to operate pinewood.specifically,the state court held that safety kleen was entitled to a permit allowing for the storage of up to of total waste.federal suit assumes that the court of appeals correctly decided that its permit is limited to of space for hazardous and nonhazardous waste concedes that it has exhausted all of its permitted space.it claims,however,that with all of its permitted space now exhausted,the constitution and rcra require dhec to allow it to store additional waste.
claims do not require us to review any issues actually decided by the south carolina court of appeals.the court of appeals never considered the consequence of exhaustion of all of its permitted space.claims also do not require us to review any issues inextricably intertwined with any matters decided by the court of appeals.it is consistent to say that under state law has exhausted all of its permitted space and that it still has a federal entitlement to additional capacity.in sum,claims do not require us to review the south carolina court of appeals decision,and therefore does not bar this action.
argues that the district court erred in denying it a preliminary injunction to enjoin dhec from enforcing the closure order.first,claims that the district court applied the wrong legal standard in evaluating whether it was entitled to a preliminary injunction.second,it claims that even if the court applied the correct standard,the court nonetheless erred in denying an injunction.we hold that even if the district court applied the wrong legal standard,is still not entitled to a preliminary injunction.
claims that the district court used the wrong standard in evaluating its likelihood of success on its claims.in evaluating whether to grant a preliminary injunction,a court should consider the likelihood of irreparable harm to the plaintiff if the preliminary injunction is denied the likelihood of harm to the defendant if the injunction is granted the likelihood that the plaintiff will succeed on the merits and the public interest.see direx israel,breakthrough med,cir.the likelihood of irreparable harm to the plaintiff is the first factor that a court should consider.see id.a court next step is to balance the likelihood of harm to the plaintiff against the likelihood of harm to the defendant.see blackwelder furniture seilig,cir.if the harm balance tips decidedly in favor of the plaintiff,a preliminary injunction will be granted if the plaintiff has raised questions going to the merits so serious,substantial,difficult and doubtful,as to make them fair ground for litigation and thus for more deliberate investigation.rum creek coal sales,caperton,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in other words,the plaintiff case must at bottom present a substantial question.
in its order denying a preliminary injunction,the district court the standards applicable in evaluating preliminary injunction motions.the court correctly discussed the interplay between the balance of harm to the parties and the plaintiff likelihood of success.the court concluded that would suffer irreparable harm if injunctive relief was denied.the court then said that it was not convinced that will likely prevail on the merits of this controversy.claims that because the district court concluded that it would suffer irreparable harm,it was not required to make such a strong showing of likelihood of success.rather,argues that it only had to raise a substantial question.we need not reach the question of whether the district court erred in requiring too much of safety kleen on the likelihood of success scale.as we will discuss,case does not in any event present a substantial question.therefore,can not meet the standard that it relies upon.accordingly,even if the district court erred,the likelihood of success factor considered at the substantial question level would still weigh against the grant of a preliminary injunction.
we turn now to a fuller discussion of whether the district court erred in denying a preliminary injunction.we review the decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.see rum creek coal sales,at.we review factual determinations under a clearly erroneous standard and legal conclusions de novo.see direx israel,at.the parties do not dispute the district court finding that will suffer decidedly more harm than dhec if a preliminary injunction is denied.therefore,we will only discuss whether has presented a substantial question and the public interest in the grant or denial of an injunction.
asserts that dhec is prohibited from denying pinewood additional capacity for several reasons.claims that the closure order violates procedural due process,substantive due process,the equal protection clause,the first amendment,and the dormant commerce clause.also argues that rcra the order.we discuss safety kleen claims in turn.
first claim is that its procedural due process rights were violated by the closure order.in order to succeed on its procedural due process claim,must show that there exists a liberty or property interest which has been interfered with by the state and that the procedures attendant upon that deprivation were constitutionally insufficient.dep t of corr.thompson,d.we conclude that safety kleen has not presented a substantial question that it has a protectible property interest at stake.the fourteenth amendment itself does not create property interests.see gardner city of baltimore mayor city council,cir.rather,they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.bd.of regents roth,d.to have a property interest in a benefit,a person must clearly have more than an abstract need or desire for it.he must have more than a unilateral expectation of it.he must,instead,have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.id.
procedural due process claim hinges on whether it can show that it has an entitlement to additional capacity.concedes that it has filled all of its permitted space and that it would operate in violation of state law if it continued to accept waste.it argues,however,that it has a property right to additional capacity.as we will explain,the south carolina environmental regulatory scheme does not create the entitlement that seeks.has made requests for additional space under three separate provisions of the south carolina hazardous waste management regulations.first,requested that dhec modify its permit to allow for more space.see ann.regs.dhec has not refused this request outright.rather,dhec is requiring to comply with the normal notice and comment procedure for permit modification.safety kleen argues that it has the right to bypass the normal notice and comment procedure and begin accepting waste immediately.contrary to assertion,the regulations permitting dhec to modify an operator permit simply do not allow to circumvent these procedures.the request for additional capacity is considered a proposed class modification to the permit.see id.app.i f a.under south carolina law dhec must follow notice and comment procedures before granting a class modification.see id.c.perhaps will be entitled to a permit modification in due course,but it does not have an entitlement to bypass the notice and comment procedure.therefore,the provision allowing dhec to modify safety kleen permit does not create the immediate entitlement that seeks.
also requested that dhec grant a temporary authorization to allow for additional capacity while the permit modification request is pending.see id.e.dhec denied this request.argues that it has an entitlement to receive such authorization.dhec does have the power to issue a temporary authorization for additional space,see,and dhec may grant the authorization immediately without following any public notice or comment procedures,see id.e.however,in order for dhec to grant the temporary authorization request,the operator must be in compliance with the standards of part.id.e i.one of the requirements of part is that the operator have adequate financial assurance for closure,and liability costs.see id.has chosen to use surety bonds to satisfy the financial assurance requirements.when an operator uses surety bonds,the bond issuer must be on the department of treasury approved list.see id.c c i.does not have bonds from such an issuer and has not otherwise provided adequate financial assurance.therefore,does not have an entitlement to receive temporary authorization.
finally,requested additional space by filing an amendment to a pending permit renewal application.see id.dhec also rejected this request.while an operator may request additional space by filing an amendment to a pending renewal application,dhec may not approve the amendment unless the operator follows a public comment procedure.see id.has not followed this procedure.again,has no right to bypass this procedure and therefore does not have an entitlement to have its amendment approved.
the south carolina environmental regulatory scheme does not create an entitlement to receive immediate additional space.nonetheless argues that either its dependence on the permit for its viability as a business or the stipulated agreement is sufficient to give the company a property interest.first argues that its dependence on the permit for its viability gives rise to a property interest.to have a property interest in a benefit,a person must have an entitlement to it.see roth,at.in this case south carolina has an explicit procedure for acquiring additional space.there is nothing in the south carolina scheme that allows us to presume that because business viability depends upon receiving additional space,the state has implicitly created an entitlement to immediate additional space.
also argues that the stipulated agreement creates a property interest.under the stipulated agreement was prohibited from applying for additional space until pinewood was within three years of reaching its capacity.pinewood had more than three years of space left the instant before the court of appeals decision,but was immediately full once the decision was rendered.claims that the agreement created an expectancy that it would be allowed to apply for additional space without interruption of its business.argument is suspect,however,because the bind created by the south carolina court of appeals decision was foreseeable and avoidable.safety kleen had to know that either the dhec board or the south carolina courts might reject the separate cap for nonhazardous waste.nonetheless,while the permit was being litigated,accepted nonhazardous waste in a sufficient quantity that if the separate nonhazardous waste cap was rejected,pinewood would become immediately full under its permit.could have avoided this contingency by limiting the amount of nonhazardous waste it accepted.because this contingency was foreseeable and avoidable,can not claim that it had an expectancy of uninterrupted waste collection.
in order to succeed on its procedural due process claim,must show that it has an entitlement to immediate additional capacity.because does not have such an entitlement,its procedural due process claim does not raise a substantial question.
second claim is that it has a substantive due process right to additional capacity.to succeed on its substantive due process claim,must show that it has a liberty or property interest the state deprived it of this liberty or property interest and the state action falls so far beyond the outer limits of legitimate governmental action that no process could cure the deficiency.sylvia dev.calvert county,cir.as indicated above,can not show an entitlement under state law to immediate additional capacity.and,we have no basis to conclude that it has such an entitlement because of any liberty or property interest embodied in the constitution.therefore,substantive due process claim does not raise a substantial question.
third claim is that the closure order violates the equal protection clause.it claims that the order is irrational because there is no showing that pinewood is unsafe.the question is whether the closure order is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.see id.as we have said,under state law dhec can grant additional space only after public notice and comment procedures have been followed.it is rational to cap the amount of waste that an operator can collect and to allow the public an opportunity to comment before additional capacity is granted.equal protection claim is therefore without merit.
fourth claim is that the closure order was issued in retaliation for its bankruptcy filing and was therefore in violation of the first amendment right to petition the government for a redress of grievances.const.amend.would have a viable first amendment claim if dhec issued the closure order in retaliation for the bankruptcy filing.see,harrison springdale water sewer comm n,cir holding that the first amendment prohibits state from taking administrative action for the sole purpose of forcing citizens to settle a lawsuit against the state.however,has proffered no evidence that dhec issued the closure order in retaliation for the bankruptcy filing.dhec issued the closure order the day after the south carolina supreme court denied certiorari.the timing of the order strongly suggests that dhec issued the order because pinewood had exhausted all of its permitted space and not because had filed for bankruptcy.because has proffered no evidence that dhec actions were retaliatory,its first amendment claim does not raise a substantial question.
fifth claim is that the closure order violates the dormant commerce clause.specifically,safety kleen argues that closing pinewood will unduly burden the interstate market in hazardous waste disposal.because safety kleen does not claim that dhec has discriminated against interstate commerce in favor of commerce,it must show that dhec actions are clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.pike bruce church,d.it does not appear that will be able to meet this high standard.see chambers med.techs.bryant,cir upholding cap on amount of waste a facility could treat under this standard.the state has a legitimate interest in imposing a cap and in allowing public notice and comment before granting an operator additional space.has not shown that the burden of the cap and the opportunity for public notice and comment is clearly excessive in relation to the benefits of such measures.as a result,safety kleen dormant commerce clause claim does not raise a substantial question.
sixth claim is that rcra preempts dhec closure order.rcra authorizes the states to develop and implement their own hazardous waste management scheme in lieu of the federal program.a state must apply to the epa for permission to administer its own program.see id.b.the epa will authorize a state to administer its own program if the state program is the equivalent of rcra and its accompanying regulations.id.a state may choose to impose more stringent regulations than those imposed by rcra.id.in other words,rcra sets a floor,not a ceiling,for state regulation of hazardous wastes.old bridge,dep t of envtl,cir.the epa has authorized the south carolina program.
in this case the provisions of the south carolina environmental scheme dealing with the grant of additional space to an operator are identical in all material respects to the epa rcra regulations.compare c class modifications to permit id.e temporary authorization for class modification id.notice and comment procedure for amendment to permit renewal,with ann.regs.c class modifications to permit id.e temporary authorization for class modification notice and comment procedure for amendment to permit renewal.because the south carolina scheme is essentially identical to the epa rcra regulations,preemption claim does not present a substantial question.
we now turn to the question of whether the district court erred in concluding that the public interest weighs against the grant of an injunction.we agree with the district court.as discussed above,south carolina has a carefully crafted process for granting a waste disposal operator additional space.that process includes the opportunity for public notice and comment.seeks to bypass this procedure by demanding immediate additional capacity.the public has a strong interest in the opportunity for notice and comment.first,the notice and comment procedure allows individual citizens and groups that are affected by an expansion in waste operations to participate in the permitting process.if history is any guide,a number of citizens and interest groups will participate in any process for public notice and comment on whether pinewood capacity should be increased.second,the notice and comment procedure allows for careful and deliberate consideration of whether it is environmentally safe to allow to store additional waste.the pinewood facility is located in an environmentally sensitive area.the facility is a mere feet from lake marion,a popular recreational spot and a source of drinking water for several thousand people.the facility is adjacent to over acres of forest and wetlands.the public has a strong interest in ensuring that dhec carefully considers whether additional capacity is warranted.see coleman paccar,d vacating stay of enforcement of federal motor vehicle safety standard in part because of public strong interest in safety see also.peace ctr.dep t of pollution control,cir staying preliminary injunction in part because of potential environmental harm if an injunction was in force.we agree with the district court that the public interest weighs in favor of denying an injunction against dhec.
in conclusion,we need not decide whether the district court applied an incorrect legal standard in evaluating likelihood of success on its claims.safety kleen has not presented a substantial question on any of its claims,and the public has a strong interest in the denial of a preliminary injunction.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying motion for a preliminary injunction.
dhec appeals the district court determination that the bond order that is,dhec efforts to enforce the financial assurance regulations is subject to the automatic stay.dhec argues that the order is exempt from the automatic stay pursuant to the regulatory exception contained in b.we have jurisdiction because the denial of relief from the automatic stay is a final,appealable order.see grundy bank tandem mining,cir see also envtl.waste city of riverside in re envtl.waste,cir orix credit alliance delta,in re delta,cir eddleman united states dep t of labor,cir sonnax,tri component prods.in re sonnax,cir the district court concluded without explanation or analysis that the regulatory exception did not apply to the bond order.we reverse the district court and hold that the regulatory exception applies to the bond order.
when a debtor files for bankruptcy,a automatically stays creditor actions against the debtor that may impact the bankruptcy estate.a chief purpose of the automatic stay is to allow for a systematic,equitable liquidation proceeding by avoiding a chaotic and uncontrolled scramble for the debtor assets in a variety of uncoordinated proceedings in different courts.fidelity mortgage investors camelia builders,in re fidelity mortgage investors,cir.however,the automatic stay does not apply to any state action to enforce a governmental unit or organization police and regulatory power,including the enforcement of a judgment other than a money judgment.b.the question is whether the financial assurance requirements here are part of south carolina police and regulatory power.
the difficulty in applying this exception comes in distinguishing between situations in which the state acts pursuant to its police and regulatory power and situations in which the state acts merely to protect its status as a creditor.to make this distinction,we look to the purpose of the law that the state is attempting to enforce.if the purpose of the law is to promote public safety and welfare,universal life church,united states in re universal life church,cir,or to effectuate public policy,nlrb edward cooper painting,cir internal quotation marks omitted,then the exception applies.on the other hand,if the purpose of the law relates to the protection of the government pecuniary interest in the debtor property,universal life church,at,or to adjudicate private rights,edward cooper painting,at internal quotation marks omitted,then the exception is inapplicable.the inquiry is objective we examine the purpose of the law that the state seeks to enforce rather than the state intent in enforcing the law in a particular case.see united states commonwealth in re commonwealth,cir united states grooms,wl,at.of course,many laws have a dual purpose of promoting the public welfare as well as protecting the state pecuniary interest.the fact that one purpose of the law is to protect the state pecuniary interest does not necessarily mean that the exception is inapplicable.rather,we must determine the primary purpose of the law that the state is attempting to enforce.see yellow cab coop.metro taxi,in re yellow cab coop,cir javens city of hazel park in re javens,cir eeoc rath packing,cir.but see universal life church,at only if the action is pursued solely to advance a pecuniary interest of the governmental unit will the automatic stay bar it.emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.likewise,the fact that the state action requires the debtor to make an expenditure does not necessarily mean that the regulatory exception is inapplicable.see,commonwealth oil refining epa in re commonwealth oil refining,cir holding that the epa could force debtor to comply with environmental regulations even though compliance would cause debtor to spend money.
in considering whether the regulatory exception applies to environmental laws,courts often focus on whether deterrence is the primary purpose of the law.for example,in united states nicolet,cir,the court considered whether the bankruptcy stay applied to the epa efforts to pursue a cercla suit to recover costs against the debtor.the epa conceded that the plain language of the regulatory exception did not allow the agency to enforce a monetary judgment.see b limiting state under its police and regulatory power to enforcing judgment s other than money judgment s.nevertheless,the epa wanted to obtain a judgment against the debtor for a specific monetary amount.the third circuit agreed with the epa.the court determined that cercla actions interject a valuable deterrence element into the cercla scheme,ensuring that responsible parties will be held accountable for their environmental misdeeds.nicolet,at.see also city of new york exxon,cir holding that cercla suits fall within regulatory exception because such suits provide an effective deterrent to violators,who will be forced to pay for the government costs in responding to their violations.because the primary purpose of cercla suits is to deter environmental misconduct,the court held that the regulatory exception applied up to and including entry of a monetary judgment.nicolet,at.
claims that dhec attempt to enforce the financial assurance requirements which form the basis for the bond order amount to grant ing the state a preference not afforded the other creditors in the bankruptcy proceeding.appellant answering reply br.at.we disagree.the financial assurance regulations are within the regulatory exception because they serve the primary purpose of deterring environmental misconduct.stated more positively,the regulations serve to promote environmental safety in the design and operation of hazardous waste facilities.the incentive for safety is obvious the availability and cost of a bond will be tied directly to the structural integrity of a facility and the soundness of its operations.when the epa promulgated its financial assurance regulations south carolina regulations are essentially parallel,it spelled out how the regulations would promote environmental protection at active hazardous waste facilities.specifically,the epa emphasized that the financial assurance requirements would give landfill owners and operators an incentive to locate,design,and operate facilities to minimize closure and costs and to improve operating procedures and reduce the risk of accidents.standards applicable to owners and operators of hazardous waste treatment,storage,and disposal facilities financial requirements,explaining benefits of financial assurance requirements.to put it more bluntly,sloppy design and operating procedures are more likely to be avoided with the financial assurance requirements and the resulting incentive to reduce bond costs.id.
as we see it,the primary purpose of south carolina financial assurance regulations is to deter environmental misconduct and to encourage the safe design and operation of hazardous waste facilities.this is a clear exercise of the state regulatory power.accordingly,we hold that the regulatory exception applies to dhec issuance and enforcement of the bond order.the bankruptcy stay does not apply to these efforts.
dhec attempts to appeal the district court order denying its motion to dismiss complaint for failure to state a claim.we decline to permit an appeal from this interlocutory order.the district court certified the dismissal question for review under b.when a district court certifies a question for interlocutory review,the appellant must,within ten days,file with the court of appeals an application for permission to appeal.see id.the filing requirement is jurisdictional and therefore may not be waived.see myles laffitte,cir.in this case dhec failed to file an application with us and did not realize its mistake until two and months after the period had passed.dhec then filed a motion with the district court,requesting that it recertify the question for review.the district court recertified the dismissal question and dhec then filed an application for permission to appeal.we hold that the underlying recertification was improper in this instance.
a district court has the power to recertify a question for review when the appellant fails to file the required application for permission to appeal.see baldwin county welcome ctr.brown,d stevens,dissenting marisol giuliani,cir nuclear eng g scott,cir.a district court power or discretion to recertify is not unlimited,however.the consideration of whether to recertify is channeled through two steps.first,the district court should consider whether the appellant can show excusable neglect.a lawyer lack of knowledge of b requirement for an application to the court of appeals within ten days will not ordinarily constitute excusable neglect.second,if the appellant can show excusable neglect,the court should consider whether the appellee can show sufficient prejudice to warrant a denial of recertification.we note that several circuits have suggested that a district court should also consider the length of delay in deciding whether recertification is proper.see,marisol,at.we do not view length of delay as a separate factor for consideration.instead,length of delay simply bears on the matters of excusable neglect and prejudice.
in this case dhec has not shown excusable neglect.dhec counsel was simply unaware of the requirement of filing a timely application to the court of appeals.the district court thus abused its discretion in recertifying the question of the denial of dhec motion to dismiss the complaint.as a result,we deny dhec application for permission to appeal the dismissal question.
the official committee of unsecured creditors of appeals the district court denial of its motion to intervene.the official committee sought to intervene as a matter of right under.a.alternatively,the committee sought permissive intervention under rule b.only dhec opposed the committee motion.the district court denied the motion to intervene without any reasoning or explanation.our review is for an abuse of discretion.see hazardous waste treatment council south carolina in re sierra club,cir.
rule a requires a district court to allow an applicant to intervene if its application is timely and if it claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant ability to protect that interest,unless the applicant interest is adequately represented by existing parties.a.the official committee represents safety kleen unsecured creditors,and these creditors have million in claims against.the official committee argues that its group substantial outstanding claims give it an interest in the case and that no existing party will adequately protect the interest of its group.in the alternative,the official committee seeks to intervene under.b.rule b allows the district court to permit an applicant to intervene when an applicant claim and the main action have a question of law or fact in common.b.at oral argument dhec counsel could not offer anything to refute the official committee argument that it was entitled to intervene to represent the interests of the unsecured creditors.in light of the fact that neither the district court nor dhec have articulated any reason for not allowing the official committee to intervene,we conclude that the court abused its discretion in not permitting the committee to intervene.we emphasize,however,that our decision on the intervention issue is limited to the particular circumstances of this case.
in conclusion,we affirm the determination that does not bar action affirm the denial of motion for a preliminary injunction reverse the determination that the automatic stay bars dhec efforts to enforce the financial assurance requirements in south carolina environmental regulations dismiss dhec interlocutory appeal from the order denying its motion to dismiss the complaint and reverse the order denying the official committee motion to intervene.

while i share the extent of judge luttig dissatisfaction with our circuit blackwelder decision and cases following,even if my reasoning may not be exactly the same as judge luttig,i believe that judge michael majority opinion correctly relates circuit precedent and affirm my concurrence in that opinion.i am confident that our court en banc will consider the matter as circumstances require.
